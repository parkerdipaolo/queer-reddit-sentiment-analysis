Okay so a lot of people suggested bangs for forehead dysphoria and I think I am in love, I feel so pretty omg		"You look amazing! 😊
I personally think you pass in every post you make. You're such a darn cutie. I think you have an adorable forehead...

That being said...I absolutely understand moments of dysphoria and dysmorphia. Bangs or no, it's all about how good you feel about yourself. Other people's opinions about you or how you look are never more important than your own.
wait so forehead dysphoria is a real thing? i thought i was crazy!!! also im jealous how pretty you are!
Gorgeous hair. Also, those eyes!
You feel pretty because you are.
You've literally won the transition generic and ruining lottery. That said I feel sorry for your DM inbox.
You look awesome. I'm planning on getting bangs soon too.
You're so pretty
Woaew
❤️How do you grow bangs? I’ve had my hair long since I was 9 and I don’t remember how😭do I just cut the hair by my forehead short?❤️

❤️also you’re beautiful, bangs do wonders!❤️
Adorable!
Your soooooo cute and preety, you look amazing
I am sooo jealous I wish I could have hair like that
Y’all gonna convince me to get bangs, but I’m also trying to save that for my next mental breakdown. I’m so torn.
I also love bangs but don’t currently have any
You are super cute 😍
I'm glad you feel better about your dysphoria! You should always be in love with yourself. 

But also, you're just always fucking pretty, I've never seen a photo of you where you weren't pretty
I wish i could look so pretty

I'd seriously consider bangs, but I don't think they'd look good on me, and it'd take years to grow them out again.

You look amazing!
You looks great!
Omg your beautiful wtf 😭😭
I'll admit I'm partial to bangs but you wear it better than most , cute! As hell is the adjective that comes to mind
Holy mother of gay I think I just fell in love!
I have never thought of this omg. I’m gonna start growing mine out immediately! I can only hope to look even half as pretty as you 😔
I saw this post again and just can’t get over the fact someone can look this amazing. You truly inspire me to transition.
A trial tree at the crest at three,
Astride the stone of mount's face,
I take inspiration from thee,
And bask in honest grace.
A grace does come,
Written in fear and pain,
A knowledge of what's to come,
If no one stops men again.
You take a delightful picture. To upgrade to outstanding all you need to do is smile. I'm guessing your face would radiate.
You look absolutely gorgeous. I think I'm in love too. I would love to be your boyfriend or husband. 😘
Ur a man
Girl or boy??? Asking for a friend
Man
You look super cute, I expect you'd make a great succubus!

(joking about the succubus part...)
Bangs?
Wow! So, so pretty! 💜 That's it, you've convinced me to get bangs myself
That look is hot on you.
Amazing look! :) What did you do with your hair to make it like this?
Get your hair did like Pippi Longstocking.
You’re so pretty💕
Very pretty.
Oh, yeah, that looks really cute.
Bangs are very flattering on you and you look fantastic!
S L A Y
Killed it. Slayed it.
Bangs suit you.
Sooo pretty
You are gorgeous holy cow
You are adorable. You are doing great. As a cis women you look like a cis girl to me
With or without, you're perfect don't worry.

You do look great! <3
Your hair is gorgeous and suits your face so well
Some people find foreheads really hot. Just saying. Keep being you ;)
Bangs definitely suit you.  

If you're super concerned about certain parts of your face ""taking up too much attention"" like I am (scars) glasses are actually an enormous boon.

Makes me feel like I'm hiding behind a mask all the time.  Makes me feel more comfortable.
Do men have different foreheads than women??
Beautiful!
Hot
Charlie Brown is losing his shit rn.
omg..... you're smokin!
Wew, damn!

Please stop being so beautiful, I came across it on /r/all and it's confusing me.
You’re gorgeous
Amazing
They look amazing.
Oh how cute!
You look hot af!  Great choice
This gives me super young Natasha Lyonne vibes in the best ways. Perfect look
you must be into stranger things, because i guess you're 11.
omg you're so pretty! love the hair.
You’re beautiful!!! 😍
You look absolutely gorgeous!
Omg wow! 😱 Cut and color both suit you extremely well (or maybe you’re generally just stunning - maybe both!)
Found this while scrolling through popular and thought to myself she’s pretty, I didn’t realize you were trans until I saw the sub.

That hair style really suits you.
You and bangs look amazing.
Definitely giving a bit of a Paramore vibe.  Looks great!
12/10
You've got a Haley Williams from Paramore thing going.
STUNNING
You look stunning!
As an enby AMAB that struggles with dysphoria from feeling too masculine I can relate to your struggle. You are absolutely killing it, and this queer stranger is proud of you!
You’re a beautiful woman.
I'm not subbed to r/trans (not against it or anything, I'm just a cis guy so it's not my space, eh?). I was scrolling through r/all and when I saw your picture my first thought was that it was probably some redheads sub or selfie sub or something, so I was very genuinely surprised that it was this sub. You look cute af, keep living your best life!
I think im in love too 😍
I’m in love too! You are beautiful!
Perfect wolfcut damn!
you look great!
You look amazing!!! 💚🤍💚
You do infact look rather pretty
you look cute as hell, did hrt give you freckles because I'm starting to notice some on me
You don’t just FEEL pretty, you ARE pretty
You look so pretty so it’s only fair
Women are so beautiful
You look like Jolene!
I'm not part of the trans community, I just spotted this from r/all. I'd say the transition was successful.
That cut is absolutely gorgeous on you! Omg you're so pretty.
holy shit you're absolutely beautiful.
Looks gorgeous
This looks great
You're lucky. Shaggy hair and bangs are in now. It looks great on you!
people always think bangs suck but they do not. you look lovely.
Amazing transition. Bangs work really well.
I always preach it. If you don't think you pass, wear bangs trans girls!!! It's always momumental seeing when I brush my hair down in the mirror
First of all, you look GREAT. 

Second, you gotta quit worrying about what other people think.

Be you.
Not even exaggerating your my goal for post hrt. Like whenever I'm not in make up or anything you are the goal.
Holy shit you are attractive
You truly are a naturally beautiful women. Hugs.
You’re someone whos meant to have bangs! wow, so stunning 😍
I’ve never heard of forhead dysphoria, but you look good with that haircut!
Hot as fuck omg
I have a new reference pic for my next haircut now ty
Looking great!
Holy shit that looks amazing 😍 I guess I know what I'm asking from the hairdresser next time
Daaaamn you are cute, your hair is prefect \*.\* love the style, colour and texture!
Literally stunning ❤️❤️
YOU ARE SO PRETTY OMFG!!!! I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU TBH
Very cute!!
You look pretty!
You look so gorgeous! ❤️
Feel pretty? You are pretty.
Very pretty.
You look like you could be in our family.
You look so much like my niece.
You look Wonderful. Stay Confident, don't dwell on the dysphoria. Every Single person in the world has apprehension of something from time to time different than usual. Always remember style especially Hair Styles come and Go... Do what makes you comfortable stop sweating the small stuff. You look adorable!
[removed]
Beautiful ❤️
look sucks eww u rude
You're beautiful 😍
❤️
Dang! I don't have the right face shape for it, great trans tip
be my gf 😍
Omg 🥰🥰 the red hair, the fluffy bangs, the gorgeous wolf cut, you’re so pretty ❤️
Wow! Looks great
i love your hair colour, and your bangs too!!! you are beautiful! :] /p
Gorgeous
Bangs are good.... speaking of bangs, are you game???
So gorgeous very femme love it
You are soo beautiful
You are perfect
you're gorgeous!
Forehead dysphoria sounds goofy as fuck 💀💀💀
You are this haircut suits you really well, u look very cute and pretty ^^
Hebbammmmmmheeei 🥰
 Just beautiful.
As an opportunity to educate: Is it gauche for a cis person (me) to tell a trans person that they look passable? I feel like this is gauche but I just want to make sure.

In a similar vein, I can use the f word but straights cannot. Is it like that? I just want to make sure that I, a gay man, am never offending our trans brothers and sisters.
Yeah I think it’s if the forehead is too big
Just here to say yes it's real. Example: me.
Your forehead is fantastic. As others have pointed out plenty of gorgeous women have big foreheads.
I mean there's not really much difference between a male and a female forehead, I think cis women have just had longer to find a hairstyle they like.
Forehead dysphoria is when it literally exists so hard, it makes me want to disappear to keep the balance.
Definitely a real thing. I think half of my pictures make me look like some grinning skull. I've had good crown recovery but I definitely still have a six-head.
I closed my dms months ago lmao men are so scary
Girl put the damn scissors down, go to a barber lmao
You will! I promise! Keep up the good work sis!
You already do I bet
Oh you just reminded me I need to take my shot Lmao I’ve been on HRT for a about one year now
Oo you should watch orphan black
No she’s not
No
Dolly Parton better watch out
It wouldn't be gauche to respectfully tell someone that you think they're doing well at something, or that they look good.
There's nothing wrong with a big forehead. Carolyn Jones (the original Morticia Addams) had a huge forehead, and she was gorgeous.
(Cis m) I had a huge 5head as a kid, my solution was to simply use my genes to lose all my hair.
Can related. I am so much more scared of men than I used to be, in all places and at all times. I'm sorry that this is happening to you but it's good to hear that you're enforcing some healthy boundaries.
LOL smart move, but to be fair you're cute enough I bet you had a decent number of messages from women to no?
***slowly puts away garden shears***  


😬
Damn, you look amazing just being on for one year. I'm jealous lol
Rihanna also is known for her big forehead but is still considered very attractive
[This woman?](http://t1.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcRbIwoG0X28pw8Sk3j6oRwXcN2p6TtE1zemGLuimNbh2M57L185UKGNI5sMow69MD29)

That's... not a large forehead. A little on the big-ish side, I guess? For cis women? I'd kill to have a forehead that small.
See Christina Ricci
Yeah these past few months I could really feel my male privilege slowly disappearing
[Also this.](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AGppTuKvYe0/XkMTEU1ZKgI/AAAAAAAAL-Q/1vXiIt4v69saDNapmHOokcvl06OEGwd8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Jones2.jpg)

[And this.](https://iv1.lisimg.com/image/7671989/720full-carolyn-jones.jpg)

You could probably project a 35mm film on that head.
Second one's a bit on the large side... mine's still bigger, sadly.
Mine's big too. I'm actually a fan of bangs, but it's possible to work with a large forehead.

Speaking of bangs, here's another pic:

[Carolyn Jones](https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MBDSAAC_EC027-1227x1536.jpg)
Yeah, I just can't see bangs working on me right now. Well, I'm still fully pre-everything, presenting male, etc. Maybe later. I'm worried about the time it would take to grow them back though.
There anything in particular your worried about with bangs atm?
Not in particular, I just don't think they'd look good on me."	xn1l41	trans	10726	0.89	2022-09-24 19:21:44
Trying to alleviate my dysphoria with exposure therapy. So here I am, unedited, unfiltered. A proud trans woman 🏳️‍⚧️		"I'm happy for you but jfc you look straight up cis.
[deleted]
You’re so prettyyyyy 😍
You look great! I would have assumed you were AFAB.
Ur literally stunning 😲
Wow you look almost exactly like what I dream of one day being!
i love your tik tok! ur very cute :3
You look great! Especially your eyes 😍
Girl, what? It's crazy how we don't see the beauty in ourselves when it's so evident to others. Your eyes are beautiful. Little jealous of your skin, aint gonna lie.
You're so pretty! You remind me of Pam in the early seasons of the office - shy, curly haired, and prettiest in the room.
You look beautiful
Wowww your eyes, your hair, the lil smile all make me so happy! I can’t wait to start looking more femme too, dysphoria is rough but seeing women like you makes me hopeful and always makes me happy
If this wasn’t in r/trans I would’ve totally thought you were cis just posting a picture of yourself. You pass so well, and look nice doing it!
You look beautiful 😘
Wow you are looking cute as fuck!
You look really pretty and also your dysphoria is lying to you. You do look 100% feminine
Soooo cute! Perfect apple cheeks and beautiful eyes!
I’m very critical and anti-hugboxing, since we need to know if we pass for safety. At least this picture, you completely pass. Idk if you’re just amazing with angles or something, but I can’t imagine someone clocking this pic if you didn’t mention it. If that’s what you look like, you can stop worrying. Obv voice is a potential issue for lots of us.
Ya your doing just fine. For the record when I post even filtered photos I don't get 1/100th the attention you're getting so trust what people are saying. You look great.
Girl your cis passing. Enjoy it. Whatever your dysphoria is saying is flat wrong. 

Like. So many trans girls wish they could look like you.
Yeah, you don't need filters at all, you're naturally pretty!
do you have a tiktok? i recognize you :0
You look simply stunning. Seeing other strong trans ppl is such a nice sight, gives me hope for myself, just barely a month on hormones (mtf) myself.
And you’re SO pretty!
Love your look
So pretty! Your hair is awesome too
You're totally lovely 😍
Girl omg
Stunning and perfect!
You have very pretty hair!
You look amazing, I genuinly can't believe your not cis.
Omg wow, I'm ngl if some one showed me this photo without context I'd think you were afab! You honestly look beautiful.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!
Beautiful
Omg your gorgeous!!! You look so good girl!!!
You're a beautiful woman! And you have such gorgeous eyes!
You look beautiful
girl tf You look amazing!!
Gurl you look absolutely gorgeous wtf!!
You look so beautiful!! You look like a cis woman and I am so happy for you!!!!
Aw ur so pretty! Id assume you were cis if i didn’t read the title/community:)
Oh my god you’re cute ❤️.
Damn you're mad cute!- from a trans man
you have such pretty eyes, hair, and smile :)
Hey I know you from TikTok! Nice to see you on here too
Huge fan! I watch your tiktoks on the reg and thoroughly enjoy them.
Don't I know you from tiktok? Way to go, boss lady.
I have known many cis women personally you remind me of and a few actresses
I don’t understand. Your face isn’t all blurry and doughy and it doesn’t look like all the other girls. You don’t even have an OF. How did you make your hair so that it doesn’t phase through solid objects? Very suspicious. *reports*
I love your curly hair! Is that natural?
I'd take you out to dinner (before and after reading the title) so you're passing amazingly well.
I hope one day I'll be as beautiful as you are 💜💜💜
Hello to my unedited unfiltered sis! You look lovely and I am jealous but so happy for you. Thank you for sharing yourself with us! 💓
I follow you on tik tok! You're so gorgeous!!❤️
Do I follow you on TikTok?

Edit: I looked at your profile. I do. :)
#Goals

Ps I love your TikToks
I think I follow you on TikTok!
OMG WENDY FROM TIKTOK
and cute as a puppy — you look great babe, keep up the good thoughts
i haven't seen you since i deleted tiktok lol. you look great!
you look like one of those really really sweet shy girls who loves baking. for sure a bit of a oddly specific thing to say but i swear every girl i meet that just has such sweet, open eyes and that small smile is the nicest, kindest, most enjoyable friend i’ve ever made. cheers sister, you are beautiful just the way you are!!!
As always my friend, you are gorgeous. Here and on TikTok, you are a beautiful woman. I wish you could see yourself with our eyes.
I only now you're trans because you said so. Goals
you look great, this is a really well taken photo. you have good lighting and a beautiful face.
I hate you! (because you're so much prettier than I am)

You look beautiful.
Hey,  I know you!
I think I follow you on tiktok?
I know you from tik tok omg
queen you are so pretty, and obviously it doesn't matter if you pass well or not but you do in fact pass very well 💜
Omg big fan of your Tiktok. You're so funny girll~
You pass so insanely well I’m so jealous 😭 but you’re stunning! Woah!!!
Take my affirmation and my upvote, awesome cute internet lady...
Wtf trans people look more and more cis each year, here's to you feeling more like yourself!
You are so cute! 🥰 Makes me a little envious 😅

I'm pretty sure I've seen you comment around the trans reddits a few time also!
If I had just scrolled by without reading anything, id have totally thought you were cis. You go girl 👏👏👏
Lucky you 🙂sure your not a cis chick taking the piss 🤔
Is that Pam Beesly?
I went through some of your post history and I’m still not fully convinced you aren’t AFAB! You’re a beautiful woman, and you look radiant in those wedding dresses. Congratulations on finding yourself and your happiness!
I was scrolling through r/all, saw your face pop up and thought ""who is that pretty lady and what is this post about?"" Wow! Gorgeous! 

Sorry if this isnt PC or Im not saying this the right way... I mean this as a sincere and heartfelt compliment... If I said something wrong, I would appreciate some guidance on saying the right thing.
YOU have dysphoria???? Girl!!! I wish I was 1/4 as pretty & feminine as you!
You've got some sass, girl.
Found you on All and I follow your TikTok. You're absolutely gorgeous and I never would've guessed you were cis at all.
Have I seen you on tik tok?
Given how you talk about dysphoria and exposure therapy, it seems like passing is important to you so i feel a little safe saying this but if it makes you uncomfortable I am so sorry but. You pass really well!
Totally rocking the “I don’t know that I’m pretty” face.
Your TikTok’s are hilarious
I, too, am here from r/all and would not have known you weren’t cis if not for the title of your post. In fact I had to come to the comments to make sure I hadn’t confused the post, and that you weren’t in fact a cis woman. You are a woman, and you look like who you are.
Omg i follow you on tiktok
I swear I follow you on TikTok, either that or you have an identical twin! 

Either way, you look incredible (and if it is you on TikTok then I love your videos!)
50 year old dad of daughters here. Youre a beautiful young lady. Feel confident in it
Gorgeous 🥰 💜
you look absolutely beautiful! you have kind eyes!
You are so cute, in that nice and flirty, yet shy, girl in the corner of the bookstore cafe.
You're honestly so pretty. I hope I look half as good as you do someday. 😍😍😍
Your eyes are so beautiful!! You are beautiful! 💕
You look cis babe 😘
Uhh. I would almost think you are just saying you are trans because you look like a gorgeous cis girl.
Like ya cut G
Yet another person from /r/All who was wondering why a random woman taking a selfie was on my screen until seeing the sub name.
You pass extremely well
I follow you on TikTok! You were one of the first transfemme people that showed up on my FYP and set me down my path of egg cracking!
You look amazing, and I hope you know it!
🖤
You look cute btw🥰
I couldn't tell, thought just any pretty lady 💜
Heyyy I follow you on TikTok! 💜💜💜 ur one of my faves 💜 looking gorgeous as always! 💜

The eyes! The hair!

Hey good lookin'! ;)
Just creeped on your profile. Fwiw you are way cuter irl than your old FaceApp transition goal.
You’re so cute!!
You lowkey remind me of princess Elizabeth of Belgium
Beautiful
😍😍❤️
All is see is a beautiful girl live her life
Hi, cutie <3
Love your loose curls! Is that your natural color? You're lovely, carry that with you!
Proud and beautiful.
Very pretty, definitely goals <3
Really pretty hair! Also your eyes are so cool, what color would you say they are (they look green, but might be the type that shift daily)?
Hell yea bud :) Proud of your courage!!
You look like this one girl in my class, she’s pretty nice
You look really good, I would have assumed you were cis woman.
Aaaaaaaa <3
44 thousand followers and 2.5 million likes on tik tok surely counts as exposure therapy, no?
Would never have pegged you for transfemme, you look great
You have a gorgeous complexion and skin
You are beautiful.
High five! Hang in there!
Beautiful!
Remember YOU ARE DEVINE, YOU ARE FEMININE, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, YOU ARE BOLD, & YOU ARE VALID 🫂
All I see is a gorgeous woman.
Smh you can’t just post a picture of a cis woman on here and expect us to believe it’s a trans person. We can always tell. (Jk of course and I love your hair!)
Hey you. If you didn't say you were trans, I wouldn't have known. Go live your best life girl.
You are so freaking pretty I can't believe it
Absolutely stunning darling
Looking good hon! Yo go girl!
You are a beautiful woman with the most amazing curls and eyes.
A little insecure, but that will change as you accustom yourself to this new and open part of your life.

I'm cheering you on \^^
Pretty :)
Beautiful woman, I see.
Very pretty, super passable.
Wow. You pass exceptionally well, but beyond that, you're beautiful just as you are :) <3

[removed]
Not just passing, stunning! 🥳
Mama you is gorgeous. Keep doing what you doing

I heard exposure therapy does not work, it is an old idea that exhaust patients until they stop showing up. Well, good luck!
Got that witchy Kathy Najimy vibe 😍
Honey you look amazing! Total goals ngl.
Looking good! Keep on keeping on!
Wow, you're cute!
Yes
Freaking awesome 😎. You are gorgeous
Legit thought you were AFAB before reading the title and seeing what sub I was scrolling past. I’d say you’re making awesome progress ❤️
You should looking great
Girl you pass with an A+ wow #goals
If you weren't in this reddit I wouldn't even notice you are trans

You pass sis <3
Holy shit! If you hadn't said, I would never have guessed you weren't AFAB. You look beautiful, btw.

Omg you look beautiful!!
Honey you are 100 percent certified gorgeous.
You have the cutest eyes and your hair frames your face so well. I hope your therapy plan works💜
I am a straight cis male. If you had not told me, I would have thought you were born female. You look fantastic. Be proud of who you are.
You pass 100% I never would have guessed!
You’re so pretty!!
Hi, fellow trans woman here, just wanna say you're beautiful and look very cis. :)
You look amazing
Beautiful girl!
if someone showed this to me without telling me u were trans, i would've thought u were a cis woman
Would never have known if I met you at random. You're an attractive woman from my perspective.
Jesus christ you have amazing skin
You are a beautiful woman with a completely feminine appearance. You have every reason to be confident in yourself.
You're STUNNING
Cis af girly nothing to worry about 💗
Yep, you look AFAB to me. You look great, especially your hair!
You're so beautiful. Your eyes 😍 they're the prettiest shade I've seen in a while
Here from /all couldn’t figure out why there was a random woman selfie trending. Had to go read title again. Don’t know the right terms to use, but you look like any other lady to me!

Signed,
Random white dude on the internet.
You’re pretty!!! Absolutely pass as a cis woman too
Girl, you look so pretty, you never even needed filters in the first place!💖
how does exposure therapy work?
Holy bananas, girl!! You look freaking gorgeous!! 😻
Proud and cute trans woman. Have a Nice day, lady

Yea you!
You're trans?
You’re so naturally beautiful!
Gorgeous
Awesome eyes on you.. pretty!
My sister just told me she was wondering why I was looking at a woman's picture online after I noticed her looking over my shoulder.

So, boom. Validation.
Omg so pretty.  Go on strong girl!
You look cis I’m not gonna lie
You’re cute!
You are gorgeous!!
I 100% never would have guessed you are trans if you hadn't said it.
You look good
Passing as a cute lady!
I had to do a double take, you looked EXACTLY like one of my ex-girlfriends, not even joking, the only difference being she had black straight hair
Girl, I WISH I looked as good as you do.
I was just casually scrolling through reddit before, after I just happened to stop. When I looked back at my phone, my attention was immediately caught by how pretty the picture was...
Pro
 YOU’RE ADORABLE!!!!
You look gorgeous
Beautiful!!
I would never have guessed! Tell that dysphoria to pack its bags and gtfo you are slaying it!
You're radiating confidence and beauty!!!
You look so good, you look cis too if that matters to you
You look absolutely fantastic. I wouldn't have guessed you weren't cis!
You are a super duper lovely lady. You’re a gorgeous woman!
You look so good hun, beautiful. Not sure if it's insensitive to say but I would've never guessed you were trans. A young, smart, beautiful woman with the world in her hands. Get out there!
Sooooo cuuuute
you look like pam from the office
Gorgeous
You're beautiful! I wish you more and more happiness everyday.
_Tiltes her head._

Are you supposed to be mtf? You look really cis to me!
Oh my gosh! You're so pretty! 😍
Nice hair!  I like how the curls and color changes from top to bottom
Your eyes are breathtaking!
Gorgeousness
Wow! You pass 100%! Beautiful:)
Brave AND gorgeous! Your skin is fabulous and your eyes pop---don't hide behind filters!
Oh my goodness you are so stunning!! Seriously your eye color alone ☺️ I think you look like a gorgeous natural beauty
You look like one of my cis cousins very beautiful by the way sis!
I would swear that you’re cis, but either way, you look naturally beautiful.
Yeah, good look, no need for filters.
You’re beautiful. Without the context I wouldn’t have known, really.
you're gorgeous!!! love your curls!
In my experience, the more I leaned into being butch/gender non conforming the less gender dysphoria I got.  This is fully dependant on being able to be around all trans/accepting cis people though.
Ahhhh, you’re so fucking beautiful!! If I’m being completely honest, you look like you were afab. Absolutely stunning 💕
Good for you girl! <3
🤘
I'm really late to the party but, girl! You look so beautiful!
Damn, your hair is really nice!
You look absolutely darling, my dear!!
If you told me you were afab I would believe it! You pass so well!!
You look great. Xx
Your eye color is gorgeous! You look fabulous, good job!
You are beautiful! I love your hair and eyes. And you have stunning skin
So you were a guy? But now are a lady?
If you did not tell me I could not tell the difference. Hopefully this helps and the comments are civil (from popular)
You look fire!!!
holy shit your eyes are beautiful
Looking gorgeous and beautiful sweetie
Natural beauty.
A beauty ☺️
Hun, if the goal is to look like a woman, you have met the goal. No further progress is needed. 

Now, tell your brain to catch up to reality and stop making you feel like shit.
Well all I can say is you look gorgeous and be proud. And as a hint i would be delighted to know more about you
You are beautiful❤️
Cis asf
You are a beautiful young woman. Your skin is beautiful. What do you use?
You look great!
You look lovely, Honey, Love, A mama.
You look a lot like a friend of mine! She’s a tall badass lady and I’m sure you are too!
Beautiful lady
You look great!
Alright, two things:  
1. You look like any woman on the street.  
2. Do you own a Blåhaj? :>
You look great if anyone says otherwise ignore them
You look cis, dysphoria is such a bitch but yeah you look great
Beautiful
You literally just look like a cis girl. I would not be able to tell if it wasn't posted here.
Cute and very very feminine. Pretty lady.
honey you pass stunningly well- i wouldnt be able to tell if i saw your face irl
You look cis
You should be so proud of what you have achieved and don't let anyone say differently, people that go through what you are should be proud and keep there heads up high as most people will never know what you have gone through and are going to go through so just believe me you a lovely looking women, I do hope that I haven't offered you in any way, but I wish you the best of luck in the world.
You’re beautiful!
Hi there gorgeous
You should be very happy with yourself.
Damn girl, looking great!
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 💙😌
You have the most beautiful eyes! Also, your hair color looks gorgeous on you
If you wouldn’t have said that you’re a trans woman I wouldn’t have thought that you are trans. You pass really good!
If it's of any value, I personally wouldn't think twice about if you were trans. I see a female. I know gender dysphoria can be really rough, as my cousin is trans. I truly mean it, I see a woman.
I looked at the subreddit, looked at your face; checked subreddit again because I wasn’t sure if the subreddit was what I thought I saw, but sure enough you just look so cis!
Well of it helps you look like an almost exact twin of a cis girl i used to work with. To the point i had to double take.
Girl you cute af!! 🌈
Look great would never have guessed
You look really pretty! I'd kill to pass that well!
Not gonna lie, if I saw this picture outside of here I wouldnt think you are trans. I hope  I can look as passable as you someday <3
Wow! So yummy 🥰
You pass
You look so familiar. And not that it matters but you’re 100% passing and I’m very critical about that kinda stuff :)
im not just trying to be nice when i say you for sure pass, 100%, i had to look what sub this was posted on to tell what the context for this pic was. i know some random on the internet isn't enough to relieve dysphoria but i hope hearing this helps somehow
I think you look like a typical woman, you go girl! :)
damn girl you pretty
You look beautiful!!!!!!!! Your eyes are stunning and your curls are gorgeous!!!!!! You look amazing without filters!!!!!!!!
You should be proud! Beautiful!
You look lovely and beautiful! And passing may not be a need for everyone but if it is to you i have to agree with the comments, i would never have guessed you were trans.
Girl you look so good I thought you where cis
Beautiful!!! 🔥✨
You look great!
You’re very cute
Yeah if passing is your aim, then kudos, you definitely achieved it.
You’re a lovely woman, hope your confidence grows
Absolutely beautiful 😍
you remind me of an old orchestra teacher i had
you’re so beautiful!!!
You look very pretty
I think you're hot as hell
So gorgeous ❤️
You look lovely! 😊
Look lovely head high
Damn I’d pick you up
I could look into your eyes forever, you are absolutely beautiful
You're stunning!!
Where do I know her from
Hahahaha you think so? ☺️
agreed fr
This popped up on my /r/popular feed and my first thought was ""hmm, she's kind of cute"" then I saw the sub. Never would have clocked her
100% agreed!
100% W O M A N
No filters? It wouldn't even cross my mind that your trans if i saw u in Public so
agree  if she had not mentioned she was trans and I saw this photos Id just assume it was a cis woman
Thank youuu!!! I’m still learning how to handle my curls, I didn’t even know my hair was curly until I grew it out 😂
Feel like there's a filter tho. Probably the one the camera automatically applies
Thank you so much 💜
What is AFAB?
Stop I’m gonna cry 🥹
Awwwwww really? 🥰
Thank you 💕
Came here to say this too! Pam was my first thought.
Thank you so much 💕
Saw scrolling on popular and did think she was cis
Awwwwww thank you ☺️
I can't believe how long i had to scroll to find a comment mentioning those unique eyes!
You're*
I do 💕
It is!!! 😊
Omg this is my favorite compliment thank you 💕
No it’s perfect thank you 🥰
Thank you you’re too nice 💜💜💜
This is honestly the best compliment out of all of these. When the incels complain and take energy to try and knock me down it truly means I’ve made it 😂
I mean weird that you made a point to specify slightly overweight but you’re not wrong 🤷‍♀️
I totally see it.
Nope it’s dyed 😂
Omg they must, because I’ve been told they look more blue before
Gray eyes, mine are the same. Looks blue or green depending on surroundings and what I’m wearing.
Hahaha I use a lot of filters there though
I do stealth 🥰
Hahahaha I’m not cis 😂
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9006570/
I mean a problem with facing fears is you gotta start out small and expose yourself more if you want to overcome them
Yes
Hahaha thanks 😅
More or less 🤷‍♀️
I’m only 5’5” 🙃
I have tiktok?
Stumbled into this from /r/all.

You pass as female. I know you have dysphoria, but if I was passing you on the street or grocery I would never be able to guess you were trans. Fuck, you look like an ex's older sister, the longer I look at this. 

And for perspective, I'm just a straight white dude creeping into middle age. I didn't see a trans woman in your picture, I just saw a girl with self confidence issues. 

I hope that didn't come across poorly, as I'm not trying to be critical or diminishing of your struggles or anything negative. Hope you find peace.
I second this, you look exactly like a cis friend of mine!
Agreed. You remind me of my sister.
I'm mindlessly scrolling through /r/all without reading titles or sub names. I was confuses as to why there was random picture of a woman between the memes. Never would have known if you didn't put it in the title.
100% no doubt about it
I thought this was posted in Selfies or something, I had literally no idea scrolling by from All. You pass 100%.
Totally do.  I also stumbled here from all.  You simply look like a woman.
Also here from r/all and I agree with everyone, I'd have thought you were cis too. Lookin' good, sister. :)
Yes
You look like my first serious girlfriend.  


...so, you come here often?
No joke, you look identical to a friend of mine who's a cis-woman. I was scrolling through /r/all when I saw this post and legitimately thought you were her for a sec. Didn't even realize you weren't her until I finished reading the title and saw what subreddit this was.
not that it should matter, but yes completely passing.
Ok listen here I don’t think so I know so. I mean you pass so damn much. The only reason why I know you’re trans is bcs you said it. Slay all the way queen.
Here from cuz /r/all.  I saw the post as from /r/trans I went ""oookay this is either a trans woman whose passing with flying colors, or a trans man at the start of his journey"" 

had it not been a post from /r/trans I woulda just been like, ""oh a selfie of a girl...annnyway back to the memes"".

Also, obligatory: you don't need to pass to be trans.
also from /r/all, GF and I both thought you were female so good stuff!
You do!
yeah, absolutely
Homie yes!
Yeah, you look really pretty and have a very soft and feminine face... Your haircut also really compliments your facial features nicely. 😊
Just mirroring everyone else's responses as well from /all.  You look great!  I especially like the way your cheeks go with your smile.

Wishing you all the happiness in the world.
You absolutely do! I had to re-read your title because I thought you were a pre transition ftm, you’re a  gorgeous woman and definitely pass extremely well. 

Definitely transition goals for sure
You pass. Take your confidence and enjoy.
If you didn't say anything I also would have assumed you were cis. I know cisgender women who look like you.
Here from r/all to say you're beautiful, sister!
I agree 100%
It took me to read the title of post to find out you were trans.
Passing with flying colors and so adorable. You have a kind face and great features.
Lol the pic tripped me out because you look like me! I’m glad you embrace your gorgeous curls
Honest question: As  a 65 years old geezer I struggle with the pronouns. I have no issue with lgbtq+ at all. I don’t understand what it’s like being gay, but I do know what equality is. LGBT+ is nothing new and has existed since  people first roamed this planet. 

With that said, it was beat (literally) into my very soul that you said ‘yes ma’am’ and ‘no sir’ to show respect. It is a habit I fear at my age is probably not going to change no matter how hard I try. It’s as natural as breathing. 

So, the pronouns. How do I know which pronouns the person in question uses in casual conversation? How or when do you use them or expect others to use then?
You look like Kate,  my old housemate, just with a kind face and not a crazy entitled screaming lunatic face.
I saw this post on r/popular and straight up thought this was a picture of a cis woman until I read the post and saw what sun it was on.
100%. At first I didn't see what sub I was on and thought you were someone's mom or something. Your transition is incredible!
R/curlyhair is an incredible resource!
Same gurl same
haha same
I have wavy/curly hair and let me tell you what I've learned! 1. Don't fight the curls, embrace them! 2. Be veryyyyy careful if people recommend Deva Curl hair products. They work for some, but some folks have lost their hair from it and there's law suits I think! 😬

Also you totally, absolutely pass.
You look beautiful and I also love your curls! As a cis woman myself with fine/wavy/curly hair it’s a pain in the ass to figure out the right product for your hair. I wish you luck on your curly girl journey!
I’m flattered because honestly there isn’t one 🥰 It’s just me
Assigned Female at Birth
Ass fish and broccoli
Absolutely!
Super helpful
Beautiful!!
That person is going through all trans post commenting dumb stuff. Honestly I hope they get better because one thing I know hate only comes from people who are not doing well 🤕
You should post a closeup to see the details (if you feel comfortable with that ofc)
Supreme eyes *
I figured it was just.... well, I guess ""an effect on tic tok"" would be a filter.  

I hope this isn't mean, and I'm also pretty out of touch with modern trends.  In my personal opinion, you look better in this photo than on TT with all the softening.  Just my personal thought, dismiss it as needed.

Good luck and you got this
That is a great attitude, I agree.
Damn. well ya look good. Certainly see a lady there.
You look great:)
Yes, you are one of my favorite trans creators and I’ve been a fan since before my egg cracked.
Thank you 💜💜💜
Haha….*you mean your Cister*
Basically you use them as normal, and if someone corrects you you keep that in mind and then use what the request instead for the future!!! Don’t feel bad 🥰
...



Tell me your skincare routine please
So not ass fish and broccoli? I am a little disappointed. But I agree, OP looks more female than my girlfriend LOL. Not kidding.
This is falsified information and I will be filing a cease and desist
IDK what's funnier, the concept of eating ass, fish, and broccoli, or the concept of a fish called the Ass Fish.
Yummy 😋
Best dinner (broccoli’s gotta be steamed tho)
Yes, I know.

Super basic grammar, as well.
Also here from r/all and I click on things without reading and I was like why am I looking at this selfie from a random woman lmao
Also from r/all. I’m a cis woman, if that matters, and I 100% agree with u/7818. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have dysphoria, and I’m not going to pretend to know. But I hope some of these comments are able to bring you some peace. ❤️
Same here. I know brains are weird little critters (am nonbinary and have dysphoria issues myself), but you 100% are a girl and look like one. 🥰
Gonna have to second /u/7818 here!
Fair enough. Thank you for your help. I'll give it my best. 65 year habits aren't easy to break.
Washing my face and being Italian with small pores basically, I got lucky with skin genetics 🤷‍♀️
Hey, I get this was a joke, and I am not mad at you, and this criticism of this joke does not mean I think you are a bad person. 

Making jokes about our significant others and saying mean (or mean sounding or mean implying) jokes about them is not very healthy. It is often rooted in misogyny when about a women, and even if not, it says terrible things about relationships, which do not have to be bad. Jokes like this can contribute to the societal standard that you should stay in an abusive relationship or you are acting against society. 

Once again, no judgement to you, but consider the weight of your joke. Is it funny enough to balance it's detriment to the way society thinks? 

Thank you for considering my comment and I hope it helps you in a moment of self reflection.
[You might want to sit down for this](https://i.imgur.com/zCKrAVP.jpg)
hahahaha lol (you are joking, right? right?)
Dang you Italians 🤣 congraz and all the best for your future
Where is the joke? If there ever was one it is dead now, guaranteed. Do you mean me quoting someone else that answered my question as to what an acronym meant?  Sorry if I hurt your feeling, truly, but if you will prepare me not to do it again tou will have to much more explicit about what is potential hurtful. Then I promise I will do my best trying not to be mean.

Dysphoria be like:		"It really do be like that 24-fuckin-7
fuck dysphoria all my homies hate dysphoria
I actually don’t mind my voice! Until I hear what it sounds like… :’c
FELT. I work a job where I have to speak to customers often. I’ve been keeping up with my voice training, but it’s painful to know that I pass up until the point I open my mouth..
Yup.
OMG YES!!!!!!
Fuck dysphoria.
Feels
I have been viciously attacked.
First, why Dysphoria exist ?
Second, why
yay crippling anxiety and dysphoria... imma play video games... and doom scroll reddit.
yo where the dysphoria at, i wanna kick its ass
Precisely.
Truth
This hit a little hard today. -.-
My voice is actually the last thing majorly bothering me. I thought I didn't care for over a year. Then suddenly, BAM... I care.
Lol 😆😂 yes!
You got me down on my loughs, thanks a lot 😆
I just go outside anyways, I still feel like shit but at least I'm doing something
I can so relate to this.  I do my best to speak in public with the voice I’ve been working on but it’s so fucking clocky.  Not that it matters since I’m so visibly trans anyway.  I’m trying to get out in and do more things and I’ve managed but it’s so hard having people look at you and stare or look at you then look down every time.  I can see people actively trying not to look at me in public.
Truth
so real
Ugh
tbhiwnbawngl
😢😮‍💨
Me whenever I try to wear a skirt in public
Lol I might show this to my cis friend to try and help him get it lmao
That guys still out on my lawn… oh. There’s a lot of blood. Someone bound his legs together with his tie…was that me??? Might have been. Kinda hazy on the details.
Why is there a red person/bug?????
I made an entire post about voice dysphoria, but I'll say it again here:  
LEARN  
SIGN  
LANGUAGE

The trans community needs to make this a thing people
My top dysphoria is so bad that most of the time I don't wanna go outside because of it...... So thankful to have top surgery this month, I wanna fucking LIVE without being too disturbed to feel my own chest...
Why one of them a fly though
Dysphoria so bad rn I don't even have to go outside to get hit by it
Something that helped my voice dysphoria was realizing that my voice is actually higher-pitched than it sounds to myself. Turns out I actually pass very well! Y'all probably do too, check it by recording yourself and listening back :D
I went full time overnight. Zero on Friday then on Monday morning surprise! Dysphoria came later one day I thought I could go out in boy mode. After that I wouldn't even try to think I could ever do that again. I found my voice about 3 months in. Then six months later I put his clothes on while cleaning the RV and I saw a woman wearing man's clothes. That was the male fail day.
I felt this in my soul 😭
I hate dysphoria, it’s like a scorching fire from inside. I hate the feeling. I wish it would leave.
When the meme are hitting you home
God, my life sumup.
I won't even verbally speak at work.  


At all.  Literally at all.
heres the trick, FUCK WHAT OTHERS THINK, they're gonna only be there for a moment in your life, irrelevant their judgement.

that said i also understand so if not then okay, you stay home watching cool movies, ill go grab some snacks then come back.
It do be like that. I can wear make-up, forms and wigs yet my voice when talking loudly still sounds like a man, and its so annoying as customers will also say thank you sir or thanks man. 😤
Hello again cool webcomics guy o/
I'm in this comic and I don't like it :(
I love not doing thing people tell me to do, so imagining my dysphoria as a person telling me not to do things is giving my hell confidence
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
I don’t feel attacked. It’s just… it do be like that everytime..
my guy this is so relatable I might cry
I’m not trans but I think my voice is just generally obnoxious to everyone.
I wish vocal training wasn't such a big deal, I need to do it but I have ADHD and *really* bad avoidance of what I view as high effort tasks so I just can't get myself to start
the voice dysphoria for lords sake it pisses me off, when will i bring myself to get on to voice training 😭 it just seems so hard like i read a lot and watched videos about it but it's so damn intimidating
This is painfully accurate
This but like ftm
Damn, this went right to the wheels. Took me nearly a year to stop switching between modes, before I finally just owned.  


Knowing what I know now, I wish I'd gone full fem from the beginning. Society doesn't care about how I present as much as I thought they did. Freaking dysphoria sucks.
Worst part for me as an ftm is being slightly overweight. It's like not enough that I might've had man boobs if I was a cis male, but enough that it ensures I could never pass as a guy.
I went swimming in my bikini in public (for the first time) with an unshaven beard and body and it went so well. It really felt like some self love ive been wanting
It do be
That we do 🖕🏾
Seriously, why does it have to sound so different from what i hear?
I can help with that! I teach trans voice! [All of my resources are free, for all voice goals, and neurodivergent friendly. I also give free lessons!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alyssavt/how-i-start-voice-training-start-here)
Oof I feel that.  I used to work at a job that required a lot of talking and since I wasn't out at the time, I kept straining my voice trying to train it XD
Only for suffering
and feel bad about it too 😩
Good luck!
Thats my sona lol. He's part of a species I made called Carvations and hes a mantis variant
[deleted]
Good luck on ur surgery!
He's a mantis XD he's part of a species where they're different variants (mixes with another creature)
Def recommend recording yourself! I was recording for a video recently and when I listened back, was pleasantly surprised
Yess, definitely don't bother with other's opinions of you.  Though for me it's not so much what others think, and more how I see myself lol.  I would rather be passing to myself than the world if that makes sense
Haha hello!
They say it don't be like it is but it do.
Your voice sounds different because you have holes in your face! Sinuses and whatnot causing the audio you emit to sound different between what comes out of you and what you yourself hear. 

No, this isn't helpful information, but at least you know you're not abnormal!
Ikr it’s like what the Fuck
Ur so fucking right, dysphoria should not even exist
Thank you, it'll be a ginormous relief.
Okay lol I thought this was like a new queer identity thing. Thanks for taking a sec to explain!
understandable, though even then i kinda dont give enough of a shit, ive been dealt an extremly shitty hand in life but one upside is now i can shout ""BEHOLD MY FIELD OF FUCKS, see how it is bare""
How fare ye upon this fine eve?
It really do be being like it make it do be do
I know why it does. Just not why it has to work like that
Why I be splendid as I play my pokeman game
It hurts my soul :c

Dysphoria is kickin my ass, but I got enough inspiration to do another cool makeup look (MtF)		"Hun are you sure u aren't cis? Because dayum, you look incredible!
wow, that's incredible. being able to do makeup that good is a superpower
That is probably the cutes make up I've ever seen 😳
Cool and beautiful
Wow your make up is amazing!!
I know how bad dysphoria can be. My friend was actually called ugly on a twitch stream when the streamer was humiliating her profile. Hope it gets better <3
Only 2 words I'm thinking of...

Ah! I knew I recognized you! I commented almost a year ago on one of your makeup looks (it was the butterfly one) about how envious I was of just how femme and pretty you are! Well… that still holds up lol I’ve been typing, deleting, and re-typing stuff for like ten minutes because I’m just *stunned* by 1) how pretty you are and 2) how completely cis you look! Like, my brain is just short-circuiting over this! So… ya still look great, hun! Hope your day gets a little better!
Not just is your style beautiful but you are beautiful too girl!

How did you learn to do makeup that good?
GOD DAMN I WISH I PASSED SO WELL
I LOVE IT!! YOU LOOK GOOD!

I genuinely thought you were cis before I saw the title and subreddit. You look gorgeous!!
I don't know how I landed in a LGBT subreddit but you look poggers
You're giving me so much gender envy rn, you look amazing!
Your make up is amazing! And you are absolutely gorgeous. Love your hair a lot, it looks great!
Gorgeous. Your practice has clearly paid off! I’m genuinely in awe.
No other words just dayuuuuuum

✨Icon✨

Serious gender envy rn 🤌
you look SO amazing. i hope that i can be as beautiful as you eventually! ❤️
cute nose
Wow you look amazing!
People are crazy if they want you in the men's bathroom simply because you were born male
So pretty
I just wish the general public felt the same :/
That was my thought exactly. Had to check which subreddit it was
I just wasn't allowed to touch it for the first 17 years of my life, and as soon as it became safe for me at home I just went off. I remember when I started makeup and was tryna learn eyeliner I'd sit with my face basically against the mirror tryna do wings every day. I'd re-do it over and over every day until it was perfect and eventually by the end of like a month straight I wasn't late for school anymore. Now I just do it almost every day, it's like any other art form, practice makes perfect and I practice constantly
I'm sorry your friend had to deal with that :(

I just work customer service so I get repeatedly misgendered at work every day. I mostly get gendered feminine, but that like 25% that doesn't really feels like everyone sometimes.
[deleted]
I actually copied the white freckly look from someone who posted on here, the drippy bits with the shading and stuff was my idea tho so I felt it was original enough to post
Thank you, I just keep trying to improve because eventually it'll be good enough to where people stop misgendering me.
@~@
Thank you, I'm just tryna get to a point where I can look in the mirror and be happy 🥲
How old do you think I am?
Literally my life goal to be called mommy. My quest is complete. Thank you.
Yeah! I love it so much, I wear it like everywhere
I don't really pass without makeup :/
Thank you, I try heh 😅. I just hate getting misgendered so I constantly try and make improvements so hopefully it'll stop one day ;~;
I mean you're WAY prettier than I am without makeup, so you TOTALLY could. It just takes practice, a looot of practice
It's merch from Jaiden Animations, she actually still has a few jackets left from her winter drop but I'd order em fast, they tend to go quick
Thank you so much! Pretty much the only rules I follow are that I need to be undeniably queer and absolutely extra
Thanks! After finally being able to experiment with makeup once I was in a safe place I found I actually really liked it as an art medium to express myself every day, and getting people to see my art was as easy as going to school or work and going about my day. I've kinda just been doing it every other day for the past 2 years, or honestly almost every day for the last 6 months
T-thank you. I'm still not sure how to respond to people being so nice
Guh, I wish that the general public shared your sentiments. I'm still tryna convince them I'm a girl
I just keep asking what I'm doing wrong and making adjustments. Eventually I'll stop getting misgendered, or at least one can hope :P

Thank you so much, you and everyone else's words have helped. I can actually look at my reflection without freaking out rn which is cool
I wish I could, but I've only ever practiced backwards in the mirror on myself so I'm absolutely awful at doing makeup on other people
I fucking love it. Despite changing styles like every day I wear it constantly
Honestly just practice. I taught myself, never really watched any makeup tutorials. Just got the basics down and learned what drug store stuff works for me and got very familiar with it. Took a few pointers from more skilled friends, and occasionally I'll look up a reference photo and kinda just stare at it until I can come up with my own way to do it
Thank you very much! And I totally remember you, like even without you mentioning it. People being nice like you really stick with me, so thank you
Hot topic, I spend way too much money there :P
It just takes practice like any other art form :)

If you keep at it you'll see results, and it honestly doesn't take too long as long as you keep it up. I've only been practicing for like 2, wait no 3 now, years at this point. Honestly after even just one year of doing it semi consistently it showed huge growth, just check out my earlier posts on my profile
Thank you so much! Ik it's not super healthy, but you taking the time to write that really helps me feel better at myself. It's weird, like I'll be disgusted looking in the mirror after getting misgendered a bunch, but then people going out of their way to say super nice things and I can suddenly look at my face without makeup and occasionally smile
The jacket is actually merch from Jaiden Animations, she still has a couple left from her winter drop but I'd grab em quick bc they go out if stock fast. It comes with most of the patches but a few I've grabbed just from hot topic or friends or whatever
Of course! I mean I get tons of inspiration from folks on here and stuff for my outfits so go right ahead
Ok it sounds crazy, but I still struggle to look at my reflection in the mirror without crying or having a panic attack sometimes. I don't really look good without makeup.
Well the other day I had a manic episode from looking in the mirror and put paper all over my all the mirrors in my house at eye level so I can't see my face and then self harmed and proceeded to have panic attacks for the next few hours. Shit's rough, but I'm still here so I try and take it as a win.
I'm just really good at makeup, I barely even pass without it :/
Yes, q-tips and toothpicks are a must for me
You totally can!!! I'm honestly not very attractive without makeup, and that's a very learnable skill. I just taught myself, didn't even use makeup tutorials so you totally can!
Thank you! I try, and comments like this help a lot with the self hatred :)
Thanks! I wear it like ALL the time
Thanks! When I started I just did my wings every day and erased them over and over until they were good enough, by the end of the month I wasn't late for school and could do it first try.
Oh yeah, I love pastel goth! I might start trying to post more often, I just don't like taking this space away from other trans individuals who aren't as privileged as me, I'm super lucky that I still get some financial support from my dad and have had time on HRT and time to develop my makeup/style in a safe space.
It's actually merch from Jaiden Animations, she still has a few in stock from her winter drop but they go kinda fast
Guh I WISH. I dress like the main character of an anime every day
I just taught myself over time. I wasn't allowed to touch makeup for the first 17 years of my life, so for the last 2 (almost 3) years I've been practicing every other day or so, basically every day for the last 6 months. I never really watched any makeup tutorials, just took a few small pointers from more experienced friends and experimented. Sometimes I'll look up reference photos and stare at them until I think of a way to do it. It's all about mastering the basics
You totally can, I started HRT when I was 18. Also, makeup is really just about practice. If you stick to it for long enough you'll be good. I've been doing it 6 days a week for the last seven months, and before that every other day for almost 2 years. After turning 17 and coming out I just kinda went with it, and here I am 2 years later
Honestly I thought this was a Jaiden animations page because I didn’t read the community thing or read what you wrote
Idk, you really coulda fooled me 😳
I mean I'm a straight cis guy and I was confused by what you were talking about
I don't know your situation but I feel like unless people knew you prior to transitioned, no one would question whether you're a girl or not. Just going by how you look here
that gave me inspiration to try and start doing make up, not gonna lie, thanks
the dedication... 
also I'm sorry to hear you weren't allowed to use makeup until after 17, that must have been tough.
Damn that sucks fr! Hope that 25% goes to zero <3
Unfortunately not. Check my Reddit profile for the post I made about it. Twitch doesn’t care
Either way, it looks great and you are clearly skilled. Keep it up 🌸
19?
Just from these pics i would assume 20's
Ooh no problem 0///0
I dont have the confidence to wear bold looks like yours but i wish i did! Your makeup looks bomb af
Omg Jaiden, I love her so much
Oh damn thanks
Sounds like a fucking magical way to exist
practice is key I know, can't wait to find a safe space where I can try it myself
Only 2,5 years? It looks like you do this professionally. Gives me hope.
I wish my makeup skills were as half as good as yours. 🥺🥺 Stunning!
Honestly you probably aren't doing anything ""wrong."" As an autistic person, I perceive gender differently than neurotypical people do, so I might not be the best person to listen to on this lol. But from my perspective, it's sometimes the most random things that are used to signal gender. Even body language can be used to signal gender--which is wild to me. So it actually may  have nothing to do with your appearance and may instead be down to some random little detail like you standing with legs apart and arms at your side rather than legs together and hands folded in front of you. But again, I truly have no idea.
It's the thought that counts <3
OO fair!.. I'm also trying to find that.. What is it of o:
I’m glad for you! I feel that! Yeah I get misgendered a lot and it hurts but it’s people like you that remind me why I’m doing this! To look unapologetically me and be hot fire! So yeah thank you! For shinning your true self like a burning star! 💜
I knew I saw that lizard somewhere! Thanks for the info, I'll see if I can get one real quick
Awesome! I haven't been on here much so I don't know if asking for permission is necessary or not but I still wanted to ask just in case.

To me, makeup and outfits to pair with them to create a cool and unique looks are more than just something you wear outside. 

It's a form of art, and just like you ask an artist if you can use their work as inspiration, I like to do the same when the option is presents itself ^.^
Darling it's not crazy. I am approaching my first full year on HRT and I still see... Him. It's just important to remember that our brains are mean. I still see and hear my old self despite all my efforts and changes yet everyone I know says otherwise and those who haven't seen me in a long time never recognize me at first or can't tell who I am on the phone. My own grandfather thought I was my Wife when I answered the phone the other week. Yet I, me, myself, still hear 'him' when I speak. Stay strong hun, you are stronger then your dysphoria.
I feel you. Also how did you gain the courage to cut? I've been trying to cut so I don't die, but yet I fear the blade.
Sameeeee lul
If you can, get involved with the Trans community in your area. You are not alone.  Dysphoria is what  it is, but it doesn't need to define you. Mutual support is a good thing. There is nothing wrong with the way you look. I know, look who is talking. I have multiple issues myself. I take meds and go to therapy ( I have serious self image problems and issues with self worth, nothing like yours, but still). I am in my second relationship with a transgender woman. She is a wonderful woman, and has supported me emotionally far more than my ex ever did, and is a whole lot more woman!
Woah… practice makes perfect
Honestly, it's fine to post however much you want. It keeps the community lively. It's not much of an issue of taking the space away bc people scroll through many posts per day. Post at whatever rate is comfortable bc it makes you happy (I hope lol). Maybe do a makeup inspo series for other trans women out here. It'd be helpful, I think.
Thanks for sharing, Beautiful!
I'm glad! I will warn you tho, try and see makeup as an art form or a hobby or something. It can take over and make you unable to see your own beauty without it. If you're not careful you can become dependent on it, or maybe I'm just fucked in the head
I mean it didn't matter because my mom was such a bigot I didn't know anything, hard to have self exploration when you can't even be yourself at home.
Eventually, it just takes time. I just keep asking what I'm doing wrong and eventually the answer will be nothing, or at least one can hope
Damn spot on. Guess I'm finally looking my age, people used to tell me I look like a middle schooler but I've developed my style a lot and lost weight over the last few months
Tbh confidence is a myth, fake it til you make it is truly some of the best advice you could listen to.

I DEFINITELY understand it being hard tho, shit sucks. You're fuckin gorgeous tho and I'm kinda jealous because I can't even leave my house without makeup or I freak out
Yeah I tell everyone that there's no real secret besides practice. I use drug store makeup so it's not like I'm out using fancy stuff
You can totally learn! I honestly just taught myself with drug store makeup, tried out brands to see what works for me. Never really watched any makeup tutorials, kinda just figured shit out and took a few pointers from more experienced friends, and this is me 2-3 years in. I've done my makeup almost every other day, and basically every day for the last 6 months
I hate gender as a social construct and simply wish it was not, but alas it is and I abide by the social rules set in place. I think I definitely have the mannerisms like that down tho, at least based on outside input. I actually have a few different walks that I swap between depending on the outfit (like throwing it back a bit more in leggings because I got a CAKE)
P.S. you're drop dead gorgeous.
I honestly have no idea, I think it's just a cool design. It's a lil ghost girl
I don't cut, I'm to squeamish. **Trigger warning** >!I braise myself by heating the back of a butter knife or similar and just pressing it against my skin. No scars that way.!<
nah, you're right, I'll be careful, thanks honey
Nice!!!!!
The only reason i dont do my makeup to leave is because i hide behind my mask lol
Look who's talking~
Oh, that's not so bad. So you do that to block out mental anguish ay?
Idk why I do it. It's addicting and I hate myself.
Why do you hate yourself?
Because no matter what do and no matter how hard I work at it I'll still be a boy when I look in the mirror.
Are you on hrt or are you you doing surgery at some point? Also I can't look in the mirror without wanting to die. Lastly, i have not transitioned yet and my family says that being trans is gross and wrong lol.
Yes and yes. And I'm sorry you've had to deal with that, I've had a lot similar and have had to cut basically my entire mom's side of the family out.
Yah. Being trans is a curse."	rm2s5q	trans	4253	0.97	2021-12-22 10:52:50

Woahhh you look so cool if I'd see you on the streets I'd literally fall in love
Of course it's zero. No idea how it could be more
Pic on the right reminds me of someone but I can't figure out who. Catherine Zeta-Jones maybe? Help me out here.

Edit: Penelope Cruz. That's who you look like, OP
Just came here to say that you look awesome just everything about your style is great!

Wigs were always a double edged sword for me. On one hand euphoria from looking feminine, on the other, dysphoria from feeling so fake. Well, no longer! Finally have the hair I've always wanted!		"Looks awesome. Like Sharon Van Etten or Patti Smith
Oh my god, I feel this. I'm currently a wig wearer but it makes me feel so fake. Been growing my hair for 7 months, I've got a long way to go
That's a great look! Seeing shorter hair styles that look this good makes me wanna chop half my hair off lol
slay queen
Your hair looks great! But also lowkey you brows are 🔥
Looking great.
I'm glad I'm okay with wigs because my hair is never gonna look that good again. Although comparing anyone's hair to yours is probably not fair. You look fantastic.
Wow looks good
Yeah, I just can't wear wigs anymore. I feel like just putting up with the judgemental stares as this very non-feminine person walks down the street in feminine clothes is worth actually looking like me, even if I don't necessarily like what ""me"" looks like.

I hope I can get hair like yours one day. Was it just a really long time of growing it out?
Absolute goals. Hair takes so fricking long to grow 🙈
Loved your necklaces too! 💕🙊✨
First thing. Your hair is amazing. Let's get that right. 
 
Second, that kind of sword is a hard one to swallow sometimes. They bring us so much joy and fulfillment but they also remind us of everything we lack. 

It makes me smile so big hearing how happy you are with your own hair. Im on a hair journey myself and this is inspiring. Thank you so much for sharing! 🥰
Big huge cheers!  I'm so glad your hair came in fantastic <3
Good for you!

You should never feel fake for being you!
Roses are red Violets are blue
You're gorgeous AF
So as pretty you're
Also help I don't know how to rhyme
Before I finished reading the title I was like ""damn, that's one of the best wigs I've ever seen!""

Then I finished reading it and now I'm so happy that you finally got your hair. It's beautiful. It is a bit of a shame though that I can't ask where you bought it. I lowkey would have bought the shit out of a wig like that.
I’m literally so happy for you! It looks so great!!!
You look radiant, stunning. I’m still in the very beginning, not even physically transitioning yet. I’m practically bald, and I don’t think I will have enough hair to grow once I start. I already know I will feel the same as you, the wig will be euphoric, but I will still know it’s fake. I hope I can work through it.
I feel the exact same way about wigs.
Gorgeous! I can’t wait till mine gets to that length!
We have similar pendulums! ❤❤❤
Looks amazing girl!
You look so  cute
I really like the blue black color a lot
What is up with your eyebrows? I freaking love it. Is that swoopity a natural gift? Or is there some hope I can get a stylist to do mine in a direction like that?
Absolutely gorgeous.
You look cute.
You look amazing!
Girl, you are beautiful 😍
Love the hair!!! Can’t wait for mine to be longer! How long did it take to get to this length?
Beautiful! 💜 Happy for you, sis!
OMG Yes girl!!!! Im so happy for you!! <3
I wish I had your eyebrows omg
looking good!
You look Fantastic
Yayyy!!! Congratulations beautiful!
Stunning! I love your eyebrows btw
You look amazing! <3
Hairs to self growth , cheers !!!😁
Beautiful
OMG GIMME GIMME PLS THE BEAUTY I AM DYING
Nothing's fake in this world. Everyone in this world has set up their own standards to differentiate between real and fake.
More power to you girl 💛
I feel the same way when I use voice changers.
You look amazing. Hope you had a good day.
Fantastic!
Your hair is beautiful! Natural growth with HRT or did you get something done?
Pretty
Gorgeous! 😍 I love the lipstick too!
Your hair and brows look fantastic! I really want darker hair like yours!
Congrats!
Girl that hair is fireeeee, and plus the necklaces???? Heck. Yes.
Congrats!! You look great :)
Looks good!

I wouldn't worry too much about it being fake hair. Us cis folk have the same issues with wigs!
Your so pretty !!1
It suits you.  Much nicer than some fake wig.
You look AMAZING!
Bless you - been there. Wigs are just a passing thing, to get us to where we need to be.
Yooo that's amazing!

Got a little male pattern baldness so I wear a wig...
I'm early in my 20's so I really hope HRT can help me with that.
If not probably gonna get hair implants.
:0 so pretty UwU
Beautiful 🤩 You’re a star dear 💙💖🤍💖💙
Hopefully I get my hair back
10/10 would love to date then cry after date is over.
Girl smile, you are beautiful
You look beautiful!!
You look absolutely fantastic. And I feel the same way about wigs, so glad you don't need them anymore :)
You look amazing! I wish my hair was that tame.
My biggest problem is, that I also like short hair
[deleted]
STUNNING. 🤩
I love your hair style !!!   So Cute !!❤️
Good lord, you are gorgeous!
Good for you!  You look great btw!
Nice necklace! Made With Molecules? 

I had one of their dopamine necklaces for years before realizing I had ADHD, so part of me kinda hopes you started wearing that necklace long before you started thinking about transitioning, and only realized that it was oddly fitting after the fact. If not, consider retconning your life, if you think it would make a better story.

Wait, on second thought, fuck that; your life story doesn't need any embellishment. Mostly, I'm nursing a probably unjustified hope that I have an unexpected molecule necklace twin.
Awesome, you are rocking the hair... I agree it's very Patti Smith
😍😍😘
You look so good I'm so jealous!
You look awesome!
What’s the molecule on your necklace?
Beautiful
Congrats! 
I prefer a low bob style myself. I ""ve grown it out long but, it started getting in the way lol. I honestly like as much of.. me included in my look as possible. Not to mention the anxiety over a wig coming off or being removed involuntarily (something I think is also disgusting to do to cis women). You look Amazing sweetie! 💋🦊
Awesome picture and congrats, OP!  I am so glad you are happy with your hair!
Very nice
You are gorgeous! Is your hair black or blue? It looks like it could be either.
Wearing a wig isn’t being fake, it’s like putting on a piece of clothing fitted to accentuate the shape of the body or high heeled shoes to accentuate calves and slim feet. Your hairstyle is meant to accentuate your face and it’s features and if that means a wig or extensions then that’s just wearing something that fits you more right now
How’s you get it to grow so long?
you look very good, congrats on the hair, looks very nice!

i'm still trying to grow mine out but it doesn't cooperate. gets all frizzy and doesn't stay at all for more than 5 minutes.
Ah congrats! I'm so happy for you. 😊 Can relate about wigs, though. I got some novelty pride colored wigs fairly recently, but I've barely worn them because I didn't like how they felt, so I'm now in the process of regrowing my hair, too. I definitely look forward to when it's down to my shoulders and seeing how well it'll compliment my skirts. Anyway, you look gorgeous, and I particularly love those eyebrows. Congrats again to you and have a great day! ❤️
Hey looks great! Damn I have a long time to wait still... I’m only at 6 inches of hair after 6 months of no haircut. How do I accelerate my growth?
hard SAME. I really started losing my hair by the time I decided to transition. I did a lot to reverse the effects. I basically became an expert on hair and all of the R&D for hair loss and the products. I'm with you, I've recovered so much I feel a huge load has been lifted.
Please don’t feel fake. I’m here as someone I love is trans. I am cisfemale (I hope I’m allowed here) and I’ve worn wigs, so many women wear them. It’s just a thing we don’t really talk about but if you start looking around you might just notice others in them. It’s like a secret you only notice them if you wear them. Unless they are like bright obvious wig types with plasticky looking hair for eg comicon things, nobody even notices.

It’s a way we can feel a bit more us as we want to show ourselves without the effort of spending hours getting ready or years growing hair out. 

Also great when I had a hack job haircut. 

Of you ever got to a club, use eyelash glue to hold them on your forehead (not near your real hair as can hurt to remove), just enough like the duo ones so they don’t come off with a move of the head. I hate gluing and don’t like Wig glue so only do it in clubs or rough pubs because some cismen of certain groups have a disgusting habit of grabbing hair and...then deciding you have cancer but it can get very nasty very quickly being outed and having it pulled off etc. I only glue the front as trying to remove glue from the back when drunk is difficult. I remove them before bed with conditioner and it glides off even with hair caught in it. Not much longer than removing makeup. 

You are you and no hairpiece detracts from that, it’s just a bit of flair to make you feel good inside. Like a nice bag or professional blow dry before an event.

Love this photo you look great!
Love it! Beautiful brows too! 💖
Meanwhile AFAB girls swap out wigs every outfit and feel completely real. What is wrong with us!? Lolllll >.<

Rice water babe!
If you go with a sew-in hair weave it feels much more real. Also, hair extensions are wonderful things. You never have to take them off. You can get so in tracks at a local beauty supply store or even a front lace wig that they can do the same procedure with did you just have to get it tightened up every month or soI’ve done sew-ins Using human hair for a couple of months now. IYou can wash it, swim with it, your lover can pull it during sex. It’s amazing.
Same and I will need transplant which scares me... because I dont know how successful it will be and it costs a lot...
Mine was originally about the same length as yours. We took off about 3 inches and curled it so it looks much shorter than it really is now.
yaaaas
Most of the time they are not, but apparently having that dumbass look on my face helps them look alright lmao!
For me, yes, a straight 3 years of growing it, but I wouldn't suggest that. Letting split ends run wild just slows down progress, if I could do it all over again, i'd be getting a tiny trim every 3 months or so.
3 years and 1 month between haircuts, probably should have gone in for trims to save my poor hair from split ends, but oh well.
Funny because I have a huge crush on her!
I love you both
I think it’s her actual hair
6 inches is 15.24 cm
*Elliot
I (transgender NC amab) have thought, if people refer to my dead name, are they referring to how i portrayed myself before transition? Honestly genuinely curious, I’m not trying to offend. Spread love not hate
shouldve just deleted your reply ..
If you didn't know, he's Elliot Page now.
He's transgender. Ellen's his deadname. He's Elliot now.
You should probably delete this
Just, read up about rice water, wow!
Does this help stimulate growth?
3 inches is 7.62 cm
Ah I see! I had about 6 inches cut off of mine early last week, and while I was sooo scared to chop it off, I was so happy with the result. 

I tried curling mine for the first time the other day, and I need some serious practice lol
I apologize in advance about that.  I misinterpreted very badly, thanks for correcting me!
It helps a lot of people with growth. Everyone has an opinion on how it should be made, but it works well.
Good bot
Oh, lol, yep that's my natural hair now! No more wigs for meeee\~!

Shaved my arms and got rid of a significant source of my dysphoria		"Omg you look soo cute 🤩
Does somebody on here have good advice for shaving? I've tried it for the first time recently and it went relatively well, but its not very clean (stubble) and my skin gets irritated a fair amount by it. Thanks in advance <3
you look so cuteeee!!!!
I did that for the first time recently. I knew my hairy arms were giving me dysphoria but I didn't know how bad it was until after I shaved. The euphoria!
You look awesome, sis!
Now this is transition goals.
Omg I wanna be as cute as you ❤️
OMG I love your hair!
You look adorable
I have the same problem. Two words groupon laser. I been doing groupon for Lazer on my face and arms. Of course I am in LA so my face is easy to get done. But laser on my arms has helped me a lot. I was an ape. Next is my chest. I only spend about 500 for like 18 sessions so far.
Omg adorabean confirmed! Your a transition goal girl! ♥️
I remember for over 2 years my arm hair pissed me off but so many people would tell me how cis women have it and not to shave because it’d grow back bad/be a constant thing from now on, but I did it last year in rehab in January and honestly never looked back and helped like crazy w dysphoria

Moral of the story: you do you, screw everyone else
Sooo Cute! 💖💖
You're so pretty!!!
You're literally transition goals omg. You are just so cuuute 🥺❤
Beautiful
Absolutely beautiful!
You are goals omg, I love your hair so much

Dang you pass, if I didn't know any better I'd say your AFAB 100%
You are so damn pretty OMG!!!!!!
You look absolutely amazing <3

I used to think I shouldn't shave my arms because ""girls don't do it"" but fuck that it feels so much better.
Your outfit is super cute and you look great!

Love your style, and your hair is goals
Looking great but be carful your arm hair with grow through really thick if u keep shaving try waxing it maybe
Looking cute really like that belt with the skirt worms really well
Lmao same. I actually only shaved my wrist/hand area cuz I only wear long sleeves rn and I'm lazyyyyyyyyy~~ Lol
You are a gorgeous smooth little yam and don't let anyone, or yourself, tell you otherwise.
I've been shaving my whole body consistently for more than a year now, I found a company called Flamingo that makes very high quality fem shaving products and I've absolutely loved it.

Now for me I'm not exactly the reason, but I need to be cautious when shaving the tops of my thighs. It's real easy for me to get cuts and general irrigation there. I'm not sure if it's how the hair grows or how thick it is.

Now everything below my knee is great, I can shave fairly quickly and it never gets cut or irrigated.
It's surprising what a difference something like that can make, isn't it?  

And I have to say, you look fantastic in these photos.  But you always look fantastic.
Same with me, but with legs instead of arms
Ughh i love your hairr 🥺
You look so beautiful! I'm so happy for you!
Ur stunning !! :0
I see your posts in this sub pretty regularly and I just wanted to say, your dysphoria should fuck right off because you're adorable! 🎉🏳️‍⚧️
Yay congrats you are so cute
Adorable!
Cute!!!
Not sure if this is overstepping but there are creams? Stuff u put on after shaving to make hair grow back slower, also intuition revitalizing by schick gives a really smooth shave w little to no knicks
[removed]
do you fart?
That's the cutest outfit ever, and it get great on you 🤩🤩🤩
you have the big kyoot, i wish i looked like you
Idk how they looked before but your arms and whole outfit looks great
I really love the fit! You look so cute.
Please, can I have hair like yours?
okay 10/10 😍😍😍
You're so cute 🥺♥️
youre so pretty omgggggg
You're so pretty 😍😍
Omg yes!  Go get that gender euphoria ✨💜
this, this.
So cute! I love your hair!
Ugh hair dysphoria.  Pet peeve.  Can creep up on you and don't realize how bad it is. Until you remove it and feel the absence of the dysphoria.

Like too wax, does take practice but once you are used too the process it is not so bad, grows back more slower, regrowth is softer and only need to do it every 6 weeks or so (winter time I wear tights so its more of a spring / summer thing).

Also exfoliates leaving lovely smooth skin.
Cute.
I want to let you know that I've known a lot of cis gals who are self conscious about having thick, dark arm hair. Two of my friends just recently quit shaving their arms to keep other people happy. 🎉 Arm hair does not disqualify you as a woman.
You look amazing! Good for you. 👍
So beautiful!!
You remind me of jessica kellgren-fozard. she’s this semi-popular lesbian disabled activist who mainly posts about lgbt history, vintage clothing, and her wife
I love this outfit v much
LOVE ❤️
Wow girl! I hope to look half as cute as you one day.
Where did you get that dress wouldn't mind trying on something like that for myself, it's so damn cute on you though :)
You're beautiful. I love you dress and the thigh highs are gorgeous!
You look absolutely beautiful
Aaaaa tysm!!
You're literally goals tbph, keep up the cute work ;D
Exfoliating is very important, as well as a sharp razor and shaving cream (or something similar)
I've been shaving most if my body for a few years. Recently got an epilator. Much better. Smoother skin for longer.

If you go this do the exfoliation and after care properly.

Also it hurts like hell the first few times.
Cold water on your skin after shaving can really help reduce irritation. Other than that, lots of lotion
Leaf razor. I just got mine and it's great for body. It's the right amount of mild aggressiveness. Check out /r/ladyshavers and /r/wicked_edge
Intuition revitalizing by schick for smooth skin, exfoliate before, moisturize afterwards(tik tok has good tips from afab people) and conditioner can work as shaving cream.
While it is hard / painful at first, I switched to epilating because shaving resulted in razor burn and the 5-o-clock shadow far too quickly. Razor stubble was just as much a dysphoric trigger to me as the ape like arms, legs, and most triggering, chest hair. 

I now epilate a few times a week for maintenance and there is no pain. It's actually an enjoyable process as weird as that may sound.  Exfoliating and moisturizing are essential to avoid ingrown hairs. I HIGHLY recommend these [natural loofah sponges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KCK67KR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s02) for exfoliating and [CeraVe SA cream](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Renewing-Cream-Salicylic-Moisturizer/dp/B00D7BZNT2)  for moisturizing cream that helps with the irritation and bumps
Theres different operations you can have to permanently remove it, like electrolysis and lasers. Apparently it isnt that painful just mildly irritating for a while
Coconut oil, before and after helps a ton with getting rid of the razor burn. It’s protects the shit out of your skin before, and holds in moisture for it after.
Exfoliating a few times a week definitely helps. It also helped me a lot to jump around to different shaving creams  until I found one that made shaving less irritating to my skin. It also depends on where your shaving. For my face I would shave downward and carefully upward after. (Makes a small difference but it can get it a liiiittle closer. Take your time and try to minimize the amount of passes you make. 

If you're considering more of a permanent option, there may be laser hair removal places near you with financing options so you don't pay too out of pocket to start getting it in control. I was shaving twice a day to keep my facial hair minimal as possible and didn't want to anymore. After just 1 session I only have to shave once a day and my skin irritation isn't nearly as bad. My breakouts are even clearing up! 

Hope that helps and good luck! ^_^
I've been shaving my arms religiously for years and I will say that after the first few times it's much easier. It takes me a couple minutes tops to do it. Shaving my legs is another story, however. I still haven't gotten past the discomfort and sensitivity to that, and I suspect I never will. Everyone's hair grows in a little different, though.
Aww thank you!!
I had that majorly with my legs, my arms were more subtle but I've realised how much I prefer them without hair
Thank youu!!
You 100% can be even cuter!!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Tysm!!💖
I very much encourage anyone to keep or get rid of their own body hair if they like/dislike it, but for me personally it just feels and look nicer to not have it
I'm in the same situation but I don't really present female outside of my room so I'm not the best person to ask, I would say that shaved face/legs/arms helps, aswell as more gender neutral clothing (oversized tshirts/hoodies) and lastly nail polish, since it again can be viewed as gender neutral so they're none the wiser
Awww thank you!
Hi Jelly I'm Dad
I used one. I screamed and there was blood. It should get easier and less painful every time so hopefully no blood next time.
Thank you!
That day has already come you're adorable
It really is, something so small has a surprisingly big impact. And thanks!!
Hey, I'm sure you didn't intend to offend but please don't use man, I go by she/her and don't enjoy being called man.
> If you go this do the exfoliation and after care properly. 

understated. You need to do this or else you can get a lot of ingrown hairs and scars from them
Is an epilator an IPL? Also what would you recommend for exfoliation and after care? I’m completely lost and everytime I’m on this subreddit y’all give amazing advice and make it seems so easy😩
I still need to shave my legs, bit daunting though as there's a lot of hair there. Any tips? 
Should've said this before, but you look super cute btw.
Omg, you’re amazing
Thank you very much! I will try all of these. Thanks for the advice queen!
😳
Hahaha, thank you very much but no, it has not come yet
I'm still working on getting it right. It's mainly my chest that has a problem.
Okay I'm still new at this so get others advice too as I'm still having a few problems with ingrown hairs. Not too much but more then I did with shaving.

Inside an expolating brush before showing and then a life to try get as much dead skin off as possible. Again no problems anywhere other then my chest.

For after care I'm using an aloe body lotion to stop the skin drying out.
I’m not op but I use your basic, generic brand waxing strips from drugstores (I’m in the US so like king Soopers, Walgreens, Walmart, etc)  and they work fairly well! Not the best imo but it helps a lot. I still shave my legs regularly and my boyfriend shaves his chest and I’ve found that, at least on a budget, drugstore brands do help a lot!

ETA: also by us brands, I mean somethin by like Nair, etc). A good oil or non-irritating lotion ( I can handle fragrances but not all can) for after care can be very soothing!
Hey, I had the same issues. when I shaved my legs for the first time, I used an electric trimmer to cut down on the amount of hair.

and when you do shave your legs, use a razor meant for women, not a beard razor. I took two 5cm strips out of my legs before I learnt that lesson. and remember to use lotion after.

hope it helps :)
You can also epilate, but it all depends on what you want. I always use an electric razor first, especially since it's easier to get clean edges, which I like. Then take a woman's razor to your legs, never use a face razor.
Oh my..... I'm.. getting chills just thinking about that..  
I'm lucky in one fact that my back and chest hair have not gone crazy before I took hrt, but they are still trying to. My body produces a LOT of oil on the chest and back, I avoid those areas entirely.  


My butt is a different story though, and I haven't found a single way to deal with that hair with no consequences besides trimming. I guess laser
Tysm❤️❤️
Thanks!
Do you have any recommendations for an epilator? I saw a braun one on amazon for $35 with good reviews which I may get as I don’t want to spend too much but I’m not sure if it’ll be good.
Haven't even tried private areas yet. I'm waiting for HRT before I even try tackle that mess.
you're welcome :)
I have the Braun silk-epil 9. It works well. Make sure you go slowly when first starting out. The shaver head it comes with its also really good.
I'm sorry, I don't. I'm fairly new-ish to this.
That's a very good idea, with t-blockers and estro, your hair's roots get weaker over time and easier to deal with.  
I'm just impatient and really hairy on my arms and legs so I keep going at them
Whatever you do, be careful about moles. They'll bleed for year (exaggeration) if you just barely knick em! Especially if they're somewhere you can't see. Get someone to help ya, or use lots of mirrors."	lblj6y	trans	3577	0.96	2021-02-03 11:24:45
Been feeling a lot of dysphoria lately. Could use some kind words from my peeps :)		"You look absolutely gorgeous, so cute and feminine!❣️
Princess zelda IRL
Super pretty AND she likes Tim Robinson!?


It's going to be okay, my dear. A friend recently told me to try and change how I talk to myself about the troubling events in my life. She said to say internally,  *""This is happening FOR me, not TO me.""* I've been trying to use that to reframe things, and it can help at times.
You are an absolute legend, you’re amazing and no matter how down you feel, that is a truth that will never change, put on your favorite hype song and bop around the house like you’ve lost it…idk, I’m bad at this, but you’re fantastic AF
You're gorgeous, I'd murder to look like you, girl.
Be proud be happy as you look fab
So pretty so pretty so pretty!!! Cute hat too 🏒
Your eye liner is so pretty. I love the wings
You literally look like Rose from Resident Evil VII
You look really great, sincerely!
Your beautiful and others may throw shade, but really, they are just jealous💋
Woooah I love how you do your eyeliner!!
GIRL YOU ARE SO PRETTY, I CAN’T 💕😭💕
Dysphoria has no place anywhere near you. You are beautiful.
Girl you're seriously so pretty, don't let those feelings get you down! So much love and support ❤️
You are so beautiful
You're so pretty!!!   😊
what on earth are you feeling dysphoric about??? you’re really pretty!!
You look amazing. 
I thought I was on another sub actually. You look so feminine.
You look amazing! You kinda remind me of Rose Winters from Resident Evil

Oh, sweety, you look beautiful! If you weren't posting here I would have assumed you were Cis Female.
Omg so cute! I’m going to do that eyeliner!! Love it

You look amazing.  Naturally feminine.

I can honestly just say ""Wow"" 

You rock
Honey, you def pass!! And far beyond just ‘passing’.
You are very pretty.
You look like Princess Zelda 😍
I love your make up...!😍 You look great :)
Gotta be honest, this kind of street fashion kills and you sell it 100%, while still coming across very clearly as a woman. And this is hard mode, if you can pull off this look you can pull off anything.
If I could do eyeliner like that I’d be unstoppable. Especially if I had eyes that pretty :3
Looking great
For Lucifer's sake you have beautiful eyes, like they're made of jade

You remind me of... I think shes call ""KallmeKris"" or something like that. She's a genius with comedy skits on YouTube
This middle aged CIS woman wants eyeliner lessons. You're beautiful, Love. Mom hugs here.
You 😍 that hat 😍 the team 😍 the combo 😍
I wish I had your courage. You're beautiful
You look like a girl to me
A little dysphoria is just fine, life wouldn’t mean much if it were all highs. The lows make the good times all the more meaningful.
Idk if it's because I have gender envy, or if it's because I like women, but damn you're pretty
You look sooooo pretty! I wish I could pass half as well as you! <3 Also, I love the choker!
I mean, fwiw, I legit saw the thumbnail and thought at first, ""Of course this poor ftm has dysphoria, that cap is fooling nobody, it's clearly a girl under there. How tragically feminine. Might never pass as boy.""
OH MY GOD YOU ARE A CUTIE PATOOTIE
Really wish I could figure out wings like that :'^)
You give me a fairy/pixie vibe and I love it. Beautiful!
Absolutely feminine
looking awesome girl! slay💅

(also where did you get the choker it looks cute :P)
Hii you are really pretty and I love your eyeliner! (I might need a few tips from a pro like you haha) Also you seem really fun to hangout with :) Do you have a favorite video game genre?
Straight dude ally here (not sure of the proper terms there. Would totally stealth check you out passing in the street with a ""nice"" after.
So beautiful

Your eyeliner looks so good, I want to try mine like that!
You are a absolutely stunning woman and from your posts you seem like a nice person. 

I felt like that from about 19 to 30 years old. Do what makes you happy even if it’s not the easiest way, if you don’t you’ll just end up miserable. I took the easy way unfortunately.
You look amazing. One of the cutest girls ive ever seen
You're so pretty 😳

I want to cast you in the next final fantasy.
I think you look adorable! Your eye make up is very cute. Your outfit is casual, comfortable looking, and feminine. 

I'm sorry you're feeling dysphoric! But it definitely doesn't mean you don't look great. You also look like a very nice lady.
You look super pretty! Your hair, your face, your everything!
I’m sorry if this comes off as a bit of aggressive but how the hell can you even think that you are even slightly male in this picture. again sorry if this came off as aggressive
Slay queen!!!

Cool hat

Cute AF. 10/10 Would compliment again
We are all rooting for you!   Don't forget all the people in your life who contributed to where you are now--there must have been so many people in your life --teachers, friends, work acquaintances, family, etc.   Don't ever give up.  I wish you the best!
The Avalanche are 2nd in the West and Georgiev’s save percentage is at peak career highs.
YOU. ARE. AWESOME!
Teach me how to do makeup, just wow stunning
You are STUNNING! 🤯I'm sorry you are feeling down because of dysphoria, you are doing so well and all I see is a super pretty and cool girl here, the dysphoria is completely wrong!
Holy shit you are absolutely stunning girl!
Ur so cute you could be my transition goal
a) you're gorgeous  
b) teach me your eyeliner magic
First thing I thought when I was scrolling was “wow, pretty girl.” Had to scroll back up to see the title and the community. Very pretty girl, you look great.
Prreeettyy
You’re the definition of beauty!
How do you do your eye liner so well, it’s absolutely lovely.
You give me fucking massive amounts of gender envy. You go queen!
You look beautiful, darling. Love your make-up and your choker is adorable! Also your eyes are super pretty
You look absolutely amazing 
If you was standing in front of me I'd wrap you in my arms and hold you tight and whisper in your ear how beautiful you are 💕
You’re beautiful, now try and forget all that dysphoria and enjoy this short life.
Soft face, cute lips, cute nose, beautiful eyes. Honestly had to check what sub I was in after looking at the pic. You do you boo ❤️
OMG IM IN LOVE WITH YOUR EYELINER

Idk what kind of validation you need so…

Your gorgeous and I hope to look that beautiful eventually 

I wanna kiss you on the mouth
You are beautiful inside and out. You also seem to be happy in your skin.
Never stop being you - the world would be a darker place without your wonderful smile
Colorado?

You are breathtaking. Even that masculine looking baseball cap cannot hide Your raging femininity!
[removed]
My bearded dragon approves of your eyeliner
You are cute as hell! Live your best life you deserve it!
Lotta nice compliments but they don't go far enough imo. You're obviously gorgeous and pass 100% to me. 

You don't *look* feminine. You *are* feminine. 

You don't like *like* a girl. You *are* a girl.
You’re pretty…but are you smart? Kind? Giving? Don’t seek validation base on how well you pass, because pretty don’t last. The more times you hear you’re pretty, eventually, you’ll begin to think that is all you’re worth, and you’re worth more than that. The kind words you’re looking for will be from the people you’ve helped, inspired, and cared for, which would be worth more than the amount of times you’ve been told you’re pretty.

What does dysphoria mean?
You have a cute lil nose! c:

🥰 Btw your eye colour is beautiful ❣️
Well now we need to see the  cosplay lol
Yay! Please do 🥰


I also have to remind myself that A) estrogen helps me feel everything (good and bad) and B) emotions are like the popsicle flavors of life, and they do change.


Every time you step through fear, it is growth. Looking back to see those ""thresholds"" is helpful.

Maybe, but definitely would be stumbling over words.
It was meant to be nice, I won’t bother next time.
I appreciate it. I still don’t know if my eyes are green or blue and neither do any of my friends lol
I second this!
Hail satan
No no no, please *do* bother! It's fine! It's just that it could have been easily misinterpreted, so I was making sure! From your comment history I kind of guessed you weren't being rude, but I just wanted to check! 

I apologize if my own comment might have come across as insensitive.
Accept Grue, the creature of darkness is in your eyes 😈
Literally I second that! Your eyes are so pretty. I have really dark hazelnut eyes, and I hate them so much, I wish I had any other light colored eyes. Girl dysphoria has been bothering me a lot too but stay strong! You’re gorgeous and never stop being you!!!
I have eyes kinda like yours and I’d bet they look greener in light.
I’m going to keep any and all opinions to myself from now on. I’ve left the community now. Apologies. ☺️

Post I put on Twitter a little bit ago, thought people here might relate. CW: Gender Dysphoria		"I'm trans AND chronically ill lol. This body can fit so many curses in it.
And more than likely itd be the same person whod be like ""welcome to being a woman"" or ""be glad u dont have to deal with periods"" smh.
OH MY GOD. I had this exact thought today. I had gotten a bad case of gender envy and was thinking, “If I could even look as half as pretty as her..” but then I remembered all of the people in my life who, at best, would make fun of me behind my back and, at worst, would straight up cut all contact with me. And I was just thinking about how bad my dysphoria is and how no one in my life knows how fucking miserable I am in my day to day life. And just like, if they knew how much mental anguish I’m in, every single fucking day.. why wouldn’t they understand why I needed to transition to be happy and have a higher quality of life?

Oof. Yeah. This one hit home tonight..
I knew I should have never egged the house of the old lady with the wart on her nose on Halloween...
I honestly wish I had a cool curse. This one sucks. It’s not even something I can overcome without a heck ton of sweatshirts.
My body hair is a curse and nobody can convince me otherwise.
Though..curses, as in most magical worlds usually happen because of human actions .someone cursed you or an object..
Or if it's a more moralistic setting you disturbed something sacred..

Would it be better or worse if there was someone to blame?
The Owl House actually does this *really* well. Eda's curse ( until S02E08 ) is a chronic condition that she needs to manage with medication. It's framed like any real world chronic illness.
Honestly! Like some days I just don’t even want to shave my face. I can get away with it as I’m pre HRTbut still wish I didn’t have to deal with it nor the permanent 5 O’clock shadow.
I had this realisation about curses and ghosts a few years ago on a horrible day when I realised I keep reliving a whole bunch of highly stressful events from my past just about every single day and I thought to myself ""this must be what it's like to be haunted"".
God have his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. Unfortunately I am not one of them ^please ^stop
Why only thing I thought in this context was jujutsu kaisen?
A whole mood
Oh shit gotta find a shaman or witch quick!!
yep. that's it. that hits hard.
I had a bizarre case of it not that long ago. I was looking in the mirror and I didn't see myself for a good like 40 seconds I'd say. I was there but was I really?
Burn God!!!! Elmo hell emoji
[deleted]
To be fair this could also be reference to the housework at this point in time too sometimes haha 
We get on with it 💙🫀

And I mean like.. karma hahaha I’m not afraid of no curse next to karma .. that’s like… life times before I was even born coming to bite my ass… damn. Haha
(Sorry for bad english)
Yeah and  in addition i think the very thing of living for every human is a curse and there almost only bad thing in life so yeah double curse yeepeee
[removed]
*slaps ypur ass at a car dealership* this babe can fit so many curses in it
(sry had to do it)
We should form a club!
crohns scars have given me an extra reason to wear crop tops this summer: chicks dig ‘em and this chick is pretty proud of the journey they represent :)
We should make a club. Five year old migraine (yes, singular, it's never stopped) plus dysphoria makes for a host of curses. Period problems are just the steaming turd on top of the pile.
Word!
Took the words right out of my mouth, sis.
I feel this too. Safe hugs if wanted. 💙
ikr

like how bout werewolf or something instead nc this one is just bad
I wouldn’t dare to try. Im in the same boat! Fuck body hair, being all itchy and prickly and make you think spider is on your leg. JUST LEMME KEEP MAH LEGS SMOOTH DAMIT
Same here!! Goodness, I freaking despise body hair!!
I felt positive about mine. “Yeah I’m very hairy, but my leg and arm hair is white/blonde and my chest and beard are brown and my head hair is blonde so I can easily get my chest and beard lasered off my pale skin”

The balloon that popped when they told me my hair is probably too red to laser off. I think I took a month long depression slide down and haven’t gotten back up to the same level since. 

I later learned to just do the laser and whatever is left get electrolysis on. I just haven’t called them back yet.
It’s not a question with an answer so there’s not a whole load of point thinking about it. I also just thought it was a funny comparison, a little laugh at the pain 😅.
ah yes pre heterosexual lmao (ik what u meant but i couldnt resist) :)
Malenia from Elden Ring comes to mind
Idk if I’d say all of life is bad, there’s definitely some light at the end. At least in my opinion.
Are you implying trans people are all mentally unstable?
Yeah that's the meme I was thinking of but I wasn't sure if it was a tumblr thing and ppl would be like wtf r u on about
😂
Yea we should!!
werewolf sounds cool id go for that over this any day
True.. i may have been cursed with a overthinking curse...
To be fair to myself..seeing as how much witchhunts and scapegoating we had in human history i'd assume having someone to blame seems to be helpful to at least some people ..

Kinda wild that this “fact” isn’t supported by many medical professionals or psychiatrists. But then again I don’t even know why I’m trying to convince someone defending anti-vaxxers in their bio to listen to experts.
[removed]
[removed]
What opposite notion? That trans people are like other people and that their mental state, conditions and health can vary from person to person. If so then yes, yes it is.
Your bio literally says “it’s not the fault of “anti-vaxxers”” I don’t know how that isn’t a defence. And if hospitals put out and dedicate a large portion of their resources to mitigating damage so that they won’t become over crowded and people wilfully refuse to help mitigate it then the problem goes far beyond normal understaffing.
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
If the notion your on about is that all trans people being mentally unstable is a fact. Then I just said that there is plenty of evidence to support that trans people all have unique mental states and just because someone’s trans doesn’t make them unstable.
“I have no response to you and my making up of facts hasn’t worked, so therefore I declare myself the winner and will leave”. Is that what you mean?
Pretty sure if an Earth quake was coming and a load of people refused to get into Earth quake bunkers and then got injured in the Earth quake. They’ve exacerbated the problems and that is indeed that groups fault.

I guess I’ve wasted all that money at university while trying to get my degree in Economics. It’s sad I’ll never be able to say “I am an Economist”. If only I’d been born with an Economists genomes."	viihvr	trans	3452	0.97	2022-06-22 23:21:43
I'm leaving the community	"Update (09/14/2022): Turns out that I was wrong about being a cis man. I'm actually still a trans woman, just that I was really deep in denial at the time. But thanks to therapy my egg hatched and now I can go on living as a trans woman. In celebration of that, I created a AMA post in discussions in order so that you can learn more about what I am up to right now.

Original post:

Hi all! I got some good and bad news to share. The good news is that I have finally figured out my gender. It turns out that I am actually a cis het guy, and that my gender dysphoria was just a symptom of the childhood trauma that I had unfortunately experienced. Which leads to the bad news, in which I have to say farewell to the trans community as well as the larger lgbt+ community as a whole due to now being anything but queer.

That said, I just want to thank everyone who came to support and encourage me to find myself in my darkest hour. I really appreciate all that you have done, and as a result I will always be a proud ally to your fight for equality and representation. It is the least that I can do after all the kindness you have shown to me this past month.

Farewell, friends."	"All I care about is that you’re happy and comfortable with your decision! Go live your life and continue to be happy!
The queer community is all about finding yourself, and I applaud you for doing so, even if it means you're no longer part of the community.

But you'll be an ally who has a hell of an inside view :)
It's a beautiful thing when someone fully understands who they are.
I don't see you realizing your CIS meaning you have to leave the community.  We need allies more now than ever and remaining plugged into the community will allow you to continue to be informed.  That said if you feel this is a step you need to take I totally understand that as well.

I hope you hang around, but it not, I hope you continue to be happy!
Happy for you that you figured yourself out and I wish you all the best in dealing with those traumatic experiences from your childhood. We always need allies so feel free to stick around :)
I'm really happy for you :)

Most cis folk never actually query their gender, they just go with what they were told; if you've actually examined yourself and know that you're really cis het, that's a big step!
Okay but I hope your identity still leaves room for you to use conditioner. Nobody is so cishet they need 2in1 shampoo & bodywash
Hey, I'm glad you found your way and you know what you want in your future now, but why do you have to leave? Who is anyone to gatekeep you from staying in this community? People here have helped you, you might want to help people here.

I think your experience and journey would be a great addition here, it would be a shame if you stopped participating.
Congrats on figuring out yourself, it's nice to have a good ally
Aww I am happy you have found your way ♥ Be happy my dude, walk strong! You're never alone ♥
Happy that you found yourself after al that time! Remember we love you whoever or whatever you are
i will screenshoot the fuck out of this OP and comments so show off the next time someone will acuse us of been too pushy on femboys and queer-questioning people

thanks for a lovely thread OP :D
The entire point of the queer community is so that people can feel safe to experiment, explore, and find who they are and what makes them happiest.


I’m glad you found you, and if you feel you have to leave so be it. But at least for me, you will always be welcome here, and you are always welcome to reach out to me directly if you need to talk.
Glad the community could show you the support you needed to work yourself out! So happy for you that you pieced you’re identity together and can live as yourself :)
It isn't ""bad news"" to figure out you're not trans (obviously the trauma part is bad news); it's actually great news! Just like figuring out you're trans means you're that much closer to knowing who you are, figuring out you really are cis means the exact same thing. So, I would, if anything, say congratulations are in order! 

Additionally, you don't really have to leave the community. Allies are always welcome.
Time will tell if you are correct in your realization. If you do have gender dysphoria it will not go away. If you are correct then at least you understand the struggles of Transgender people. You don't need to abandon us. We need allies like your self that understand the struggle.
That's totally valid, bro! I hope you found the labels useful while you had them, and I wish you well on your journey xx
Good luck and glad you figured you out. All the best
I’m sorry you had some trauma that really affected you and made some things confusing :(, but glad you took the time and effort to confront it and figure yourself out. :)

I haven’t seen anything else you’ve posted >~<, but I’m glad the rest of the community here was able to offer some guidance and support :).

Realizing that this path doesn’t affirm who you are, even after exploring it, does not make you a fraud or any less human. I think it even adds more to who you are by your willingness to face that and figure out who you are and what’s right for you. 

I wish you the best of luck homie :).
Thanks for stopping by!!
Trying on labels and experimenting while you are figuring yourself out on these crucial things is not time or energy wasted. You are returning to your old label this time with an understanding of yourself that you did not have before.

Best wishes on the rest of your healing journey.
Congratulations. Trans or cis it’s good for all of us to discover who we are
But your experiences and journey are valuable. Why not stay and help those on a similar journey?
Best of luck my dude! Congratulations on the self discovery and I wish you all the best as you heal.
glad you figured yourself out!! what matters is that you're happy with yourself and that you now get to heal :) best of luck!!
Good luck on your journey friend.    ☺️
It's great you've done self- exploration, hope things go better for you in the future :)
That’s okay! Experimenting with gender is something everyone should do to get a better idea of who they are! No shame in it! Continue on being happy, you’re still welcome here as an ally 💜
Goodbye have good day
Hey I really hope you start healing from your trauma and I’m proud of you for finding yourself.
Congrats on figuring urself out! :D
Congrats on figuring yourself out!
You're still valid, and a friend of the community❤️🏳️‍⚧️👋
Quitter. Just kidding. Big hugs and hugs kudos to you for doing that work.
Good luck on your journey forward! And I'm happy you were able to find yourself!

Also, the radio litterally just started playing See you Again by Wiz Khalifa lol. Almost feels kinda appropriate for your situation
Wow, thank you for sharing your journey here 💜 we appreciate you and wish you all the best!
YAY!!!
SO GLAD YOU WERE ABLW TO WORK THROUGH YOUR STUFF, sorry things took a longer route to healing but I wish you the best : , )
So happy for you
Now you can be awesome ally to the community, be the best boyfriend to a trans girl, or if your journey leads you back here, we’re happy to welcome you back! ☺️
I'm very happy for you that you figured out your gender:)
I WISH YOU WELL!
Even if you aren't any of the letters you are always welcome in the community spaces. LGBTQ+ is all about figuring out who you are and accepting everyone's differences. You are welcome in LGBTQ+ spaces any time, really, feel free to lurk or comment/give advice if it's asked for. 

Congrats on finding your identity and good luck in therapy, good job😄
congratulations on figuring yourself out, dude! good luck in the future!

and remember, even if you're not a part of the trans community now, allies are always welcome here :)
Im happy you've discovered more about yourself good luck with your journey!!
How did you figure it out? And how do I figure it out? It’s too confusing >.<
We’ll miss you! Thank you for being so kind about everything. I hope your trauma heals somewhat so the symptoms of gender dysphoria dissipate. Have a good life ! <3
We still love you. If anything, that experience of self discovery has helped you become a more rock-solid ally than most - feel more than welcome to stick around :3
This is so sweet but so sad, it's great that you found out more about yourself!
Exploring and finding your truth is what it's all about, and discovering yourself is validating regardless of that outcome. Thank you for sharing your journey and best to you moving forward!
I'm glad you're comfortable in your identity, and I hope that you'll continue to support us :)
""it's not about winning or losing it's about the friends you made along the way""

Congrats on finding your true identity!
Congratulations! Im glad ur comfortable in ur skin and figured things out. Thats the only thing that matters :]
Congrats on figuring out who you are!
Congrat !! Hope you will be okay and all the trans-internet is proud of u ♡♡
I don't think you need to leave; you're a lot different from a person who needs their gender assigned to them, and conforms to it without question. Being trans to me is about exercising your right to express your gender how you want.
Glad you figured things out hunny 🙂
Farewell friend 👋
Congrats to finding urself bro
This is a place as much for people with transgender experiences as those who ARE trans.

Just the fact that you embraced gender non conforming paths to discover you're mostly cishet means you are actually queer AF and will always be welcome here ❤️

PS. Keep that courage in the years to come. There are surely more surprises of self discovery waiting for you.
Its a bittersweet thing, i know i dont know you bit its kinda lile you gradiated and now get out in world leaving the nest. 

Anyways, hope you find your happily ever after my dude 🤟
Understandable, but we the community need inside Allie’s more than ever. If you truly wish to leave then no worries, just know we are always here.
I'm happy that you're making progress in resolving your trauma, best of luck in your journey, you're still welcome here even if you're not Trans. Farewell.
that's totally fine man! I'm glad you realized your identity even if its not apart of the community. Best of luck and know that you'll always have a place here as an ally. <3 Farwell friend :)
I think most people just want you to happy, go grow yourself 😁
Well, glad you figured yourself out. Plus you'll always have hella an inside view on queer communities that most cishet people never will get.
it doesn't matter what you are as long as you're kind. the knowledge you have fought for and earned is yours. I wish you only the best, and that you are happy. you're always welcome and appreciated as an ally
Glad you were able to figure yourself out, wishing you the best mate. 🙌
Congratulations on finding yourself, dude
As long as you’re being true to yourself… that’s what matters.
The lgbtq+ community is all about supporting others and helping them find themselves, and it can be very difficult. I’m glad you were able to figure out what was right for you!
Me 6 months on E: huh I also had a lot of childhood trauma….oh no I’m doubting again
This is so good to hear. Proud of you for getting to know yourself better and having the courage to confront your past!
As long as you're happy we'll be here for you, trans or not!  That's what the lgbtq+ community should strive for, people being willing to find themselves and feel comfortable with yourself, and I'm glad you found that ❤️
Sad to see you go, but it is your decision and I will respect that. 

Also congratulations on figuring out about yourself.
Wish you luck and we are always here for u!!
I'm really happy for you for finding yourself, and not going to lie - a bit envious. Eight years in and I still question whether I still made the right choice sometimes. With that said... I'll leave you with a quote from my favorite Hashira - a character who a few years back helped me make peace with my own masculinity:

“Go ahead and live with your head held high! No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness…set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.”
I’m curious how your dysphoria manifested and how you determined that it was from trauma and not identity-linked? I would love for this to be the case for me and put all of this behind me lol.
i dont see why you would have to leave. if you have friends around here, you could just stay, not like youre required to prove your identity to anyone. in fact you can share your  kindness to others in the community, even being cis. up to you tho, and only if youre willing. i wish you luck in future endevours regardless
I’m glad you figured yourself out and are on the path to healing! Best of luck in whatever your future will entail ☺️❤️
If you ever wanna visit just say hi!!!
You know realistically you don't have to leave the community; you can still be a part of this without being trans
Well, we all love and welcome you anyways. It's good that you found yourself! I hope I can achieve that too one day!
Glad you figured things out.

Anyone who is respectful is always welcome, trans or not, so you don't have to leave if you don't want to :)
congrats on being sure
you chose what's best for you. i wish everything will go smoothly from now on!!! :3
Pls don't leave.. You sound like a cool guy..
I'm really glad you figured yourself out!
You can always stay as a supporter
Would you mind if i PM you, i have a few questions, specifically if you could share what trauma it was or how you realized it. Im struggling with gender identity as well, and a very toxic family, so im constantly thinking about the chance im just too traumatized and actually not a girl.
I’m proud of you!! Self exploration is all a long journey we are going through, and I hope that our community was able to help you in any way!! I wish you luck on your continuing life journey!! :)
Hope you’re doing ok man, take care of yourself, and just know you’re always welcome in these spaces
Best wishes, and you’re always welcome back if things change
I'm so happy you found yourself. Just continue as you deem fit my friend.
I know you have your reasons for going, and they're totally valid and reasonable and I don't want to stop you, but remember that the reason we call it the lgbt+ community is because the acronym was unwieldy when it was LGBTQQIA (and growing), and the A stands for ally. You're welcome back any time you're ready.
That’s ok! Gender is a journey even if it turns out you’re cis. You understand why you’re like this and can feel more confident in your gender. glad to have you while you were here.
You know I think in a lot of ways this was a nest, but some people reach a certain point of flight where they're comfortable enough to go out and be themselves, whether that be any variation were all just human and we come here feeling scared and alone and hoping to learn from others Introspect, and it's a beautiful thing I'm so happy for you,  I'm so glad you found help here like so many people do, best wishes !!!
The queer comunity is always here to support you, no matter what. Be well and I hope the best for you
farewell my friend, i only hope that you live the best life possible ! the queer community is one big tent. even if you don’t fit inside of the identities here, you’re welcome here! 

i also hope you do deconstruct that trauma, i know that road can be difficult.
Hugs to you on your journey through healing. LGBTQIA+ includes allys and we’re lucky to have you if you’ll still stay.
how did trauma give you dysphoria?
Please stay in some capacity, what you’ve been through could really help someone. I might be in a similar position as you, I’m right on the fence about transitioning and what you’ve just said might apply to me. So please hang around, it could save someone. 💖🥰
Once lgbt always lgbt Dosent mean you actively take part but it has been a part of your life and you’ll always have a loving community too talk too if you ever need. Godspeed my friend, Godspeed
Just saying, that the only prerequisite to being trans is to think you’re trans. It doesn’t matter where you *think* your dysphoria comes from as long as you’re living the life that brings you happiness. In any case, wishing you healing ❤️‍🩹
Fair winds...
Good for you :D
I recently came across r/detrans. The experiences of people there might resonate with you. Take care, OP!
dude really notified us of his absence
Yk you don't have to leave, you could still stay just as an ally
Thank you. I'm actually going through therapy right now in order to make that a reality.
Freaking true! Proud of it too, as the community has kept me sane and alive while I sort myself out.
Agreed. Though I will admit, I was not expecting that this was the path that I would take. But I am not going to complain, as it makes this moment even more special.
Don't worry, I'll still make sure to fight against white supremacy and transphobia wherever I go. It is just that I need to separate myself from the trans community in hope of figuring out what it means to be a cisgender man and most importantly a cis ally to you all. 

I had basically spent too long ingraining myself to this wonderful community that I had lost sight of what it means to see myself as a separate person from everyone else in the society I live in. Thus I just want to spend some time alone to gather my thoughts and prepare for my new life ahead.
by the way cis isn’t an acronym, it’s from a made-up language called latin
Allies aren’t part of the community though, they’re allies *of* the community
Oh, you really think so? Here I was feeling shame over realizing that I am not actually queer, as I had built my entire life to be that up to this point.
LOL! Don't worry. I learned that the 2in1 shampoo and conditioner and other variations are trash. So I am definitely going to wash my hair with separate bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash from now on.

Healthy hair and skin is better than brittle hair and dry skin any day.
I'm trans and I use 2in1 shampoo QwQ (I have bad dandruff so I use Head and Shoulders lmao)
If I had any coins, you would surely get an award for this comment. 💕
One time at a friend's house party I met a girl that had the most beautiful long thick, straight, shiny hair. Her hair looked like the models in the hair commercials. Of course I asked what she used to wash her hair expecting a long list of the most expensive hair products. Her answer? Pert Plus. LOL. I've been using Pert Plus since then, and I've gotta say, it's made my hair look much nicer than it ever did before. Though I still use a L'Occitane body wash :D
I was under the assumption that since I no longer identify as queer, I should step aside and let the queer community speak for themselves. I've seen far too many times when a cisgender person, much less a cishet person, tries to speak about the queer experience only to end up damaging the already strained relationship that the queer community has with the rest of society. So I just want to be respectful and not get in the way of progress when you definitely deserve better.
You are most certainly welcome. Oh, and if you encounter any transphobic person trying to twist my words into another transphobic attack, please remind them that I am a proud ally of the trans community and that there was no way in hell that I was ""mislead"" into thinking that I was trans for a while.

Or even better, tell them that I have no regrets over exploring my gender identity. Because I really don't, as it had allowed me to grow into a much more confident and kind man that sees the importance of allowing people to be their true selves.
I'll be sure to check by from time to time. I just need a breather from the chaos that is going on right now.
I agree with this and I’ll add that hopefully the realization of it being solely a trauma response wasn’t guided by others who have less than good intentions towards the trans community.
Thank you. I wish the same for you too, friend.
Thank you! I wish the same for you.
I'm certainly working on it. I am already seeing a therapist to help me go through it.
Thank you!
For sure! I will always be an ally too, as I now know how much it sucks to deal with gender dysphoria.
LOL! Nice. It is definitely going into my playlist now.
Oh for sure! If I ever fall in love with a trans woman, you can bet that I will be the most doting and validating boyfriend that I can be. I'll give her all the pillows and Blahajs she wants so she can be the ultimate pillow princess... No. A pillow QUEEN!
Years of therapy and self-reflection for the most part. Also letting go of your self-hatred helps a lot too.
True enough. I do got that.
Relax. Take a deep breath and then let it out. There is nothing to worry about. What works for me doesn't mean that it will work for you. But if it helps, try finding a gender affirming therapist to talk about it. They are much more qualified in helping you sort everything out than I do.
-----------   Trigger warning: Abuse     ---------------------




|| I was abused as a child by my parents. They shamed and mock me for everything that I did, only to isolate me and psychologically torment me for going against their command no matter if it is real or imaginary. They gaslight me into thinking that who I am and what I was doing was wrong and that it would only make me end up on the streets with no help or comfort in sight. Even when I was doing normal stuff a person my own age was doing, they would find a way to twist it into a message about how immature and naive I was to do so. So as a result I learned to despise everything that I am, including hating my body and my gender because I wrongly thought that the reason why my parents (and by extension, the society that I lived in) had hated me so much was because I was the oldest son in the family and that it would have been easier if I was born as a woman. ||

Hope that helps.
I'll stop by from time to time. I just need some time to figure myself out now, as I still have lasting effects of the trauma that I have to contend with atm.
Thank you! It was a difficult journey indeed.
Thank you for your kind words. I really hope so too.

Btw, Happy Cake Day!
I wrote this out on another thread in this post, so I will just copy and paste it here. Just be warned that it is distressing as it talks about abuse.

I'll think about it. I'm kind of preoccupied with other things right now tho.
That subreddit has actually been taken control by terfs/transphobes. You really shouldn't go there unless you want to see how vile terfs really are.
bad sub, think there is a different one that isnt as cringe.
Awesome! I know from my short experience with therapy that it’s nice to just talk about how you feel and then start working to make the negative into a positive.
That's totally valid.  I hope maybe at some point you can reengage after your more sure of your place.  

I also hope that if you feel after some distance maybe it wasn't the right call, don't feel like it would be a problem to come back and again seek help.  I can't speak for everyone but I know I've waffled back and forth a few times on the path to accepting myself (And I'm probably still not done)

I truly wish you well and hope to bump into you out there. :-)
I think I get what your saying, he isn't a part of the trans community because he isn't trans, but I think what others were saying is that they can still vibe in r/trans the subreddit and be a part of this community, despite not being trans
The community is in this case the subreddit. Why would a cis person not be allowed to interact with/be a part of r/trans?
Respectfully, but strongly, disagree.
Lots of us had build our entire life around being cis. Doesn't mean we should be ashamed of that, just like you shouldn't be ashamed either.
You thought you might be, you explored it, you realised you're not. It's not a big deal or anything to be ashamed of; people grow and change and develop themselves as they live, it's natural.
The queer community can sometimes be a little heavy-handed in pushing the idea that a person who is questioning must be queer. I would say that, similar to the way most cis people don't question their gender and most straight people don't question their sexuality, most queer people don't fully consider if it is a fully internal thing for them or if they're being influenced by outside sources, like a childhood trauma.

That being said, life is a journey, it's not about where you end up as much as it is how you get there. You have unlocked more about your past and now understand more about yourself than most people will. There's no shame in realizing you're not queer, there's no shame in realizing you are queer. It's just self-discovery and that is a powerful thing that no one can take from you and shows a massive amount of introspection into the way you were, the way you were brought up, and the way you are and the way you interact with others today.
I wish more people would explore their gender. I celebrate your for going through that exploration and finding yourself. That's what its all about, discovering and embracing yourself and it looks like you've done that <3
If every man could learn this lesson, the world would be a better place. Congrats on your journey, and much love! 💖
Same but I use 3 in 1 lol
You've gone through gender dysphoria and figured out it wasn't because you wanted to be the opposite gender, but early trauma. You're not alone in that and I think that experience can be of value for some people that aren't sure wheter or not they're trans.
Unfathomably Based 😎👌
OP said in another comment that they came to that conclusion themselves
That’s a good step!
If I didn’t already have an amazing boyfriend, I’d be hitting on you right now :P
Ty lol
Thanks for sharing. So happy for you that you’re working through all of that!
ty!!
thanks. did you come to this conclusion yourself?
No problem, I’d just like to say thank you for your input. 💖
Oh good to know. That's sad because if it were sincere, it would be such a great space for questioning people to access!
What's the less-cringe sub?
I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thanks.
Exactly that yes. More people in these subs is always great, especially someone who has experienced gender in a way that isn’t stereotypically cisheteronormative, but that doesn’t mean they’re part of the community at large
That’s not even remotely what I’m saying, I’m saying cishet allies are not part of the community. The subreddit is fine and welcome to all obviously
It doesn’t matter if you agree or not, you’re just plain wrong.
Literally this. My entire life was built around being a cishet white man, and casting any thoughts to the contrary aside as shameful dreams and wishes. Turns out I’m much happier now lol, I’m glad he figured himself out :) we all deserve that in the end, and to be allowed to be ourselves without feeling like we shouldn’t or can’t for reasons A, B, or C.
Tbf, I am still dealing with the aftereffects from the trauma that my parents inflicted upon me. They made me despise every aspect of who I am inside, only to then shame me for even questioning and exploring my identity. So it is still a struggle for me to acknowledge that I did nothing wrong by going the direction I did, even if it lead me back to being a cishet man. 

But I am thankful that I did go down this path and learn what the queer experience is all about. I do not ever want to forget that experience for as long as I live.
I will think about that. But for right now, I just want to work on myself and move past the trauma.
Me too.
Yes I did. I wasn't forced to make that decision by anyone but myself. I had even distanced myself from the toxic people of my life for a while by the time I came to it. So this is truly coming from my heart and soul.
Yeah. It pisses me off too as I would have loved it if such a genuine place exist. But alas, it is not the case.
I think its called real detrans or something like that.

Edit: hit me as soon as a pressed send - its actualdetrans
I'm comfortable with my position.  And judging by the votes the wider community would seem to agree.  I don't know what your so mad about, but I do wish you well.
Interesting story. Thank you for sharing. Wishing you good luck on your continued healing :)

If you feel comfortable sharing, was there a specific moment or thought where it ""clicked"" where you realized ""Ah hah, i'm not actually trans, it's just Trauma #2341""?"	wkwemz	trans	3374	0.95	2022-08-10 12:39:54

You are hella cute
I'm a 35yo straight gym rat. In my adulthood I've had the privilege of seeing the trans movement grow as now women start hrt earlier and start having access to resources that teach them to be themselves.

This has allowed them to go from being painful obvious, to now, I'd legit approach you in a bar. Or maybe, I wouldn't because I'd be worried you're out of my league.
Looking good xx
You look amazing!
Damm u pass
Aw. You look super cute. Don't let that dysphoria get you. Show it who's boss.
Success. You're adorable! ♡
Hey don't let that stop you from enjoying your day. Your a beautiful woman and you'll kick ass today, tomorrow and forever.

So this is my official medical record...		"In my record it says something like problem: transseuxal/transgender and it makes me laugh every time.
As my therapist told me when I brought up this same thing. “Don’t get hung up on insurance and medical codes.” ❤️
ICD 10 codes are a bit ridiculous. 

W22.02: Walked into lamp post

Y93.D1: Stabbed with crochet tool

W60: Contact with non-venomous plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves

V90.22XA: Drowning and submersion due to jumping from a burning fishing boat

W59.22XA: Struck by a turtle
 
Z63.1: Problems in relationship with in-laws

Y93.E2: Injury due to activity – laundry

Z00.00: General adult medical exam without abnormal findings

V00.15: Heelys rolled shoes accident 


My personal favorite is currently in my medical chart. Z72.53: High risk bisexual behavior
ICD 10 is superseded by ICD 11 since 2022
But not yet implemented everywhere.
In ICD 11 Trans* was categorised differently, and not as ""Disease"" as in ICD 10
I only see ICD-9 and 10, Ask them to check out ICD-11 chapter 17 page 9, Gender Incongruence (BlockL1-HA6), I think the code is HA60
It's just a billing code.  

Clinical Information  
Severe gender dysphoria, coupled with a persistent desire for the physical characteristics and social roles that connote the opposite biological sex. (apa, dsm-iv, 1994)  
The urge to belong to the opposite sex that may include surgical procedures to modify the sex organs in order to appear as the opposite sex.  

It helps your Doctor get reimbursed.
ICD-10 codes are weird af. One of my BFFs (who is also trans) works for a pharmacy and deals with these codes day in and day out. She once told me about [this one](https://icdlist.com/icd-10/W56.21XA) and I think about it almost every day.
Mine has a list of ""ambulatory problems"", and right next to all my mental health conditions, there's ""transgender""... yikes. Makes me laugh though, as long as your doctors are treating you right.
I think mine actually says “hormonal imbalance in transgender patient”
These are outdated classifications
God when will we not be medical problem/anomaly. Folks I get it what it meant to say. I mean the thing can just say ""gender dysphoria""... why outdated terms like "" transsexualism"" or ""transgenderism"", these to me sounded wrong.
Just to clarify, every time a doctor submits a charge for a visit or orders a medication or labs, there has to be an associated diagnosis code.  Most electronic medical records will group those together in a ""problem list"" to make it easier for the clinician to find in the future.  Also, the displayed verbiage can be a bit clunky, but what matters is the actual letter/number combo as that tells the lab/pharmacy/insurance company the ""why"" of what they're doing.  Medicine can be pretty cruel in their terminology, and that's really unfortunate,  but a lot of times the clinician doesn't have any other options when selecting an option in their system.  In Obstetrics for example, a 37 year old women with 3 miscarriages and a delivery at 20 weeks would get labeled as an elderly multigravida, habitual aborter, with an incompetent cervix....all pretty offensive but not inaccurate.  Our EHR company realized that and changed the verbiage to less offensive terms, but not every clinician has less offensive options.  If you like/trust your doctor, I would assume she/he is just limited to the terms available in their computer system.
Dysphoria is a problem; being trans isn’t. Being trans is the solution.
It’s just for insurance reason. You’d have to coded in with medical conditions typcially like gender dysphoria to be able to be prescribed hrt and get gender surgeries covered
Transexual is medical jargon for a trans person who is seeking to medically transition. I hate it, I had to explain to a room fool of doctors that maybe they shouldn’t use the term transexual anymore as it has fallen out of use in the trans community and some people find the term insulting. That transgender is the safer term to use with trans people even if some are okay with transexual… and I was completely ignored. They chose to ignore the medical student in the room who is trans when I tried to explain about trans stuff. I’m technically “transexual” but I visibly cringe at the word. 

A handful of the other students in the room came to me afterwards and asked about various things, so there are doctors on their way who care more about trans issues, but the old fogeys who were lecturing about trans stuff that day were lost causes.
same but at least i get free transition yk
Average American healthcare system insurance moment
my psych ward records say “sexuality: transgender”
If you want treatment, they have to document why. Yah, sometimes words are ugly. But they’re only a means to an end.
A doctor I used to work with likes “unspecified endocrine disorder”
I have a medical assessment for public insurance that says:
Illness: Transgender
Cure: Transition

Lmao I wish it would make me not trans
Its okay, my last therapist (I left since then lmao) put me down as a transvestite 💀
As a PA who works in LGBTQ health, these options drive us insane too. I try to warn my patients that I have to chart a diagnosis on the ""problem list"" or I can't prescribe or document things. I apologize to them for the clunky nature of the EHR and remind them that it is *not* a problem. I usually ask if they have a preference for the wording I choose (transgender vs gender dysphoria, eg). The code is F64.0. Some EHRs autopopulate the words if they pull it from a prior record. So for example, I chart f64.0 - gender dysphoria, but then you go to a new provider and the chart pulls the code only and auto selects ""transsexualism"" (an old, outdated term that still lives under the same code). I try to fix it but it still pulls from some stupid database over and over.

Medical coding is frustrating and insane and makes us crazy too. Those of us working on the field try to fight and fix.
Mine friggin had transvestitism on it.  Still upsets me.
You’d be amazed on how many insurance and medical codes are so outdated. Federal and state laws language as well. The amount of “mental r*********” I see is mind blowing.
I think of it as a double edged sword. Typically, healthy people don't need medical assistance, right? We trans people typically require medications, often times surgery, and mental health support helps too. If we're classified as healthy, we're less likely to be afforded special consideration which many need. It's not that there's anything wrong with us, but that for legal purposes, it's useful.

Public perception is the other side of the coin, of course. Possibly even self perception, but that's a more solvable problem.

In the end, I can personally see it both ways. Well meaning people who are very supportive of the community might support gender disphoria being classified as a mental illness for similar reasons to classifying depression as a mental illness. It's not inherently a slam against people. Research says most adults have a mental illness of some kind in their lifetime anyway. So, try not to take it personally. 😊
Arguably gender dysphoria is a problem
Lol on my top surgery paperwork, my diagnosis code was ""transsexualism with asexual history"" which is technically true, I was ace prior to starting T, but like I'd never mentioned that to my doctor lmfao.
Mine at the VA says male feels they are female after my first visit lmao. 

Then the next doctor put is experiencing gender dysphoria...because you know...I'm trans not a delusional person lol

That's why unless I have to I don't look at my medical record. When I went to get my lungs checked post military the guy explained to me how on the inside I will never be female and he has to run the test as a male as if he ran it as a female I'd probably have like 125% lung capacity (I already have 111% somehow). I was upset because how he said it...I am aware my lung capacity is more no need to be rude af.

Anyway, I feel your pain.

Much love - Fran
My ""problems"" page just says ""endocrine disorder"" best way about it!
i laughed, i'm going to hell
In my country I had some form of sexual deviancy (hypersexuality or something?) listed in my record so I could get some of the meds.
I still think Z72. 53 is hilarious
my medical history says the same, it also adds my depression as a problem, but it is not because it is something bad but rather that it would be something to improve in the health of the user

Meh, either this is medical jargon for ""reason for visit"" or people aren't open minded, either way, you're you.  No one else's opinion matters.
Gender dysphoria is what it has to say for you to get treatment anyway.  My husband's doctor wrote his prescription for T for ""testosterone insufficiency"" as the dx code.  He's AFAB so they wouldn't cover it,  but they would for AMAB. If it said ""gender dysphoria"" instead they would have covered it
Mine has ""transgender person on hormone therapy"" under the ""conditions"" part lmao
Got the same diagnosis.  I think it’s automatically assigned when I signed the informed consent forms.
The verbiage is not pleasant but having these codes help you get insurance approval.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen-
The problem is you were born the wrong sex. Not transsexualism.  That would be the solution
It is causing me issues
As a medical student and soon to be provider. Don't really get hung up on what we have in your clinical history. Most of it is for legal purposes aside from information we do need. Where they type problem they mean the reason you came in to see the doctor and what we find is wrong ,not used to identify you at all.
Unfortunately, the DSM is out of step. And the terminology is lame and wrong. And yet these diagnostic terms are how we get insurance to cover therapy. 🙄
If the only ""problem"" was gender dysphoria, okay, but really, ""transsexualism"" ? After all, gender dysphoria is a trouble 🤷
Finally France isn't so bad about insurances haha
Problem: Transsexualism

Solution: Picrew
jesuschrist  thats not ok
This is Medical English, it is not vernacular (everyday) English.

this is prescribed language that is universally understood in the medical field. don't take it as an insult, these are frank and sometimes brutally honest descriptors that you and your medical professional need to use in order to get you the right gender-affirming care and treatment.
Since I am not privy to the entire diagnosis, I suggest you see a shrink before you do. Just remember, nothing goes away. You either accept or deny it, and you live with yourself and accept that beautiful person you are. Next time, let me see all of you, and I mean ALL! MoM
It’s not a problem, it’s a challenge! Let’s face it head on fellow trans peeps, and defeat it with self love and acceptance! 😌💕
It’s not a problem it’s just who you are. That’s bs
problem???
I see this feed in some future history (whatever will be their alternative of a) book and all the kids laughing at the stupidity of our time.
Transexualism sounds like a practicing religion....I'm cool with that. lol. 

Try to make light of the dark. Never read into soulless words.
Thats just terrible .
I've only been on hormones for a year so I'm still new to the community and what things mean, but by ""problem"" are they referring to it as something that can just be magically cured or rather the obvious work of transitioning/therapy? Sorry if that's a dumb question
The way I see it as an autistic trans person, problem in medicine doesn't always mean ~bad thing to have~. It just means that you are part of a group that requires extra supports in some way.

Like, I and many other autistic people don't see our autism as a problem in the sense of it meaning there's something wrong with us - but in a society where most people are neurotypical there are a lot of things about daily life that disable us so we are disabled and have niche support needs. We struggle unnecessarily if we don't have access to those supports.

Similarly, being trans is a great way to be, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. But under a society where most people are cis, we have very niche medical support needs that cause us to struggle unnecessarily without them.

The thing that makes being trans a medical problem then is not us, but the suffering many of us endure without medical supports. 

Or as my best friend put it to me a few years ago when I very dramatically sighed that it was dumb that being trans is classified as a disorder and that you have to prove that you're suffering ""You DO suffer being trans like, all the time. Otherwise you wouldn't do anything about it.""
Add depression and anxiety on there and it matches mine! 😂
Darling don’t worry. It’s just for insurance reasons I know it can be annoying for it to be an “issue” or use a term you don’t prefer but the doctor didn’t think that per say, but that’s what they do so insurance will pay. ~A pharmacy student
On mine it just says gender dysphoria, what state are you in cause that’s so unnecessary
my cardiologist also says this, i laugh at it honestly 😂
I get those notes in my chart too. Genuinely 99% of the time they are putting it in to try to be helpful. It theoretically makes it more likely that future people in that office will know you’re trans and look at the notes for your name/pronouns. It’s the only place they can usually put it. EMR systems are notoriously bad about having a spot for preferred name and pronouns b/c they are designed solely to ensure your doctor gets paid
Yeah, I had to provide diagnosis codes to insurance once when I was having some issues getting them to cover appointments for therapy and I had the same.issue. The language regarding trans people in medicine (and research) desperately needs to be updated and standardized.
It makes it sound so clinical
Sorry for the crap photo, Was taken from my work pc. I’ve coded for a lot of trans people and I’ve never had anyone specifically diagnose this. My network just updates the name and adds mtf/ftm in the history and nothing else is said about it. I also just code for Ed visits so maybe that’s why I haven’t seen this diagnosis? You can find more info than what I got by going to The WHO website https://i.imgur.com/VHlbXZB.jpg
Honestly I wouldn't even care so long as they cover the damn health insurance claims! But put that on there and then send me a bill for $400? Yeah, no thanks.
jesus christ it literally has a fucking insurance code too
Problem???????
This is horrible what is this for I’m confused ??
yeah...that's half the reason i hate doing medical things

because why label my stuff as a problem? 

Problem: Depression...like that doesn't quite have the same meaning...does it...?
ICD 10 is not a very up to date billing code. I would be disappointed but don’t fault the hospital system. It’s probably the only code they have to bill with. ICD 11 is much more up to date but not every country/health system is using it yet.
i once got diagnosed with “high risk homosexual behavior” 👍
Just think of it as the cross-sex hormone human equivalent of a car repair bill that is telling you you are low on oil and other fluids and need it changed/filled.
Being transgender is like autism.... It's not a ""problem"" if it's making you cooler.
Wow. They list it as a problem what the f***
Problem: being too sexy B)
Mine too
yeah mine is the same
I got the same with anxiety sprinkled in there 😅... then a host of unrelated hullabaloo ❤
Wait how do you view this type of medical record?
Yo wtaf
Well then
samesies
Wtf
Mine says ""transgender person on hormone therapy"" but I haven't started hormones yet (start tomorrow)
Unrelated but how did u get the trans/bi flag next to your name?
Sameeee
Mentally rewrite ""Problem"" as ""Medical Need""
This is true. They don't see it like you think but you would not believe the hoops Healthcare providers have to jump through  for insurance 😮‍💨
This. Gender dysphoria and all that is in the DSM (for the US) so that there can be an official diagnosis and insurance will pay for it, not that it's an ""illness"" or something.
My mom works in a hospital. They still have a group for patients suffering from ""mental r*tardation"", listed in their charts. Really, don't worry about the terms.
I want to try to get some of these. Getting ""struck by a turtle"" on my record would be pretty hilarious
A while back, a guy was almost swallowed by a whale. The chat about it on the nursing subreddit was mostly speculation about how that would be coded for insurance purposes.
I have not been stabbed with a crochet tool, but I have with a knitting tool! Are those lumped, or am I just SOL?
🤨 high risk bisexual behavior?!?

What. 

are these real?
wait it actually says “high risk *bisexual behavior*”? Damn
What if I am submerged after jumping from a non burning fishing boat?  Or from a burning non fishing boat?
Z72.53.2 eye damage after constant exposure to bisexual lighting
Please tell me those are made up. Right?

Edit: they seem legit...
Is there a difference if the turtle strikes you of its own volition ir if someone throws it at you or a bird drops it on you?
ICD10 100% speed run glitchless
….of all the codes….why did struck by a turtle sound craziest…
This needs to be its own subreddit
🙃 And that is before modifiers. 

The ""zoo code"" Z00.00 is detested by insurance companies and many of them won't pay for it. But in the short term it is helpful. Say you come into the doctor's office not feeling well. The doctor doesn't know what the problem is so the doctor orders labs and uses the zoo code. Every procedure big and small must have a diagnosis code attached. Later the diagnosis of pernicious anemia (as just one of many examples) can be added to your chart. It gets crazy when old diagnoses are not marked as ""resolved.""

Having transsexualism and/or gender dysphoria allows the pharmacy to fill HRT prescriptions (everything must have a diagnosis).

Most doctors who practiced medicine before the ACA loathe ICD10 and find it ridiculous.
>High risk bisexual behavior

Is the risk lower when you use condoms?
How bout R46.1: Bizarre Personal Appearance?
I wonder how it will affect insurances paying for it if it's not a ""disease""
Clarification. It started rollout in 2022 with a 5-year transitional period.

Also, the change for trans is going from the name transsexualism to gender incongruence. And along with that it was moved from the section on psychiatric disorders to the section sexual health.
ICD 11 is brand new and many countries have a few years until they are ready to start using it
*initial* encounter???
That would actually be accurate!
I mean from a medical/insurance standpoint, this will always be the case.  The whole reason HRT and other stuff is covered by many plans is because they recognize it is a legitimate mental health issue for those who can’t transition.

Re-read this in the context of the problem being your AGAB.  That’s what you’re being insured to address.
Whenever we don't want our medical treatment covered by insurance lol. 

Insurance will always require a diagnosis if you're asking them to pay for a medication.
You're missing the forest for the trees. From medical/insurance's stance, it IS a medical problem (aka something that needs treatment). If it wasn't a problem, why would insurance cover it?

Don't be insulted, there's a big difference between an insurance company diagnosing it as a medical problem and some random DRUMPF or TERF saying trans people are a problem.
Condition is medical jargon (for medically whats up with this person), and problem here seems to be: ""Condition Identified"". It's definitely cold and callous wording.
I personally dont mind if a doctor uses it, as they’re using it in a clinical setting and no harm is meant by it
I thought that the term “transsexualism” wasn’t used anymore in the medical industry. Or maybe I’m thinking of the DSM-V and not insurance codes.
Why don’t you like the term transsexual? Transgender people don’t change the gender they ID as, they transition sexually, no?
...that's not a sexuality
why does the doc have to say it tho?? Like rub it in your face?? ""hehe you'll never have FEMALE LUNGS"" like wtf   
You can have my lungs :)
Heads up, pronoun typo
I hate being trans, I'd rather be cis and be actually born as a girl
user flairs
Basically just press on your own profile in the comment and press change user flair
But it is a problem. To me at least. I'm so angry I wasn't born the sex I want.
The best part is medical care has become political AND corporate, so you get hit with the cheap side of claims and being told your job is mutilation.
Not that its an illness but if u have gender dysphoria in an ideal world healthcare should pay for everything you need to become the gender that you see yourself as. We dont live in an ideal world tho. We live in a fucking hellhole
New challenge throw a turtle at someone.
What do you mean, I'm not supposed to treat ICD 10 codes as an achievement list? Fuck you, I'm getting that Platinum Trophy!
J0N.4H: Ingested by whale
They are lumped together.
Lol yes. Very real. And yes I do accept that I am at a higher risk for STIs because I do not have a monogamous sex life.
The codes are dated and updating them across all hospitals is unlikely. 

But basically if you have sex with multiple people you do have more risk of std then strictly mono folks. 

The term was used back when bisexual were thought of as sexual deviants. Evil gay shizz. 

It’s wrong but that’s the history.
Yep it is a real ICD code. I'm not complaining because insurance has not questioned why I get more STI tests in 1 year than some people get in a life time. (4 times a year, every 3 months. I have also met people who have never tested before in their life)
Different code
Nope they are all very real codes that medical facilities can send to insurance companies for reimbursement. A lot of times insurance companies will ask for a code before granting approval for treatment or a test. Like the doctor wants to order an x ray the insurance is like but why are you ordering an xray and the doctor can put in the order that the person was struck by a turtle and file W59.22XA as the reason for the xray. 

For some reason insurance companies think medical providers just order things for the LOLs
Probably not. Its ICD codes so they're used to justify medical spending. The end result would be the same, you probably need an xray.
Eyyy someone does medical coding lol
You increase your risk every time you sleep with an additional person. So someone who has sex with 5 different people in 1 year has a higher chance of catching an STI than someone who sleeps with just one person in one year. Unprotected sex is riskier than safe sex. There will always be some level of risk if you engage in sex. Even if you are in a closed monogamous marriage, your partner could cheat on you and introduce an infection. While only sleeping with one person your entire life is usually the lowest level of STI risk you can have, shit happens. Having unprotected sex increases your risk. Having unprotected sex with multiple people increases your risk even more.
oml that would be put in my chart so fast
It's still in the ICD, just in a different section under a different name. It means that you may be rejected by psychiatrists if you request one on the basis of being trans, but insurance or government-funded free healthcare should still apply.
It’s moved under “conditions related to sexual health” and the diagnosable code is changed to “Gender Incongruence”… it replaces both dysphoria and transsexualism codes. The recommended treatment for Gender Incongruence is gender affirmation therapy which can include HRT, surgery, etc.
Can confrim, here in Ireland all clinicians still use the ICD 10 as well as the DSM 5. As a student nurse I've only been told about these two as well so this is my first time hearing about the ICD 11
The Orca apologised and they became friends afterwards.
Initial encounter is basically what directly happened because of the bite, subsequent encounter would be anything that arises down the line due to the injury
As opposed to subsequent encounters, like [when you're struck by a duck](https://icdlist.com/icd-10/W61.62XD).
I've heard somewhere when you don't want it to be seen as a problem/issue the the insurance will cover nothing and you need pay everything on your own
you got it, the DSM has moved on but insurance is glacially slow to change
Yeah. That was what I thought, but the doctors who were leading the teaching session chose to use it still and blew me off when I said something.
Because it's not a sexuality and the term transsexual makes people conflate the two.
Transexual is often used by transmedicalists/truscum like you aren’t really trans unless you are transexual. I am seeking to medically transition, but the language has been co-opted by what are basically the “pick-me” trans people. 

Transgender is more inclusive language anyways, transexual is a sub-population that not all trans people belong to, and as such is the safer term to use anyways. It is somewhat necessary for insurance and they seem to think it is important to use it in doctor speak, but they will wind up using it with trans people completely oblivious to the connotations.
Yeah I was pissed, he was very against trans but then since the appointment was super long he asked questions and after I told him I only transitioned because it was that or blow my brains out he changed his tone and even teared up. It was a bit strange I won't lie

*also* thank you for your lungs. I will be coming to extract them soon 😇
Thanks.  He didn't change his name, or want to be gendered differently. So it's been hard to catch myself when it feels like I care more than he does lol
Cool! Thank you ❤
I never knew this, thank you!
Oh sweet!
Wow
Never knew that
[deleted]
But it’s in how you read it… since most of my colleagues think that being transgender is „sick,“ „unnatural,“ etc… they see it as a problem…

I of course came out after I heard them all speak… so big foot in mouth Moment for them, they saw me as one of the guys…

I digress… me… it’s not a problem… it’s a diagnosis with a medical solution. 

I don’t understand what it doesn’t say diagnosis or diagnostic code, or billing code. 

To label it „problem“ makes no sense.
Agreed
I’ve hit many turtle shell sniper shots in MarioKart
If the turtle is bisexual too, what code is that?
Pinocchio syndrome
Not necessarily because there is also high risk heterosexual behavior (Z72.51) and high risk homosexual behavior (Z72.52) so it isn’t really because bisexuals were thought of as deviants
Oh, geez 🤦🏻‍♀️

YeH, like being bi has nothing to do with high risk sexual behavior. 

This sounds like when my mom used to seem to think bi people had to have sex with both men and women
This is standard for those of us in the US Navy lol
Are you not using protection tho? Like that’s at least moderately avoidable lol
I've worked for doctors that ordered any number of unnecessary procedures and labs. Some doctors state that doing so reassures the ""worried well"" the MRI showed nothing abnormal. The last doctor I worked for did it for extra reimbursement. Like repeated labs for patients that were under the care of other specialties such as cardiology or hematology- and labs other providers refused to do. Such as ordering a test for the JAK2 mutation for a patient whose other labs were sufficient to diagnose secondary polycythemia. The patient was a smoker and refused to use their cpap at night.  Both obstructive sleep apnea and smoking can cause secondary polycythemia. And guess what? The JAK2 mutation was negative. But this allowed the doctor to bill the insurance company for a much higher level visit to address the complex medical issues. (That were being sufficiently addressed by hematology) Don't even get me started on how many doctors have financial interests or outright own labs.

So yeah. I will never again work in health care. Literally made me sick all day long to see stuff like this. We think of insurance companies as evil but sometimes they are our last defense against doctors like this.
Did! Used to! Not anymore. Lol
Idk about elsewhere but in the US (insurances here are still using ICD 10 at the moment) mental health practitioners haven’t been able to bill for any of the F64 codes as a stand-alone diagnosis or a primary diagnosis for quite a while because we’re not really treating the dysphoria/incongruence… instead treating accompanying things like anxiety, depression, trauma responses. 

I freaking hate the way the systems are set up with it for mental health anyway. It’s all about pathologizing everything. According to insurance you can’t come to therapy because you’re stressed out and don’t want it to grow into anything bigger… or because you just lost a loved one and need some support…. Wellness and preventative codes aren’t a thing in the mental health section and to me that’s just poor forethought on the part of insurance companies. 

Like do you wanna pay for 5-10 outpatient sessions to help this person get through a couple stressful months or do you want to pay for a whole inpatient stay, and then step down care, and then outpatient, after they hit a breaking point because they didn’t get the support they needed?

I mean most people who seek mental health services are probably going to meet criteria for something because of how general some of the diagnoses are… but I don’t think it should have to be that way.

Then again I’m just a tiny cog in the machine that is the American Medical-Industrial complex… trying to be a squeaky wheel, though.
Yeah it makes sense, if someone says it’s not a problem then there’s no reason insurance should cover it.

This is one of the reasons it does matter to distinguish between people that experience gender dysphoria versus those who don’t, even though we are all trans.  Many have a legitimate and urgent need to be covered to address mental health risks, whereas if someone says they are perfectly happy as their AGAB there is limited reason for insurance to cover it.
People tend to insinuate that this is all a kink so the term transsexual is very upsetting I think.
Transsexual actually refers to biological sex, physically/hormonally changing the body to resemble the other sex. Many people argue the term is outdated, but there are plenty of older people who openly identify as transsexual and live as the opposite sex.
That was my initial worry with it, why I didn’t like it. Makes it sound like it has something to do with sex, even though sex obviously has two very different meanings 

Though now I don’t like transgender either, even less, as “gender” means different things that may not apply.
I just use “trans” because cis people don’t know or care about the differences anyway.
Can I also get your lungs or- are you just taking my lungs and adding to your lung capacity 😭
Me too, just commenting to try to do it too. He he he

Thanks ppl.
The Longing's a great game
<3
Im just tired of being treated like a subhuman :(
Whre your friends at?
My guess is the code goes both ways?
That's a bit of a personal question don't  you think? But yes, I'm a big supporter of safe sex. Even with condoms every additional person you add increases the risk. Condoms can break. Condoms don't protect against everything (herpes).
It's just so much ""fun"" explaining to people that while yes your doctor wants you to have this procedure and you want this procedure, the insurance company has decided it doesnt feel the procedure is necessary so you will have no coverage. Your options are pay your self or go without. 

American Healthcare is so fucked up
“Many people argue the term is outdated”

“But there are plenty of OLDER people who openly identify as transsexual”

Read your comment again very slowly

Note the words: Outdated and Older 

It’s outdated, that’s why OLDER people only continue to use it.
many young people ID as transsexual too
Yes, soon I will have 250% lung capacity 🎃🎃
Same!
im commenting to try it too
Yup same
I was thinking the same thing
I know. And I completely understand. Ideally we'd do a bit of therapy just to make sure it's what we want, then transition freely, but the world is broken and money rules everything.
If this is a reference I don’t know it lol
Best comment yet on this thread.  I tip my hat to you.
I don't wear hats...  So I I point the foot of my cane at you.
Oh for sure it’s a personal question, it was more on the rhetorical side. I think I was just surprised by how it’s every 3 months like clockwork. I’m far too anxious to be meeting that many strangers hahah, hookups always sound nice to me in theory, but the actual meeting up is nerve wracking. Although now I’m monogamous and it doesn’t matter anyway
Used to be part of my job. Not anymore. I quit and I'll never go back.
Plenty of people still use it and still like to use it. We shouldn't try to police that.
With transgender being defined as ""anyone that does not identity with their AGAB"" I think some people are now using it to emphasize that their issues are not with their identity but their body. In some alternate world where I was somehow assigned MtF at birth I'd be cisgender by this definition but I'd still be transsexual.
I’m here for the same thing 👀
Its bc mariokarts shells tend to turn friends into enemies
Fun fact, not strangers. I have had fwb situations lasting over 5 years now.
What we are seeing here is the same thing we see with so many similar things: there will never ever be a universal consensus on specific terminology. Some people will find certain things horribly offensive while others will prefer that same thing. Some people will take a lack of deliberate inclusive language as a personal attack and others won’t care because they understand generalizations are never actually a complete and total blanket statement. 

IMO I think a lot of people could stand to base their judgements off intent, rather than taking things 100% literally at face value. 

Like I’m not going to blink if a cis companion says ‘lady bits’ in specific reference to her genitals, because I’m well aware that’s the case for like 98-99% of women and it’s obviously not an attack on me for being different in that regard. But I’ve seen people, at least on the internet, go into a long winded diatribe about how awful that same example is because some women have a penis and how hurt they are by it and I’m just like… yo chill out, that wasn’t about you and we all know there are exceptions. 

Or - to use a less controversial example - when straight women vent about the woes of dating and shitty things boys are prone to doing… and some dude has to come in and be like ‘well not ALL men!’ Like obviously not all men, but enough of them that a generalization is warranted, and the exceptions understand fully that it doesn’t universally apply to every single person.
Ohhhhh ok I only really played by myself against ai and only occasionally with friends 
😅
Huh. I just would’ve expected that to mitigate std risk if it’s the same people every time
Lol
I think your caught up in thinking there are levels. In terms of medical jargon there is only standard levels of risk and high risk. There is no in between. It's sad but kind of funny that a lot of insurance and what not will require pregnancy testing on all sexually active women. This has led to stories of women married to other AFAB people trying to explain they don't need a pregnancy test. But in the eyes of insurance all sex can lead to pregnancy for AFAB people.
Not necessarily. If you're having sex with multiple people, they might also be having sex with multiple people, all open and consenting, no problem, but the risk is still there. Good to know that you're clean and find out ASAP if you're not. My big yikes (that I'm sure was a yikes for you too u/PaxonGoat) is always hearing that there are people who have never tested. 

That's fucked up. If you have sex with one partner, make sure you're both tested so you know. If you have sex with anybody new, get tested again.
Ah I see, interesting. Yeah I took “high risk” to be more of a measurement/scale.

And I get that. I’m ftm, and I was required to get a pregnancy test before they would start me on hormones, despite there absolutely not being a chance. The medical system is fucked up sometimes
I mean there are definitely people who seem to actively ignore the risk but I was more thinking about some of my coworkers who went on to marry the person they started dating when they were 15. STI testing is very unheard of in purity culture and people who wait until marriage to have sex.
I get that. I suppose I just have never heard of such consistent diagnosis aha. I feel like I’d be panicked if I ever got an STD and close my sexual circles wayy down. But that’s also likely due to society telling us std’s are “dirty”/“impure”. Thanks for this conversation. I think I need to look at my attitude just a bit more.

I will be getting tested next month though. Doctor told me to wait 6 months after my last partner before becoming monogamous, then test, and we’re good after that as long as it’s negative!
The stigma is real! It's crazy, too, because obviously being afraid of it and choosing to avoid finding out is way worse than just getting checked and then being able to treat anything you might have. NBD to get tested, but a very big deal to not get tested and unintentionally contribute to the Chalmydia epidemic in a lot of young people :\\
6 months is a bit of a wait. Usually 3-4 months is how long it takes for HIV to show up on standard tests. The problem with testing too soon is the risk of false negatives. Tests are definitely improving. There are also rapid HIV tests now that show infections within a month of transmission. Testing is definitely important for anyone who is sexually active. Its possible to have an infection and have zero symptoms."	yr6bzv	trans	2946	0.99	2022-11-10 05:28:05
Does anyone else get dysphoria when they put their hair up? It's mostly in pictures for me but when I put my hair up sometimes I feel like I don't pass and I've had people tell me I do pass no matter what but idk how to get over it.		"Oh you're mtf, I legitimately could not tell until I looked into your profile.
I see a woman in the photo. The hair up is perfectly fine.
Yep, it just highlights my hairline 😭😭
I think it’s because when you put your hair up, it seems like you have short hair. Short hair is a stereotype for men and that’s the only think you see
You are adorable. I wish I had hair. I'm going to have to use a wig ;)
I completely know what you mean and what are you talking about but girl.. you have beautiful face and you completely pass, your face shape is absolutely cis-like too for me! I think that hairstyle suits you by the way ♥️
You look amazing
Get outta here lol jk you 100% pass to me! I love the outfit btw
You pass fine. You have a very feminine face and your hair compliments it well. 

If you wanted to do something to look more feminine when you have your hair up (although I really do not think you need to do anything) you could always get your ears pierced. It is a bit of a commitment though, as they take a long while to heal.
I don’t really have any advice on how to get over your dysphoria, but I didn’t know you were trans until I read the title and saw what sub this was posted to.

And honestly, I covered everything except for your head and TRIED to see you as anything other than a woman, and I couldn’t. 

You pass. Hands down, you absolutely do. You remind me of a beautiful ballerina.
I had to check what I sub I was in, thought it was r/outfits

You definitely pass with your hair up.
Girl you absolutely pass lol I don’t think you could even look like a male if you tried
Wait you *aren't* afab?
Girl you pass so damn well
Maybe try two little braids, or pigtails to tie your hair back? It could help by trying decorative ways of styling your hair up, or using cute hair clips to combat the dysphoria. I think you look great anyways, but using accessories while having your hair up will keep it looking feminine 🙂
I'm having a legit hard time believing your amab. Your hair looks great up or down, and that outfit is out of this world.
You’ve got nothing to worry about! You totally pass. You need to start believing that you are a woman. You’re not passing as a woman you are a woman. Know that in your heart and it will come through in your presence.
You look feminine af with your hair up, it's just your mind being mean to you! You are very pretty!

This guy I've been seeing said that he likes my hair down more. It definitely stung a little even though it wasn't meant as an insult. Now I have a hard time putting my hair up around him.
Yes I avoid ponytails and buns bc they always look masc on me
Try braiding it over your shoulder. Keeps it out of your face and looks cute as well! 😊
I feel like I pass better with my hair up. But I think I just don't like my current hair style.
I think you pass really well
I’m ftm and when I pull my hair back I think I look totally female, I’m a year on T and look make with my hair as I do it. It’s just one of those things if we are reminded of how we used to look just a bit it feels like that’s our face again
You look great. Svelte with romantic wispy hair in both pictures. 

One thing that’s great about a fem “updo” or “messy bun” type style is that you can pull little teeny strands out of it to frame your face… nobody ever questions that your hair is actually long, and women-attracted people maybe start wondering just how messy your beautiful hair can be… point is, it’s on-point for women’s fashion and can be very attractive. 

Keep doing what you’re doing, OP. Your comfort and confidence are the most important thing.
Pretty x
hey friend! sis women have this too. has nothing to do with gender, just how each individual decides how they want to portray themselves. sometimes girlier down hairstyles, sometimes more severe up hair style. you have the whole palette to paint with and i hope you have fun with it! you're gorgeous!
I only like my hair up when I'm wearing makeup or if it's up in a high bun. Otherwise it looks off
I hate with boiling blood putting my hair up. It only highlights my edgy jawline, dysphoria be damned
I saw someone say you’re a woman which is good because otherwise I’d be insulting you to say you just look like a woman. 

You’re expression in both…I’d like to see a more neutral mouth position, but other than that you just look like an attractive woman.
I get anxious over dumb stuff too. It's normal, dysphoria is a bitch. You pass 100% and I would definitely date you haha. I'm MtF also
I'll be that girl.
 Time, baby, time!
 Find some solice in this time, we all know it can be stupid-hard. And, if I were a letter you wrote to your future self, or selves, as it may be, I would tell you - you are perfect- right here, right now.
You are the future, what I couldn't be at that age, and those of us with jaded eyes are depending on you. 😁No pressure ☺️
Stay the course, young lady ~💙💜🤍
U look incredible!!
Its that thing that happens during transition, we become our own worst critic because you have seen yourself the most.

You definitely pass, I can't wait for the day (if it happens) that I pass too
You look amazing, but I definitely don’t when I have my hair up I look so guyish.
You’re so beautiful and pass very well, I promise :)
Paradoxically my baldness causes severe dysphoria with my hair pulled back, but I feel like my face looks less feminine when I pull my hair forward into my face. 

But yeah you pass
Same but also…… you’re really pretty
Your beautiful with your hair up
Me too, i feel ugly with my hair up idk why
You literally look amazing with your hair up?
You are a lady.
1. You look great sweetie!!

2. I tied my first ponytail, but left my bangs untied for an 80’s style thing, it looked so good, but thats my preference
Omg u have no idea plus I have hair that trails down my neck I can't wait to laser it off to atleast makes me feel a little  better about putting my hair up
I love your hair up. Dw you definitely pass lovely. I also love your outfit, it's super cute!
You 100% pass, you’re very pretty!
I feel the same way sometimes, especially at work when I have to wear a hairnet over it. I've resorted to leaving a few dangly bits out of the ponytail and just kinda framing my face with them.
Honestly I feel worse with it down currently. The way it frames my face makes my jaw stand out and look wider. I think I look more femme with it up in a bun with a cute hairband right now. 

You look gorgeous! Rock it girl! Sending trans sister love your way! 💜
Bold of you to assume I even know how to lol

(In all seriousness though, I just see a girl in these images - you pass perfectly!)
TBH I think you look better with your hair up. Gives you that femme french vibe.
you look fine, but if you're nervous about it maybe try different ""hair up"" styles? braids, buns, etc
Your eyes are very feminine
Coming from an Internet stranger who has no reason to lie to you, you absolutely do pass. You actually remind me a lot of my cis friend from high school, it’s so weird, I thought you *were* her until I checked the sub.
I 💯 get that myself, i end up forcing myself to let my hair down cause of that same reason
Sweetie, you pass and you are a beautiful looking female 🥰
Yeah it shows how evilly disgusting my hairline is
You’re beautiful and actually I get some euphoria w my hair cut or put up

But you really look gorgeous
Girl you look like a girl. Your dysphoria is being a bitch and is basically being an ass. I experienced dysphoria in the past but nowadays not so much. It's basically because people treat me as a guy. And I also go to men's bathrooms am trying to get money to buy some private shit for more gender confirmation and other shit. Because I have to wait anyway for the other shit. Also because my body works in a way that make me euphoric. Also there is vagina shit you can buy to hide your private part and then there is other shit if you're not done with surgeries and shit
Definitely still passing. You look great!
you look fine to me.
You pass so well
100% ... when I pull my hair back I feel like I look like a male [Hoosier](https://youtu.be/Unwus_iwdSE) from South St. Louis County. :(
You look absolutely beautiful
i get it too, id bet it's pretty common
Dang your cute didn’t even realize you were mtf.
I feel you on that. But there's something about putting your hair up that screams femininity. Because ever since I started doing it basically daily at work I haven't been misgendered once (I work retail).
Wait you’re mtf?? Yeah for sure you pass I had no idea you were amab until I saw the comments! Props to you bestie 🙌
You look great girl. No question
I have always hated putting my hair up with a fiery passion my whole life.  Never figured out it was actually due to gender dysphoria until I finally learned that I am trans lol.
Looks quite lovely
You are so pretty! Your the kind of pretty I aspire to be when I feel fem!(I'm gender flux)
I have the same thought when I put my hair up, it's like it goes from long and feminine to short and masculine. But that said, you look perfectly feminine to me, and I'm probably more feminine than I think. We tend to have harsher biases when looking at ourselves than how we see others
Remember: we judge ourselves, and look at ourselves more harshly than the people around us. Scrolled through my feed and stopped when I saw your photo... I would do a double take in public as well... You're a beautiful woman, you are gorgeous, didn't even think twice about that
Gurl,u look so fkn goood.
this gives me ballerina vibes, you look so pretty!
My mom tells me to put my hair up all the time and I hate it for the EXACT same reason that you do. Thank you for posting this!
Girl you pass, like I don't think people clocking you at all
I definitely know that feeling but I really don’t think you have to worry about it at all
Sometimes a nice tied up hairstyle like a plat or a nice high ponytail, or having stands of hair down or a loose bob or messy bun can be 10x more feminine than just hair down.
Mine is mostly whenever i see my round ass face tbh i just cant see my face be feminine no matter what i do
Girl, you look fantastic. If I saw you IRL I'd assume afab/cis.
First off I thought you where afab. Secondly you’re firkin beautiful omggggg!!!!
By multiple people Ive been told that when I have my hair in a ponytail and have a jacket around my waist I look like a girl from behind. That made me feel good
I see a girl with her hair up
Honestly I’m a cis girl and I used to get dysphoria over putting my hair up, I was 7 so I just cried about it.
Maybe Tyler down a little on both sides. I do that and I feel way better
I most certainly do. I am pre everything but I’ve been growing my hair out over the year and I usually feel best when it’s up in a bun or pony tail. It’s helped a lot glad to know it’s helped others ♥️
You have a very feminine neck. I’d show that off if I was you.
Bruh, you good, you remind me of a student I know, never would’ve thought you’re trans. Also,  nice hair
To those in your life being discouraging and saying ""you don't pass"", try your best to brush it off and keep telling yourself you do. I didn't have to dive into your profile or anything, you're without a doubt a women and completely pass as a women in the photos I see here. 

As for the hair, you're going to tie your hair up many times in your life so I wouldn't worry too much about how it looks tbh. I would suggest maybe practicing low and high buns and just learn some more of those hair styles to try and get more comfortable with it. 

I hope this helps, much love and good luck on your journey! ❤

Edit: spelling, punctuation etc.
You could perhaps add some decorations to help your dysphoria. But honestly you pass 100% keep being awesome
I legit did not know you where trans until I saw the subreddit. Congrats, you won transitioning! ❤️
You pass with flying colors. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
You pass so well!! I didn’t even know I was on r/trans I thought it was just a photos sub you’re hair looks good idk what else to say because I’m a trans dude and I have short hair but you 100% pass so well dang
Have you tried putting it into a high ponytail that's slightly to the side? You'd still see your hair while having it up so maybe it wouldn't be as dysphoric? It might even work well if you have a few small stands out in the front with the rest of your hair up.
I'm not sure if I understood what you said about ""hair up"" (English isn't my native language), but you pass 1000000000%. I had to check if you are really trans xD

You are really beautiful
Not even trying to be nice but you pass 100%
When I saw this my gut reaction was “she looks pretty.” Then I saw the post title and went “what is she worried about? She looks beautiful.”
Those people are right -- you could shave your head and still pass, tbh 😁 You look super pretty and feminine with your hair up!

I think the dysphoria is something that will only improve with a lot of time, y'know? Older trans and gnc people always tell me that the longer you've lived authentically and the more complete your transition becomes (by your own terms, of course -- transition means different things for different people and everyone's experience is valid), the more those insecurities quieten down.

I hope you get to feel as beautiful as you look to the rest of us soon, OP 💜
i wouldnt doubt for a second that youre a woman with your hair up or down
You look fine no matter what and you are always you. Please don't worry about it!
Yeah I have the same problem, I always leave my hair down
I mean... idk, I heard that transgender people often see themselves as AGAB, even tho they pass...

Cause you do and if you think you don't, it's just your brain messing with you. I bet that if you just went out into town, no one would misgender you.

Comparing this photo to the others on your profile, I have the impression that this is the one you look best on, but it's just my opinion.
I'm ftm and I fear cutting my hair short cause putting it up causes me dysphoria. I feel like it looks like I'm bald looking. Maybe I just hate my head shape? No idea. No offense to those who are bald. Also I know that long haired guys exist and are valid/normal etc., I just want to appear male and with my big female looking body, the long hair reads fem.
You look like my aunt, so I’d say you pass
Yea i do
Ok if in real life you look like in the pic, you pass 11000%! If I'd meet you somewhere I'd think ""Oh my... What a pretty girl!""
You 100% look like a woman.
I’m a cis woman and I feel like I look more masculine when my hair is back. I think most everyone does? You’re beautiful
I get dysphoric occationally because i cant put my hair back when I do things, hair is weird. You look good with it up though!
I have the same thing and I hear you, but looking from the outside, you look perfect, not a question, complete passing.
Your hair is very pretty like that. You pass sis. ❤️
You look awesome! Maybe you can leave some front strands untied to make it even more feminine? It looks pretty :)
Maybe you should try to make a bun (use a donut if you don't have enough hair).
Well.

A) you pass and are adorable.

B) I feel the same way. I often do a half pony as a way to keep my hair up but also show off the long femme locks.
For some reason, i hate having it down 😵 I always put it up in some way. I feel more dysphoric, idc why tbh 🤔 It's also more practice for eating and everyday stuffz x3
I’m… confused. Are you NB or something? But, why would you care about how you do your hair? You honestly just look like a cis woman to me, sorry if I’m not really getting the point. You look beautiful either way, totally wear your hair up.
I had to reread the caption several times before I realized you were mtf. Girl you look great, no need to worry! 👍
I'm the opposite... Putting my hair up makes me feel good about my appearance! I mean, ik I don't pass well, but that's not necessarily my objective at this time. 

I'm just now getting used to my new gender expression after 3 decades of denial/trans & homophobia/toxic Self-deprecation. My time will come.

Don't be so hard on yourself miss! I think you pass wonderfully 💖
I’m like 90% I knew another girl that look exactly like you so I honestly didn’t even realize you were mtf at first
it's the opposite for me because my neck is smaller now compare to before with muscle
uhhhhhhh i thought you looked cis

but i also get that feeling about my face sometimes? even tho it’s actually kinda feminine
You definitely pass, but I feel the same wayyyyyy. I think for me it is triggering because my face is ""framed"" more like it used to be as a guy. Long hair also covers up much of my jaw line. You're beautiful, trust your friends :)
Your feelings are valid but you totally pass and I've seen cis women who look just like you. Maybe the reason you don't think so is that you've been seeing your own face for all your life so you can only associate it with how you looked before, but to someone who has never seen you before you just look like an ordinary woman.
Haha... You pass EXTREMELY well... People like you (compliment) make me extremely jelous and hopeless. Ill never look this good or pass this much.
I feel similarly, but thats cos it highlights my hairline and jawline more 😭
Honey, you pass. You literally look like most girls I went to school with
Me too. I never put my hair up but I am afraid I will have to for my new job. I am not out yet
I feel the same way. I have to work with my hair up and it just makes my skin crawl.
But I can honestly say you pass with your hair up.
You look great 👄
Um, girl. You are legit fucking gorgeous. Don't let that dysphoria tell you otherwise. I truly mean that and am not just saying it to be nice.
I seriously couldn’t tell until I read the message, you pass, you’re completely valid and very pretty!
Idk if it’ll help but in the few times I put mine up I try to leave some around the sides to kinda frame the face, maybe it’ll help you feel better
Yes, I dislike my hairline and it reminds me of when my hair was short. The only time I ever have it up is during a race for track or cross country
I'm the opposite! I feel as if I pass way worse with my hair DOWN, and other people seem to agree. I don't know what it is, but it's the ponytail life for me.
You look like a woman. Hands down. 100%. Super adorable. I think you look great with your hair up and should do it as often as you like. :)
U passssss
You do pass! I wouldn't have noticed if I didn't check the whole post. And, answering your question, I do get extremely dysphoric when I put my hair up. :/
Girl you pass without question, you have a wonderful look about you and great feminine facial structure. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
yeah, i have long hair and i despise how i look when i put it up
This may sound silly but, if you put your hair up at least once a day and tell yourself in the mirror that you are a beautiful woman, eventually you will start to believe it. It may take a long time but it has worked for other people.
I’ve had it done a few times, but now I’ve started to have my hair done by my friend in class, I will say, no matter how you have your hair, you are beautiful, and we will all support you no matter what!
I think you look great with your hair up it really suits you, I hope you'll feel more comfortable in the future and have it like that more often :)
Absolute stunner, lovely. All I see is GOALS 😊
Even when I presented as a woman,  I would feel like I looked like a man when I put my hair up hahah. Guess thats just the feminine experience. Lots of my girl friends felt the same!
you look very feminine to me!
stop you pass 100% maybe putting the hair on your shoulder will help more for your dysphoria ?
Classy and classic. 👌 Dys is a legit b*tch but you look delicate and feminine and pass just right.
I think we just get used to trying to hide our entire face under lengthy hair for dysphoria reasons lol
I thought I saw Elle Fanning. I had scroll back up. Girl I didn't even know you're trans!
Idk if this helps, but as a cisgender woman I always feel like I look like a little boy when I have my hair back in a low pony. But then I remind myself that's just societies stupid voice getting in my head. Hyper femininity is not a requirement to be a woman THANK THE FUCKING GODS.
For what its worth, you look like a cis friend I know. She is always throwing her hair up like that.
[deleted]
Uggg wish my arms were like that!! Tooo masculine 😖
You are pretty. I personally really like your hair!
i genuinely thought you were ftm but didnt know until i looked at the comments
[removed]
You're beautiful darling!
Not that looks matter, but your face looks great with your hair up :)
Girl you pass better than anything I didn't even notice you were a trans woman!!
You pass 100% and having your hair up really suits u :)
Wanna start of by saying I’m cis so this might not be the most useful. And I believe you pass hands down - but what I belive and what others believe won’t necessarily change what you believe. So here’s my advice: for me, growing up looking like your dad and older brother was real annoying, especially when both have longer and silkier hair than you - but I digress. I used to put cute little bows, clips, and other hair accessories in my hair to kinda make me look different then my older brother lol. I’d braid scarves or ribbons into my hair, I’d tie a ribbon around my ponytail, I’d add a headband-bow, and if all else failed I’d use as scrunchie. There’s not much you can do to your hair to make it more feminine without it looking childish in my opinion but hopefully this helps. You’re beautiful and don’t need it, but I know sometimes our mind betrays is and makes us feel differently.
I used to, but for the past year it's switched to being euphoric. I also noticed way more changes from HRT this past year (after switching from pills to injections) than ever before so maybe for me it's just a fat redistribution in my face thing. I hope that it's just a matter of time for you too, no real advice this used to drive me nuts. you look great, either way!
You look so good, girl!!!
Damn if I saw you in public I wouldn't be able to tell at all that you're trans
It might not make you feel better cause like, dysphoria doesn't follow logic, but I work in food service AND I'm a STEM major, so I see a lot of women with their hair up all the time. I'm not sure if it's a weird thing to say but I follow a lot of like, selfie sub reddits, so just scrolling I thought you were just a cis girl taking a cute photo. I didn't think twice about it or anything.
OK FOLKS HERE WE GO - see your fly always? LOVE THEM, they know what’s up! Here’s whatcha gonna do:
1) comb your hair with a center part and comb your hair straight out (instead of back. Ex. If the center line represents your part from above, the front should look more like a ‘T’than an ‘m’..if..that..makes…any…sense) 

2) GENTLY shake your head a little bit and notice which hairs naturally fall forward at the side of your face/wanna go back from whence they came. Grave them. There shouldn’t much hair, like enough to hold between two fingers. This is the hair you wanna cut. 

3) tie back the rest of the hair that you don’t want to cut.

4) remembers those flyaways that if you’re anything like me, are STILL making an appearance? BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL GLORIOUS GENIUSES use’m as guides for length. Go two, hell even three inches longer (giving you more hair after you cut) and do a rough cut BELOW that estimate. GIVE YOURSELF AS MUCH ROOM AS YOU PLEASE. 

5) Put on some music, light a candle, make it about you cuz it’s fun. 

6) get a comb (or a brush if you’re chaotic like me 👍👍) and comb down to that 2”-3” line you mentally established earlier

7) hold the scissors up and down and do a little bit of each side at a time. Have fun, take your time. Also the way Vivi from One Piece is like… PERFECT OMG

Thassit!
You look like you passed to me
You pass soooo well!! I definitely get that and dysphoria can be so crippling but I just want you to know that you pass totally and completely
You're Gorgeous Dear! Even GOD won't notice you are trans😙☺️& im Pretty sure HE doesn't mind at all! 😙cos HE make sure that He put Sugar'& Spice'& Everything Nice' when HE made you💜  so Your Good trust it😉 sending you LOVE&LIGHT🍀⭐
You go girl
 I  understand that dysphoria isn't always rational, and you cant help it.  Our dumb brains be jerks sometimes.  I think you look great withy our hair up!  I hope that helps a little.
Well I can imagine that could happen if it makes your hair look shorter, but that's definitely all in your head
You look very pretty!
pretty 😊💕🤗
You look like Emma from The Prom. It’s a  movie on netflix and it was also on broadway
As an FtNB, I often put my hair up to look more masculine, so I think in some circumstances I think it can have a masculinizing look, but honestly you look very feminine to me. So if you’re going for female, you’ve definitely got nothing to worry about there. I don’t think I’d even clock you as trans if I met you in the street.
You can’t tell trust me but I know how you feel I never put my hair outta my face
Our minds get used to our patterns, and a good way to break your way of thinking is happiness. This is not a ""just be happy"" thing that I'm talking about. If putting your hair up makes you feel dysphoric, find something to do that you feel better doing with your hair up and feel the laughter and smiles when you get them in those moments. Too often, we rob ourselves of joy by thinking those sensations are simply fleeting.

By the way, you don't just pass, you excel. Keep doing you, girl. 🖤
Nope all’s good you look amazing
I’m ftm and I can assure you putting your hair back doesn’t look masculine, I used to try that but I got misgendered more than when it was left down XD 

You look beautiful, and that’s a really cute feminine looking hairstyle!
you DEFINITELY pass, seriously
Saaame I want pigtails so bad but I'll never have the face to pull it off I feel like
Firstly: ya look fantastic! Secondly: I hear you, I feel the same but opposite. I'm ftm and recently grew my hair out again, I still pass even with the long hair but when I pull it into a bun at home I get super dysphoric. I know I think it makes me look like a girl because that's the image I've always known, but to anyone else I'm just a guy with long hair.. I'm not so sure it's a hair thing and maybe more that I'm seeing more of my face that I don't like.

Anywho. You're beautiful no mater how you wear your hair. Don't put it up if you don't like it! Also try other hairstyles like some people have said. Long hair is super versatile. You could even pull out little whispies on the sides, to have a little hair on your face!
Yep. Had to go look. Girl you look GREAT and you pass...hands down. You pass
awww
Samesies. I had to double check the sub this was posted in and re-read the title to make sure I was understanding lol

OP you're totally passing and look cute as a button
awww this means so much to me ♥️
I wasn't even thinking about that tbh just when I see my full face makes me think of when my hair was short
noooo 😭
I think that's why I'm feeling like that ur right 😅
Also keeping your hair down gives the illusion that your shoulders are small and frames your face in a way that makes the features appear slimmer and softer!
im sure u are still cute ♥️
Thank you 😊
awww tysm
I was thinking about that!
this almost made me cry thank you so much
I agree with this, I thought it could have been from teenagers sub or a photography one. To me, adorable is the perfect adjective, and you just look feminine, like a girl who is ‘dainty’ (for lack of a better word) so they couldn’t be mistaken for anything else.  
  
But I must admit, I am a 33 y/o cisgender woman, and I feel like that with my hair up too. Last year I cut my hair real short, and it’s growing now so I can finally do something with it, but when it’s all back, I remind myself of my dad (which I hate for multiple reasons). I find that when I do want to put it up, having hair fall around my face helps a lot. Use your “pinchers” and grab a little from around your temples. Or for half up, half down hair, make sure some around your ears falls down. For me personally, I need volume is all. So if I do put it all up, I make sure to have the ponytail not pulled tight to my head, but make it a little loose so there’s a little “bump” on the top of my head. I think this ponytail in your photo is perfect. It’s not too tight, and the part is flattering. Maybe bring the pony tail around one shoulder, or curl it or learn to braid? You could frame your face good with french braids. I read you can’t braid, & I can’t yet either, but I know there are youtube tutorials. You could also consider bangs, I think you’d look cute with bangs. I think you look pretty af now though!  
  
Ps; another comment mentioned how they usually do more makeup when they put their hair up. That’s me too, somehow it feels like it look more balanced?
omg thanks haha
I DID A FUCKING SPIT TAKE >///<
aww tysm, I don't know how to do braids yet lol no one in my family has taught me how to girl >//<
aww im sorry that happened im sure he is a good guy though and tysm this means a lot
im sure your adorable!
ooh okay!
awwww tysm that means a lot
this means so muchhh
I was going to add this, it’s like a balance thing I think? If I have a messy “thrown up” style, I feel like adding makeup makes it look more purposeful?
haha thanks im just self conscious about my teeth hehe
aww im sure you do!
I doubt that! ur a cutie!
aww tysm
awwww tysm!
im sure ur cute!
awww thankss
awww tysmmm

You probably look adorable ♥️
thank you very much ♥️
omg I used to do cross country! I miss it so much >//<
this is what I sorta did for my transition and it worked so ill try that too!
awwwww
that's good to know haha

awwww hehehe thank you 😊
This right here.
awwww omg I love her
awwww your so right!
awww thankss
what does that mean? >///<
awww u think they look femme?
awww tysm
awwww hehehe
awwwww you mean it
awww tysm
awww tysm
awww tysm that means so much! its just hard because where others see a female with here hair up i sometimes see my old self but honestly the overwhelming about of positive responses has really made me confident and happy 😊♥️
I feel passing and happy most days its just my mind sometimes goes ""oh wow short looking hair, this must be a man."" but I will probably start injections when I hit 6 months but idk if I should start any sooner? what do you think?
awww
That does mean a lot! It really helps to hear people reference irls situations!!! ♥️
lmao tysm! ♥️
thank you ☺
tysm it does help a lot!
awww tysm
awww tysm
tysm that means a lot
aww tysm ill definitely keep this all in mind ♥️
Your hair up looks fine! It might trigger some past dysphoria but I guarantee you other people cannot see that image. Also no one looks to each other like we look in a mirror, straight on: we are always moving and as such, we look different!
I was like yes, its finally long enough to tie up. Then I saw a mirror 😭😭
I personally really like a couple of lobe piercings + a helix piercing at the top of the ear. I think the anatomy of our ears is pretty different, but I could show you a picture of my ear if you want to see what they look like. :)
😁 I’m so glad! Rock it, girl!
I'm sure there are lots of YouTube tutorials out there to help! I had to look up a YouTube vid to teach me how to use a curling iron, so there's no shame in looking tutorials up lol! Good luck, I know you can do it! ✨
For me it's just that a bun was never a thing I could do before so for me it's always been something I did as a girl. Hair in a ponytail looks like how I combed it back for fun after some showers when it was shorter. Also high ponytails hurt for me so I only so I only really do low (hair is too fine and slippy for mid)
lol I was ever any good at them when I had long hair either, but maybe you could find tutorials online? ik hair type can change how styles look too, so maybe look for what fits your hair best? good luck tho :D
Sweetie, you look soft and feminine. Your physical build speaks female. If I saw you in a store or walking on the street, I would perceive you to be 100% girl. 🥰😍❤️
No prob madam
I think you'd suit a low bun with a nice glittery hair peice and some decent strands hanging down but still connected to the bun. A bit like Triss' hair from Witcher 3 but 1 bun instead of two
😊 You're welcome!
Don’t know what you’re talking about. Can’t tell at all that you’re AMAB, seriously, don’t worry about it.
Thank you! You look pretty as well :)
Mhm, hope it helps!
Agh I just had my last highschool race a few weeks ago T^T hopefully I’ll be able to do it in college though. I already miss it :(
:) you are gorgeous amd I wish you the best!
Just keep doing you, sweetie 😊
oh i see it in the second picture now
Ofc! So jealous, wish I could rock no sleeve like that!!!
It's no problem love!
That’s good! I’m glad the positivity had given you that boost of confidence. My brother has the same issue, he cut his hair really short and has always had long hair. We thought it’d help him look more like a guy but his hair is so curly and it being short just made it more curly he immediately was like “I look like a grandma from the 40s” now thinking of doing either shaved or a Mohawk 😅
that's exactly how I used to feel, the good news is those thoughts/feelings will probably just go away with time!

as far as starting injections that's super up to you, if you aren't afraid of needles and have a doc that listens or are doing DIY I can't recommend the switch enough. I wish I had been on injections this entire time personally, I spent 3 years on the patch and 2 on pills, and this past one on injections has been the  most comfortable I've ever felt in my body.
that's true! tysm
nuuuu
tysm!
oh for sure! ty!!
I'll try it!
hehe thanks
aww i bet so! reddit is not letting me add or dm people but I would very much like to be your friend if your down and want to dm me or add me on my socials!
I will!
haha yeah I also need to learn how to do braids and stuff
awww thanks
ooh that's really good!
Sure! I’ll add you on insta
absolutely i think two french braids would look beautiful
can you do braids by yourself?
ah no i’m trans masc and have like no hair
no no I meant like can I do them without someone needing to help me lol
oh , yeah it might be a little difficult"	r60bt4	trans	2848	0.98	2021-11-30 23:19:06
TIL that Gender Dysphoria is a reason to get a ESA approved (maybe wrong flair? dunno which one to put)		"I wish all *trans people* a very pleasant *emotional support shark*
me walking into the college dorm with my dysphoria supporting ostrich
It seems everyone is qualified? We all have some gender identity so everyone suffers from a disorder apparently.

It seems the cis are at it again
does that mean i can register my BLÅHAJ as an ESA ?
ngl this looks a little dated... especially with the 4th bullet point?
Can I get two support animals? I have tics and a gender identity.
So for them our gender identity is a „disorder“ again, awesome :-/  /s

maybe not what you wanna hear but an ESA isnt really anything different from a normal pet (they get no additional training, unlike service dogs) and theyre generally not allowed in spaces like malls or reastaurants..
on my way to claim my emotional support lion
me with my anti-dysphoria flock of magpies
Well cis people also have a gender identity, so …
The emotional stress of having a pet will qualify me as an ESA owner.
For all you out there thinking you need paperwork for a service dog (different from a ESA). 

https://beta.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/

Ummm no paperwork. 

And a ESA is not allowed in public places. But you need a letter from a therapist or doctor for having ESA or service animal on your place.
Ima get an emotional support Cassowary
On my way to go get 4 more birds
Just a PSA: Emotional support animals aren't protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. So, this means you and your pet can still be denied entry into public places. I just don't want anybody to get a rude surprise \^\_\^
Lmfao everyone has a gender identity the ""disorder"" is called gender dysphoria. Im ded
just by ‘DSM-V’ this source looks super shady
And for the first time ever I realized my tics don't happen when my dog is with me
omg i want this so bad
Does that mean that litterally everyone can get an emotional support animal
Did anyone else notice that they actually have the words “mental retardation”??? 
What is this???? They are using an outdated DSM-V and need some help on what the correct terms for these are.
MENTAL RETARDATION??? IM SORRY WHAT?
I love how it says ""gender identity"" instead of something like ""gender identity disorder""
Emotional support animals are not service animals, they do not have the right to be out in public spaces like service animals! You CANNOT bring support animals to public restaurants, stores, etc!

Ugh this comment section is grinding my gears, OP you need to put somewhere in your post that this list is not for service animals as there is a difference and people in here are getting confused thinking they can bring an animal wherever they want because they have gender dysphoria.

ESAs have a right to housing and that's it, meaning that if you rent or live in an apartment they can't stop you from housing your ESA, that is the only right that ESAs have. Service animals have to be trained to perform at least three tasks for their owners and are specifically trained to be out in the public, ESAs need no training as they don't interact with the public and are to provide emotional relief to their owners.

Edit- These are the laws for the US, it's different around the world ofc, be sure to check your local laws on the matter.
Uhh the forth one 😬😬
It's not a disorder tho
On an unrelated note… is “the r word” still a term we’re using for mental disability/neurodivergence?
This is outdated.

THAT SAID TIME FOR MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FERRET
So everyone who isn’t agender gets one?
Is that for real? Lmao, why?
Can I have a emotional support hive of hornets or can I only do one?
i mean i heard emotional support animals dont have as much use as service animals so like... Its nice and all but my ESA isnt going to be able to help me with a panic attack in public.

Its still awesome though!
Anyway I'm off to get my support rat.
Mental re- 

That’s so outdated wtf
What animals can you have? I do not like dogs for reasons but carrying around a bun sounds nice. Don't think this applies in my country but still interesting to know. Can you have any animal?
Can I have an emotional support human?
Honestly, I'd use this fucked up rule to play the system and get me a super cool support animal. Ideally an attack dog against transphobes.
I want a red panda.
Are you saying that I can get an emotional support animal for being trans?
They can say I have “gender identity disorder” all day if it means I get a smart ass dog.

Time for me to get an emotional support capybara
I have like three of those. do I get an entire pigeon flock?
free dog i guess
'Why do you have an emotional support animal'

' Because I dont have nice tits and im REALLY SAD about it!'

(legit tho its hilarious and adorable at the same time)
This is from a private organization, not an official government office. ESA is not recognized by the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act). Most states don't even recognize ESA in any form. I wish people would do a little more research before making claims like this. Here is the [official ADA page](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html) if you need a source.
I WANT A DOGGO SO BADDDDD😭
You have to let me bring my pet bird on the plane, I’m trans!
We'll all gonna have a get together with our new pet blahajs
time to join the european space agency /j
Yes, I need this support animal. They respect my identity when nobody else does 😔
In Florida, it’s also a qualifier for getting approval for medical marijuana.
I feel torn on this (I am a cis person). Being trans or having any other non-cis gender identity is a very stressful thing to go through. But it is not a disorder. I agree these should be qualifying conditions for therapeutic support but it makes me a little mad to see it listed along with a list of disorders.
Since I have multiple of these do I get multiple dogs
I can get a ESA and I might actually want one holy shit
Omg can I get one??????
Gender dysphoria can lead to depression which qualifies for an emotional support animal. Also encouragement seems pretty appropriate and accurate
I want an emotional support bearded dragon
Wait i can get an emotional support animal with ADD? Hell yea time to get an emotional support raccoon.
Do emotional support cats count? Dingus will only need on ladies (mostly boobs) so when he need my wife it brings her joy.
I could be like anxiety around it——? Idkkk
Just remember Emotional Support animals are not covered as ""support animals"" under ADA laws so business, renters etc are not required to allow you entry

Maybe I can get my cat as an ESA
looks like i can get one for multiple reasons, can i get multiple animals lol /s

My cat is my emotional support animal for so many reasons. I guess his job description got longer once my egg cracked.
ayyyy i’ve got three
Where is this from? This list looks seriously outdated, it doesn't take anything from the actual DSM V.
cool! though it says ""sexual disorders'' which idk if its giving me ick vibes or aphobia. either way an animal won't help with that and morally shouldn't either. the rest are ok tho
Dude, I got like half of these. Shit lol
ouch, that fourth one. gross
Dysphoria Shark Week
dang.... at some point it makes more sense to just tell you which ones I DON'T have lol
I mean, you can get an ESA for anything really, there are no real requirements, standards, or qualifications.
Ew outdated terms… (2 and 4, though 2 isn’t as bad as 4)

Doesn’t seem like a credible source
I qualify for a few to many of those
fUCK yeah, dude!! You get it.
It has honestly been one of my best purchases. When I'm feeling like shit I can just hug it really tight and it's so nice to do. I need more giant plushies...
Would you swim with it, or like, carry a pool around?
Hear me out: we find dragons and then we all have emotional support dragons, but only us trans folk know the significance of it being a dragon, so when we see other dragon owners in public we know that we’re both trans folk so it’s safe to talk. Thank you for coming to my trans talk (get it, not a Ted Talk a trans talk)

Fuck that I'm getting a cassowary.

Motherfuckers feel tough when they walk around with a pitbull? You better watch out for the trans bitch with the cassowary.
Definitely, but if it's an additional reason for my Psychiatrist to write an ESA approval Letter i'm not gonna hesitate to mention the dysphoria next appointment
Me being agender/genderless >:)
Don't quote me on this, but I always thought the only requirement for an ESA was filling out a form and paying a fee. ESA's don't need any training, unlike service animals.
""Yes doctor, I have a severe case of being a boy. I will now accept my pet turtle, thank you very much.""
I wish   
Sadly doesn't work with stuffed animals
yeaaaaah, it's from July 2020, can't believe that point was still used back then
I believe it's the official term. I don't like it mind you, I just think that's their reasoning
I get why people don't like it in general speech and especially used as a slur, but it has a place when speaking scientifically/medically. 

My biggest issue when used in a clinical sense is that it's such a broad term it can cover everything from physical trauma to chemical imbalances >.>
It is a correct medical term and came before it was even slightly offensive
sadly in america it’s still used frequently as a medical term
I have ADD, gender identity, and very mild dyslexia (that doesn’t affect me too much unless I’m not focused but it’s still a learning disorder). I would like to file for 3 dragons please.
I know it looks bad, but at least we can get Emotional Support Animals :-3
Not quite, gender dysphoria is a clinical term for psychological anguish that is severe enough to negatively impact your ability to function as a result of a mismatch between your gender and your body and/or your social interactions. Being trans (termed as gender incongruence in the DSM-V, the same document that defines gender dysphoria) is a prerequisite for gender dysphoria, but not all trans people have clinically diagnosable gender dysphoria.

Think of it this way, a kid born without an arm might feel distressed, depressed, or anxious from the lack of the limb both in how it's harder for them to interact with the world and how the world interacts with them. The missing arm is not a mental disorder, but the anguish resulting from it cans develop into one. Particularly without the physical side being treated, in this case with a prosthetic (or in the case of us trans people, transition).

EDIT: I'm occasionally blind and read gender dysphoria and not identity.
What is the best term, I don't even know how to describe it myself
Gender dysphoria is the term for intense distress caused by misalignment of gender. A disorder is a trait that makes it difficult to go about daily life. Gender dysphoria is, by definition, a disorder. The issue was that, for a long time, being trans was what was considered the disorder even though, post-transitioning, trans people do not face a significant hurdle to functioning. Saying gender dysphoria isn't a disorder is pretty much the same as saying trans people aren't real.

As a side note though, the checklist used the r slur which is not great...
They're disordered for lacking compassion 9/10 times. Buncha *SIMS*.
List is very clearly old enough to be using the old DSM instead of the current version

some people are really lazy
What is the problem with calling it a disorder?
It's not actually saying it's a disorder though despite being lumped in with disorders. It's just saying there are issues we deal with mentally that may require emotional support.

Edit: nvm, my bad, I read it once and formed an image of what I wanted it to say, which I then misinterpreted as what it actually said
If it’s not a disorder, why treatment (HRT/Social transition) is needed?
if you put a / at the end of the link it should work. I've checked that it goes to the same place, and the formatting should recognise it as a link
I would try to be a good friend and give you a glass of water, you deserve it ☺️

Okay in that case can I qualify for 9 dragons?
They’re typically not allowed in indoor public spaces, but they have to allow them in most housing if you have the proper documentation. The only reason I can have my cat at college is because she is an ESA. They used to have special traveling rights as well, but unfortunately that’s no longer the case due to abuse of the system
That does not apply to every country though, here in germany they are allowed to accompany everyone everywhere and go through 12 to 24 months of special training
This is the way
An animal meeting the requirements for ESA doesn't really get you much. You can bring the animal on planes (some restrictions apply due to abuse) and there are some laws regarding what land lords have to accept from renters.

That's about it. Doesn't mean you can bring them to a restaurant, or the grocery store, or school, or work, or other cool places you like to take your body.

The list in OP is misleading as well. The requirement for ESA is ""animal well behaved"" and ""animal makes me feel better"". What OP found is a list of people who have found ESA's helpful, and not a list of things you can use to get an ESA. They have the cause and effect backwards.
That's why i said Gender Dysphoria in the Title

I was originally looking for information about ESAs in cases of Depression and found this
I have two!
Yeah I don’t know where this list is from but it does not look real, official, legitimate, sterling, believable, or true.
[""Any domesticated animal may be considered as an ESA (e.g., cats, dogs, mice, rabbits, birds, hedgehogs, rats, minipigs, ferrets, etc.) and they can be any age. However, an ESA must be able to be manageable in public and does not create a nuisance.""](https://www.umassmed.edu/TransitionsACR/resources/emotional-support-animals-101/#:~:text=Any%20domesticated%20animal%20may%20be,does%20not%20create%20a%20nuisance./)

Apparently yes, as long as they're manageable in public
Yessir! I could totally qualify my grandparents dog because he’ll never really attack unless you fuck with me and his bark would scare the transphobes away!
Yep :-3 I dunno where this one applies since i couldn't find any regional indicator, but yes you can get an Emotional Support Animal against Gender Dysphoria of any kind

Is also doubles as a remover of unwanted body parts!
Heck yeah one of my partners just got one it’s about a third of her size and she freaking loves the thing I’m also sending a hoodie for it lol
The specifics are catered around your needs
Small shark in a tank of water that has wheels and a camera to let the shark direct the tank around...

But how big would the tank need.to be so the shark isn't practically living in a cage?
It’s in a tank on specialized wheels so it can go anywhere with you. There’s even a setting where it can fly!
Or Land shark
You had me at dragons
Fun fact: I have a Dragon sticker on my primary water bottle in the trans flag :)
*cue the slamming of credit card down on the table multiple times* 
I’ll take your entire stock!
A distinct style of dragon would allow for color customization. (;
Do bearded dragons count? My baby does wonders for my mental health!

I mean if we all had dragons I’m pretty sure everywhere is safe for us.

In my perspective I would say that the lack of gender is a gender identity in itself, though I'm not an expert

Still, for a mistake like the one in the post I doubt they even know about agender people... As usual -_-
[this source](https://www.servicedogcertifications.org/emotional-support-dog-requirements/) backs you up. the only requirements are that the pet is well-behaved (ie house trained and well-socialized) and doesnt pose a risk to those around them (eg severe allergies.) they are not allowed in no-pet buildings (excluding residences) unlike certified service dogs, and the biggest barrier to getting one is finding a therapist that will ESA-certify the animal
😢😢
Time to get a real blue shark xD
it hasn’t been used in the DSM since it updated to the DSM-5. The correct term used since 2013 (iirc) is simply intellectual disability.
Isn't it like a medical term? Just people historically turned it into a slur
Wait then why did they put ADD down as a disqualification in their second point because in the medical world they have phased out ADD as a thing you can diagnose people with it was changed so that it’s all just ADHD but there’s just three different subtypes so technically no one has ADD anymore it’s all just ADHD
It isn’t anymore. It stopped being used in the DSM in 2013, and (fully) stopped being used by the ICD in 2018.
not really. It no longer exists in either the DSM-5 or ICD-11, and there are a multitude of other names for it out there that aren’t connected to slurs.
Which is why gender dysphoria would be a valid point on this list, but not „gender identity“.
Best term for what?
Which is why gender dysphoria would be a valid point on the list, but not „gender identity“.
It's not? I am who I am and I'm valid.
Because being trans is not bad in itself or a „disorder“.  
Gender dysphoria is very much so and deserves/requires treatment. But our transness is nothing to be cured.
Thanks for the edit. Glad you saw it.  
The many replies to this show you just how insidious covert bigotry like this is and how easy it can be used to skew the discourse in a negative way against us.
1. it‘s nice to wear the clothes or act the way you really are; it‘s not „nice“ if people call you something you‘re not (imagine being called a bunny 24/7). 

2 „gender dysphoria“ is a disorder, not „gender identity“. Or do you seriously wanna argue being a man / woman / nonbinary is a disorder?
Thanks for the hint
Thank you, Bea :)
Abso-fucking-lutely.
oh sorry my bad! i just assumed so because id never heard of such a thing anywhere else (i live in europe too)
No, you cannot bring ESAs into public spaces like restaurants and stores where animals aren't allowed, it doesn't matter how good they are with the public they are not service animals. 

Literally your link says you can't have them in public spaces where normal animals aren't allowed, they have a right to housing and that's the /only/ right ESAs have, they have the right to be housed with their owners even if that's against the properties rules to have animals.

You've made a very misleading post and are now spreading misinformation telling folks on here they can bring their ESAs wherever and thats simply not true nor legal. ESAs are not Service animals, they are not trained to perform specific tasks nor are they granted access to public spaces prohibiting animals.

Edit- This link you provided is from a collage in the US and therefore is using US laws as a guideline, you can't just say to someone else that Germany's laws are different and post US based websites. That's cool they allow people in your country to walk around with ESAs but thats not the case in the US and you're seriously confusing people and telling them they can do something that could land them in legal trouble.

Lmfao at the downvotes, in the US ESAs are not protected like service animals so y'all have fun trying to bring your untrained pets illegally into businesses and see how quickly you get kicked out 🤷‍♂️
Wonder if any of this applies in the UK :(
So like as much as I love my bunny I would totally use him as an emotional support animal BUT it doesn’t say we can’t have a tame dragon? Or if dragon is too big a leopard gecko?
I’m from Sweden! And I really hope it applies to Sweden as well
I'll take your entire stock!
Yay no more titties
I'll take them all! Whats the price?
Some quick searching suggests ~180-350 gal as a minimum for smaller sharks - Freshwater ""sharks"" would be far more practical

There are land-dwelling fish, so maybe some hybridization is in order
Alright! Let’s start searching for enough dragons for the entire trans community, then distribute them, and then register them as emotion support!
Yes. One of my discord groups has the general room called cat girls....when they start posting car girls I can't help put post dragons/dragon girls instead. Dragons the new trans icon please 🥺
That fuck fact is awesome!
Currently are stock only consists of a stuffed dragon named Mr Snuggles, and we’re auctioning him off, the highest bid so far is $500,000. But I’m willing to go lower if I don’t have to pay for shipping.
100% we should start a new business For Trans By Trans Emotional Support Dragons
I don’t see why not, since my leopard gecko is awesome too
Well I’m a trans that’s ace, so it could be By Trans For Trans (and/or Aces)
True. Our dragons could just kill the transphobes which is convenient
That’s fair - it really depends how you define things, for example I’ve seen gender identity defined as
> an individual's personal sense of having a particular gender

and where agender is actually *not* having a certain gender, you could interpret that to them not overlapping.
it's like my bank account, zero is a number
While it is a medical term, it’s still considered pretty ableist. Language changes, and medical language should too when its roots are often based in ableism and oppression.
It *was*, but the term got changed because more was discovered about the various disorders that all got group together as one thing under the term decades ago so people who still use it are always saying a slur. It's kinda like how the n-word was Spanish for black that got changed over time but it's still a slurwhen used in most contexts in the English speaking world.
Sometimes the issue is that it's a legal term--and it's the legal term they used when they wrote the legislation or policy guidance, and then changing the terminology becomes difficult or impossible without changing the law or policy guidance itself.
So is transsexual but I don’t know a lot of trans folks that identify with it.
It is no longer a recognized medical term, nor is ADD. It's been that way for a very long time
""Hysterical"" and ""neurotic"" used to also be medical terms to describe women suffering any kind of psychological or emotional distress. Words change as culture changes, particularly in scientific fields. The literal foundation of all sciences is acquiescing to and integrating new information and forming/adjusting theories to fit new understandings.
No, it isn’t the official term anymore. The official term is now intellectual disability. It used to be the medical term, but it certainly wasn’t in 2020.
Many Doctors still refer to it as ADD, either the only thing that's been updated on that website was the Date of Upload or they forgot it's called ADHD now

Most my Docs also still refer to it as ADD
Ah okay, my mistake
I didn't say it was still in common use. It can still serve as a general umbrella term, though in most cases it would be better to use something more specific, as the various conditions are only superficially similar and have a wide range of needs and facets. which is what most medical/scientific institutions do now.

I also believe any label, regardless of how accurate or specific can be used as a slur to shame and denigrate someone. The broader the term, the more people it affects, the worse it can be. 

There should be a disconnect when speaking clinically though.
Lmao, I legitimately misread it as gender dysphoria. I'm blind sometimes.
Gender identity _____

I'm trans myself and don't know the proper word to describe it, I usually just say I was born with a hormone issue lol
Ah, my bad, I misread it
Gender dysphoria is a disorder tho? Like, it's defined as being intense stress as a result of gender incongruence. A disorder is just something that impeads your ability to function. Being trans is not a disorder, which was the thing people had to fight pretty hard to have recognition of, but saying that gender dysphoria isn't a disorder would basically be saying trans people aren't real.
All people with disorders are who they are and valid. And if it isn’t a disorder, why do you need treatment (HRT/Social transition)?
The disorder is that your identity is stuck in the wrong body. And people without dysphoria still experience functional abnormality, otherwise they wouldn’t experience euphoria
No probs
Perfect!
The UK currently doesn't recognize emotional support animals, unfortunately
I’d say so, yeah! Let’s splice dogs with sharks. And make them blue.

Land Blåhaj
Shouldn't be that hard
They're already kind of ace icons, so you'll have to make a deal with the asexuals to work that out.
I just edited it, because I saw my typo. I apparently drop the f bomb a lot >.>
I’ll pay for shipping and I raise that to 750,000
im agender too! i would argue (and this is my perspective, i dont wanna police anyone!) agender is a gender identity only because the absence of something is defined within the bounds of the thing its absent of. for example, absolute zero is still a temperature reading despite being the complete absence of heat (if that makes sense in comparison)
You're right it depends on the definition. I never saw that one myself and that way it's how you said, though I never delved too deeply into it so I'll take your word for it.

Still you can use my definition just for free pet purposes only :p
How is it ableist? The word ""retardation"" isn't a slur. Any word can be turned into a word of oppression.
Usually trans people that have sexually medically transitioned (bottom surgery) use the term, so there is a use for it.
no worries ! this website really does give the impression it is still used, to be fair
Haha too late, everyone with a gender needs an emotional support pet now, until you’re cured of your gender.  
The agender agenda in action /j XD
I would say it's gender dysphoria but i'm not an expert
I see this list as a categorial error.   
Gender identities, ALL gender identities, are not a disorder. Neither is being trans itself.  I don‘t suffer because I‘m a guy, I suffer due to gender dysphoria symptoms.  
So either „gender identity“ needs to be dropped in the list or the list needs a different title because „disorder“ doesn‘t fit for the term *gender identity*.   

*Gender dysphoria* on the other hand could be on this list as a disorder and would be a valid point.   
The fault lies in equivalating gender dysphoria with transness. We don‘t stop being trans without GD, for example when we have transitioned and feel better. Being trans would still be what we are. But our disorder of gender dysphoria would be lifted.
Too late, one bunny for you until you‘re cured of that nasty gender :3
Okay put in that way I agree, and of course dysphoria is real and also trans people. I just don't like to be put in the ""broken""category (even though I am
Note how it says „gender identity“. 

So too late for anyone, if you are a man a woman, cis or trans … you need a support bunny now, mate.
And once we have transitioned and feel fine, are we still „disordered“? Or may this be a redundant pathologization?
[Did you mean: Vress?](https://twitter.com/vress_shark)
The Click has that as merch mango the landshark
Not at all
Me too lol. Love it tho, fuck facts are awesome lmao
I would say sold, except Mr Snuggles hasn’t arrived yet lol.
I think it also depends on how you interpret being agender, though. Some people who are agender have no understanding of how people perceive gender, like people who are transphobic saying that there's no way to 'feel a certain gender' then find themselves to be agender. In that sense I'd say a metaphor could be instead of being absolute zero, being temperature-less. Though yeah, honestly I just mentioned it to make a little joke, haha
Just like how most trans women here would hate being called ""sufferers of autogynephilic transsexualism"", the modern term is ""intellectual disability"". When people start using a medical term as a slur, the medical field generally changes its terminology to become less charged.
While the word was not initially intended as a slur, there is a whole discussion to be had around our current systems of measuring intelligence. Additionally, the word is absolutely a slur at this point.

My doctor doesn't call me a ""transsexual"", and that's honestly much less offensive than being diagnosed as clinically... Well, yeah.
It's more to do with the word retard, since it's very regularly used as a general insult like idiot. A lot of people have heard the word retard used as an insult far more than a medical term, especially groups of people that others consider weird or out of place like neurodivergent people
I have met plenty that don’t. Maybe it’s common in the States? Not here in Australia.
Usually is a large overstatement. Trans folks with some problematic views on other trans folk who do not wish for full or any medical/surgical transition are the ones that tend to identify with term as a way to separate themselves from the ""trenders"".

Not here to tell people how they're allowed to identify, but that is a big reason why some still use this term.
I mean, the lack of a gender is still a gender identity.
In the UK it’s diagnosed as “gender incongruence”, because “dysphoria” is a symptom more than a diagnosis, and many people don’t feel dysphoria, or don’t feel it in a recognised way.
Having a disorder doesn't make you ""broken,"" it just means you have more difficulty in functioning under ""normal"" circumstances. I mean, the vast majority of scientists have some form of autism spectrum disorder and scientists are literally *the* smart people.
Yeah, that's a tough point with all the disabilities and disorders. Sometimes it's helpful to remember that most of the challenges of being trans (or having adhd, autism, chronic illness, whatever) has to do with trying to live in a society that has not been made accessible to us. We have different needs that should be irrelevant to our worth as people, yet the values of society often punish us for having those needs.
Yes, and people without gender as well
It’s kinda like being a diabetic, you need continuous hormonal treatment for both of them (preferably free or at least subsidized)
I was not aware of this. And it’s absolutely adorable.
I was thinking Mango sold by The Click
I know…I wish I could afford it…

But Mango isn’t blue, which is a pretty big oversight, I’d say (/j)
worst part is: I can't even blame like, auto correct. My fingers just typed that themselves ><
Damn lol
what would being temp-less look like though? even room/ambient temp is a temperature. im not trying to argue, also, i just like hearing others’ perspectives and trying to understand them
Ok. Thank you for explaining.
Yeah, never met a trans person who would be younger than 70 now that uses it in Ireland or the UK personally
Probably more common in the states. Usually younger people don’t generally use it as well, even if they have had bottom surgery.
That’s true I did overstate. I guess I meant to add that it’s usually older trans people that use the term as well. 

I think that it’s true that some people use it to separate themselves in a derogatory way but it isn’t all people. Often it’s people that just aren’t really on the internet that I’ve met use it, like from my local lgbt center. They’re usually stealth outside of there and very supportive of the younger lgbt people like me, including non binary people. 

It sucks ass that people use it to be hateful towards non binary and non passing trans people though. I saw this as someone who was previously affected a lot by Kalvin garrah and made myself feel like shit.
I was thinking this, how would you describe gender dysphoria, is it a condition, symptom of something, if its not a disorder? 

I used to put it in the same category as depression and anxiety which are considered disorders apparently by the NHS

NHS from what i can see avoids all of the above. Instead opting for 'Gender dysphoria is a term...'
Thank you kind person
You do know not every trans person takes hrt all their life? Again, trans is not the disorder, dysphoria is.
I firmly believe it is one of the reasons the internet exists.
HAHAHAHA LOL LOVE IT
Oh- I was using that as like a metaphor, for how I personally interpret agender, to compare how I see being agender to how you see it. I hadn’t really thought about how it would work irl, but like, if being agender was equivalent to 0 degrees, would male and female be a really high positive temperature and a really negative temperature? In that case, agender would be in the middle, but the middle seems like it would be more of someone who’s bigender between male and female, rather than someone who’s a third gender or genderless.
From what I’ve heard it’s been move from the mental disorders category to the long term afflictions category
If it’s not a disorder, are trans people fine as their agab?
thats fair, i guess color would be a better analogy in that black, the absence of color, is defined as a shade rather than a color but is still defined within the bounds of color definitions, so being agender is…a gender variant, rather than a gender identity maybe? although at this point its getting convoluted, but i think conflating gender itself with gender identity is part of why that is (agender is the absence of identifying with any certain gender, paradoxically becoming its own gender identity)

basically, we’re weird. we’re weirdos. we dont fit in, and we dont want to fit in. have you ever seen us with a stupid gender? thats [weird](https://youtu.be/wnMEp02P-_k)
Damn does that not come with tonnes of baggage too? I don't really feel like I'm of ill health, suffering sure
Are trans people their agab? No. We don‘t fit the label we were given. That in itself is not a disorder.  
I‘m told I‘m east asien often. I‘m not, it‘s not my label. Not a disorder either.   

Do many of them suffer from dysphoria symptoms? Yes, that‘s why we treat dysphoria. Dysphoria is a disorder.   
Are some okay with their body pre transition (totally or in part)? Yes, those exist, too.
Yeah honestly it really does get nitpicky when people try to fit all the terms together and stuff aha “:D
I think if people identify with what they perceive a label to represent, that’s good, and if they don’t identify with that label, they don’t have to :)
I think the reason for this change is that it being a mental disorder implies that the most common way you can deal with it is therapy
Does being told you’re East Asian affect your health?
youre right there, it all comes down to the current obsession with microlabeling ones personality traits and identities, breaking them down to becoming incomprehensibly complex
It affects me the same way it affects me being told I‘m a woman. If it happens constantly, it can take a mental toll."	vxy3yc	trans	2740	0.96	2022-07-13 08:25:51
Three generations seems improbable, but here we are.	"My kid has been out as trans for several years.


I've been out as trans for a while. 


Now, one of my parents has tearfully and privately confessed that they aren't cis.


I'm just waiting for one of my grandparents to rise from the damn grave to let me know how their gender dysphoria manifested in 1938."	"Both my sister and I are Trans
That's so lovely!!! 
My kid came out as Trans 10 years ago at 17, I came out this past Autumn at 49. ❤️
I’m not gonna lie but it is because of my kid that I have allowed my egg to crack. I’m still in the closet but my daughter tells me a closet is no place to live.
I’m trans and both of my siblings are trans
My grandmother's are lesbians, my uncle is gay, I'm trans.  My family at some point inherited all the fun.  It's like a 50% chance that being in my bloodline comes with a membership card.
""Back in my day we didn't have dresses rising to our hoo hahs. Damn hooligans,  now get off my lawn!""

Sincerely,

your repressed all their life MTF ""Grandpa"" who is understandably a ""little"" bitter.
My mom's main argument for why I'm not trans (she means well, and won't stop me from transitioning) is that she felt the same way for most of her life. Legit. She's very much conservative-leaning so idk if she'll ever come out (haha) and tell me she's trans, but given I've gotten her to accept me being attracted to my agab, and that she basically came out as lesbian to me last week, I wouldn't put it past her to come out as trans at 62 years old.

Her birthday is in a month... I should buy her a trans pride pin.
Knowing 2022 i would not be surprised if one of your grandparents re animated just for that
My dad was trans.  My father in law is trans.  My brother in law is gay.   My wife is bi sexusl.  We have an open eye on our 2 kids.  Lol.
❤️
omg this is so cool. i think my brother (?) is trans and hes told me he has been questioning his gender when i came out to him. it hasnt been mentioned again since but i wanna be there for him :(
That’s pretty cool.
This does make me question if it is genetic, as improbable as you say it is, I have encountered this several times already - and with how few trans there actually are, that's pretty statistically significant.
Your truth is not lost on me.

When one considers the number of generations before us (see, the seminal passage in “Look Homeward, Angel,” by Thomas Wolfe; have tissues), if one is trans, one cannot help but reach spiritually backward to wonder at the ones who just bottled it up and went on. They had to be there. Statistically. If one has access to old photographs, one wonders even more.

So, while prayers are meaningless, one may yet call up their unknown memories and cherish them for the you they perpetuated, even if it’s only random mathematics. 

We only happen because we happened before.
Wow being trans is hereditary in your family
I'm nonbinary and my kid (8yo) is too. Yep. Significant.
mom is bi

a sister is genderfluid lesbian

a sister is abrosexual

brother is questioning

we are trans, gay, poly

have a happy lil family except our dad doesnt know we're gay and the rest of our family doestn know we're poly but here we are
Bro my uncle is trans and I'm on the nonbinary spectrum wtf
this is so cool omg
Why seem like trans sometime run in the family for some. Really is weird because my sibling is trans also.
If we assume 1% of people are trans the likelihood that a trans person has both a trans parent and a trans grandparent is somewhere around 8:10000 or 1:1250 (2:100x4:100)

So it's unlikely, but there must be 50-60 thousand trans people in the world with a trans parent and grandparent. It's pretty cool!
I'm an enby trans femme, my brother is pan, and his husband is a trans man

That's being said, I still think that some other eggs are still to crack
there's like 10 lgbtq+ people in my family that I know of
One of my siblings is agender, I'm pretty sure trans might run in some family's
My (trans) husband (also trans) who is the other parent of our kid (also trans) swears blind that my mom is actually a trans guy. 

Honestly, he makes a compelling case. It wouldn’t surprise me if we were also a three generation family.
I have an Aunt who is trans
holy shit thats amazing
My daughter is trans, my older sibling is trans, my cousin is trans, and I am trans. I feel like there is probably more to come 😂
And then there's me, the only lgbt person in my entire family 😭
woah :o
Naw just look for their historically close roommates
My sister and I both came out as trans a year and a bit apart. I felt so bad because I just thought I was trying to copy my sister, and my parents kinda thought so too at first.
i do wonder about the biology side of things. fairly sure that a few members in the fam are, and while im cis female,. im very very masc presenting and have had serious thoughts about gender over decades
Oddly enough I just saw an aunt of mine for the first time since coming out. She more or less admitted to me she’s not cis in a sort of sidelong way.

That entire side of my family is a dumpster fire of emotional trauma untreated mental conditions. So it would be of absolutely no shock if many of them aren’t straight/cis and just buried it their entire lives because of growing up in a repressive religious household.
OH WOW
I mean it's gotta be genetic right? My parents were gender weirdos for sure, not that they would ever acknowledge that in an open way.
My brother is also trans, I do wonder if it somehow runs in families.
That’s really awesome. I unfortunately do not really have any close gay, lesbian or trans friends locally or family members. Been in the closet for pretty much my whole entire life irl, with not much guidance & through 2 identities till I finally understood myself more, thanks to another Transgender friend I’ve made on twitch.
There is some evidence of a genetic or haradatory component to being trans so... not that improbable.
I'm trans, and have a cousin whos trans.
Being trans has significant genetic factors, so it's not THAT unlikely.
I didn't read the research myself, but I've been told there is quite good evidence pointing to relevant genetic influence on being trans. So this is probably more common than we imagine, and as we normalize trans existence more and more we'll see stories like that.
i'm trans and my sister is trans :3
i think this just goes to show that in a loving, accepting, welcoming environment, free from societal pressures, being trans is a LOT more common than some would like us to believe
I think there are 2 factors at play here. Bring on the LGBTQI+ spectrum is likely incredibly more common then anyone expects but people have been hiding it and there have been studies showing there is likely a genetic component.

My dad was a closeted trans woman and I just came out about a year ago.
I think twin studies have suggested there's probably some degree of inherited transness
Fun fact if your parents are trans or closeted trans or any close family members that are or closeted the chances of the next born being trans increases by a small percent
Like most things, there is some evidence that gender dysphoria can (not necessarily must) have a genetic factor.
End up getting a message about a long unknown storage shed your grandparents had and you go to open it up and it's nothing but cross-dressing supplies.
I'm trans m2f , my son is gay, my sister is bi, my other sister daughter is lesbian , my dad was said to have been a crossdresser, one his brothers was gay and one of his sisters was bi,  so it's in my family line .
i'm nonbinary and honestly my ""dad"" gives me closeted transfem vibes idk why
Me and my little sister are both trans, both realized at the same time too
my sister, 2 eldest cousins on my mums side, and I are all trans
Heredity for things like this are funny, ain't they? I also have a family with quite a bit of LGBTQ+ identities in it. My grandma's bi, my uncle's gnc, my aunt's bi and genderfluid, my mother's also gnc, and me and my only first cousin are both trans. It's funny to think about how my grandparents started with a granddaughter and grandson, and..... still have a granddaughter and grandson lmao.
I’ve heard about certain research finding that there are certain genes that are much more common in trans people than they are in cis people, leading a lot of researchers to think that there could be an inherited genetic component to it, so maybe it’s not all that improbable! That being said, it’s pretty speculative research, and it probably doesn’t explain everything so take it with a grain of salt, but I just thought it was interesting 🤷‍♀️
Get everyone's genome sequenced at one of the reputable places like Dante (not one of the cheap ones that don't do a full sequence e.g. ancestry).

Will be interesting to see all of the shared genetic transgender traits.
There’s definitely a genetic and biological component to it

As I understand, the Y chromosome isn’t slapped onto the X chromosome universally. A girl can have some amount of Y in her genetic makeup, without having been the part that made the major genital decisions - so to speak - and a boy can have XX as the outward presentation but with the Y chromosome working internally 

So I guess a mtf has their DNA configured in a largely typical female way and the only part of Y that contributed during development was the reproductive system. Hence why they’re a women on the inside but a doctor saw one thing as a baby and called them a boy

Men and women should not be defined by their genitals or reproductive systems any more

Does anyone know of any genetic tests or DNA tests done on trans or non-CIS folk?
I love hearing stories like this. My 19yo F2M son came out to me about 6 months ago, I've recently came out as being FINsexual and my son's grandfather on his mother's side is gay.
This is beautiful. Glad your family feels safe to share such intimate details with one another.
My gf and I are both trans. We got together when I knew but was in absolute denial and she didn’t knew
I wish someone else in my family was trans. I feel like a big weirdo being the only one. Like, one of my cousins gotta be questioning but not saying something, I have a tons of cousins.
My brother and I are trans. He came out first and has been out for a while. I’m still relatively new to it and I’m still trying to understand it. I feel very strongly that I’m a woman and I’ve come out to enough people that I don’t feel as trapped. But it’s all happened so fast and it started out as one thing and it’s snowballed from there. Not sure if that’s normal but I’m trying not to worry about normal and just worry about myself
That’s awesome lol
Myself and my niece.
Idk about generational but my brother is gay and I'm a trans lesbian. For all I know my younger brother is the only straight cis sibling I have.
I am and will probably continue being the only trans (and not straight) person in my family. Everyone in my family is cishet :/
My dad is ""cis"" but in high school when I asked if everyone wanted to change genders, he told me everyone would be a woman if they could choose bc women are better.
I'm beginning to feel weird for being the only trans sibling out of of 3 sisters and 0 other LGBTQ+ family members that I know of.
I'm trans, my niece is a trans woman, and one of my cousins has not one but two trans children.  Odd how that works, isn't it?    


Or maybe not so odd judging by the other commenters here.
My dad and I are both nonbinary
As far as I know I'm the only one in my whole family tree who is LGBTQ+ in any way. I guess all families are different!
Yall taking the term transparent to a whole new level
My friend and her brother are both trans
Now i really think it's genetic
So far I’m the only trans family member but my sister is queer and I hope we aren’t the only ones as time passes!
So far out of my 400 family members (uncles, cousins aunts, etc.) im the only trans person in my family
My step sibling and I are both non-binary. Not generational, but a nice coincidence
Cool! I'm trans (closeted for now), my mom's cousin is lesbian, my aunt is bisexual and I bet my non-existent dick that my brother is either trans or gay.
That's amazing. I'm the only one in my family
Well I have long hypothesized that like other mental illnesses GD runs in families.
My Kid is somewhere on the gender spectrum.   
As I am Trans. So there are 2 right there
I- HOLY SHIT THATS AWESOME
*summons jesus*

Me: Jesus we need help
Jesus: don't worry I was technically apart of the Roman empire 
Everyone I knew was either gay bi or an Ally

Me:yaaay
I think there is a same issue in my family. I think my dad was. And I was diagnosed mtf.
There are actually studies that show there may be a slight biological factor! Identical twins are something like 20% more likely to both be trans than fraternal twins. (Can’t find the source but I’ll try to look)
i want a family member like me. closest thing i have is my cousin and to be sister-in-law are bi. i'm a transwoman with a side of panromantic asexual.. i just idfk. it gets to me, makes family events that much harder to go to because i'm such an alien to them and they really don't understand how hard it is
Yo I have a feeling that my mom ain't cis, and that my two younger cousins are trans too...
I'm the only trans person in my family. My aunt is a lesbian and my brother is sole form of queer, but I'm the only one whose gender was a little fucky lol
Yall counting generations backwards? 😭 ok but that sounds great
Soon you’ll have an army like none other you’d have ancestors rise from the beyond joining!
I'm non binary and my sister is binary trans and both very queer. Also have 2 cousins who are various flavours of trans and queer too. 4/7 of my grandparents grand kids are trans! (And one is still bitty and thoroughly in bible day camp mode cuz that's all her mom lets her exist in but we'll see where she ends up down the road when she grows up and is able to get a little distance lol)
My spouse is non-binary aswell and their sibling is some flavour of GNC/non binary. Other partner is non-binary with 3(?) Trans/gender variant identified siblings so it really do run in families lol
I have a trans sister. Still trying to figure out what I am.
same lol
Lol I'm sofar the only trans kid in my family.

But myself, my sister and my cousins are all somewhere along the Queer spectrum.
I mean I'm mtf and they're genderfluid but more on the masc side (they're afab) my mum knows about me but doesn't know about them, so its gonna be a fun conversation
69th like, lol funny number
I’m trans, my sister is trans and our only cousin is trans too. My grandparents have exclusively trans grandkids ha ha
same
Same here. The statistics of this had me doubting myself for a while but then I remind myself that there are trans twins lol
Same for me and my brother. Back when he came out, my mom was all upset about not having a daughter anymore or something stupid like that, and I’m just sitting there like “I’m… not gonna say anything yet.” I’ve only recently come out, and honestly I think that particular conversation is part of the reason I waited so long.
My younger sibling came out as an enby and I'm a transbian, my mom was like ""I guess there's something up with my dna huh?"" Lol
xx Hugs sister xx
My son came out a year and a half ago at 6. My wife came out 8 months ago at 37. I've been out genderfluid 17 years. We think my gran might have been ftm--only wore pants, fairly gentlemanly masc for the time she was from, and more...

I appreciate these changes in the community. I'm waiting for the world to catch up.
It really isn’t, though I’m the opposite, the only place I’m not out is home
Your kids must love you for being supportive and accepting. Its what Trans Youth dream of. Being able to be them selves and feel good while at home instead of being berated and called psychotic for just being themselves. Props to you for being a rare supportive parent.
My son has helped crack my egg in a similar way. And he's one of my biggest supporter. He helped me find the nonbinary community, and it's because of him that I'm now on a waiting list for gender care (I might get my first call in 2024, depending on how lucky I get)
Oh my gosh I wonder what coming out was like for you all
0:
Same I came out to my sibling first and they came out as non binary as a response 😂 my dad is against it but he was like ""I've dressed up as a woman and thought I looked very attractive 🤨"" as an argument but I just went 🧐✍️ hmmmm 😂
Damn that's nuts, there are 0 openly queer people of any sort in my entire extended family.
My grandfather wore a pink speedo for his professional body building contests and is always asking me about what I'm up to in my transition.  He is taking an active interest, asking questions and being supportive in the only way a man of his generation knows how.  Always thought an 85 year old man would not be accepting, yet here we are.
>she felt the same way for most of her life

same. And they don't even see the irony.
Dont do it
Hello fellow he/it trans bi ace! lmao
There’s NO doubt in my mind that genetics can play a part in being transgender. There are way too many “coincidences “
That's interesting, one of my trans friends has a parent who is trans too, and I had another friend who is questioning their gender/maybe genderfluid, and they have a trans sister and trans dad. Personally one of my siblings is trans as am I.
Not only do I think there's a genetic component (both me and my son are trans), I legit think we're severely undercounted. I think we're probably closer to 4-5% of the population than 0.7%. I think that the number of trans people that are out and comfortable being out might be 0.7% of the population, but that's not all of us. Not with how many people transition later in life.
Iirc thats what the current science says.
I mean everything we are is genetic. So I wouldn't be surprise. But it could be about the genetics of the mother (how the go through pregnancy) as well. Or a mix of both.
? From your sample size of n=2???
No, it's not at all statistically significant.

https://www.statisticshowto.com/what-is-statistical-significance/
I very VERY strongly disagree with the notion that being trans is a result of some genetic factor. If we can acknowledge that gender is not physically real and instead a social construct, then we can rule out that it’s genetic.
There's also likely an epigenetic component: a pregnancy drug called DES significantly increased the rate of gay and trans ID in exposed infants, and that effect carried on into *their* children as well.
I mean… this is not uncommon. There does seem to be some genetic component.
If being trans is genetic, then gender identity CANNOT be a social construct.
... Which is it though?
I really like your name!
[removed]
I feel you, im the only one too, not just in the family but i don't think there's a single person who even knows someone trans 🤷‍♀️
My brother came out as trans 5 years ago. I'm just starting to question whether I'm enby or trans as well. Can't help but wonder if I'm just copying my brother. I'm going to see a gender therapist as soon as my insurance kicks in.
There are many. Just search in PubMed or which database you have access to.  
[Here is one](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/2/390/5104458)
Keep looking. My family covered up the lgbt+ and neurodivergent parts of the family, too.
saaaaame, i didn't even know that a few of my cousins were trans, but when i came out a few relatives were like ""oh yeah (very distant relative that i don't know at all) said they were... something dunno""
Nice
But some say it isn't genetic lol
We always knew my sister (AMAB) was different. As a child she would wear girls runners and got caught numerous times trying on my mom's clothes. It was the 80s so we didn't call it trans. I didn't realize I was trans until this year 45. Once I figured it out so many things from the past now make sense. I wasn't like my sibling I didn't try girls clothing on but I now realize I have always identified as a female.
I’m sorry. That has to be really hard on you. To be able to be yourself most of the time and then having to closet yourself in a place that should be your safest place. Maybe some day we will both be able to be our true-selves all of the time.
Same, hate it when the people closest to me (physically ofc) are the ones who would hate me for being me.
I live in with 9 other ppl and a couple caretakers (that's the fcking word I was looking for yesterday lol). Our caretakers know and a couple of my flatmates, but not all of them and it's so damn hard!
I feel such love and hope for the current generation in grade school. They show such acceptance and love to each other. I just hope some of the individuals in political power don’t make it illegal for these kids to be themselves. I wish the politicians could actually spend some time with our youth. They could learn a thing or two.
Something something cracking enough eggs for an omelette
I only know 1 queer person in my entire group of ppl Iknow from real life and it's a guy who's trans and I have absolutely nothing to do with their family except my parents and his are kind of friends
Same! I also grew up in a small village in the Swedish countryside, and as far as I know there is 1 other person who is LGBTQ+ from there, and she's a couple of years younger than me, and also wasn't born there so I'm not sure if that counts. Come to think of it, I'm sure I'm the first openly queer person born in that little hole. Wow. And trans on top of that? I should get a medal! 

Though of course there are people who I *think* are queer both in that town and my family. As an example I have a 12-year old cousin and I'd almost be willing to bet that he's gay or bi but doesn't know it yet. He's just, you know,  💁🏼‍♂️ But of course I'll love him even if he turns out to be a heterosexual.
Same here. No one even seems queer. Maybe that's just Poland for you?
That is awesome :)

Btw may I pet you behind the ears neko? :3
I kina agree with this, if your mum is really trans, then she/they come to this conclusion by her/themselves. Accepting our own transidentity is never easy and it takes time. I hope it will get better for you 💚
Hi!!
A survey in 2016, from the Williams Institute, estimated that 0.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender. If a random American adult was chosen from the entire country, there is a 0.006 probability of them being transgender. The probability of choosing 2 trans adults is 0.000036. That is indeed statistically significant.
Under represented probably, but 1 in 20-25 people being trans sounds far too high
Yes, but we are even *more* than that. For instance, you have more biological life in your body by mass that are microorganisms that don't have your dna. Those creatures have a huge impact on thinking and behavior. Shoot, we already know post-flu infection patients are at higher risk of depression (1920's swine flu and this one) from research conducted on patients. 

Certain microorganism concentrations may also be correlated with depression, anxiety and gender dysphoria. My *untested hypothesis* is that, if other variables were controlled high concentrations of those relevant microorganisms may act as ""egg-cracker"" catalyst for people already disposed to be trans genetically
I mean it could also be environmental factors, which presumably parents and kids would both grow up in similar situations
Well now my sample size is 205. And the answer is 17%.

Edit: now n=232; 17%.
Just spitballing here but, whilst it’s true that gender is a social construct, there is a physical factor to gender dysphoria. There is a function of the brain that is essentially an internal map for the body, this is how the brain sees the body and knows what is where. This function can go wrong in cases such as phantom limbs and body dysmorphia and, though there isn’t enough research for me to say this without a doubt, it’s likely that it plays a role in gender dysphoria too ( at least the part concerned with ‘being in the wrong body.’ )

Couldn’t it be possible that there is a genetic factor to specifically this part of gender dysphoria?
Sure gender is a social construct, but it’s one made up of both cultural *and* psychological parts. Obviously it’s not genetics that makes me feel good wearing a dress, but it *could* be genetics that makes me feel I have the wrong genitals
I mean... I understand the whole gender part, but I actually wish I had a real vagina, uterus, ovaries... Like, an intense burning desire and sadness at not having that. I think that is beyond the social, and starts to dip in to something else. I dont want to be a feminine person with a penis. I want to be female - which I guess is one of those few things that humanity has yet to truly conquer: self sex determination.

We just arent *quite* there yet, but with how far implants, hormones, lab grown organs, and CRISPR type genetic editing tools that we now have... I think we may conquer that hill in the next hundred years.
It's epigenetic.
This is a mix up of terms because people unfortunately aren't very clear on the Internet smh. When you hear 'gender is a social construct' they're almost always referring to gender *roles*, not gender itself. I know it's obtuse as hell but for some reason that's the phrase that caught on. People don't usually call gender in its entirety a social construct, because yeah body dysphoria and the whole genetic link, but the word roles in 'gender is a social construct' is always just assumed instead of outright said
Why do things always have to be put into black and white binaries.
I mean it’s not impossible, but then again, my family has 0 LGBT+ persons and I am trans which suggests that there must be more than just genetics in play aswell.
Sure, but for first order approximation, I think it works. Sets a lower bound estimate at least

(I'm actually pretty interested to do a statistical study to estimate the true proportion of queer/trans people, but that's not really related)
I think between my partner, and my sister and cousins. We make up the majority of the Queer Rainbow
I hope it comes soon for both of us :)
> Maybe some day we will both be able to be our true-selves all of the time.

That's beautiful. I think I'm going to make this one of my go-to toasts.

May we some day be able to be our true-selves all the time.

Yeah I like that.
You can pet me 🥺
That study has interesting crosstabs, as a note. Age correlates more strongly to being trans than anything else--or, put another way, internalized transphobia is so intense in older generations that basically nobody hatches, while younger folx with better information and less self-hatred are *dramatically* more likely to come out.
Honestly, if someone is agender, for example, and experiences no dysphoria and they're from a generation where people didn't know that was even a thing. They wouldn't ever find out, would they?
Sorry but I didn't turn trans, or were you suggesting other things?
Yeah, my wording was definitely not the best lmao. As I said in another comment though, I never meant that something that is a result of your genetics couldn’t contribute to your dysphoria, but its presence doesn’t immediately mean that you are trans. Physical manifestations of dysphoria vary greatly from each trans person (with some not feeling it at all) and have many different theories as to why they occur. Maybe some of these manifestations are the result of a genetic component similar to what you described, though this is speculation at best. Hope this cleared up my argument, my thought process is pretty disorganized so I tend to come across as kind of confusing in my writing lol.
I never denied the possibility that a genetic factor could contribute to your dysphoria. The presence of this genetic component, however,  wouldn’t provide any concrete way to test for transgenderism through your genes, which is what being genetically transgender would entail.
I will confess that I don’t fully understand what that means.
Or possibly instead of 0 LGBT there could be a sprinkling of closeted.
Or it could be a recessive trait, or maybe some people have genes that are just more likely to express a trans identity. Who knows!
\*Gives soft gentle pets\* There you go mammon-of-lilith :)
That totally makes sense!
I meant something along the lines of if there was a high concentration of something in the water that could’ve affected our moms’ hormone levels during pregnancy that could conceivably cause someone to be trans when they wouldn’t otherwise
No problem, I’m the exact same way. I didn’t mean to imply that gender dysphoria was the only component of being trans or that a person can’t be trans without it. And you’re completely right, unfortunately all we can do at this point is speculate. I really wish we had some good research on trans identities. Hopefully we’ll have more in the future.

Edit: and if anyone does know of any research that exists ( except for those terrible old ones on trans sexuality ) I would really appreciate a link :)
oh yeah, I guess something like that could also be another option"	tib4cc	trans	2675	0.95	2022-03-20 02:27:49
I really don't get the mind dysphoria part, can someone explain it?		"Habitual behaviors and thought patterns we've picked up by performing our AGAB but make us go ""Ew I don't like being like that""
[deleted]
The other commenter summed it up very well. For me as a trans man it manifests as being disdainful of my emotionality. I cry very easily and this has always felt wrong and uncomfortable. Even though I know that there is nothing wrong with crying and would not fault anyone else for it no matter their gender, whenever I do it I get intense feelings of dysphoria. I don’t want to be reacting in that manner; it feels like there is a disconnect between the person that I am and how my body reacts. I want that more traditional male stoicism and when my emotions don’t line up with that it makes me dysphoric.
This is like a pie chart for me 60% mind dysphoria, 20% social, 20% body
Brain fog, disassociation, frustration, depression, dysphoria can cause a bunch of mental effects. Many known many as yet only theorised to be linked.

Put it this way, pre hrt I was diagnosed with dyspraxia which explained my poor time keeping, poor understanding of time passing, poor hand eye coordination and terrible sleep pattern, since going on hrt all of that has basically gone to the point I probably wouldn't pass a dyspraxia test anymore. 

So fuck knows I'm not a neurologist but I do know my brain just works better on hrt than when I wasn't.
It’s basically your thoughts and emotions causing you dysphoria. For example, transmascs might feel it if they cry easily, feel a lot of empathy/sympathy, are passive, etc. while transfems might feel it if they are cold, distanced, aggressive, etc.
I read it as a dislike of the hormones effects on one's mood. There are many accounts, frankly in both directions, of people being calmer and more at peace with themselves after starting up their hormone of choice. For a significant fraction this effect hits way quicker than physical changes have a chance to manifest. While transfemmes will often talk about feeling a greater depth of emotions and less anger, transmasculine folk tend to report feeling less anxious and more chill as it were.
Biochemical dysphoria is also a thing. My brain literally works better on estrogen. Running it on testosterone was like putting diesel in an unleaded car.
All of it, mix 100% of all three categories into one pot and you get the nastiest dysphoria pie and me right in the center of it
Things like being dysphoric about crying/not being able to cry, subconsciously misgendering/deadnaming yourself, feeling emotions that are stereotypically masculine (anger etc.) or emotions that are stereotypically feminine (vulnerability etc.)
It can be like the emotions you feel (ie, crying too much and feeling too feminine, or being too angry and feeling too masculine), or it can be from things you perceive as feminine or masculine, like how you walk or talk or certain things you're interested in. It's mostly a feeling that your ""soul"" or ""mind"" is too feminine/masculine for some reason.
My social dysphoria kind’ve causes my body one. When I wear a mask, I get seen as male and it’s great. But then it makes me scared to take off my mask because I don’t want to be registered as female. I was once at the gym and I decided to use the male locker room and i left my mask on but because I was wearing a tight shirt (with a binder but I have wide hips and a small waist), I was so scared to get clocked. I mean in retrospect, no one looked at me or cared I was there but there’s still that part of me that thought maybe they were just being polite.
I have all 3, body is easy to understand, social is also pretty obvious, but mind I only really understood when I took hormone blockers.

To me, on Testosterone I had WAY more thoughts of having sex, agression, violence and general disconnection to my feelings. 

I hated feeling aggressive in a ""masculine"" way, (I haven't taken E but I assume the way you experience aggression is different) I hated having aggressive sexual thoughts, I hated having that disconnection from my thoughts... 

Empathy is also impaired while on higher T, in my experience. It's easier to think of people as objects. 

I don't mean to say ""only women have feelings"" but please, understand that hormones have a profound effect on your mind and behavior.

Some people might want those masculine traits, they can be great! Make you more confident and dominant. Less sensitive or prone to crying, most of my FtM friends are happy with those changes.
I get mind dysphoria. I ask my self why am I like this? Why do I have to feel this way. I'm very comfortable wearing feminine clothes and clothes assigned to my birth gender but I have recently also been experienced some body dysphoria
I think it’s like, if you identify as a boy but you get really emotional and cry a lot, you feel like you’re ‘acting like a girl’ which makes you dysphoric
For me it's mostly the masculine conditioning to not cry, especially in public, and deadnaming myself in my thoughts
I 100% have mind dysphoria thinking about it. I feel like my emotions are almost stifled, sometimes. I want to cry or laugh but I just can't get into the full range of emotions I know exists.
See Dara Hoffman-Fox's ""You and Your Gender Identity: A Guide to Discovery"" chapter 12 (specifically pgs 175-177 in my edition). Amazing explanation!
Would an example of mind dysphoria be something like hating how I can never seem to cry?
If we reject the mind-body duality, then mind dysphoria is a form of body dysphoria where the part of your body you're displeased with is your brain: the way hormones affect neurology, the way social pressures have shaped it through neuroplasticity, etc..
bro i gots all 3 cuz i have 0 fem pieces of clothing, literally today i laid in bed and was just cuddling a teddy bear bc i was upset the my dumb masculine body is a fucking square 🟥 and also today as that i've recently become trans, i keep on saying things that my normal male self would say like ""yo"" which isn't really even masculine but my brain dislikes it soooo....
For the mind, I see it as your mind expects one thing, your body does something else. Like, pre-T, I could be confident as hell for public speaking. But the second I heard my voice, it was like an out-of-body, something foreign taking over to come out of my mouth. That would make me blush/shake/etc. Even if my mind was screaming 'I don't give a damn what any of these people think, why is my body doing this?!?!?', it still would go on. Haven't had a single issue with that after starting T. 

Another would be crying when angry or frustrated. The emotions I felt and what my mind said would convey angry or frustrated. But my body would still cry for no reason. That would only increase the anger and frustration. Again, something I haven't had to deal with since starting T. 

So I would say it's from having one expectation that you, well, expect to happen. Only for the dominant hormones in your body to do the opposite. Hope that makes sense and helps you understand it better. (And this is just my take, so it differs person-to-person)
Once a month right before That Time Of The Month, I get terribly sad and lethargic and anxious and confused, and usually have doubts whether I’m trans. Then I start bleeding and I’m like “oh right, that’s a thing that happens to me. I stop making t for a few days.” I can’t wait to actually fucking be stable instead of fighting for it and pretending; I hate this goddamn rollercoaster. I don’t like dealing with emotions bc it makes me fucking exhausted. I used to be so even-keeled as a kid and now I have to fight to act the same throughout the month, because lemme tell you “acting like I’m on my period” gives me dysphoria like nothing else. Except my tits. And birth name. And not having a beard :(
Mm yes all. All- me all.
Pretty lucky overall. Just sometimes my internal self image pixelates I'll get a glimpse in a mirror and be surprised that I look like that already, wow!
50% social, 40% body, and 10% mind for me
Semi-related question: can you be trans/nb without feeling dysphoria?
I feel … seen?
From puberty to when I started presenting fem (about 14 years), I had an almost constant sense of dread - that something just on the edge of my perception was deeply wrong. Gender affirming activities/clothes and estrogen are the only things that have ever made it stop. I'm pretty sure this is largely biochemical dysphoria, a response of my brain expecting estrogen and receiving testosterone.
this really helped me, i never got the bad social dysmorphia but seeing that my mind brain dysphoria is valid really helped me come to terms that not having insane amounts of dysphoria doesnt make me any less trans
To me it was a lot about libido. Male libido terrorised me. The way my brain wanted me to view women disgusted me (am the lesbian) and I missed something - that came with E. Female libido is what I was always after - a fulfilling, emotional experience, my brain finally views women in this fluffy, non-sexualized way.
I get dysphoria from being so emotional, crying a lot, liking certain things etc, because I associate these to be feminine things. I think that can be mind dysphoria?
It's like if you think you're ""too emotional"" cause you're ftm, or ""too angry"" of you're mtf. Or like if you don't get ""only men understand thus joke"" type jokes as ftm, or ""things only women understand"" not making sense when you're mtf. Not sure what the equivalent would be for nb people
I don't feel it, but my best friend (a trans man) does (or used to). He felt really dysphoric about traits he views as feminine. He hated getting emotional, crying, or being ""soft"" because it made him feel womanly. I think that at least in his case it was the effects of toxic masculinity
Hormones have an effect on emotional regulation. Pre E trans women and pre T trans men experience emotions in a way that feels wrong because they're missing a physiologically component that determines how intense those emotions hit them.
For me I know this sometimes manifested less as learned patterns and more as the chemical reactions in my body not lining up with my personality. Before I started HRT testosterone boosts would sometimes affect my emotions or thoughts in ways that gave me a panic attack. I don’t know if anyone else has experienced that.
I'd reformulate the part about mind dysporia as your thoughts and emotions not lining up with your *expected* gender identity. I can see gender roles and/or norms feeding that feeling of discomfort. Heck, at least that's how my dysphoria feels...
Ah, the one I deal with most. When you misgender yourself, when you behave in a way more akin to your AGAB, stuff that nobody else can really witness but you absolutely *hate*.
Yeah, for me, I think I still feel like I can't really act the way I want to because I definitely have those feelings like I'm invading women's spaces. And because of that, I get a lot of dysphoria when I do something remotely masculine. I'm really scared sometimes of seeming like an effeminate gay man. Also, I feel like vocal dysphoria kind of fits into mind as well as body dysphoria because it's a combination of physical characteristics and mannerisms between gestures, character in tone, and even the content of speech.

Recently, I've been thinking about how dysphoria is really not like anything else, and it's a really isolating feeling. So I'm glad I have a lot of people around me that also experience it.
Some could be from stereo type. “Men act/ think this way, women think that way” kind of thing, and emotions could be similar but also there are things like how testosterone makes emotions deeper and harder to express, or how estrogen makes it easier to express them but they’re also more sensitive
I've never really thought about mind dysphoria before but now that I have I definitely feel it.   we had to put down the family dog and my mom and sister were so upset, and I ended up crying because I felt like I should be crying like them but the emotion just wasn't there.
i still dont get how male and female brains are apparently different, it doesnt seem like a real fact, even if it is
Wow this is totally on point. I am going to make this a poster and pin this to my board at work.
Out of the three I mainly contend with emotional dysphoria and much less of the other two.
This inate urge to want so desperately to be a girl. Your feelings, the way you talk to yourself everything is female except for the outside you.
I feel like it might be like how people associate certain emotions with certain genders
plumbus from rick and morty lol
Birth gender
I still don’t understand 😭😭
All of the above.
Add the ""All the above"" box.   


Looking more like I want to and acting more like I always have but more correct to how I like, but the dysphoria and fear is real.
I actually feel like I get mind dysphoria the most. I’m a trans woman but most of the time I have a tough punk tomboy personality and only act super femme when I feel like I have to avoid a complicated social interaction.

It feels fucked up and it gets me in my head, like I’m somehow inappropriate or just not femme enough, but I also know that’s bullshit and I’m valid anyway. I don’t have to act like a ‘daddys girl’ or whatever you want to label it. I’ll kick your ass and I suck dick, come at me.

I guess like all dysphoria there’s ways to manage and counter it but it still fucks with me and it still sucks sometimes. But I am who I am and I won’t apologize for it.
at first i couldn’t understand it at all but then i realized it’s something i’m deeply familiar with. dysphoria relating to emotions, personality traits, etc that are associated with a particular gender. in my case i tend to feel like a failed woman for being too “aggressive” and not empathetic enough.
I’ve got body, and mind and I guess soul if you believe in that thing. My best friend and I were born in the same hospital a few hours apart cuz our parents were friends, and she always felt she was meant to be a man, and me vice versa since as young as we can remember. So 8mm still like 98% sure our souls got swapped somehow or something.
[removed]
for me mind dysphoria is not fitting into the gender stereotype of the gender I identify as , even though I am a typical teen girl (unless I am depressed) I still get mind dysphoria and I cannot express myself as a girl to others,
I have mind dysphasia but tbh I don’t get it either and I think that’s the dysphoria part as well lol
Ur brain says ""this gender acts this way and u don't therefore u aren't who u say u are"" 


Mental health stuff never makes perfect logical sense
Bingo
For me (transfem) it’s things like

* not being able to cry

* feeling emotionally flat

* struggling with empathy

All of these things can be exacerbated by testosterone. Not that all people on testosterone have these issues (or see them as problems) of course but for me it makes me feel dysphoric (depressed, anxious, irritable, etc.) when I can’t access the emotion I’m trying to feel.
Uh, is it bad that I feel all 3?
mind is complex. it goes from emotions you associate with the gender you aren't (like being angry as a trans woman as anger is seen as a more male thing) that when you feel em you get dysphoric. it probably also includes dreams causing dysphoria. like i am on tiddie skittles since a year and i have still dreams where i am a guy and those dreams make me dysphoric. basically anything your mind cooks up that then causes you to feel dysphoric. like for me when i am horny i sometimes feel dysphoric when it's like an aggressive kind of horny that i associate with male. it's honestly really hard to describe cause mind dysphoria is very subjective.
I don't know. Maybe like. Having some dysphoria over having interests that align with their birth sex? I don't really understand it either lol.
behaviors we do, it's pretty simple actually, social is when others don't perceive you correctly, body is when your body doesn't define you correctly, mind is when your behaviors don't define correctly. for example if your agab is female you might feel dysphoria doing things or playing roles that are stereotypically feminine, or having feminine behaviors, interests, or emotions. a lot of people understand what this is but don't know it's dysphoria
Oh wow I had no idea mind dysphoria was even an aspect but that makes SO much sense for me personally! Thank you for sharing. It's hard to put into words but I'll have a think and try later.
Aaand i feel all of these
for me its 40% social 30% body and 30% mind
I don't really suffer from any if them thankfully
I have them all, amazing
Uhm- is it bad I feel all three-
This idea has intrigued me for like a year (since I first saw this image). I think it hits right at a super critical core, but I've not really been able to explore this at all from my single point of view, and I can't find any writings or discussions about categorizing dysphoria or exploring commonalities in a more structured way
I felt gross and masc in my mind but since starting hrt 5.5 months ago my mind is the one type of dysphoria that has totally vanished. I feel great in terms of emotions. Not that I'm saying I always have positive emotions (they're mostly not) but the way I feel them is gender affirming now. Most of the negative emotions are from the other kinds of dysphoria though 🙃
The mind one i think is if you feel sad or emotional (stereotypically feminine qualities) but you identify as male, that kinda thing maybe
My mind dysphoria mostly consists of residual self-image, when my theatre of mind automatically creates an image of myself that looks like egg-me, making me dysphoric. Or my inner voice sounding like my actual voice because my brain can't picture what I might sound like on T one day. When I read a chat log between me and another person and my brain goes funky fem on my own lines, that hurts. 

On the emotional side it's just tiresome to be so extremely peak-valley all the goddamn time and I hope to find more balance when I get on T.

In general I have a hard time ""feeling like a man"" against the whole dysphoria package that I carry.
It's the social dysphoria for me, mainly cuz A) I am not in a stage of my transition where I could even hope to pass and B) My outside family doesn't even know I'm trans
I get this tbh. I notice it most in the way me (pre T) and my cis process our emotions, and it makes me really dysphoric. It's like, even if we feel the same level of emotion, I am so much quicker to well up with tears without wanting to. It's an uncontrollable thing, but he simply doesn't get this, despite being an emotional person. 

It's like the automatic response I believe to be because of the hormones - you hear about transmen finding it harder to cry on T. 

So yeah, I guess we're referring to the emotional impact of the wrong hormones. Period moods/pre mentrual syndrome is another example for me personally.
The first two, got punished for it a lot as a child so I keep my mind/emotions under tight control to ""fit in"".  I suspect that has a lot to do with why I tend to be introverted.
Mind would probably be able to be explained as ftms getting really emotional pre-HRT and since that emotional thing is stereotypically a feminine thing  it causes dysohoria
I have huge body dysphoria
Maybe it's supposed to be about your interests and stuff as well as emotion? Like a trans guy feeling dysphoric about himself because he cries a lot and likes makeup idk
The mind one confuses the fuck out of me, ngl.
Oh. Oh joy. I have three types.
Wow i only knew an edited meme version of this where mind dysphoria is replaced with mario. Just mario
[deleted]
When in need of a cry my mind goes man up and I cant cry so I sit in sadness. Idk if that exactly it but that's my take.
My experience with mental dysphoria was a goddamn terror. Any time I acted as I assumed a birth-gender self would act or indulged a birth-gender aligned interest or adopted a posture or took part in an activity I aligned with my birth gender in any way? I would spend the next several hours to several days invalidating myself and my trans experience. It sometimes still gets to me but it's less so now, and far less often... How'd I do it?

1. Internalizing the fact that ultimately, all gender roles are constructed phantoms enforced by a society that ultimately uses those cues to imply and defend a power structure which I already don't agree with. There is no singular trait or activity or state of thought which must necessarily belong to any given gender experience.
2. Recognizing that in relation to my own system of definitions, however arbitrary, I have a gender that is fluid. My experience of my mental gender can and will change over time, sometimes as a slow trickling current, and sometimes as a crashing wave.
3. That within that fluidity of gender experience, along with the internalized precept above, my presentation and my interests and my actions can either defy the conventions of my momentary gender or conform to those conventions *and that both outcomes can be desirable at different times in different situations.*
4. That my comfort with or need for any label can and will shift as my experience of gender shifts in different times and environments, and that this is *also* a valid aspect of my evolving self concept.
5. That an attachment to the act of transition, or to any label, and the striving to conform to the conventions of a gender or label which I am more comfortable with on average was actively harmful to my sense of self, to my mental health, and to my ability to honor my own momentary experience.

So now? When people ask questions about gender experience from a trans feminine, non-binary, gender fluid, quazi masculine, or bi-gender perspective? I answer as I feel my experience is relevant rather than restraining and confining myself to stay in a single lane. I am not in a single lane. And it is no wonder that at times when I refused to accept this about myself that I caused myself such incredible pain for not conforming to a set of arbitrary self-imposed restrictions which I adopted not to please myself, but for the sake of being easy for others to understand.

Now, for those of you suffering mental dysphoria... I'm not saying ""accepting that you are non-binary/genderfluid is the answer to mental dysphoria."" It might not be for you. But I am suggesting there's a good chance that internalized transphobia, gender essentialism, misogyny, or misandry is a factor in why you find certain thoughts and attitudes to be aligned to a gender which you don't experience. Understanding why you perceive a passing thought or experience as necessarily unaligned with your gender is key to defeating this monster. Because ultimately? Its a puff of smoke. It's something you were taught and conditioned to feel which you probably already don't intellectually believe. 

Alienate your ""self"" from that experience and apply it to a hypothetical ""other"" if you can. Ask yourself if it would make this hypothetical other invalid or less their own gender if it happened to them. It's a great way to highlight how often the last holdout of toxic gender attitudes are self-applied standards we would never dream of putting on someone else.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. This ramble has been brought to you by genderpunk.
Have a wonderful weekend everyone 🌹
It hits me more as like, the ""man"" emotions that were beaten into me as a kid. My inability to cry, being forced to be angry instead of compassionate so on. It's taken me years to unlearn some of this stuff but I still think like ""oh a woman wouldn't react like this in this situation so clearly I'm still a man"" and it's pretty hard
Like when you imagine you in a situation and imagine yourself as a gender that doesn't align with your identity. Happens to me a lot when I have more impressions of women in that particular thing and just can't really imagine a man etc in that situation (motherly stuff for example)
I thought everyone had all of these. Interesting.
On example from a trans femme: being AMAB often times you’re taught or encouraged not to show lots of emotion and hold things in. Or discouraged from showing emotions in a stereotypical “feminine” way (I put that in quotes because while there is a feminine stereotype there is no one way to be feminine). Basically this conditioning makes you have a really flat affect and makes you feel very unemotional when you otherwise might want to be. And once you start transitioning you often start expressing your emotions in a more “feminine” way which can alleviate a lot of dysphoria. While some emotions even may be negative, if they feel gender affirming it will usually lessen dysphoria. Another example would be how you talk to other people. Again from a trans femme perspective before I came out to certain people, talking certain ways as an amab person caused people to view me as a cis-gay man. While there’s obviously nothing wrong with being gay, I don’t want to be a cis-man. I’m a woman and want to be viewed like that. But after coming out, me addressing my friends like “hey girl” or “hey bestie/bae” is just seen as girly. Which can be very gender affirming because you realize people are now viewing you as the gender you really are and want to be. Rather your AGAB. Ofc this is only from a trans femme experience I can’t really speak on transmasc stuff as I’m not transmasc
I know I'm transfemme. At least I'm pretty sure. But my social dysphoria at being considered a guy is low. Maybe it's because I realised it a couple months ago and no one has actually especially treated me like a guy since then, or it's because socially being a woman just gives me anxiety right now.

Which basically adds up to the fact that I just present as genderqueer/non-binary a little bit, and am thinking of recognising myself as such for the near future. I have no idea if that'll work out.
I haven't heard of this term but I feel that I experience it. Like sometimes I get frustrated with how I emotionally react because I think things like ""a guy wouldnt act like this or think this"" generally i try to push these thoughts away though because they unnecessarily reinforce gender stereotypes? but even so I do feel I experience it
Gotta catch them all !
like for me it's when my voice suddenly gets too high or the ""accent"" that women speak in ifyk what I mean. or when I suddenly walk with my hips swaying.or my hands being extra campy. like for me, in my mind I'm ....me . but I wanna be seen as NOT feminine if not masculine. so it's like a loop inside my head that goes on and on.
I feel like mind dysphoria is more precipitated by the type of gender that is fought hard against by feminists given that there is no real difference beteen minds
sort of like how you react if you do something that is stereotypically of your agab, like sometimes i look at a typically feminine clothing and want it then in my head i go “AAAA im a girl no no”
i have all of them💀
Types of Gender Dysphoria*

I have Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria and it has nothing to do with being trans and everything to do with being Neurodivergent (ADHD) and a total failure and loser and having everyone hate me.  God why do I even exist?
The mind thing seems like something that can stem from either of the two!
(From the perspective of a trans male)
“I’m getting so emotional, that’s for girls.”
“Why am I so shy, aren’t boys supposed to be strong and fearless?”
“I should stop liking art and get more interested in something like football. That’s what boys are supposed to like”
I feel all this every time
still cis tho
almrd D:, nunca pensé en la disforia social, siempre pensé que mi disforia de cuerpo fue muy baja pero considerando la social me doy cuenta que tengo mas de la que pensaba .\_.
WAIT WHAT??!?! 
THIS COUNTS AS DYSPHORIA?!
I thought I was just weird! Like, speaking in a high voice whenever I'm meeting new people. Or when I walk in a flowncy way. Or how I act all flirty and low-key promiscuous to get people's attention to prove I'm pretty. Not to mention I took this test online hoping it'd say my behavior was like masculine or androgenous or undetermined and got super super uncomfortable when I found I act like a woman. My behaviors are passive and sweet and nice like a woman. But I'm not a woman. I'm just me. And me not being overly confident is seen as a feminine trait. I really wanted for my behavior to be masculine. Or at least not feminine. 
Wow.
I think the ""bro nod"" (rather than the little hand wave women do) is an example of such behavior that can induce dysphoria, right?
OH.
This is where it started for me.

“Boys don’t plan ahead”

“Boys don’t say stuff like that.”

“Boys would never think this way.”

“Boys would not think this maturely.”

“Boys wouldn’t think about marriage they’d think about sex!”

Mmmmmm I was such an egg!! Wish I wouldn’t known sooner
Isn't that what's described by social though? Genuine question.
BRO THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING, I HAD NO IDEA THIS EXISTED
In spite of the third b\*tch in the image, I like to think that making d\*ck jokes doesn't make me any less femme.
You described it damn near perfect
 Thank You
As a trans man, pre-T: I cry whenever I get angry, frustrated, sad or overwhelmed and it makes me really dysphoric. T is gonna make me cry less probably
Anger is everyone's game but it's how you choose to express the anger whether you're masculine or feminine. Women will stereotypically verbally joust each other while men will just straight out fight. Of course, this is all bullshit because, when I was in high school, girls fought more than boys. I once saw a girl slam another girl's head into the lunchroom table. The guys did fight, yes, but it was rare and it was never at school.

The women of my hometown are vicious and would kick anyone's ass that tried to pick a fight with them. It's probably why I like MMA, martial arts, and HEMA so much and associate sword fighting with feminity for some reason.

Sorry if I went on a rant. I just realized why I might like fighting as much as I do, though I would do everything I can to never fight and always watch fighting
That’s a great, brief description. I’d say it kind of feels like my mind is operating in black and white instead of color (not my eyesight but my emotions mostly). 

I’d probably include the way my mind processes attraction in mind dysphoria, too.
yeah T did this to me and getting rid of it fixed it. one of my favorite effects of HRT
I love this explanation! That's so similar to how I feel. Or have felt. I feel so much better being on E and spiro. So much less aggression. So much more euphoria. HRT feels like the medication I should have been taking my entire life. It's literally a lifesaver and a lifegiver. :)
Women are not extra special creatures with more depth of feeling than men.  That idea sounds terribly misandrist, not to mention leaning on misogynist stereotypes of women being ""irrational"" feelers.
this was a rlly good comment thread to read; idk how to put it into words but like. It was just a good discussion.
Holy Heaven, I DO have dysphoria!
This. Sometimes I even wake up dysphoric because I had a dream where I presented as a man. I'm MTF by the way
I'm trying to get the male voice out of my head. It's Sooo hard though, what's the best way to do this?
I feel this in my bones but just didn’t know the right term for it until now.
Oh i have this as well! I feel so awful right after I'm angry at someone.
Literally this, the bain of my existance
Came here to say pretty much this 👏
I recently learned some neat information that might suit you too. About 70% of our thoughts during the day we simply think out of routine. I found this can also impact how I think about myself and That there are some pretty outdated self images at play. It’s important to stop at these moments, if one realises it, and make a conscious effort to break the pattern.
[deleted]
This hurts. Literally, I'm agender and I get gender euphoria (ironically for someone who doesn't have a gender) from androgyny or people being unable to determine my gender. 

Literally, I didn't realize how bad my mental dysphoria was. Especially with my emotions; I get uncomfortable that I cry like a baby over everything. (Literally, I was watching Ratatouille where it had the scene ""I pretend to be a rat for my dad. I pretend to be a human for Linguini. I pretend you exist so I have someone to talk to. I know who I am! Why do I need to pretend?!"". It's a movie. About a rat chef. And I was bawling my eyes out. 🤦‍♂️). And when I feel happy, it feels so feminine and innocent. It's seen as feminine and I'm like ""Why can't I just feel happy androgynously?""

But at the same time, literally any time I feel angry, it feels so masculine and destructive and I'm like ""Noo. Why can't I just not feel angry all scary like?!""
Not to mention that I get uncomfortable when I repress my emotions and try to appear like things aren't bothering me, it's seen as masculine. There is no winning for me. 

Like, I just want to stop being overly emotional but not cold or detached or stoic like stereotypical, toxic masculinity or masculine in general. 
But yeah. Emotions are a big source of dysphoria.
I thought I was the only one. I also hate myself whenever I act feminine
I get anxious and start crying and then it feels like two juxtaposed feelings. The anxiety, and on top of it now I'm angry because anxiety made me cry and I really very very much don't like it. And then it spirals down to unworthiness, and a sense of being a failure because I want to be reliable but I only could get anxious AND also cry over it. And now I feel angry and disgusted upon myself, like, self-loathing because I really didn't want to act like that, but it seems to not be in my control to do otherwise.
Do you say that some of that disgust and self-loathing that makes me beat myself up (sometimes not so metaphorically even :c ) when I'm anxious or emotionally fragile might come from gender dysphoria????? O crap, that would explain a WHOLE bunch of stuff.
me too! it makes sense now thank you
The crying thing is on point for me but the oposite as a trans woman. I sit in sadness that I wish could just come out in tears then making me more sad and also less able to cry the more I think about it. Even perpetuating things like man up in my head it's horrible. And when dysphoria use to make me sad alot it was like an endless cycle at first
Once you go on T, you might not be able to cry at all anymore. You're gonna miss it then, believe me.

Personally not being able to cry feels more 'me' but it's also a source of emotional disregulation that causes problems down the line.
For me 70% body; 20% social; and lastly, 10% mind dysphoria
[deleted]
For me it's like 50% body, 30% social, and 20% mental.
35/35/30
It's really hard to separate it in percentage because I feel strong dysphoria in every aspect. Not necessarily in the same degree, nor in the same time. It depends in my mood, but when I'm relax, it tend to be like: 40% mind, 40% social and 20% body.

If I have to go outside, it's 70% social, 30% body

When I'm looking at myself, 50% mind and 50% body
Same, mind is definitely the strongest (for me). I feel like it is also the most difficult to describe to others, at least from my limited experience.
50% mind, 30% body, 20% social
Mines like 50% body, 40% and social 10% mind
For me I feel like it is 50% social dysphoria, 30% body and 20% mind. Interesting how it can be so different!
50% social, 40% body, 10% mind
Same here, no dyspraxia but all sorts of issues and trauma from extreme prem birth at 25 weeks gestation in June 1982, brain and general health are way better on HRT than not, started hrt initially to both separately stop menopausal symptoms I had since age 7/8 or so, depression set in at puberty and gender envy kicked in then too, didn't have words for gender dysphoria or anything until I put dots together age 19/20, only got onto hrt age 37.5 in Dec 2019, now way better and wish I'd started earlier so I didn't have to suffer health issues and more for so long
Are you sure it might not have been ADHD?

Since it manifests differently depending on the hormones in your body.
My very goodness, I'm spamming this post because everything is so informative and explains so much!
I'm autistic, don't have a dyspraxia diagnosis but I know I have it because I experience all the things that you refer since I was a little kid. I very much really hate that from myself, ever since I didn't knew what it was. And while I'm  down for neurodiversity and autism acceptance, I just can't with the dyspraxia related stuff and the complications it brings. It sends me to a downward spiral of anger, anxiety, self doubt and self-loathing that I've already described on a previous comment to this very post. And also have disassociation episodes. 
Are you saying that HRT can be helpful? Where can I start  looking for information about this?
Yeah!!!! There's a lot of mental effects that come from dysphoria like that, poor memory and brain fog as well as depression symptoms are all of the big stuff for me. (Edit: I forgot one of the biggest ones: super low energy!! Spoon theory stuff very much resonates with me and I think mind dysphoria is part of why) 

Turns out when your brain is expecting certain levels of certain chemicals and hormones but is getting way too much of one and way too little of another, that causes a lot of subconscious brain issues!! (Thats all afaik). 

And as you said, brain works better on hrt, when your brain is getting the right amount of hormones it's expecting and was designed to receive, the effects of that not being the case for so long start to clear! That's how I see it at least :p
I struggle with my cold distanced and aggressive thoughts. I don’t like them and they make me unhappy but I’d say that’s from being socialized as a male. Ever since coming out I’ve just wanted to embrace the feelings I was told young that weren’t ok for AMAB such a crying and just being an emotional person I’m slowly becoming more in touch with how I really feel inside.
Could you elaborate on this further?
I don't want to be more dominant. But I feel like my body and mind are hypersensitive and generate a huge heavy lot of emotional load that I don't even manage to process properly. It's excessive. Heck, as I write this tears come on their own from all the explanations and info I got from this post.
Could you paraphrase it?
FVCK I LITERALLY STARTED IT WITH ""BRO"" WTF
Yes, it does make so much sense that I can't keep myself from spamming this post, while crying and pillow punching. I make sense. This that happened to me for more than thirty years is something that can be described. Holy heck I make sense. I don't know if I like which sense do I make (hence the pillow-punching) but this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle I needed to know what was going on all these years.
This but with hormonal cycles related to periods. I feel like absolute crap for a week, until the red banner drops. As I'm so very much disconnected from my body, that I always fail to calculate when it will be, even when it makes me feel so unwell.
They aren't? They maybe different in a minimal way in relation to grey matter white matter ratio, but other than that very minimal ill important subject, it's all hormones.
By the way I'm unlucky mostly it's just mods banning me without even reaching anyone
Where is my price ???
I don't hate you I don't know you but I definitely don't hate you
I completely understand this feeling. But if it helps, try to remember that all of these things are mostly societal stereotypes that actually have very little to do with your gender. There are plenty of cis men that act feminine and are still considered men. Your actions and mannerisms are what make you, you and I don’t think you should change your personality to fit society’s expectations of what a man or masculine person should be, because in all likelihood your personality and mannerisms are beautiful and handsome and wonderful.  

It’s just my opinion so feel free to completely discount it, but I think it is society that should change, certainly not you. But, of course, never discount or invalidate your feelings either, whatever they may be.

Much love xx
You described my habits pretty perfectly. It's nice to know I'm not alone :)
I mean speaking in a higher voice when meeting new people isn't a feminine thing. It's a social anxiety thing. Like when I'm in public, I have a ""Public voice"" vs the voice I use with my family and friends
... wait what do you mean ""act like a woman""?
I *hate* the bro nod ._. when I catch myself doing it I'm basically done talking to whoever I nodded to, because if I keep talking to them I won't stop thinking about whether or not they think of me as masculine
I usually just respond to the bro nod with the wave and most of my dude friends respond to the wave with the bro nod. Nobody seems too upset by it so I guess it works.
I'm the exact opposite, I cannot stop waving to people with cute girly wave. I wanna bro nod. Every time I see my friends I wave even tho I wanna nod because that is seen as more masculine. My dumb mind.
Ah, not ""bro""...
I relate to this! Before T I had issues of crying at a time I really didn’t want to cry. Like when I’m standing up for myself. But I couldn’t cry when I wanted to!
Now on T I can both cry when I want to and not cry when I don’t want to. It’s great!
[deleted]
T definitely makes it harder to cry. I've only been on spiro for around a month but I've already found the mental block that always made it so hard to cry has lifted. Im not sad more often, its just that I'm crying when I actually feel I need to now.

Now on to estradiol so I can really become a mess 😁🙃
cismen also do this, though toxic masculinity has informed us that it's not ok to cry. I'd encourage not looking at crying as something to be ashamed of, regardless of gender.
It's not necessarily how you express the anger, but also largely how you feel it.  In my experience.  The shift seems subtle but I feel really different when I'm angry than before I was on E.
[deleted]
Yeah, we know, but gender is very closely relates with society steriotypes, and dysphoria is not rational, so a person that grew their entire life hearing that boys don't cry and girls are fragile, will have dysphoria with this patriarcal imposed toughts, even if dislike them and know that you can cry as a boy and be tough as a girl.
This. It can be tempting to dislike anything male but you should love men for who they are, like your father. He created you, surely you wouldn't be better off if he was self loathing and depressed. For he wouldn't have met your mother to begin with.
the issue with the idea of irrational feelers is that rationality and emotionality aren't mutually exclusive, unlike what most people think...
Yet people who are in the last months of pregnancy and who have just given birth cry far more easily than people who don’t have those levels of estrogen and progesterone.  Hormones have real effects on emotional experience.
Now that's a very interesting thing.... I tend to not remember what I dream. But when I do, I don't experience ""gender"" and just don't see myself.
[deleted]
No problem. And honestly? That would be really nice, I’d gladly swap
That’s almost exactly what it’s like for me. I have pretty bad anxiety that manifests by making me cry over the smallest stressful incidents. I remember once I was in meeting with one of my professors about my honors thesis and he was giving me constructive feedback. It wasn’t anything rude, it was actually rather nice but I got so anxious about it that I literally started crying. I hated that so much because I *knew* I shouldn’t be crying over this, I didn’t want to be crying over this, but I just couldn’t control my own body. It felt so wrong and made me so angry with myself. I wanted to be stoic and in control.
T does not make a person unable to cry. Maybe you aren’t able to cry because you’ve psychologically convinced yourself that it makes you unable to cry, but this is very extreme for something that doesn’t happen. Ask a cis guy if he can cry, he may say he doesn’t die to social stigma… but he still cries. The only cis guy I’ve ever known who couldn’t cry also had ASPD, a disorder that makes it hard for him to feel emotions. T does not make someone unable to cry. You might want to see if there’s other issues going on, or if this truly is the case for you, you might wanna tell a doctor about that. 

I’m not here to force you to do things with your life, but I don’t want people to keep believing inaccuracies. Another comment explained dpdr and dysfunctional biochemistry, pretty well! Here it is if you are interested; https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/uu9zzs/i_really_dont_get_the_mind_dysphoria_part_can/i9fjels/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

I’m not trying to invalidate anyones experience here, just trying to shed some light on a misconception!
We have the same percentages but in reverse lol, for me socially it’s 70% and 20% body
This happens to me when I sometimes get to use masculine pronouns for myself. Like, I know I love it, I know I can relate better to my emotions and to physical sensations when I treat myself as a masculine subjectivity. Then I get up, dress up, look in the mirror and it just feels a thing so illogical to do, that I end up not doing it.
Yea if I was to sum hrt mentally up for me, it qas like waking up from a bad dream, you know like those dreams where everything just not quiet right, everything just off and distressing.
Dunno, and getting diagnosed as an adult in the UK is as long a wait list as the gender service waits soo....
It helped me, my sleeping is alot better, depression is gone, still got some anxiety but that's mostly from society, terfs e.t.c kinda normal stuff to be anxious about, I bump into less stuff, more aware of time passing, not disassociated.

I'd say ur best bet is to talk to specialist in gender dysphoria or try hrt if you can get it.
I don't want to sound medicalist about this - some people talk about ""male"" and ""female"" brains but I don't think it's really accurate or helpful in terms of trans issues.

However, some people's brain structures can end up forming in a way where they're expecting a biochemical environment dominant in different hormones to the one the body produces. Not every cell in our body is the same, has the same DNA or the same organelles.

In my case it manifested as dissociation. I felt disconnected from my body sometimes, like my mind was a passenger in a meat suit. I now feel so much more connected to and in tune with myself on estradiol.
Really roughly. These are snippets I took from it:

""Mental discomfort can be difficult to pinpoint and describe because. It's been there so long that you have gotten used to itYou figure it must be the way you are supposed to be feeling and you just need to live with it. You don't know what else to attribute that feeling to.

Some statements that show mental dysphoria:

I had no idea how much irritability/dissatisfactin/stress I was feeling on a regular basis until I...
I didn't know how depressed/anxious I actually was until I...
I never knew how much I wasn't 'me' until I...
I had no clue how cluttered my mind has been all my life until I...
Having to wear 'guy' clothes to work didn't bother me (or at least I didn't think I did) until I...
I didn't realize how disconnected I was from my body, myself, my life, until I...""

(This is an awesome book, by the way:)


I've also heard it called indirect dysphoria, managed dysphoria, etc .... Some great articles on indirect dysphoria are:

let's normalize women using bro tbh
Bro, if it helps, I'm AFAB Agender and saying things like ""Bro, dude, yo"" all the time. 
I know it might not mean much but I do it all the time. 
Stay safe, kid.
I like this 💕
I don't know if you meant to but you made my day. (And low-key cry a little /pos)
The fact that cis men can still act feminine or have feminine mannerisms and people don't think they're women. The fact that even if I act feminine like a woman, that doesn't make me a woman and doesn't automatically mean people will see me as a woman either. Just Sam with feminine qualities about them. Just the fact that I don't necessarily have to change for people to see me as me or to 'pass' is just really comforting. More than I thought it would be.

Thank you for your kind words. 
I hope you have a good day today. 
Thank you again. 😊😁
Hold up. So that like voice that I see women do when  meeting new people is social anxiety? Ooo double fuck.
Apparently there's things that qualify as ""Feminine behavior"" which is why I ""act like a woman"". 

This is things like:

Being shy and passive 
Being quiet and not outspoken
Not being overly confident or lacking confidence in yourself
Crying a lot/ emotional
Talkative
Not very analytical or logical.
Not being blunt when talking to others. 
Nurturing
Empathic 
Gentle
Vulnerable 

(A little example from the Wiki on Female Behavior:)
Traits such as nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding have been cited as stereotypically feminine.

So basically, If you act like any or majority of these, people will naturally see your behavior as feminine or ""acting like a woman"".
don't worry, it gets better after a while. I still sometimes do it out of habit, but regularly interacting with a small friend group of mostly women really helped me learn the hand wave.
So do I.
I always nodded, and felt terribly uncomfortable when as a kid my family tried to pressure me into waving. I've been nagged endlessly because of that. Until some day when nagging just kind of stopped and I don't know why. But it was like, 1994 and I was eight and we did knew nothing about gender.
I'm astonished.
Oh my apologies that's my default response. Please forgive me
Ah that's great!
I get that!
I know cismen also cry but it is a fact that hormones heavily influence the way you experience emotions.
I've experienced the same thing. The best way I can put it is that it's like the difference between frying and baking certain foods, like potatoes. Both methods cook the food and the end results taste mostly the same, but there are still slight but noticeable differences that can completely change the experience.
I'd describe it as actually being angry, instead of being mad.

Before getting on E any time I was angry I would fall into a type of blind rage, logic didn't mean anything and I'd trip over my own thoughts trying to stay angry and keep that adrenaline flowing. After 2 months on E I can say that the anger is truly anger. It is directed, it is pointed, it has a known source, and it is easily defused. Anger is now a feeling, not an activity.
No worries.  Sometimes its less that I'm sure a person meant X than I'm worried someone would infer X from what someone else says so I jumped in to clarify what I think is an important bit not to miss about gender stuff.
The thing is it's not necessarily clear it's T vs E as much as it is compatible vs incompatible hormones in the brain. Many transfem people have dpdr pre-transition and then when taking E it alleviates. Same for transmascs - they often have dpdr before taking T. It's not that E is the emotional hormone and T is the unemotional one. It's that dysfunctional biochemistry in our brains leads to messed up emotions.
True.  I just feel like for everyone's sake people should strive against the ugly stuff the culture puts in our collective heads.  Accepting that men are emotional is important for their health and everyone else's.  Part of the hammer terfs swing us is that we can't possibly be as good and moral as ""real"" women because we, being men in their eyes, lack something vital and essential in our feelings and moral processes.
I don't think it's the estrogen, I think it's the raised hormones in general.

(P.S. I'm not trying to start a fight, I know this string of comments holds some tension but I didn't mean to add any in my comment.)
Thank you.
Yep, was brain fog and bad dream for me and trying everything to get the body to be in sync with the mind (body felt stuffed and slow and the  mind was racing all the time too fast, nothing internally was in balance or homeostasis), 

realised pot brought things into balance but only lasted so long, alcohol was good for calming the brain but wasn't good for when driving...and tobacco was nasty despite being a good stress reliever at the time; 

then I started listening to my body when I was stoned/drunk and clicked that I needed something and that everything was off balance, that I was drinking and smoking for medicinal purposes rather than to purely get stoned or pissed, that realisation was in my early 20s when I first came out (but didn't get onto hrt though), 

Stopped social transition because I felt others were judging me and I second guessed myself and fell to the pressure of parents and all (this was 2003-2005 here in New Zealand, then came out again and onto hrt in 2013 when I was 31/32, instantly felt better but didn't have progesterone (since learnt that progesterone stops addiction issues due to hormonal imbalance...), Back into the closet in 2014, then age 37.5 in Dec 2019 came out again, started hrt, cut ties with my parents and started living my life for me, since then everything has been great!
Holy Wow!! That sounds super cool! I didn't even know that was a thing! 
So basically it's kinda like your brain is built for, in your case, estrogen and whatnot. 
Like running a petrol car on diesel or something. Or employing a lawyer to do construction work. Put the lawyer in a court room with a law suit and the lawyer does better. Wow! Well I'm hella glad that estrogen helped you out so much 😊😁
Literally, this is something that needs to happen more often.
I don't use bro, I think at all, but dude is something I think I've used pretty much interchangeably for a while, along side ""you guys"" when referring to a group. Might just be me though lol
thank you 🥹
No problem, any time mate. I’m really glad it helped and you’ve made my day in turn!

Have a great one xx
I think it can be both depending on the person
I mean potentially. When you meet new people, you put up a facade, whether you mean to or not. You don't wanna show your true self because they might not like you, so you inherently put up that facade. That facade could be anything. How you sit, your expressions, or how you talk. For some reason, lots of people think a higher pitched voice is a ""nicer"" tone. I don't know the psychology behind it.
You mean I'm a Girl? Well, Hallelujah! ☺️ 😉
I think that's pretty sexist ngl
I'm the only woman at my job and have no time for social situations so I have to kill the nod when everyone nods
Sure, though our bodies know the best way we personally need to discharge emotions so they don't get suppressed. Suppressing emotions results in worse outcomes (anxiety, depression, etc) and having something like an anger outburst due to ""behaving successfully as a male"" is only perpetuating more societal issues and isn't helping anyone.
Funny, because even though I'm the exact opposite, this was also how it was like for me. Pre-T I was easily irritable and easy to anger. It was pretty intense, but usually converted to depression, randomly, and I'd usually ""rage cry"". Now not only has T seriously mellowed me out and fixed a whole lot of brain issues, but I'd say I feel anger more ""normally"". It's directed and has an obvious source, and is so much easier to manage and defuse. And I don't wanna break down every time I'm simply mad anymore, which is all a major win.
This!
Yes, you are right, we need to overcome this concepts in general, but when dysphoria strikes you can't be rational and think better, terfs are shit and many of this type of dysphoria come from what they say.

So, terfs deserve jail and people struggling with dysphoria need support and a safe environment where those aged concepts of gender are irrelevant.
Alot of the really is vlose to how I've experienced things! It's like a hitch or a lag in the pace of my brain and the pace of my body, also everything felt stiff like I couldn't move properly like I was 70 years old at just 15. Could never place wtf was wrong! Got diagnosed with dyspraxia as alot of it fit but was never the full picture. 

Went down the booze and drugs road, alcohol helped, then it took more and more to help, then came coke, and spiraling, and other issues and more destructive way to cope, then last September I had breakdown confessed everything to my gf, expected what I'd feared that had kept me in the closet for so long that everyone would reject me and I was fully just ready to finish what I started 10 years earlier with my first unalive attempt, but I was suprised, my gf excepted me, told me she's bi and loves me what ever gender, sister was next she accepted me then I told a few freinds only 1 ended up being a royal dick but he was also the one that introduced me to coke so fuck him, told my mum and she accepts me, not only that she allready knew.... she'd worked it out when I was 10.... just didn't know what to do or to ask or push it and as I'd never said anything she just left it........ 

I was lucky I had the funds to go private for hrt and thank god for gendergp, I know there not perfect but they had me on E within 3 weeks, I'd have not survived the 5 year wait on the nhs, I've been clean off drugs since last October, E and prog helped I've had no cravings at all tbh, still can't kick tobacco and I have a drink once or twice a month but that for pleasure nit to feel normal. Life is fucking fantastic tbh, yea the terf bullshit in the UK gets me down, and goverment is transphobic as hell and I'd love far more physical changes and all that and I'd love to just pass but tbh, that's all secondary for me, my brain finaly is normal.
Exactly!

And I want to emphasise feeling that way doesn't make someone trans or not trans. It isn't a prerequisite. It's definitely a thing, though.
yeah and my very cis girl friend uses “bro” and “dude” loads
The fact this makes so much sense though it it just clicked. Wow. Thank you so much for writing about this. I really appreciate it. /g
😁😊
Happy to help 😁😊
It is. Very much is. Rooted in a lot of ""women have to act this way"" and ""men have to act this way"". Lot of patriarchy fucking things up. 
That's part of the reason why I'm so glad to see cis men doing things like painting their nails and wearing skirts and dresses. Not because of aesthetic reasons but because I'm happy that they're happy being themself and are unlearning sexist, toxic masculinity shit. 
Sadly, dysphoria doesn't care 🙃
I'd never want to suppress emotions. I don't know where you got that idea
Yup, yup.  I'm satisfied everyone is on the right page now so I'll toddle off now.
Yes, the passing and all is secondary for me too, having a brain that feels normal and that works and works well is so beautiful! 

I bought a vape and cut down tobacco with that, then eventually I gave up for an initial 3 months (everything (booze, pot, tobacco) and then I drank for pleasure, not to function, pot maybe once a week or so (one cone only it seems - have found it doesn't do much to me nowadays, and no tobacco any more (smoked since I was 17 til I was 39 so am very happy to have kicked that habit considering my underdeveloped lungs and all since being born at 25 weeks gestation))
You're welcome!
🙂😍
Avoiding crying is a form of suppressing emotions
[deleted]
Which is something I do not do nor advocate
Yup.  Wanna see my badge?

Edit: Ah, sorry, that's glib.  Sorry for being an ass.  I just worried people were taking the wrong idea about how emotions for men are.  A lot of guys commit suicide because people don't allow them to vent their emotions.  They just suppress until the explode.
From your original comment, that seemed to be intended purpose. Because T doesn't take away the response of wanting to cry but makes it more difficult to (and it's not always a guarantee people will respond to it all the same, anyway), which is why I'm saying for dysphoria reasons it's best to complicate what crying means and make it a point of pride rather than something shameful."	uu9zzs	trans	2677	0.99	2022-05-20 22:58:42

Wanna pm and talk about it?

Sure!
Learn how to compliment, telling people ""hey I would like feel you up"" isn't a compliment, and if you think it is you're delusional. Its fucking weird and creepy, stop.

Ohhh, so I'm the one looking for attention and when someone gets ""flirty"" it's my fault? Nice victim blaming. Tell me, are we on a dating sub? Where people are meant to try and flirt with others? Or is this a sub where people go to find support and to try a lift up others? Yeah its all my fault you were trying to creepily flirt with me on a sub that is not for that. If you're coming here to flirt, you're at the wrong place. Also how THE FUCK am I supposed to read that as anything else?? Has that crossed your smooth brain or is that still a few miles behind the ""how to compliment without sounding like a creepy fuck"" train of thought?

can we please normalize not having bottom dysphoria?	Seriously. Some of the comments and judgments I get when I say I have zero plans to get bottom surgery are insane. I love what I have going on downstairs. I don't need bottom surgery to dictate how authentically female I am.	"This subreddit supports any trans person. This includes:

- People who do want surgery.
- People who don't want surgery.
- People who do want HRT.
- People who don't want HRT.
- People who do want social/legal transition.
- People who don't want social/legal transition.

etc.


If you're someone who wants to judge others on their transition choices, this is not the subreddit for you. Anyone caught telling someone who they are, what they are, or telling someone what they should want, you will be actioned on. This is a **SAFE SPACE** and we will make sure that people feel that way here.
You’re right! It’s stupid that some people try to determine other people’s transness when it doesn’t concern them.
nobody needs any surgery to dictate how much of an authentic trans person they are. equating a trans person's validity to the amount of medical transition they've undergone is gross. not everyone has the money, nor the want for certain aspects of medical transition. any and every transition is valid and trans ""enough"" regardless of how many medical procedures have or haven't been done.
Honestly if I just get some T and get the ""middle ground"" down there I'm good
Besides completely erradicating the point of being trans and out of the binary box, i think that kinda narrative also invalidates intersex people who can have more complex genitalia than whats typically “cis” and not feel the need to change them depending on what they identify as. Im sorry u had to deal with such trolls, you do you queen, i love to see trans people liking their trans bodies.
That’s messed up. How do we tell people to stop focusing on what’s in our pants if we’re doing that same damn thing..
Let's just normalize allowing people to trans however tf they want to and not policing each other in general.
Fun fact: those exact types of comments kept me in the egg for years after I knew I was trans femme.
It’s seriously uncool to put that kind of pressure on someone who is already going through a lot.

Gender gate keeping is for terfs and fascists, keep it out of our spaces.
I've been downvoted in this subreddit for saying you don't need hormones or surgery to be trans. Even though this subreddit is where I learned that. People are very weird for suggesting there is only one way to be trans.
I have extreme dysphoria with everything else but getting bottom always felt kinda unnecessary for me due to price and the lack of real dysphoria for it. Im sure it would make me euphoric if done very advanced but thats expensive. Maybe when its more widely available and new methods come out.
This. And some people don't want bottom surgery even with bottom dysphoria. Surgery doesn't define your gender! You do! :)
I don’t have bottom dysphoria either but I do have top dysphoria because Im trans masc lol. But its nice not having both but it doesn’t dismiss  that I am still trans. All power to you!
I have pretty heavy bottom dysphoria, and when I hear that you don't have bottom dysphoria, I'm happy for you. You're not any less trans. I'm just glad you can be comfortable with what you've got. Honestly as much as I *need* to find a way to get that surgery, it's going to be a process, and the idea of invasive surgery is... imposing.  So I wouldn't wish that need on someone else.  
That's one burden you don't have to deal with. It's messed up that you have to deal with judgment instead. It doesn't make you any less one of my sisters.
Sex =/= gender.

Anatomy =/= gender.

Presentation =/= gender.

Pronouns =/= gender.

Feel free to add to the list!
NB here. I never understood why people only think men could have dicks. Chicks with dicks are far hotter than dudes with dicks. Your genitals don’t decide who or what you are.
I (ftm) 100% agree.

My private parts are private for a reason. I don't care if I'm ""less of a man"" to others because they're my damn genitals.
Saying bottom surgery is required is transphobic, even if the person saying it is trans.
I have bottom dysphoria but I think it's unfair for people who don't have it to be less trans than others just bc they see their genitals as masc/fem. Sometimes too, it may not even be the right idea to get surgery. I think it's perfectly fine to have zero bottom dysphoria! :\]
I’m with you. I’m a trans woman who is totally cool with my downstairs mixup. Genitals do not equal gender.
You’re who you are. If you don’t need to alter your genitals, don’t, and gawd, think of the money you’ll save. 

Only you can be you. 

I suspect there are far more trans women who don’t/can’t have GCS than those who do. It may already be normalized purely as a statistical function. 

Dysphoria is another matter entirely; but I-don’t-need-to-be-dysphoric-to-be-trans seems to already have become the norm, as well.
Yes YES YOU ARE VALID it is very valid not everyone has dysphoria and that's amazing your comfort is valid you discomfort is valid it's about you and how you feel and however you feel is Hella valid
Super valid!
Personally, I’m looking forward to new plumbing, but that’s MY relationship to MY body for what brings ME euphoria. Everybody has a unique relationship to their body and gender, and their is no exclusive anatomy that defines femininity. 
I am joyous that womanhood has room for celebration of many kinds of shapes and sizes, including mine, which I love, but I also love to love other women loving their own bodies as well 🖤
Absolutely. My dysphoria is limited to my facial hair and the lack of boobs - but the penis? Don't give a shit. Hell, i'm ace, it's not like i use it for much to begin with.
Also it adds a hidden layer of shame by implying we're not rich enough to afford said surgeries.
I have had arguments with transmen who refuse to accept another trans individual as trans because they don't want surgery. It's absolutely terrible. Accept someone with different definitions than you and work together for the great cause. It's such a bad litmus test.
In the same way a trans woman is not less of a woman *before* she gets bottom surgery, she’s also not less female if she doesn’t want it and never gets it.
I completely agree. Personally I have intense bottom dysphoria but the fact that you don’t doesn’t make you any less trans or any less of a woman, and anyone who says otherwise is being dumb.
Hell yeah, I'm so glad I'm not alone in having no plans to get bottom surgery
100% I feel the need for bottom surgery and will be getting it but not a single person should be made to feel worse about themself just because they don't suffer from bottom dysphoria. I'd rather be friends/ partners with people who are comfy in their body no matter what that means to them. if you're cis good for you don't be one of the crappy cis people and i'll be happy to have you in my life. If you're trans and the only thing you want is to socially transition but dont want or decide with your doctor its best not to medically transition or if taking hrt is right for you and after getting on hrt and being on it you don't feel the need for any surgeries. All of these people are valid as men women NBs. and side note if you aren't planning on sleeping with someone why should you care what someone has in their pants also while we're at it can we stop people asking about peoples trans' peoples plans for surgery if we want to talk about surgeries with you let that be our choice we don't owe you a detailed plan of every surgery we want.
same, I'm a trans man but I recently realised that I wouldn't get the results I want from bottom surgery. I don't experience bottom dysphoria except when it comes to using public bathrooms. at the end of the day, I'm fine with how that area is. other than a hysterectomy, I'm happy to keep it all the same down there. I'm just as trans now as I was before I decided I don't want bottom surgery <3
Yess thank you! It’s about time this was said. I constantly feel “less trans” whenever I talk about bottom dysphoria cause I simply don’t get it. Do I wish I had a vagina? Yes. At the end of the day can I really do anythin? No. I feel for my brothers and sisters who have to deal with this but I don’t think I should be seen as less trans just cause I can’t afford to have surgery or don’t even want to have surgery. Actually if I’m even honest SRS terrifies me. What if somethin goes wrong? What if it’s not exactly what I want? What if I don’t have feeling down there? There are a whole list of reason that make this surgery not worth it to me. It’s also the only surgery that makes me nauseous just thinkin about it. So the next time I get a reply to one of my comments talkin about how I should be dysphoric or it’s weird that I’m not I’m gonna go off. If I want to be a chick with a dick then I’ll be a fuckin chick with a dick. Sick of people tryna tell me otherwise. You’re trans you should know better than anyone not to preach your garbage to me. Ok rant over. This is just somethin that’s been really annoyin me lately. Thanks for postin OP cause I didn’t have the guts
YES FUCKING PLEASE! I do have bottom dysphoria but I don’t like how so many people seem to believe transitioning is just a road to bottom surgery. Like if I have the money I will get bottom surgery but if I didn’t want to that would be completely ok. Also my dad whos extremely abusive transphobic and horrible tells me if i don’t get bottom surgery I will be a boy pretending to be a girl so yeah.
Exactly. I'm a trans guy yet I only want top surgery, not bottom surgery.
I honestly don't care... Like when I get there I get there. I don't care if I get it or not... I likely won't because money, im also not into sex honestly, Ive tried to be but I'm not. So it's very low priority.
yeah i’ don’t want bottom surgery i like my hole and i have too bad medical anxiety to go thru another surgery
Do you girl! It’s your body. Don’t let others drive your choices, and try to tune out negativity. I know, easier said than done. 

Hang in there. Hugs!!
I see your point and raise you “Can we please normalize not having dysphoria” cause you don’t need to have dysphoria to be trans.
yessss alll trans people are different. theres no one right way to be trans.
Idk if we should *normalize* either situation, so to speak. Everybody is a unique case. We just need to make sure our system can permit and support us all.
I'm nonbinary and have no bottom dysphoria. My top dysphoria is only because they are way too big I don't want a flat chest but one that is easier to hide when I don't feel so fem.
This touches on something I’ve been ruminating on for a while.  I think one day we might need to “reclaim” transsexual or create a non-problematic alternative that is separate from gender.  Not as an alternative, but two subcategories of trans where you could be one or both.  Like how we have binary and non-binary trans groups.  

Gender and sex aren’t the same thing is something often said in the trans community, but we keep running into issues between trans peeps who are fine with their birth sex bits and need to be their true gender on one side.  On the other, there are the trans peeps who feel the need to change both their gender and sex.  

Both groups are valid and valid needs, but every few months we see members from both start head butting over which is the true ~~Scotsman~~ trans.

What is “trans” has grown so large that we as a community should consider sub groups.  Each valid, but “trans” has gotten big enough that each have some details that conflict with what works for other groups.
Some of us really want bottom surgery but that is not an indication if you're transgendered or not if you have comfortability with your genitals then that's amazing you're lucky some of us don't have that luck if you don't have bottom dysphoria Rock on enjoy what you got XD
Please. Or just lack of dysphoria, it ain’t a requirement it just occurres
Literally me: and we valid af
it's really odd that trans people undergo so much judgement about what's in their pants and then turn around and judge each other over essentially the same thing. i don't have plans for bottom surgery either, all i really care to do in terms of medical transition is starting T, top surgery, and maybe a hysterectomy if i have the money when i'm older or if T doesn't stop periods/causes complications.
Same, Idk why I get dysphoria about everything but my peen but why risk the surgery if I don't need too
I'm okay with normalising it, but I can't understand it.
parts dont make the woman/man the heart doesW

rock on bishhhh x
Thank you for this post. 🖤
I've been told ""Oh you must be non binary"" because I only plan to get an Orchi.
Can we also please normalize not having any body dysphoria? I've been downvoted and even been told to reconsider my transition for simply stating that I've never experienced body dysphoria. 

Not every trans person experiences body dysphoria. You can be binary trans and not experience body dysphoria.
I get what you are saying. I don't love what I have, but I don't hate it either. Would I prefer to have the other? Yes. Big time. But it's not a top of the line necessity for me, personally, to feel feminine.
I genuinely can't find the comments that actually say this, any chance you can link some, so I can see?
the “you need dysphoria to be trans” debate is so dumb. there’s endless possibilities when it comes to the ways you can express your gender identity. including embracing any aspects of your body. genitals don’t equal gender!! there’s nothing wrong with you if you’re comfy with what you got going on in your downstairs region. and there’s nothing wrong with others who feel uncomfortable with theirs. your body is yours, only you can decide if you like it or not 🤷🏻‍♀️
I personally don't have much dysphoria, but that does not make me any more of less Trans or a woman because of that.
I want it but each to their own
I love my lil wiener that has grown since starting T. I don’t want to have bottom surgery cause I’m in love with what I got growin lol
I'm with you girl, I don't plan on ever getting bottom surgery either, we're women with dicks and nothing anyone says is gonna change that!
For real though, the majority of the bullshit I have gotten over my gender is from other trans people because I don't have bottom dysphoria and rarely wear feminine clothing. These women lose their minds and call me a trender or say I'm not really trans enough or woman enough. It's why I barely take part in the community anymore.
Ty!!! I would be upset if I didn't have my pp.
Honestly can we normalize not getting any dysphoria? I get gender dysphoria but there's people who don't at all. Gender dysphoria is a possible *sign* that you're trans, but that doesn't mean everyone gets it. Some trans people don't get gender dysphoria at all and get told they're ""not trans""
Is it really that bad? I'm curious if it comes from just Cis folk or even that judgement is coming from other trans? 

Either way it's not right. Though I tend to not care what other people think when it comes to what I may or may not do with my body. I feel I should prepare myself.

And I agree trans-ness should not be determined by any form of medical processes (HRT or surgery)
Trans people (being right) : ""my genitals are none of your business, you don't get a say in what I do with them! Being pre-op doesn't make you invalid!""

Some trans people: ""YoU'Re NoT GeTtInG bOtToM sUrGeRy??? ArE yOu EvEn TrAnS??""

Seems a bit hypocritical
Thank you so much everyone for such amazing and overwhelming support. It warms my heart to know there is such a large community of people with such love. I did have a few people personally reach out to me and ask if I'm ok. I also had one person submit a report to the crisis help page of Reddit. While I do suspect this was done as a troll as I've recently been targeted by transphobic accounts. I want to make sure however that all of you that reached out to me know that I appreciate it. Seriously. I want to make sure I put all of y'all's minds at ease when I say I genuinely am okay and very very safe. The post that I made was not to imply that I myself am at any risk. While I definitely do have people make comments to me and question me about my ""transness"" I am able to handle that with poise and respect.
     I genuinely do believe that I am who I am and I don't care what anybody thinks about me or says about me. The reason for this post was to raise awareness. People need to be aware that what is in your pants does not dictate their gender. I also wanted to raise awareness that just because you thought a question does not mean you get to ask the question. Think before you speak. Just because somebody has disclosed to you that they are trans does not immediately give you the right to ask any and all questions that come to your mind. You should wait for them to open that dialogue first. Or at the very least if you feel you have a question, you should ask if it's okay to ask questions first. And for goodness sake, please ask the question with respect. Also, you have the right to say I don't feel comfortable answering that. Just because somebody asks, a question does not mean you're obligated to answer.

Again, thank you so much. I am genuinely so grateful for this community.
I think placing less emphasis on dysphoria, in general, would be good. I’m not saying dysphoria isn’t a big deal but so much of the narrative revolves around people bursting into tears whenever they look in the mirror. My dysphoria has always been so mild that I assumed I must not be trans because I wasn’t having that experience. I’m 35, came out to myself 12 years ago, and some days I’m still unsure if I’m trans
UGH. I agree with you OP. There is no one way to be trans! I actually used to be worried that I wasn’t trans anymore because I don’t hate my body. I think I was 24 when I realized that being trans does not equal hating yourself. Being trans does not equal wanting SRS. It doesn’t even equal wanting to be on HRT. There are so many people in the trans community who know nothing but pain and hate and unfortunately sometimes that results in some trans people attacking the only people they can: other trans people. You don’t need to change anything about yourself, OP, you are fantastic just as you are.
Yeah I dont want or need bottom dysphoria to be trans
I wish I social transition by cross dressing live in manassas city Virginia my mom won’t allow it
Yeah and it’s crazy, I’ve wanted bottom surgery but decided the risk wasn’t work it.  I mean… I had one woman complain about the 9 months of hell she went through, three revisions and bed ridden and in and out of the hospital for six months…. Then judge me for not thinking this was something I wanted to experience in my 50’s….. not with two young kids I share custody with… then she tries to convince me to go to her surgeon….. umm, no thanks.
ABSOLUTELY!! I have zero dysphoria downstairs outside of them sometimes getting in the way, but I still want to keep it because it personally doesn't bring me any distress.
i def feel it some times but it’s certainly not the main thing i’m dysphoric about at all. people always love to say that since my main dysphoric thing is my height.. it’s not an actual trans problem and it’s not dysphoria.. which is the WORST thing to hear. i don’t love my bottom area.. but i also don’t hate it, i dont mind the bottom growth and honestly makes me feel more masc. wouldn’t really trade it for a thing bc they kinda look gross (saying this as i have a preference of men LMAO) but not having bottom dysphoria doesn’t make you any less trans, GO YOU!
Thank you! I personally don't care for bottom surgery. For one, the science as it stands would give me more disphoria as I would want it to really function the same. So I might when penile transplants (which just started to be talked about but for burn victims and such) become a thing. 

Besides that? I rather have everything functional, save money, enjoy when I bottom (sorry, not a big butt stuff on the receiving end), and feel FULLY down there.

Less disphoria and more just fear with bathrooms in passing than anything.
In my opinion it’s up to the person, if you feel like you need to go that far to be happy then go for it. If you don’t feel that way then you don’t have too, just do whatever makes you happy in the end. That’s my way of seeing it
Eh, I'm all good not getting any surgery
But it would be nice to learn how to dress in a way that expresses who I am
Same here! I often have little to no bottom dysphoria. It's mostly chest dysphoria for me.
This!!!
I get bottom dysphoria but i have chosen not to get bottom surgery and just pack in the future because i’ve heard horror stories about pain continuing after bottom surgery and i just dont want to chance it ya’know? and i feel like thats a valid reason
I've put been here a few weeks now and I'm shocked that this is the case. Why on Earth would a trans person think there's only one ""right way"" to be trans? That stinks of transphobia. I have major bottom and general body dysphoria but I've never thought less of ya'll who don't. Hell, I'm kinda jealous you have less to change to hit your comfort zone.
I don’t love my equipment, I’d prefer other stuff, but honestly at this point it’s more of a daily annoyance to have to tuck all the time.
Same, I totally want top surgery so I can look flat, go swimming , be happy with my body, etc. But with down there it's not like anyone's gonna be seeing it in public, I do feel like I'm missing out sometimes but I hardly have any dysphoria about it. And what if I wanted a kid? Like you can get pregnant if you go off testosterone even with top surgery and maybe in the future I'll want kids. I'm also afraid of regret because there's no going back
All trans people aren't the same, some people want bottom surgery some don't, I know some people don't want hrt and that's fine too, we are not all the same and that is totally fine :)
Same! I mean, I wanna get a total hysterectomy, mainly bc of monthly bleeding and my PCOS, but I don't plan on a bottom surgery other than that. My main points of distress are fat distribution, my hips, and my chest.
I agree with that sentiment  though I don't  understand how you are confurtbull with it because of my experience  
But at last people get built different we don't need to understand it we just need to respect it
Only our expression, to me I'd gendered and visible to others. genitals are literally ungendered to me
You're absolutely right, everyone should just do whatever they feel is best for themselves. You can be a pretty girl either way 😉
exactly and ppl are ridiculous. not everyone has bottom dysphoria, can afford it, has insurance, is not on hrt, are fine using their genitals etc.
Bottom surgery is something that the hateful like to push in the sick thought that you will regret it and be another “case” to prove their point. I didn’t realize that it was coming from the community as well. Surly different motives but truly no one else but you can decide what is right for you. Peer pressure on that just seems weird.
It doesn't even make sense. It's a gradient, not a binary, to be trans
I agree although I may personally want to have bottom surgery to get a 🐱 I say it's up to the person getting the surgeries to decide what they want changed
I thought it's already normalized o.o at least here in Belgium in the community it's is
Well for me I know im a girl bc of gender euphoria not gender Dysphoria but when it comes to genitalia for me i really wanna have a vagina. But i know many trans ppl in person that don’t want bottom surgery and thats sooo valid and I’m happy for them that they can be happy with what they have.
But i also know trans ppl that would do bad things if they weren’t able to get surgery 

So i can see both side but I agree you don’t need any (medical) treatment to be Trans*
Yeah, transness is not a slider expressed by the amount of gender affirming surgeries you’ve undergone
THANK YOU QUEEN, PLEASE LOUDER SO THEY HEAR IT IN THE BACK

My fear of surgeries overshadows any wish in me to be an ""authentic"" female, I am very much satisfied with my body and I really don't want to change too much past HRT. I'm not trans for anyone else but myself, the way I very much want to be
Yeah, I almost certainly won't be getting bottom surgery unless how I feel changes. I actually like my penis. It's always felt wrong for my body, but it doesn't bother me more than the enjoyment I get from it. And the surgery recovery just sounds awful and like something I really don't want to go through.
You can't win with these people. They say ""well if it's the inside that counts then you don't need to change the outside!"" Then they say ""if it's the presentation that matters you don't need to change the inside!""

These people are just confused and malicious about it.

Fuck 'em dead. You do what your body warrants and you do it proudly.
I too feel no need for bottom surgery. I've been a man this whole time, everything I'm doing (HRT, top surgery) is for my own benefit and not for outside validation.
Honestly most interactions I've had with trans women are outside of reddit, and most of them either don't have bottom dysphoria or it's not enough for them to have surgery... 

I personally 100% plan on keeping the ol woodpecker because I enjoy having and using it as long as it wants to function.

My fiance had this cute photo she shared the other day that said ""wanting to keep my penis doesn't make me less female"" and honestly I vibe with that. If u do too that's all good with me and should be fine with everyone else.
I'm sorry you've had to deal with that, coming from your own community. You'll get no judgement from me. If someone says they're a girl, then they're a girl (regardless of any physical or social aspects they have).

I'm honestly a lot harder on myself than I am anyone else, and hold myself to standards that aren't very realistic. I personally have pretty severe dysphoria over things down there, but I don't agree with anyone using their own feelings to force others to conform to what they believe is correct.

Me and a friend of mine are both different in quite a few ways when it comes to things like bottom surgery, voice (absolutely hate mine), and social transition. I still love her, though, and have no doubt that she's still a girl in every way that really matters.
THIS THIS THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't want bottom surgery!! I want top surgery!!!!!!!!
Like i love to tuck dont get me wrong but im content with my genitalia for the most part
I honestly envy y’all that DONT have bottom dysphoria. Like it must make life so much easier for y’all lol. I think maybe some of these people are envious/jealous of this and take out their frustration on you. You’re definitely valid for not wanting surgery💗
i completely agree with you. genitals and gender identity really need to be disconnected one from another.
I totally agree, nobody should be judged by another’s standards. That’s why we’re here in the first place is to get support and see kindness in a world that throws us so much hate. I’m just as valid as any other trans person and so are all of you. I’m gonna get hated on for that too no doubt.
Can we also normalise having no dysphoria at all? and/or don't wanna get any surgeries? Seriously Only cause I'm trans doesn't means I have to get every surgery in the book or hrt

Some old friend told me she wouldn't call me my preferred name or pronunce until I have ""the surgery"" okey, yeah BUT WHICH ONE DO U MEAN????????????????? giiiirrrlll 🙄 it's not being talked about that no one has to do or have any of these things in order to be trans. You're trans if you feel so 

Also when I'm going to swim idgaf and just put on a bikini and still I'm trans. DEAL WITH IT :O

Thanks
[removed]
mood. idc what anyone else thinks I do not ever want a dick and while I have not experienced much hate about me being perfectly happy with what I got since I don't talk about it much, I do get ""so you wanna grow a dick"" a lot whenever I out myself and just.... no... why is the first thing you assume that I want a dick...
i’m trans ftm but i agree if you don’t have dysforia down there why do it, for me i wouldn’t get it because i don’t have dysforia about that specifically and it’s so much work for essentially nothing to me but on the other hand if you want it good for you :))
I know how you feel!
I don't really have issues with my current equipment.
Maybe I'll keep the young lady down there? Who knows! Certainly not me, let alone someone else
I am a transgirl (as you I suppose) 
I don't have bottom dysphoria, cuz I find my way to don't have it (mostly because I say ""Girls can have a dick too). So don't care of it. If you fell a woman, you're a woman ! 
And be proud of you
Yes, I’ve been dealing with this so much since I came out. Just because I am okay with my parts doesn’t mean I am more or less of a trans person. We are all valid regardless of what we do or do not choose to do medically or otherwise during our transition. There is no magic list that we have to follow or check. 

I don’t understand trans people who hate on other trans folks because of what we decide to do with our own bodies/transitions. We deal with enough hatred and misinformation from outside the trans and LGBTQIA+ community, we shouldn't have to deal with it from inside our community as well.

(Edit: Spelling+Gramer + Not sure why I am getting downvoted... I am supporting what OP said and expressed a dislike for pressures from both inside and outside of the community.)
Yeah like, if I were single maybe I'd prefer having a vagina over a girl dick? Haven't really thought about it. I'm dating a cis woman so I don't mind having matching junk. I just want to be recognized as a girl in the other 99% of my life.
For real! If there’s two people with cocks in the relationship, I want mine to do the fucking on the odd occasion. If there’s just one, no need for dildos, I already have a natural one on me. The physical practically explains itself.
Yes!!! I have little bottom dysphoria, especially compared to top dysphoria. But people still think that if you don’t want to nuke every typically male/female trait of your body, you aren’t trans.
I like my girl dick and am keeping it.
Here's an idea, at least this was my brain dealing with this as a cis male.

It started with seeing someone's legs and thinking ""nice! She's got great legs"" then they pan up and it's a guy.  Like all my friends I did the same thing....""ew! Yuck!""

Then one day I thought to myself...so what, I have a thing for sexy female legs, so if a guys legs turn me on, he has sexy female legs. No other guys legs as sexy to me. So why react like that?

So I let that go, hot legs are hot legs. Period.

Overtime I expanded my physical attraction to many other body parts. (Don't get me wrong, physical is by no means my only idea of sexy, it's just the topic here.)

Fast forward to today, and I don't care what's in your underwear, a sexy woman is a sexy woman. I'm not attracted to men at all, but a woman with a penis is still a woman.

Now, stepping away from my brain, most cis guys I know are fixated on vagina. I mean, tunnel vision here (no pun intended) so I think for most of them it's not so much bottom dysphoria, but bottom focus. If a woman doesn't have a vagina, to them, she's not a woman. Not because of some social issue. But because to them that's all that matters sexually.

Not saying they are right, nor am I defending them. I'm just saying for those that fight you the hardest, maybe it not about hating you as it is being attracted to you. To a cis male, vagina = sexy = ""I'm ok to like"" 

It's not bottom dysphoria, it's attraction dysphoria. Maybe, a tactics change may help.
I genuinely don’t understand why some people think that everyone who’s trans needs bottom surgery. Other peoples bodies are none of your business! 

(and also as a bi person like, I really don’t get why some people care. penises are great, vaginas are great, and whatever brand new surgery’s people are inventing to have non-traditional genitalia are also great. Who gives a flying fuck what gender or genitalia someone has, they are amazing and perfect being who they are!)
Im not letting a scalpel anywhere near mine. I do have bottom dysphorea, but i like my penis enough to tolerate it. Also i have top energy.
I would like s bottom surgery but it is not a need for me. I am sure that if cis women were born with it sometimes they wouldn’t mind either
The number of cis women who have told me in confidence that the genuinely wish they had a cock but don’t wish they were a guy.
as a trans guy that's exactly how i feel. i don't plan on ever getting bottom surgery, i'm okay with what i got. and tbh i think it's weird that people think we're supposed to hate everything about our bodies and want to change it to validate ourselves as trans people and that's not the case.
I just started a thread about something related to this and yes! You should love what you got going on!
nobody owes getting bottom surgery to anyone. you can be as feminine as could possibly be and still have a penis. genitalia does NOT = gender.
Agreed I’m gender fluid so I don’t think I’ll even go as far as HRT but I never really experience dysphoria at the most I get gender envy from some women or enby people because they are so freaking pretty but between hair styles tucking clothes fake breast and things like that I feel like I can compensate enough to always feel at least a little comfortable with myself all the time
I think I had someone try to say something about me not getting surgery but I immediately shut them down and they didn't respond
It took me a while to get to where I am now mentally when it comes to bottom surgery. When I first learned about my identity i thought it was almost a requirement to want bottom surgery. However now I just want to start hormones and get top surgery. I think for me finding my partner that doesn't care and still sees me as me has helped me a lot. I hope more people don't get pressured into that need for bottom surgery or surgery at all!
Honesty congrats if you don’t have bottom dysphoria. Getting surgery is a pain, all the paperwork and recovery time…
100% I'm with you on this. Bodily autonomy is everyone's right and what you or me or anyone wants to do with their body is no one else's business. Just keep being true to yourself and everybody else can go kick rocks.
Preach!!
Exactly the only thing that matters is whether or not your healthy and happy with your body and thats not someone elses job to decide
[removed]
Yes!!! Finally someone fucking said it.  


That's not to say I go through the same thing. I'm actually somewhat the opposite (i'm ftm, but i don't have top dysphoria. The rest of me, though, i hate) but good fucking christ are people so willing to fly off the handle because some people don't feel a certain way about their bodies, or god fucking forbid no dysphoria at all.  


Honestly, you're just as valid as any other trans person to exist out there. Don't change your body because someone else told you. Change your body because you told yourself to.
Amen sis! I’m glad you love what you got and that is awesome! People need to stop trying to push stupid narratives that you need to do xyz to be a true woman! Just not true
Definitely, I don't necessarily love my equipment but I don't hate it either. I'm scared of surgeries and sometimes it feels like there's a lot of pressure that I have to go ""all the way"" in regards to transitioning, but I don't want to, the most I want is an orchi.
I agree. I still want bottom surgery but having that equipment doesn't give me disphoria.
Those people need to mind their own business. You do what you want and what makes you the most comfortable.

My ideal body is wishing I can physically change my gender whenever I please, but that's just not possible.
I quite like my ittybitty member 😡😡

*COME AND TAKE IT* 😤😤
Done. I think it's very normal as I am someone who is not getting g bottom surgery as of now.
100% agree. I very much have bottom dysphoria and want to get that fixed but I'm not gonna shame others for not wanting to.
Seriously I hate this concept just bc I don't hate what's in my pants dosent mean I have to enjoy it either it's more about what makes you happy so do what you please
people who think you need bottom dysphoria to be trans are dumb as hell. you aight homie, you’re a woman with or without it
My wife doesn’t have bottom surgery and I support that 💯
Yea that's a big thing in the grand scheme of people getting to know me. I have very little bottom dyshporia, ans can tuck just fine. I married a woman and I get shit for that, and get crap for dealing with the minor bit. I may not be a top often, but I don't want to have to buy a rubber for the Mrs. 😂

But people really focus on what's going on between my legs. Creepy AF. I  married woman, so leave me beeeeee.
Agreed ❤️
It’s weird most of time I don’t mind the part I have i mean would I like to have a v hell yeah but mostly I don’t have bottom dysphoria so hell yeah let’s normalize it
Oh yeah I totally hate my bottom half rn. Last week after work I went to the bar to get a drink ( non- alcoholic beer) while waiting for the bus. A lovely lady sat down next to me and we immediately hit it off into great conversation. About 30 minutes in I had to cut it short to catch the bus. She asked if I’d like to hang out and go on a date. I said obviously yes , but then I had to do the dreadful reveal that I’m transgender woman, I think it’s obvious that I’m trans, but anyway. She then quickly revealed that she wasn’t into it cause I didn’t have what she was looking for(a vulva) . I kindly said no problem, I totally understand. Paid for my fake beer, got on the bus and cried. And Totolly hated my identity of being trans, but at the same time love it because my transition saved my life. True stories. This is not the first time I’ve come in contact with cis-lesbian who felt the same way, sucks. And if there are any transgender girls invalidating us girls who haven’t had bottom surgery, I hope you have a wonderful day
Yeah I feel the exact same way!
Say it louder for the people in the back!
i have very mild bottom dysphoria and majority of the time i don’t care that i don’t have a dick and i feel invalid because of it but this post and the comments on it are making me feel less insecure about it :)
We just need to normalize that trans people don’t have to have any type of dysphoria for them to be valid trans person
God same. when people call me pre-op I just get sad :(
I’m probably trans I just decided against transitioning all together it’s like I don’t wanna be trans I just wish I was born the opposite sex😞
This is something I fight with a lot. I'm FTM, and I only want top surgery and to have my uterus taken out. I'm still iffy on bottom surgery.

To top it off, I'm not even sure what to call myself anymore. She/her us 1000% no, he/him is still uncomfortable, and they/them feels the same.
I rarely have bottom dysphoria 
I mean i dont really like what i have but surgery means i couldnt reproduce for example (if i ever wanted to) and i want that option to be awaidable
I'm only dysphoric about what I don't have and even then not by much, most of my dysphoria is just about my chest but I'm on hrt for that. I'm genderfluid and for me personally I would like to have both parts, maybe someday science can do that for me, but until then I'm personally gonna stay with what I have and what I know.
I did wonder whether wanting top and not bottom surgery was normal x
I’m ftm and I’m with you. Everyone’s experience, feelings, and transition are different. You’re super valid.
[removed]
anybody who says you need bottom dysphoria is almost at transmed shit which is lame
Thank you. Because I don't want bottom surgery because I don't have bottom dysphoria. I know some people who do want bottom surgery and that's ok, but not everyone wants it.
Already normalized in my head bb 💜
I don’t plan getting bottom surgery either, because a) the options for trans men are kinda meh imo and b) it’s fucking expensive
I never had much dysphoria over that area, but where I live it’s a requirement to change the gender marker 😣 and that stupid M gives me massive amounts of dysphoria… so I’m being forced into bottom surgery
Who can just dismiss ppl for something that stupid like we need more infighting
I agree it’s insanity and I feel some people think trans folks need to have surgery to be complete. From my experience when I first came out all the questions I was getting were about surgery and insane; to the point where it became a daily occurrence. I really don’t understand why people thought it was OK to just ask my about bottom surgery. I feel it’s one’s business if I get surgery or not; it does not make my less than any other female.
I totally agree! I’m the same way.
Yes totally
I think that I am a guy who is at least 99% binary, but I don't think I would ever want to have bottom surgery, mostly because I am very repulsed by sex and the body parts, and I also have a huge fear of ppl seeing me naked, basically I have no use for anything downstairs. Ideally I don't want anything down there, but I hope that people don't think that I am faking it or I am not binary, tho I don't really worry about what other people think lol.
Agreed..... This needs to be normalised straightaway. People need to stop backseating someone else's life and mind👏their👏own👏 business 👏 Pure and simple.💕
Sometimes I at least wish I could filter out some keywords and such. Seeing folks say ""dysphoria sausage"" frequently and such makes me very sad :c What I have and want to keep doesn't define my dysphoria.
Exactly. Im FTM and I don't have bottom dysphoria. It makes me feel like I'm not trans enough sometimes because I'm actually content with a part of my body
I saw a trans girl say she kind of regretted getting bottom surgery because she has realised with how Gender and society have developed that she didn’t need to have a really invasive surgery to be who she wanted to be.

But she felt she had to because otherwise she wouldn’t be a “real woman” 

And I think it’s really sweet that we have progressed so much that people no longer have that pressure and soon I hope that nobody confirms their gender expression to what others think
Good mod
Too bad there's no way of moderating voting. Not that I care about imaginary internet points, but a sub doesn't feel like a ""safe space"" when I get downvoted for not having body dysphoria. 

I feel like the xenogender community is the only trans community online that hasn't given me shit over not having body dysphoria (but still suffering from loads of other dysphoria). I don't dare tell cis people I don't have body dysphoria.
‘Transness’ better be added to the dictionary
I agree 100%. I have a cis friend who I'm trying to explain this to. With him (and a lot of cis people I think) it just comes from ignorance. They just don't know what it means to be trans, and the numerous ways you can be. They hear ""trans"" and assume it means a person who wants to do everything, HRT, surgery, etc. I'm new to understanding this myself. Being ""trans"" technically just means your internal gender identity and your physical sex/expression are incongruent. Significantly incongruent, not like a cis man just wanting more muscles or something. Having that incongruency usually prompts trans people to OPT for HRT and other treatments but it's not a requirement for ""being trans."" It's kind of a catch-all word that a lot of cis people don't have a nuanced definition of
So true. I have dysphoria over it, but nowhere near enough for the risks of surgery
>n

so true
felt that, along with top surgery (for me, that's what I want), that's kind of my ideal body type
FR
>invalidates intersex people who can have more complex genitalia than whats typically “cis” and not feel the need to change them

Or people like us, who want to have complex genitalia created. 

Bottom dysphoria for us is strange because we have euphoria for what exists and dysphoria for what's missing at the same time rather than just dysphoria, so it's less obvious and acts like more of a rollercoaster.

Being Salmacian pre op can be an odd trip. Hopefully things calm down post op, assuming we get surgery approved.
transmeds will always be somewhere unfortunately
[removed]
This is me. It’s just a pleasure organ for me that’s not linked to my gender so it never gave me dysphoria. And the tech I see out there just isn’t good enough to warrant surgery given lack of dysphoria
The recent question I got (oh if you trans does that mean you only date men) 

Orientation =/= gender
Sure, I work on my voice a lot because I want to (and voice feminization has given me an excuse to indulge in my desire to learn voice work). That being said...

Voice =/= gender.
As a chick with a dick I love chicks with dicks but can we not do the whole superiority thing in a thread about discouraging superiority?
Username twinsies! ❤️
I’ve literally been searching the comments for this cause I 10000000% agree. I’m a (very) recently trans person and I posted on a couple trans ‘friendly’ subreddits asking for advice/other peoples stories and literally every comment before I deleted the post essentially said ‘lol ur not trans cause u don’t have crippling dysphoria’ and needless to say that sure didn’t help this very confused guy/girl/something else 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
Except that there are people who don’t fit neatly into either group you are suggesting because gender and sex aren’t binary things. I am transitioning because I have loads of facial and body dysphoria but have little to no genital dysphoria. I think people can also have varying degrees of dysphoria too so your proposed boxes just divide among arbitrary lines.
I don't mean this insultingly so please don't take it that way.

 However if you don't experience dysphoria over your body why transition at all?

 Wouldn't remaining how you are be easier than dealing with the social consequences of being trans?

Not to say you should or shouldn't continue to transition, I just don't entirely understand.
you can search by controversial on this post to find a few
I think that the first telltale sign of being transgender is feeling euphoria when thinking of yourself as the opposite gender. Some people have secondary signs like dysphoria but some people don't.
Ahhhh I want one
I hope this sub is better then. If it happens to you here, report asap, we'll handle it, I promise.
Sometimes this community's worst enemy is itself. Nobody gatekeeps more than people within it.
I can confirm, 90% of the gatekeeping over my gender has been from trans women in trans support groups. First it's my 'unladylike' or 'aggressive' personality, then it's my clothing choices, and then it's my lack of bottom dysphoria and referring to my dick as my 'best friend since puberty.'
Absolutely. Getting bottom surgery is just as valid as not getting it
I'm about to start hrt and I'm really worried about function. Some people completely lose it, and I'm attracted to women more so than men, so it's obviously a valid concern. I'm thinking of stopping hrt once I have the changes I want, if things down there get too broken. Do you know anything about how much that would work? You're obviously on hrt if you have concerns too?x
Maybe you just don't know, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt: trans can be used as an umbrella term including but not limited to binary trans, non-binary trans, non-binary, gender queer, third gender, two spirit, and gender non conforming. Basically if you want to be trans, you're trans.

Transometric value.  ""Hey, what's your transometric value?  How trans are you?  Oh. 14?  OMG Do you even trans!""
cis ignorance is something i just do not have the patience for anymore. i salute you for your endurance and bravery in dealing with... *that*. /hj
It's not just that they don't know what it means to be trans, but that they completely center genitals in their understanding of gender. Having one or the other set of genitals **is** your gender (to a cishet) and everything else about ""being a man/woman"" flows from there. The idea that their innate physical body and the hormones that made it that way isn't directly correlated with everything else they think of when they think of ""sex/gender"" (which they use interchangeably), including fashion and aesthetic preferences and hobbies and everything else they assign gendered qualities to, is completely alien to them.

So it's not completely beyond them to come around to the idea that ""some people are born in the wrong body and now want to fix that"", but anything beyond that seems completely contradictory to every idea they have about being human.
This ignorance is a lot of what's fueling the panic over trans youth. People will hear about a four year old whose parents accept their identity and think that means they're giving children that young all the surgeries.
I hear that. I'm totally trans, but have never done anything at all, and maybe never will.
the way i think about it is i would like to seen as a woman or woman-adjacent in some or all different ways of “being seen” can mean

from being attractive to gay women, to just a more general softness & lower aggression idk
Yeah, sadly cis ignorance is very common. I love to educate people about it, but I understand there will be times that I just don't have the energy for it anymore. I guess until being trans becomes normalised, cis ignorance will remain a thing.
same
THIS!! I am so so so sad that this issue/experience is not more openly addressed in the community. Truth be told, this is the first time I am hearing of another person that would like to have “complex genitalia created”!! I thought I was all alone hoping that was possible because my experience with my birth genitalia is complicated but no, you just proved me wrong!

That only shows me that there is people out there, younger or older than me as well, that feel super insecure about their identity because they haven’t seen any representation even in their own community! Truly a sad fact. We must be better.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: i just remembered this experience and I wanted to share to further stress my point. I once had a conversation with someone who was an ally of the whole community (even though slightly misguided he had no real hatred) but because of the lack of representation and information about people with/who want created complex genitalia he mentioned the word futah (futa? Im not very familiar tbh) in a very sexualised context. Personally that made me super uncomfortable but it goes without saying that awareness needs to be spread about this and we cant inform people without representation first.
No, being trans just means you don't identify with your assigned gender at birth. You can choose to transition *because* you're trans, but you don't have to transition to *be* trans - you already are.
No. You do not have to transition to be trans. There are many reasons why a trans person may be unable or unwilling to undertake any particular part of transitioning, or all of it, and that's ultimately their business.
From my understanding the tech is actually very good. The bigger issue is how expensive it can be.
Hey that’s like my mom. When I told her I was mtf she asked me if that meant I liked men.
Oh yes ""You can't be trans if you then turn out to be homosexual"" 😐
I didn’t even notice in my efforts to be supportive and I apologize. I thank you for being so civil and diplomatic. Internet hand shake.
Yay!!
> However if you don't experience dysphoria over your body why transition at all?

Because I have other types of dysphoria. I already tried living as a cis person for over 30 years. No matter how much I've tried, I can't get rid of the feeling that I was meant to be male. 

You might be interested in https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en to learn more about other types of dysphoria 


> Wouldn't remaining how you are be easier than dealing with the social consequences of being trans?

Actually my life has vastly improved once I came out. I live in a very trans friendly city in a very trans friendly state. So far I have had zero social consequences from being trans. If anything, I wish I had started hrt earlier.
Well I've tried my best to clean those up so I don't think you'll actually see them anymore.
I definitely agree, I feel euphoria when I shave my legs and arms, and when I wear my skirt, but not much dysphoria.
I wouldn't really know so far, I mostly lurk.
That is really sad that it comes from within our own people.

I guess I can consider myself lucky. I've only realised I'm trans for a few months (deep down I knew i was over 20 years ago. Long story behind it all) and I've only been publicly open about it the past month. But I haven't heard to deal with anything negative beyond a back handed comment from my birth mother saying ""try living like a guy first""

So I guess I'm lucky.
They need to stop projecting their ideals for themselves onto other people. It's disgusting

There are two different transometric scales. A 14 is low on the Zelda scale, which runs from 1 to 69, but off the charts on the Samus scale which is out of 10.
He's one of my best friends, has been for 5 years. I'm going to come out to him soon, ideally I can educate him and bring him along as an ally 🤞🏻
Exactly! Or that they're even starting them on hormones that early! To my knowledge the most that would happen is they start puberty blockers before puberty, which are proven to be reversible if the adolescent decides they don't want to go forward with gender affirming care. They basically give the child a few teen years to decide if HRT is really what they want. Some states prevent teens from starting HRT until 17 or 18. The idea that kids are being ""indoctrinated"" or ""groomed"" is preposterous
We recommend perusing r/Salmacian and possibly joining the Discord.

We wish to have both sets of equipment essentially, to put things more plainly. And such surgeries are possible.
Some people in the Salmacian groups do identify as futas as well, but yes, that is a term more often used in porn. 

We are very sorry you were put in that kind of position ever, no one should feel sexualized against their will. 

Of course, we are also simultaneously sex positive and think that those who wish to be sexualized have every right to experience such.
Thank you for making me feel a little more valid 😭❤️
This plus medical intervention is not the only way to transition. People have been trans since before hormones and surgery
I’ve heard you lose sensation in that region. Is the new tech not doing that anymore? Totally could have come across bad info in the past
That's really similar to my mother's argument she tried to use to prevent me from transitioning. (Not like I haven't made up my mind already.) ""So you're gonna be trans and gay rather than be """"""normal"""""" and straight? That just doesn't make any sense!"" Yeah, well, if we could choose to be cis or trans based on how much *sense* it made, I wouldn't be having this convo with you mom.
It's all good. Trust me-I'm biased towards the gals but there are a lot of good guys out there who don't deserve the added insecurity. Thanks for being cool.
Fair enough.

Thank you.
Most people need to stop it, sadly.

Good luck! I hope it works out well for you and that he is supportive, even if it takes a while for him to fully understand.
hugely suggest giving him his own resources to look at rather than solely relying on you. emotional burnout is a bitch.
Definitely bad info. As someone who is post op, I much prefer sex now than before, for a number of reasons, and that surgery was done almost 4 years ago.
My partner lost sensation and drive after GRS and has been really fucked up about it since. There are risks. It's always getting better but it's still a coin toss.
Yup. When I came out to my mom I told her all the reasons I am trans, including my ""private life"". Didn't really help her to understand. She thinks I'm struggling with my identity. Yes mom, and I've already found out. Now I'm thinking of the steps I wanna take. I don't choose to be like this, but I choose what to do about it.
I’m NB so I certainly get it.
Ha! No worries! I thought it was funny <3

That's a great point. Do you have any recommendations for resources that could clearly and succinctly explain the nuance? A lot of stuff I've read fleshes out these concepts in great detail, and may be overwhelming or inaccessible for a cis person. But then again, maybe I should just go back and find some passages myself. My friend is also one to TRY to understand if he doesn't know about something
That’s awesome thanks for letting me know
I assume you're aware of the gender bread person? It's simple and straight to the point. Not specifically trans, but gets the job done immediately. Hope this idea helps someone.

My therapist said being trans is a choice	"I came out today to my therapist as trans hoping she would help me coming out to my (transphobic) parents, but she totally misunderstood it (I guess). She kept saying identifying as trans is a choice and she kept calling me by my old name. Although she promised she wouldn’t tell my parents, I’m still quite upset with it ‘cause it feels like I just lost the only person I trusted and actually had the opportunity to help me with my gender dysphoria. I’m just kinda devastated honestly atm but yeah. It’ll be fine eventually ig but being trans just really sucks sometimes:/





Added:

Thank you guys for all your responses!! Never thought it would have this much comments when I posted this topic, but it really makes me feel valuable and worthy despite the shit I got over me earlier. You’re all just amazing:))"	"Oh hell no, get another therapist 

Im sorta on a similar thing where this pyscologist I got referred to keeps on talking about I might change my mind as trans like I really need to say ""can you stop talking about that, I'm fucking trans"" cis people have this thing where anything that's not straight or cis is a choice or temporary. This shit lead me to have transphobic intrusive thoughts, make me wanna swing at myself.
New therapist time
Being trans isn’t a choice. How long you choose to let your past define is. If you are trans hun, then live your life as you. It was a nightmare for my parents but after three years they got used to it. It’s not gonna be a nice neat little Christmas present but give it time and the you that you are will become the new normal for them, transphobia or not. Have faith and pride in yourself and take it one step at a time! You can do this!! And get a different therapist. We are all here for you.
Ask them if they consider being gay a choice? They will probably say of course not you are born gay, hopefully this will help them realise the hypocrisy of what they said and how wrong it is.
Jesus, I hate when people think this kinda stuff is a choice.  Same kinda logic when people think being poor’s a choice
Get a new therapist 

Being trans isn't a choice; transitioning is.
change your therapist
I had a therapist that told me this too.  He told me being trans was “a sickness”.  I ended up recloseting myself for a long time only to come out at 41 and start transitioning.  Being trans isn’t a choice and it doesn’t go away.
Possibly poor communication, or lost in translation?

Being trans is definitely not a choice. Whether you transition, and how you go about it, are entirely your choice (even if it feels like there's only one option, because the alternative isn't good).
Being trans isn’t a choice, and a good therapist would know this because there have been numerous psychological studies into that question.  How your therapist *should* treat you is in the DSM, and your therapist isn’t following the best practice guidelines.

I am so sorry.
Its really sad that some therapists out there are like this. When I came out to my therapist she said I just wanted to become a man because I was deeply misogynistic
If that's her response, she's not worth trusting.  I'm certain she will tell your parents.  That happened to me at age 13.  The therapist assured me that EVERYTHING I said was in complete confidence. And that he was not even LEGALLY allowed to tell my mother.  He poked and prodded until I revealed things to him I'd never told anyone.  Things I never planned to tell anyone.  Things I was ashamed of.  But he said I could only get ""better"" if I said them openly. He scribbled notes furiously, but promised that no one would ever find out. I let my guard down (stupid, stupid!).  At the end the session, he invited my mother in alone and read his notes to her verbatim.  On the hour long ride home she got to thrash me and attack me with, using my greatest fears, and most shameful thoughts against me.  She continued to use that against me for years after.  Yeah, Generally f$%& therapists for teens.  Talk about not getting ""better"".
Unfortunately you need to find a therapist who is LGBTQ+ friendly. These days you can't expect any standard provided (mental or physical health) to understand or support trans folks. I tried to come out to a previous therapist when I was underage and they just ignored me. Now I have a great therapist who is poly/ace and has tons of trans clients.
Ask her when she realized she was cis. Ask her how she realized she was cis. Ask her if she's sure it isn't a phase. Ask her if she has ever tried being the opposite gender.

In my experience, best tactics to use are whatever they are using. Then they can't dismiss your point as being *illegitimate* or whatthefuckever.
I'm sorry that you experienced this. I have to say from a clinical psychologist perspective and as a transgender woman myself being openly transgender is a choice. You can choose to live a lie or live your truth. Hang in there and be firm with you therapist about your boundaries and expectations for your sessions. If need be change therapists if you don't feel comfortable with your current one. And yes being trans comes with difficulties but your going to be stronger and better equipped to take on the world. I have complete faith in you! As for your parents, if you rely on them for housing and everything else coming out to them may not be best if you think they will kick you out. I waited till I no longer needed my parents for help before coming out. Glad I waited!
The only ‘choice’ there is with being trans is whether people know or not. TBH they already sound like an awful therapist, I’d be replacing them as fast as I could since there’s no excuse. I’m so sorry you have to deal with someone whose only way of being ‘professional’ is in their title, and I hope you can find a therapist who’s actually going to have your back. *sends witch hugs*
Sorry for your experience.  I had a psych professor in uni say, in passing during a lecture, that ""gender"" was performative.  He was part of the Behaviorists group of faculty in the department.  My point is, psychology is actually a large field and it impossible to know all of it, especially if the information is not directly related to your field of interest.  I assume your therapist is a general practitioner or juvenile specialist.  In which case their knowledge on Gender Dysphoria will likely be either significantly outdated or missing entirely.  A good test of your therapist's intentions would be to ask them how are trans conditions discussed in the DSM (if in U.S.) or ICD (if not in U.S.).  If their answer deviates from what is in either resource, leave and never go back.

[How the DSM defines it (not a link to the DSM but to Psychiatry.org)](https://psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria)

[How the ICD-11 defines it (not a link to the ICD but to an article by the WHO)](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/gender/gender-definitions/whoeurope-brief-transgender-health-in-the-context-of-icd-11)
Find out her governing body and report her.

I'm a trained therapist and this is enough to get her in deep shit.
If you like this therapist, they may just be ignorant, many are not trained at all to handle trans clients and you msy often find yourself having to educate them, no doubt people in the comments are suggesting finding a new one, that's not always easy, and you already have rapport with this one and seem to like them.

If getting a new one is an option, great, or you can try to train this one if you like them enough to continue.

Be firm, when they use the wrong name or pronouns correct them. Keep correcting them until they get it right, don't move forward on a topic. Get them research materials, YT videos, discussions, papers, scientific journals, email them or bring them with you. 

You can't continue to get help until they understand how trans people function, so they either need to get educated or you will have to go elsewhere. If it is the second option make sure you let them know why you're leaving. Make it sting, let them know they failed you, so maybe they have some remorse and they do get better educated if they ever get another trans client again.
As a therapist in training:   


NO. BAD. FUCK HER. FIRE THAT BITCH. She's a fucking transphobe.   


I'm so sorry she FAILED to do her job and support you. She is WRONG. I love you. Please find a new therapist <3
Idk, that sounds horrible to me, if you want to continue seeing her it’s fine, but I don’t know how much she’s going to be able to help you with a mentality like that because even if you avoid the topic, being trans is still a part of you and that wouldn’t be very healthy. If you have the possibility to do so, it would be best for you to switch. Having to educate your own therapist is a really energy draining experience and sadly I say that from experience.

One of the most sinister things about this society for queer people, is that someone could be so nice to you, literally the kindest most loving person ever, and then one day you find out they’re queerphobic and it’s like everything starts falling apart in a matter of seconds. You just never know, it’s like a ticking bomb, you can’t trust anyone unless you know them deeply. Kinda disturbing at least that’s what I think but I might just be dramatic
New therapist time and report them, this person is dangerously ignorant for their job.
that really sucks, it's time for a better therapist
That's because psychology is largely biased towards us
This is simple, get a new therapist. Sometimes therapists are garbage humans who are able to focus on one specific aspect of human psychology to get through their practice.  Sounds like your therapist is garbage.
Never go there again
Just FYI changing therapists is a huge part of therapy for everyone who wants it. 

Therapists aren't a hive mind, or the borg or whatever. They don't all have the same values and experience and education or training. 

You *do* have to shop around. It's not a failure on anyone's part if you want to switch
Being a worthless therapist is a choice, you deserve better sweetie
""Ok therapist when did you choose to be cis?""
I’m sorry that happened. 

It doesn’t sound like you may have much option regarding your choice of therapist. Hopefully you will be able to see a different therapist in the near future. When you can; try to find one who specializes in gender issues. It makes a world of difference.

Until I found one, I looked on you tube. Dara Hoffman-Fox and Dr Z were the two most helpful I found. They are more geared toward adults but the info is good.

Phoenix Animations has some good ones too. Not a therapist, but one video “Harsh Reality of transitioning” captures how I feel, and I guess how many more feel. It discusses a more supportive but realistic view of how things are for us. 

When I looked I picked a good day, and promised myself to ignore that thing in my search that was anti-LGBT+ in any way. Anything that called us part of a movement, a craze, etc. the two therapists I named are petty good about getting anti-trans stuff off of their comments sections. Others, I tend to avoid, unless I feel like I can handle it. 

And you’re right being trans does suck sometimes. But not because we are trans. It sucks because some people are bullies. They want to try and stop us from being who we are, so for me, when I start to think being trans sucks, I say some people suck. And my “choice” is to not let them stop me from being who I really am. 

Internet hugs my amazing sibling. There are good therapists out there and hopefully you can access one soon.
I mean, report them to the board. They are practicing quack psychology.
So many people say it’s a choice but when they do I’ve found asking them when they chose to be cis or chose to be strait to shut that down quickly and somewhat turn their logic against them.
Gender affirming care is hard to find but I really really think you should leave this therapist and seek a new one.  She will not help you with the care you might want or need in the future.  I’m really wishing you the best and I support you ❤️
Because your therapist is someone you trust, is this a relationship you want to salvage?? If so, do you feel safe enough to share your discomfort with the way they handled the discussion?? As I’m sure you know, finding the right therapist is a journey, sometimes it’s a long painful journey. I think you should sit with your feelings and decide if this is something you want to attempt to work through with them. You’re the one who knows them, would it be worth it to bring up how their response made you feel, or do you think that would be a lost cause, or even something you want to do. It all comes down to how safe you feel with them. If you don’t, feel safe expressing your grievances, close that door and open another one. 

But if you do decide you want to try and salvage it and need help confronting them, reach out and we’ll help you. 

Either way, good luck. You deserve to be supported, you deserve to feel safe.
I understand a theory of gender where it is a choice to be any gender and a choice to transition, so through that lens, it is a choice to be trans... it's just a choice that is influenced to the point of compulsion by Gender Dysphoria - when someone has that. It doesn't seem like that's what your therapist is going for, if they are also deadnaming and shit. Looking for someone who specializes in trans health might help, though it might be hard to explain to your parents. Consider your excuses in advance I guess because GOOD healthcare is critical
Time for a new therapist
Find a therapist that specializes in gender identity
If trans was a choice, I wouldn't be transitioning at 34 after decades of suppression.
Depending on your country you may be able to report your therapist for being transphobic. Any therapist who lets their political beliefs get in the way of providing care is unfit to practice
Did you pick this therapist? Because if your parents took you to a therapist that's say of a religious bent. That may well be the typical response you get.
Find a new therapist, AND lodge a complaint with the state board that certifies them. Deadnaming is shitty, she wouldn't do that if you'd changed your name for something like marriage. Blatant transphobia to me.

Also therapist <> patient concerns are confidential. If she WERE to share any information like this with your parents, she should lose her license. Therapists aren't even supposed to confirm if someone is their client or not! If you're over 18 and she DOES share with your parents, get a lawyer and sue her pants off. Lambda legal has lawyers that specialize in lgbtq issues.
Ask them what does it mean. I think it could be easier to talk if they could explain what is choice for them
Get a new therapist!
Did you indicate your uneasiness you were feeling while talking to her? You have every right to correct her and if she still doesn't listen to your point then clearly she is in wrong profession.  You can find a new one then....

There are a lot of Wolf in Sheep skin in the world. Specially in recent past, many anti-liberal agendas getting boost and these wolf's are showing up. We see them all over, from top scientist, professors, journalists, politicians and all the way down to the day laborer everywhere.

Its a sad state of affairs... :(
I always feel like the people who say that being trans/gay etc is a choice were born trans/gay and they “chose,” not to be.

Edit: poor grammar
Wow that therapist is super bad and wrong
She obviously has no expertise in the area. She should admit it and help you find someone who can be useful. But my guess is she won't.
Never go there again
I know a toxic person who is a therapist 
Just because someone is a therapist doesn't mean they actually part of your healing journey
That's why it's important to pick the right therapist
There are therapists specialised in  LGBT+ issues, I hope you can find a good one
Also might be worth reporting them if you can?
I'd say get a new therapist honestly. Since you aren't out to your parents just make up some excuse to not talk to her anymore
A choice the same way happiness is a choice, or like choosing to have a life or not. A choice like you can either live or die. 


Your therapist makes excuses for the world's hostility to trans folks. It'd be absolutely in your right to dump her.
You need a new therapist. Seriously, please. Find one that has experience with trans and lqbtq issues. Your current therapist is NOT helping you, and is woefully incorrect
Sounds like your therapist sucks. Time to find a new one
Hey but you know what is a choice?

Who your therapist is. This one’s no good.
I'm sorry, you may need to find a new therapist or at least test the waters elsewhere if possible.
I'd seek out a trans friendly therapist, even if they are online only in your area. A therapist who thinks trans is a choice is an uneducated one who will do more harm than good.

If you're confident enough I'd even tell the office when I cancel follow up appointments, ""I need to move on to a more educated therapist, this one told me begining trans is a choice but that is outdated and incorrect information. Now I need my files sent to Dr. X please. I won't be back to this office.""
This is exactly why I skipped talking to a therapist no thank you! Glad I didn’t need one to start transitioning.
Therapist sounds uneducated and lacking adequate experience. Folks like this will only stunt your growth ime.

Gender expression can be a choice, since starting HRT I truly don’t believe that being trans is anything but a medical condition. I read this from a conservative trans man who was living stealth and while I did not understand at the time what he meant I do now. The social aspects can get confusing but not to someone with lived experience.

I hope one day the medical community catches up. I would say I hope the psych community does as well but most days I don’t fully understand their place in any of this aside from emotional support during the process. A real professional would be able to separate opinion from fact.
Your therapist is an uneducated moron.
Holy crap! They're a shit therapist...
get a new therapist-
Being trans is as much a choice as being black.
Becoming a man or becoming a woman is a choice☺
Being Trans is not a choice, but what is a choice, is who is your therapist and it certainly shouldn't be that amoeba!
Ditch that asshole and report them to the appropriate governing body!
Psychology today is a great site to find a therapist and you can filter by insurance plans and with a variety of other things, including LGBTQ+ supportive therapists. Tell your parents that things aren't really gelling with this therapist and you took the initiative and found a couple of therapists that look like might work.
Adding my voice to all the others here, FIND ANOTHER THERAPIST ASAP!!
Get the EFF outa there and find an actual good therapist. I have a zero TERF policy, and that extends to medical people and therapists.
Since your therapist is out of line with the latest DSM, this actually sorta means that your ""therapist"" is just some arrogant asshole making it all up as they go along.

New therapist time!
I know how you feel kinda, I feel like I’m getting mixed signals from my therapist, she was acceptive and stuff but she’s always saying my dead name, like no matter how much I remind her or talk abt the fact I’m trans and how it affects me she always uses it, idk if im being paranoid but I just don’t feel comfortable going anymore because of that fact
Find a new therapist. If they don't take you seriously when you tell them something, they do not have your best interests at heart. If you're a minor, go stealth if necessary.
It’s a common misconception. Being trans is not a choice.
I guess identifying as trans is a choice, but being trans is definitely not a choice, who would choose to go through the things we go through every second of everyday, seriously, you should report that therapist and get a new one asap
It’s not a choice. 

Transitioning is. Telling people you are is.  

But being trans, nope. That’s just who you are.
Get a new therapist they are not allowed to give any judgments, I report her too!
sure, being trans is a choice, if you mean it's a choice between transition or misery, or for so many, between transition or death. Your therapist is treading dangerous territory here.
I gotta agree with you tho...

If you feel you have to ""come out"" with your therapist.. probably that the trust isn't fully there.. so looking for a new therapist right now is the way to go..
She’s awful. You need a new therapist
What a fricken tool of a therapist- if it’s an option definitely throw her in the trashcan of bad resources and get a new therapist, at least do the first option
She is either confusing ""being trans"" with transitioning or doesn't understand how character traits work. You can't choose to be something or to like something, you can only decide what to do about it. Let's take pizza for example: You cannot choose whether you like pineapple on pizza or not, this is just a part of you, yet you can definitely choose whether to put pineapple on pizza or not.
This is like finding an airline pilot who thinks the Earth is flat. It's rare, but it happens. Time to find a better therapist.
Well, unfortunately some doctors think the same as well. Some believe that being gay is a choice or a sin (which means both for them). And some refuse to treat LGBTQ patients. Seems that's the case with some therapists. Find a trans-inform therapist. Hopefully these resources help. Good luck.

You are amazing.  Stay true to yourself.  Hugs and Prayers tomorrow is better for all of us!
Hold in there girl!!! Teenage is hard to navigate but it'll all come just fine!!!

Sorry for your struggle and you not alone..
 We're here with and for you 💗
Time for a new therapist, this person has literally no grasp of the realities of the trans experience.
Um yeah...it IS a choice...
But the choice isn't a take or leave choice it's a I'm not gunna sit here and be something I'm not just to please others with what they believe I should be or what I should do or behave. It's a choice to take a stand and be all you can be as a person and take those steps to change your entire chemistry just to feel an ounce of happiness. Seems like people have a hard time understanding that the choice isn't the swap, it's the choice to not settle for anything less than who we are and that is the BIG difference.
She is right I guess. Identifying as trans is as a choice as idetifying as a human being. It's something that you are whatever but it's your choice to identify as...  
Jokes aside she is not worth your money. Try to find a new one if you want to go ahead in your journey.  
Lots of love and support <3
I hope you find a new therapist! I found someone that has been totally accepting, and she has been a blessing in helping me further explore who I am,  where I am going in life, and help me navigate my worries and self judgment as I figure out to what level I will transition. She has been absolutely amazing, and I really feared I would never have such a vital resource to share and speak with.

One of the things I really love about her is that she doesn't make me prove to what level I am trans, which was always something I was very worried about and felt with other therapists here & there over the years. I feel like so many areas of transgender care is (was?) about gate keepers telling us whether or not our feelings and experience is legitimate or not. My current therapist has reiterated numerous times she is not there to judge whether or not my feelings are legitimate, rather she is there to help me navigate what I am feeling and to help me best adjust to my circumstances so I can live my happy and authentic life where I feel like I can be me.

They are out there! I hope you find one.
You are not alone and you are a very valuable person worthy of all the kindness there is. I think you need a new therapist even though you must feel comfortable with her since you came out to her. She may ask why you think your trans so you can understand who you are but being trans isn't a choice, it also isn't a disease that needs to be fixed. Once the therapist helps you understand that when you look in the mirror (contrary to what society has always told us) what you see may not be who you are then your choices can start, your journey is your choice. how far, how fast, how much you transition is up to you, the therapist should help you navigate all of it
Just food for thought but when I came out to my therapist we discussed that being trans is a choice. Obviously not literally, you can’t help being trans, but you CAN choose not to act on what you want. It’s a choice between being yourself or being unhappy for the rest of your life but that still is a choice. You know better than me how she said it but I thought I would at least present the possibility that that’s what she meant
You are the amazing one. It’s time to find a new therapist someone who specializes in gender dysphoria. Please stay safe and take care 💕
Hellllll noooooooo.

A therapist denying your true identity?? Get lost!

Thats such a basic low level standard of respect its honestly a show of character that your THERAPIST cant even respect something so so so simple.

Youre valid and im pretty sure this shouldnt even be a barrier. Especially if you have bigger things you need to work on in therapy.

Be straight forward and honest about it. You respect my name and pronouns and you get your check. If not im bringing this up with someone more important than you.

Keep your head up friend. Youre amazing and totatlly worthy of being respected.
<3
Wow... that's... totally going against what a therapist is supposed to do. Damn, peoples' transphobia is coming out of the woodwork just everywhere right now, ain't it? I'm so sorry, you need to get an educated therapist who isn't biased against transgenderism or trans people. People still talk like this about being gay, and we still have homophobia, but it's just gotten much less acceptable to dehumanize gay people than trans people. Things will change, in time, but yeah. 

You can search on psychology today and other sites for gender affirming care providers who will support you. Biases should never get in the way of providing psychological or medical care, but people are human and there's always a few bad ones in a bunch, unfortunately.
Ditch this bastard and get a new therapist, one that specializes in gender identity issues.  If you have trouble finding one go to [WPATH.org](https://WPATH.org) and click 'Find a Provider'
I’ve tried to choose to be cis. Gender dysphoria can be completely unbearable, and I’d far rather just enjoy being a male. Unfortunately, all I got out of attempting to be cis was a bad childhood. There is plenty of science behind using medical transition to treat gender dysphoria, and I promise you it works very well. Get a more qualified therapist.
Okay, but even if it were a choice. . .it's still fine and dandy. The idea that you have to prove it's not a choice already puts you at a disadvantage. We know it isn't. But this weird notion that somehow our choices are invalid in the first place, particularly ones that harm no one, seems to go unaddressed. I wonder why.

Transphobes don't actually care if it's a choice or not. Gay conversion therapy isn't done because they honestly believe it's a choice and they want you to choose their way. It's about punishment. It's about sadism. It's about something ""wrong"" with you, and it's about them using that as an excuse to punch down and revel in what scraps of dominance they have over another member of their species. It's just ape-brain behavior disguised as concern, righteousness or even mask-off psychopathy. 

Don't placate. Don't submit. Don't play nice. They certainly won't.


Fuck em. Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.
Therapists do not care about your feelings they are there for the money unfortunately. Planned Parenthood you don't need approval from a therapist whatsoever, I walked in, didn't have a referral or anything. I had a prescription for Estradiol and Spironolactone in less than 2 hours.
I feel like most people are confused about the terms they use, and they talk too fast, and thinking that there's only one way to look at things... So much misinterpretations..

It's important to be able to differentiate the concept of ""doing"" vs ""being"" which refers more as: they way you are inside, the way you feel inside.

Maybe the way your therapist saw it what more from the point of view of the action of coming out... Which is indeed a choice, as much as someone who decides to never come out publicly... As much as any action we choose to or not to do in our lives...

Whereas most people think of it as ""being""(the way you feel inside), and in this case is in fact not a choice... That's not something you can explain why.. you just ARE... 

That's why I feel it's important to notice the nuance of the words that are being used... Because someone who's not careful enough could easily interpret the words ""I am"" for, ""I decide to do"" based on the simplistic aspect of appearance.. without the deeper concepts that it involves.

Some people just don't have the linguistic capacity to understand the differences of the words.. they just bluntly stay in interpretation at all time, and that leads to miscommunications..

Maybe to try to clarify that with your therapist could change this whole situation.. because even as professionals, they are just people, people who also need to evolve in order to reach a higher level of understanding towards everything.
Did your therapist ever ask you about any of this? So far the therapists I’ve seen have always asked me about my gender identity/how I interpret it and worked from there. She may just be misled. You can try talking to her about it before just transferring to another, but that’s your choice friend
Fork her!! Ask her how she knows she’s cis.
Damn imagine becoming a therapist to help people in need, and then not helping people in need
Maybe being trans isn't a choice, but there a lot choices involved with being trans, just as there with being straight, gay, black, Asian, or whatever. We still have choices - being trans doesn't automatically make one DO anything in particular, just like being a man doesn't automatically make a person a violent sociopath, or being a woman makes someone a slut. These are choices individuals make.

So you're trans. Neat. What choices are you going to make now that you know this? Will you dress different? Will you get offended if someone mistakes your gender? Will you go to parades and hold signs? Will you take hormones and get surgery? These are all your choices.

Finding out your trans is your journey of self discovery, but it's not autopilot cure all where you now know what you have to do with your life. It's just a realization you've made about yourself, and now you have choices to make so you can live your life the way you want to.
Quick tip, don’t come out to your parents if they’re transphobic
Once again a therapist  putting the hyphens  into psycho-the-rapist
It’s the choice to be your true self or to be something you’re not for everyone else. It’s time for a new therapist🏳️‍⚧️
You should change to another therapist. You can say it’s for any reason, it doesn’t have to be for their views on transgender people. (Which by the way, being transgender is 100% NOT a choice. We’re born that way).
Wow, you def need a new therapist. I can’t imagine someone saying anything that reckless and wrong. Sorry you had to go through that.
As a therapist that was very irresponsible of her political beliefs and ideal should stay of of sessions
Do people honestly think we choose to be trans??? Do they think we choose to be disrespected, killed (at alarming rates), attacked etc
Yep, not all therapists fit all patients. Time to look for a better fit.
Although I do not know how old you are or who is paying for the “professional care” that you were supposedly receiving I personally would have gotten up right after she told me it was a choice and told her that it was obvious that she is not the person I am looking for to assist me with my health.  I would have secondly not have paid her for that session stating that I pay for professional services and she is obviously not one of those persons.

I wish you all the best, you deserve more than what that lady is capable of providing you. Do some research and I hope you find find someone in your area that can provide you with the care that will help you in leading a happy and healthy life.
New therapist time.

Also, they don’t need to ‘promise’ you that they won’t tell your parents. In most countries, it’s straight up illegal to violate your secrecy that way.
Wow… it is not a choice! Time to find a new therapist for sure! It is your choice on being authentic or staying “in the closet”, but you don’t make the choice of being in the wrong body gender-wise.
She's wrong, and even if she wasn't you're still the only one who knows what is right for you.
Yeet the therapist
“Being trans is a choice.”  
“And? Are you saying it’s not acceptable unless it’s an accident of birth? We’re you born an asshole?”
Google ""LGBTQ friendly therapists near me"". That's how I found mine. A lot of therapists will have what they specialize in, listed in their profile. LGBT issues will be listed as a specialty. Good luck friend ❤️
I had one do that to me I legit walked straight out of their office and never returned.
the only part about it being a choice is when you come out & when + how you decide to transition. you think we wish all this dysphoria on ourselves cause it’s fun & feels nice?
All therapist have different views that will help them reach a final choice, if i may say tbh shes probably more old school. She may also think SOME should learn to just learn to love themselves, however everyone is different. Not to be anything but a therapist (a good one anyways) isnt paid to tell you what you want to hear.
Time to trash her get a new one
No my middle finger slowly rising in there face is a choice but it sound like you may need to find a new one. Its not ez getting someone to change there position on this so you're going to have to gage if that's something that you want to try or find a new one that is openly more supportive.
please get a new therapist! Being trans is 100% not a choice and it sometimes is a big bummer to live with but you’re emotions and identity are valid :)
okay so my therapist really did not quite understand me being trans. which was kind of funny because then I had to teach her. i made a google slideshow explaining the early moments of my life where i unapologetically saw myself as a boy before i was forced to conform to my assigned sex at birth, my history of gender dysphoria, the whole transgender and cis brain research study thing, etc. she’s beginning to understand a lot more stuff now so i can actually vent to her about dysphoria stuff and transphobia and she can offer stuff back.
Just adding to the crowd but FIRE YOUR THERAPIST.
Is that legal?
Being a chef or a bricklayer is a choice but being trans isn't because you can't help what you feel about yourself like a homosexul person can't help being attacked to the same sex or someone with a fetish or an addiction try as you may to put it to the back of your mind it will get the better of you in the end,
 
So how can someone suffering the feelings they should be the opersit sex live there lives without doing something about it ie transitioning becoming a transgender person,

Best tell your therapist he or she's is in the wrong job and would be better to choose to become something else
One thing you could do when visiting you therapist again is ask them what exactly they specialize in because if they do not specialize in gender identity etc they are not the therapist for you,

Believe me i asked one once and after a wile of asking sevral times she said HIV and I said well its understandable you dote understand what im telling you and she said what do you mean I trained for 5 years yes you trained for 5 years reading books on your special subject so maybe you could read some books of gender related issues to better understand people like me she said its all in your head you dote know what your talking about Well i obviously know more than she did and I didn't train for 5 years 😉 🤣
Yeet the therapist
Get a new therapist asap.. whoever that person is he or she is a dumbass
Identifying as trans is a choice. Obviously.
I don’t get why the conservatives and transphobes think this is an insult and I don’t get why people are offended by this. Can somebody please explain this to me. I don’t get why nobody actually listens to gender theory.
Therapist here. Get another therapist and report that one. Also if she mentions it to your parents she can lose her licence. I am assuming you’re a minor since your parents are a worry, but even if you’re under 18 your therapist can’t tell your parents anything unless you’re a danger to yourself or others (or if you give her express permission to do so). 

We are classified as healthcare providers as well as being mandated reporters. HIPAA laws apply and those protect your privacy.
Mine keeps calling me by my old name. Haven’t corrected her but if I do ask and they say differently, it’s gonna hurt to stop seeing them.
it is about as much choice as breathing.  you can choose to stop breathing, but the body will eventually take over after you pass out and resume breathing.  you can deny being trans, but after a while, you reach a point of ""i can't go on like this.""  at which point, your whole being is telling you to get with the program.
That therapist is a choice
Is there any rating site where you can leave a comment about this therapist being transphobic? They usually are anonymous and called something like Rate My Doctor. 

I am so sorry this happened
Your therapist is a hack fraud.
I definitely didn't pay $8,600 on laser hair removal because I chose to be transgender. Wanna slap your therapist so badly!
That's not a therapist it's a bag of rocks with a degree, get out if there.
I don't get why people trust therapists, that whole concept seems dangerous to me, telling your deepest darkest secrets to basically a stranger and then just trusting there word they won't tell anyone else? 

I've had a strange life where I've met alot of people who knew top secret things and confidential things, every one of them couldn't shut up after a few beers when they thought nothing would get back on them. 

Hell I have a f35 lightning 2 concept pictures from 2005 when it was still called the x-35. Wanna know where I got them? Bring your kid to work day at BAE in a spill over store closet.

Once a 2nd person knows something it's no longer a secret in this world.
Gender dysphoria is listed in the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) and is professionally recognized as not a choice. You should report your therapist to the appropriate governing body.
get a new therapist, bring trans isnt a choice. it is your therapist’s choice to be transphobic though.
My therapist immediately was like “You sure?” and keeps asking me if I am, idk how to react
Any chance you live anywhere in NY?
came out as enby to my therapist, apparently she’s a transbian lmao. the things you find out.
""Yes, it's a choice, MY choice. If you can't respect that I will use my choices to no longer employ you""
Get a new therapist.
Your therapist is wrong and you should find someone else
That's a fuckwit not a therapist
omg u need to switch therapists right away. she isn’t getting paid to make you feel worse. she’s supposed to be supportive even if she doesn’t agree.
I'm sorry. You deserve better.
Screw that son ova bitch
Can you switch? This seems pretty toxic? :s
I’m uh, I’m currently in a long term rehab program (I don’t like stay there I just pick medicine up weekly and talk to the doctor like, monthly), and every time I talk to him he tries to tell me I might change my mind and deadnames me and such. People like that piss me off, like no, I won’t change my mind after being out for ten years, you’re just an asshole. B( sorry you’re dealing with it too, dear.
I third this, although most therapists won’t fully understand what you go through, any good one would know that it isn’t a choice
I second this. Definitely find a new therapist. One that actually supports & understands what it means to be trans. Ditch those who are closed minded & align with people who just fucking get it.
You deserve better,  OP.
This is the way.
Idk OP's age but if they are still under their parents thumb then it might be the parents paying for the therapist. That might make it hard to switch cuz they'd have to convince the parents without telling them the real reason. If it's possible though then yeah they need a new therapist lol
Absolutely. Is being fucking cis a choice? Is being straight a choice? If they say yes, we'll it's a shame they're in the closet or an egg, but I'd bet they just think that straight and cis is just 'normal'.

We're all just choosing to be marginalized and mistreated minorities for fun and clout. That makes total sense.
This too. Ask them when they knew they were cis.
Ask them if being an ill-informed, incompetent therapist is a choice. Oh, yeah, it is! Tell them to choose not to suck!
Why are you homeless? Just buy a house lmao 🙄
The old “pull yourself up by your strap on “
God I wish it was....
*so let me get this straight: ever since you were born, the world assumed you were a man. and you are a man. so the only experience you have with gender is when it lines up the convenient way that fits everyone’s expectations. you’re cis. and you think that **you** have the perspective to say whether being trans is a choice?*

*well okay, then tell me, when did you decide to be cis?*
IMO that’s a really bad comparison. The entire argument behind being lgbt is that the scientific consensus says it’s genetic and hard wired into us, therefore not being a choice. Are you saying being in certain economic classes is determined from birth, impossible to change? Obviously some people are born into billions and some poverty, but many people have changed their circumstances. Class is at least somewhat controllable and meritocracy is a proven thing. You’re comparing immutable and mutable things, not apples to apples.
In my opinion, however, at least homelessness, is already a choice. You can always go to prison. There it is warmer than outside in the winter and you do not starve to death 
Edit: I'm from Germany and that was an allusion about a tradition during the 2nd Reich. I don't know why I thought you would know this
Or being gay
I wonder if the therapist is just conflating the two?

Sometimes the terminology can be confusing.
Wooooow. 

They should be prosecuted as far as I’m concerned. Not just lose their license, that is criminal incompetence.
Similar boat and the same seas here.  If it were possible to not be trans - and I tried every god damn thing I could think of in that regard - I wouldn't be.
Hey,  👋 

I'm another 41 late starter. Literally tried goddamn everything to not be trans. I wish I could go back and tell my teenage self to just embrace it already.
Forget the DSM, just being a decent human being is knowing what to do in that situation. OPs therapist failed in every aspect
WTF :((((
Whoa, what the actual fuck. Your therapist also needs to be reported if she wasn't. Damn.
😡😡😡

I’m wtf is wrong with this shit?

They should be prosecuted, not just lose their license, for spewing evil hot takes like that.
WTF. 

Another pos who should go to prison, not just lose their license.
Holy shit that is AWFUL.
Wow. If you have the information to report him now... I hope you can find the courage to do so. That's just... deeply horrific. I'm so sorry that happened to you, and I hope that you can find an affirming care provider you can actually trust in spite of that scumbag.
Wow, what a piece of 💩. I hope he has an awful life with constant suffering.
I’m seconding this. General practitioner therapists can do far more harm than good to us. The first therapist I talked to had NO clue. I was more informed on trans issues than he was. Thankfully I found that out by the end of the 3rd session. But it still set me back a good 6-9 months because I was really apprehensive about trying therapy again even though I had a gender identity specialist lined up.
I think a lot of people are still too stupid to get it even when they’re being hit with the exact same damn thing.

I’ve tried this before and someone, and they just were like “why are you insulting me!“.  

Like I am LITERALLY JUST SAYING THE EXACT SAME THING, FLIPPED!
I don’t necessarily think that thinking of gender as “performative” is a transphobic way of thinking. When people say gender is performative, they are referring to the way in which gender is constituted and reconstituted by actions. The word “performative” can have connotations of inauthenticity, but in the context of social science it means that gendered actions, behaviors, and beliefs are not innate but rather learned. Gender is something one does, not is. Note that this is distinct from gender identity-that is, we do gender in a way that reflects the identity we hold.
I really appreciate this response. Sometimes relationships require work on both parts, even a therapist/patient relationship. Ideally I’d like my therapist to be perfect, but if they have shortcomings that I feel I can work with and help them with, and they’re worth it, I’ll stay.
That's a stellar answer.
yeah that’s how I feel too, the gender dysphoria or whatever feeling you have that makes transitioning an option isn’t a choice, but there are options on how you choose to deal with it of varying effectiveness.
No I didn’t actually, I was kinda in a crisis situation and unable to take decisions by myself so the ER picked in cooperation with my parents a therapist based on their availability so yeah, I didn’t had much of a choice unfortunately:/
Meh. It's a therapist's job to see and tease out the nuances, even (especially?) the hidden/Freudian ones that you're unaware of.
Not really… I live in (western) Europe
And I love where he’s a “professional” and doesn’t know the most basic things about something he should. 

This is why I don’t automatically assume professionals actually know anything (while simultaneously valuing actual expertise). 

I love too where we’re paying THEM and they lack a 101 level education on this. In 2022 no less.
You can always switch and even many therapists say it’s completely healthy to even “shop around” for a therapist to find the right one for you.
No, I got referred, idk I have to speak to him to just not say that anymore 
I mean he's a good psychologist, today he said hello even but it's just when people bring those types of things up..
of you can switch gladly, i did it so many times, although I have never found one that wans´  t completely understanding of the situation i hope you do Queenie.
Gross. I'm so sorry. I'd report him for the harassment and unprofessional conduct when you're able, that's so incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional.
that sounds like a report for professional misconduct. dont ask me where you need to report them, but i know you can and should
The only choice trans people are making is choosing to be themselves.
I fourth this, find a therapist that can atleast somewhat understand their patients.
I can't say whether you should try to educate your current therapist after finding a good therapist that specializes in trans clients, however if she is completely oblivious to the matter of being trans, she COULD be giving lots of (unknowingly trans) clients bad information in good faith.

If she is unwilling to learn, then ditch her 100% because no matter your stage of transition, this can cause you mental stress if she's TOTALLY missing the point.
Don't forget permanently altering our bodies through hormones and spending a few or tens of thousands on surgery's, all just for fun and clout of course!
Damn, if only the homeless knew how easy it is!  We can’t all be rich super geniuses 🙄
Damn, if only the homeless knew how easy it is!  We can’t all be rich super geniuses 🙄
Ikr, I wouldn't wish being trans today on anyone.
I know, it’s just similar logic
Remember, though, prison in the US is literal slavery according to the 13th amendment. So the argument you're making is that one can be homeless or a slave (if this is in the US that we're talking about).
I honestly can’t tell if you’re being serious or not.
So you'd willingly break the law and get sent to prison to stop being homeless?   
Because that'll just make the problem worse. People with felony convictions almost never get hired
Therapists should know better though
According to OP, they said “identifying as trans is a choice.” I’m wondering if they meant “openly” identifying as trans or something like that. I really hope it’s a matter of the therapist not choosing their words wisely and not them actually thinking *being* trans is a choice.
For real. I tried so hard for so many years because I knew how the people around me would take it. Hell, sometimes on bad days I still make a half-assed effort to push myself back in the closet because at times it seems easier than all this (doesn't work anymore tho, the genie is out of the bottle). If it was a choice, with the way the world is right now, I really doubt many people would choose it.
Are you presenting yet?
Another late starter here. I spent ten years in the Army trying not to be trans.

It didn't work.
Yeah, some therapists are just..not the greatest
He's not in practice anymore.  But tgere are plenty like him out there.  Be careful who you trust.
I saw a therapist who had a YouTube channel, and seemed pretty damn saying, and had a video about dumping someone if you were having to pay them to educate them. GEEZ.
Yeah. Gender expression is the performative part of it (Judith Butler is nonbinary and uses these terms in a way that doesn't mean inauthentic, just symbolic acts). But gender identity is also way beyond expression
Their use, in context, was gender-ie the entire concept- is performative, not ""gender expression"".  Again, his specialty was behavioral psychology, not cognitive.  I am trying to give some latitude based on the scope of his specialty rather than just assuming he was being dismissive.  But the class was about Diagnostics in psychology and we were going through the DSM.
Gender-Identity, Gender-Roles, Gender-Expression

so many thingssss
It sounds like your situation is not great, but it does at least sound like you are not currently in crisis. Find a therapist that better matches your needs.
That's right.. it's their job... But again, are we supposed to assume professionals are 100% perfect at their jobs instead of taking the moment for clarification?

Also I want to point out that, there's a difference between what they should be able to do and what they can do.. just because it's the therapist's job, doesn't mean, the therapist knows how to...(we're all human, nobody's perfect).  

And I think it is worth clarifying things.. for the sake of keeping the relationship of trust, if there's a tiny chance that this matter is simply related to miscommunication.  

Especially if the therapist is the only person she can talk to

Ps: I'm not taking any sides here, I'm offering an alternative point of view and a solution
Lol, he's from the school district 

Yeah ge doesn't know much on lgbt I guess
I can't he's from the school district but I can get myself a counselor qnd a psychiatrist
It gets much worse. And I’m very strongly considering it. But I can’t until I go to move to another state bc I’m worried if I do report him rn it’ll impact my recovery and such if I do it now, you kno?
I definitely agree with you but I feel like if I do it while I’m here in my state, it’ll impact my recovery, so. I’m biding my time until he either goes to another clinic, or I move, whatever happens first. Bc honestly it gets worse and I wanted to fist fight him today.
to be fair the therapist kept deadnaming OP. ngl dont think educating this person will really do much. some people are just beyond help but you can try. just dont go in fully expecting them to change.

>I can't say whether you should try to educate your current therapist

You should not. You're there to get help, not to pay to listen to harmful shit and teach someone empathy and basic human decency.
I hate the dumb fuck Republicans that say the kids are just saying they're trans to be cool. Like I think we're cool, I think there's some really incredible trans people, but do the majority of normies think we're cool? Does the average cis person know much of anything about us? I don't know about Gen z, maybe they're a lot better, but high school kids tend to be awful sociopathic bullies. I doubt coming out in high school is a move people would make just for popularity. That's crazy.

Of course it's all bad faith talking points, it just annoys me how blatantly reality contradicts the things they say and how two seconds of thinking is all you need to know they're full of shit, yep still they shout their stupid talking points.
But it’s not? Being lgbt is literally not a choice at all. Class being mutable by definition means it is to a degree a choice. Yes there are homeless that are addicted or mentally ill and can’t help themselves. Then there are those, that according to accounts from former homeless people, just would rather live that life then work. So in that case it’s a choice. There are endless examples of, in this case not homeless poor, that are poor because they don’t have ambitions past a min wage job, or don’t want to go get extra schooling. It is harder to do this if you start out poor of course, but it’s not like the gov hasn’t thought of this and there aren’t plenty of grants and financial aid.

Similar logic would be the “rub dirt on it” or bootstraps. That’s just saying find a magical answer w/out giving an actual solution. Usually the answer is somewhere between the bootstraps and “helpless” arguments.
Yeah, I am from germany. In the 2nd Reich it was a tradition among homeless people to march around the Reichstag at the end of autumn to insult the emperor together. Insulting the emperor resulted in exactly 3 months in prison and thus one was released at the beginning of spring. This is how you survived the winter
Both at the same time. But I am also from Germany. Our Prisons are pure luxury, compared to USA.
A lot of people do precisely that.
20 years in the air force here 😆 

The denial is strong
I get that not all therapists understand LGBTQ+ issues. But I really think a HUGE part of a therapist's job is to help us *see the forest for the trees*. I literally used that phrase with mine this week, thanking her for NOT leading me on, but for helping me to see and connect my own dots about what's really going on with me.

This has happened repeatedly with her, where in the course of a session she will ask me something that I dismiss as ""No, I don't think so."" and then 7 months later I'm like ""OMG, could I not see that?!?"" I think part of it is familiarity with issues like mine. While we're all inherently different, there are a lot of similarities, and if you specialize in something, you recognize more of it because you see more of it.

This relationship is built on trust. SO MUCH TRUST. I tell mine things that I've never told anyone else, sometimes even myself! And it kinda seems like this relationship can never have that level of trust, even if it was a misunderstanding.

Disregard the sunk costs and find a new shrink: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists
I understand... God, I wish I could help you. That's just such a terrible rock and hard place to be caught between. I hope better days come soon for you.
He's impacting your recovery. And he's paid to help you. Is he the only one at that clinic? I'm guessing insurance pays for this, since you are hesitating - if it was you paying, you would be more sensitive about it?

Well, up to you of course. I've never been to psych doctor ever (tho I'm definitely crazy, getting into diy hrt with an Indian online pharmacy)... Only know them from series like Lucifer, Hannibal and Suits 🤔
I had a therapist I tried who had in her information that she has experience with trans clients and is involved in the community. However, when we talked, she misgendered me and didn’t really seem to want to talk about my gender lol.
I agree, however being that she knows almost NOTHING about trans people I'm willing to bet she is not seeing the damage that deadnaming is causing, and is instead thinking that this is an issue made up in OP's head and BELIEVES (which is very much wrong) they are doing OP harm by ""fueling the misconception"", which is basically the only logical reason for somebody who DOESNT want to do harm to a client, but also does NOT understand dysphoria or anything of this nature. Definitely not a good practice as PERSONALLY I would just call a client whatever they wanted to be called if it made them feel better.
I agree, but there's alot more people that she could be doing (unknown) harm to, and to the uneducated person (especially a therapist/psychiatrist) they may believe that this is simply a delusion. Most therapists will try to combat the delusion and are used to dealing with cishets (probably more likely just cis people as a lot of therapists ARE at least somewhat educated on sexuality) and she likely just sees a new identity as either a delusion or as another identity (in the case of multiple personality disorder or something of the sort) and until she understands, will likely do LOTS of other people harm who have NO idea they are trans.

I am not saying that you SHOULD personally educate this person, but maybe giving them a book that's designed for people who study psychology, may help EXPONENTIALLY not just for you, but for her other (even unknowingly) trans clients. She may start to see patterns (such as myself who has been to COUNTLESS psychiatrists and counselors/therapists and was simply told I was depressed with no actual diagnosed cause). I was personally diagnosed with chronic depression, even though I didn't give off the Depresso vibe, I wasn't VISIBLY depressed, but the way my life was being lived, lead them to just say I was DEPRESSED and simply was given antidepressants, some of which worked, some of which caused MORE detriment to my mental health (while taking the drug of course).

I'm sure counselors and therapists see MANY trans clients, they simply lead them in the wrong direction unwittingly, and there is likely an unmeasurable amount of trans clients who visit therapists and are simply given antidepressants. The number COULD be substantial, but there's no way to know, because many of these people could have been simply misdiagnosed for years, even DECADES.
Considering half the country wants trans people dead, those same people claiming trans people are just “choosing” because it’s “cool” is especially evil.
Someone else mentioned it above to you but prison can literally be slavery here.  The Constitutional amendment that banned slavery in America carved out an exclusion for imprisoned people.  Here’s the actual text.

""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""
Wow sounds like she just wanted to run a conversion therapy.
yeah thats also a possibility as well i suppose
Half the country wants trans people dead? Can you back that up with any statistical evidence? That’s quite a statement to make.
What the hell. Ok, starving is better in the USA
yeah fr. thats just screwed up
Are you kidding me?

Don’t be pedantic. Is it exactly half?  No. Probably. Is it millions?  Yes.
How many people voted for the twice-impeached disgraced former President in the last election? That many people want Trans people dead, or at least, are OK with it morally. They've been remarkably clear about their utter disregard and contempt. No I'm not going to dig through the bile to cite sources for a Reddit thread. Oh maybe you're not from the U.S. and you're from a place where there aren't so many right-wingers.
In most states they do pay prisoners for labor to motivate them but because slavery is allowed, they can pay whatever they want.  It’s basically you work a full time job and can reward yourself with a few comfort items like a bag of coffee and a candy bar to make your time slightly less miserable.  Check out this table.

https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/
Oh and that’s bad enough for cis people.  Add in a trans woman and it’s hell on earth.

[She/her] Dysphoria has been kicking my butt lately. Am I passing? Do I need to change something? :(		"That top looks so good on you
You're gorgeous, you don't need to change a thing

Definitely passing. Your chest is like SUPER passing, I agree that the top is cute and I like your hair texture/length. Squats if you want a thicker bum.
I am a huge fan of the pants! Heheh definitely nice and fem! Not to mention everyhing else is on point sister!
You def pass :) very cute top and I also LOVE your shower curtain 😂
Dysphoria is kicking your butt? I'll kick it for you because its a hot ass ngl
I thought this was r/lesbiansactually first, so I think you're doing alright!
So in terms of your literal looks, you totally pass. No one would be the wiser.

Being real, I was in a very similar emotional place very recently, and there's definitely a vibe, a thing in common between how I looked and how you do, that's really about body language and facial expression. There's this feedback loop of ""I don't pass because I look like my dog died, and I look like that because I don't pass."" Girl... it sucks. And I don't have some genius advice, other than keep taking care of yourself anyways, accept yourself as you are (you are good enough, even on days you don't feel like it), and the cloud will eventually leave and find someone more entertaining to pick on. Dysphoria is just another bully. It will get bored and leave eventually, and while it'll be back sometime, it has a lot less power over us when we build good habits of self care that endure through crisis.
You have amazing hair, you definitely pass imo, I'd ask you out haha
Beautiful 💕🥰😍😍💕😍🥰🥰
You Look so good.
100% pass, you look just like any other girl.

You are beautiful!
I think your a mega cutie
yeah!
If you're going to post a ""do I pass post"" you need to post from multiple angles and not hide your face
You look great sweetie 💞
You look amazing!
Just scrolling through the popular page, stopping by to let you know you're looking great. Give those brain bugs a kick, they lie.
I really like those bangs!
I love ur top!! Ur so pretty!!
Passing 100%
I'm not bullshitting you when I say you look more feminine than I did at the height of pretending I'm cis
Great body, lovely curves
I'd say so. Maybe not like I'd think you're cis, but I definitely get a feminine vibe.
Beautiful
Hard to see your face but what I can see is very pretty
Looking
I read that height and build is your concern. But don’t be! I personally love tall women! Also with build you could try doing certain workouts/diets that can change the way your body looks! Personally you already have a great butt but if you wanted to get bigger and a smaller waist you can try waist trying while working out! There’s workouts out there designed to shrink your waist and get a bigger booty! But at the end of the day you look amazing! I hope you share for photos of yourself, you are so pretty! Also Bc I’m a hair coloring addict I would recommend adding highlights or changing the color! Your brown is super cute but I think highlights would def up your game!
You pass, dear. :)
[deleted]
Thanks :3 its just from 2 years of hrt
Height/build :(
Just be happy with what you have and who you are.
I feel like it's definitely a self-perception thing. I'm transmasc and felt weird about my glasses until I got a more ""masc"" set. I realized after though that I never notice it on cis or trans folks. Women regularly get more square/""masc"" frames, and round frames are becoming more popular among men too.

I think it's also seeing your face differently that helps with dysphoria. So i second getting new glasses! But as for if you pass OP, you definitely do :)
100% agree with this I struggled with the same till I found the right frame. Op you look amazing by the way definitely passing
I know but squats suuuuuuuuck :(
I third this. 😘
i am so excited for the day when I can start hrt
I wasn’t going to say anything but I definitely agree, you’re gorgeous and your body emits femininity
What do you want to do about build?  Height is height.  I lost almost two inches due to scoliosis.  I DO NOT recommend that as a transition goal!
Dysphoria makes that really hard for trans people to do
They suck soo bad, my knees HATE squats😂. You don't have to do them! You look great and super femme. it's kind of a style choice at that point. Lots of cis afabs I know want thicker bums and even tho I'm transmasc I do too.  That's why I say booty is a style choice not necessarily a passing thing? Sometimes when I'm icky dysphoric it helps to use my body for something joyful like dancing or hiking?
i quadruple this
Its the magic pill we all wanted, it just takes some time :)
2 inches? Worth it
i quintuple this
Does it hurt as much as people say? Some people keep telling me it does and others tell me that is minor or totally not at all. And you look beautiful, if I pass like you do after my transition then I’d be really happy with myself!
Do you have any idea how painful scoliosis is?
As a tall cis woman, finding good skinny jeans and leggings with long legs is a challenge and can feel like you don't have the opportunity to wear ""femme"" looks. If you're in the US, I recommend American Eagle skinnies - they're very tight and come in extra-longs! They're the only jeans that fit me right. And for full-length leggings, I like Old Navy Activewear - they have longs that fit my 34"" inseam.
I sextuple this
Hurt..? No.. I've never heard of it hurting at all, from anyone.
No but 6'2 sounds better than 6'4
ASOS had a wonderful tall section
I what ever is after this this
I’ve heard that particularly growing breasts can be excruciatingly painful from a few reddit posts/videos, websites and also some hearsay. My trans woman friend said that it hurt her but not as bad as I asked so I guess it differs per person?
I’m sorry you’re struggling with height. I’m really tall too, and it makes me feel really awkward sometimes. 

Still, your height doesn’t make you less of a woman. I know cis women who are taller than you are.
Septuple?
I octuple this
Oh like yeah they're sore and sensitive but no worse than a cis woman when she goes through puberty
Yes that word"	rv6oo7	trans	2201	0.92	2022-01-03 17:15:12
"Most of the ""Do I pass?"" posts on here are most likely fake"	"Been on this sub ever since I came out as trans (MtF) a couple of months ago. I usually just lurk and never post much.  But something has been catching my attention for the past couple weeks on here.  I've been noticing most of the ""Do I pass"" posts that get upvoted fairly are made by new accounts with that post being the only one.  And I'm am sure this isn't a one off thing, about 80 percent of these top post accounts that post is the only one on the account.  Using reverse image searching I can usually find that the pics are just cis people taken off of Facebook to pass as really good looking trans people.  Not only does this kinda ruin the overall vibe of the subreddit, it puts false expectations for other trans people that are dealing with dysphoria.  Not to mention most of these ""do I pass"" posts say that they are pre hormones, which causes more stress to people that have been on hormones for a while and cannot pass as often.  


Sorry for the random rant but i just wanted to get this off my chest, and I don't see anyone else on the sub noticing it.  Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.


Edit: Someone in the comments has pointed out that these posts could be an attempt to troll by TERF message boards (aka 4chan). Apparently they are trying to use these fake passing posts to disenhearten us and weaponize dysphora. Truly disgusting."	"It's a known issue. I was aware of 4chan using this tactic, but the TERF angle is a  new (but predictable) development.

We *try* to remove these when it's obvious, or when another user is able to provide some kind of evidence, but we are walking a tightrope here. On one side, we want to allow people to tell their stories, with minimal gatekeeping on our part. On the other side, we want to eliminate the catfishing posts, as the unrealistic pics can lead to dysphoria.

Do we succeed? Probably; I'm guessing more than we fail. Because of our strict automod content filter, we end up manually reviewing 100s of submissions a day, which keeps a lot the worst and most obvious from seeing the light of day. But it's impossible to catch everything and everybody. If you see something, downvote it and report to the mods; we're much more responsive to the ModMail reports than we are to the (literally) exponentially larger Mod Queue.

We're looking for new/additional moderators for the r/trans sub. If you think you can do it better, please [submit an app](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/q5yzyz/we_are_officially_looking_for_new_moderators/):)

&#x200B;

edit: spelling, words
IIRC there are some people on the TERF message boards who have admitted that they do this, and encourage others to do it, in order to sow doubt in our communities and weaponize dysphoria.

Edit: a lot of people are saying 4chan, and the pinned mod post mentions it being a new development that TERFS are doing it. This was just something I've heard people discussing before in passing, and I couldn't remember the exact details, so it's probably 4chan if that's already been a confirmed source of this stuff. I personally get a lot of harassment from TERFS and forgot that 4chan was a thing. I hate to give TERFS the benefit of the doubt, but I also don't want to be creating or spreading misinformation.
Yikes! That's awful if true. I never ask if I pass, because I'm pretty sure I don't but I always get people telling me here that I do, hard to know if they are being honest, when everyone wants to be so nice(which isn't a problem usually but yeah)
TBH, I was just thinking of unsubscribing because quite a few ""do I pass"" leave me feeling incredulous and disheartened. Now I know why.

And it's doubly awful, because I want to support everyone here, and so I get to choose between feeling awful because of my dysphoria or feeling awful for abandoning y'all.
Egfuckingzactly this, been saying for decades the infiltration by experienced bad actors is far more extreme than naive inexperienced wide eyed new trans folks can realize. 

The upvotes is extremely alarming and telling how well the infiltrators have become.

Some verification and process is very much needed.
i never say I pass regardless of what people say to me. I'm genuine with my pics though dispite me hating them. But yeah, using fake images really sets the wrong expectations on what is considered passing
Legit been suspecting this cuz there's so many ""pre everything"" trans MtF and I'm sitting here like ""I don't see makeup, and I don't see them using an app, where is their facial shadow?""

Yes I know not every trans girl may be in my shoes with heavy/thick facial hair/shadow however the more I connect with my trans sisters, I'm seeing us all bitch about facial shadow and the like. I personally meet very few who don't have this issue unless they managed to go on t blockers before they grew facial hair (lucky girls, I wish I could)

Again, this is my 2¢ and I know I'm painting a broad brush stroke but these are based on my experience and everyone has a different one.
I also am tired og the age and gender me posts. My blood pressure is to high to get on HRT. It because i have chronic kidney stones and the Drs did lythotripsy. To break them up which altered the glands that control my BP. So I just decided to do what I can and be the best I can because inside this is who I am. I don't make the rules to life. I just break them
I think you’re right. I know trans women IRL and sad to say, most of them don’t pass. But that shouldn’t matter.
I don't really click on those posts tbh. It's something I passively notice but scroll past because it doesn't bring anything fresh or useful to the conversation. 

But feel good selfies are still fun occasionally

EDIT: selfies but not tagged with ""do I pass""
A decent amount are and tbh it makes alot of us feel doubtful and in a way weaponize dysphoria

As you said a lot of these images are just cis women that absolutely evil people plant here to fuck with us who are here to find realistic expectations and experiences 

Ruins the whole vibe of the subreddit because some people are just truly evil
Not going to comment on the TERF catfishing which is obviously sick.


I am intersex and pass extremely well (which is great post transition but being intersex comes with a whole load of its own trauma and confusion). I can go to the beach on a busy day and maybe 35% of the (probably) cisgender men around me ""pass worse"" (IE look more like they are AFAB) than me.


The reason this is relevant is because other trans men often immediately compare themselves to me when I tell them I am trans. My housemate brought a early transition guy home who literally said ""transition goals"" when he found out. It is very unhealthy. I still have crippling discomfort around the way my genitals look and even around anatomy that is actually pretty normal like slightly wider than average hips.


Lots of cis people have similar problems. 1 in 167 cis men had a penis that is too small for penetrative sex. The majority of men are concerned about their penis size regardless of if their concerns are grounded. Obviously it tends to be more multifaceted for trans folk but even men who are marginally shorter than average are often bothered by it. Our suffering is real and can be very intense, but it is far from unique by nature.


The point is, that everyone is so eager to match unrealistic expectations that they have stolen from others with different life circumstances that they don't see how far they have come personally and celebrate the progress they have made, and will continue to make as they come closer every day to the best version of their own self.
I've always wondered if this could be happening, but didn't know how to find out. Thanks.
It’s also annoying seeing a lot of those same posts over and over passing shouldn’t matter and there are other places you can share pics of yourself.
This has been bothering me for a while.

This group should prohibit any posts that explicitly ask the community to identify or affirm gender based on a photo. Make it a Rule. Even if some of the posters are genuinely trans people, this can't be a healthy way to redefine their identity or overcome dysphoria. It also puts an undue emphasis on societal standards of appearance as a requirement of gender, which can be traumatizing to those who are struggling with the expectations of society as to what male and female should look like.

Full disclosure, while I'm a member of the LGBT community I'm not personally trans, but I am married to a trans/NB person for 10+ years.
Sometimes I want to post a pass thing but I know I don't and I don't want to be lied to but I also don't want to hear that I don't so it's kinda a lose lose
I agree. Im sure there's some real but yes most seem fake. Specially the ones who use faceapp.
I have posted on of those. I did it because I was pre everything, and had no support irl, and I can here for support. It really upsets me if lots of them are fake, because there are so many people out there that need support because they don’t have any of that around them.
Hopefully no one thought mine was fake. I saw a couple of people say that it looked suspicious, especially because I said i was pre everything (and I am). I don't want to be part of the problem and definitely don't want to hurt other people, and considering the fact that I've only been on reddit for like a week it might look even more suspicious. Should I take it down?
Figures… such bull crap too.  Also the faceapp pictures that aren’t labeled… annoy me
Thats horrible :(
This should be pinned!!
Pretty sure some actual cis people do it as well for easy validation. Makes sense cause we boost them up all the time
I'm so glad you posted this. I had a sense that these really attractive passing folks posts would be disheartening to the vast majority of trans folks. The fact that some (most?) of these posts could be planted by trolls hadn't occurred to me.
But why people would do that ? I mean it's awful and bad, actually I've learned to accept my self as I'm, and focuyon my trans identity, even if sometimes it's kinda hard to not be dysphoric
Well I’m one of those accounts with only “do I pass” post but that’s because I made my Reddit account solely for that purpose and just sticked around for longer, and good luck finding any of the pics from my post online, I assure you there’s none because I haven’t even posted them anywhere else, and the thing with terfs is really fucking disgusting, fuck em
This really makes me worried that I can't actually pass. I haven't begun transition and this just makes me feel really dysphoric rn
This makes me feel a lot better, I saw an ‘MTF pre everything’ where they literally had d cups and fem facial structure, perfect makeup etc and was getting upset
Ooof and I thought I was going crazy. Had a few of those and thought "" no fkcing way youre pre everything"" Good to know I ain't paranoid.
I agree that many are fake, but about the new accounts, many people make throwaway accounts to post with their picture so it doesn’t get linked to their main account
Wow that’s super frustrating
I think you’re probably right lol I saw someone who had a before and after like this and they looked nothing like what they did before basically only similarity’s were like the spacing for their face parts but their eyes nose and lips looked different and it was weird... can hrt rlly do that much? But... I am pre everything and do pass on a decent level or at least some level because I’ve been asked at times if I’m a guy or a girl so that’s gotta mean something and also I’ve been called a girl with a mask on so idk what to think of it... maybe they just didn’t have any account before and wanted to know if they pass... I mean I get it because u rlly cant tell if people are just being nice or if I rlly do pass... it’s so weird how dysphoria can clog your brain like that lol but some of them are definitely fake you’re right.
I've been using username as a basis to speculate whether it's a fake account ot not. 

Number? Sus.

Repeated letters that look like an increment for multiple accounts? Instant sus.
Oh. ರ╭╮ರ That's so gross...
i dont post passing related things on here all that often but when i do its definitely real. i just got bras for the first time today and im super happy. my best friend said she could def see the difference even tho i couldnt ee too much of one.
Thank you so much for saying something OP!! Those posts have been driving me up the f’ing wall!
aiming to pass is stupid anyways aim to feel comfortable in your skin, xx
Kinda quick to assume every account that posts thier first pic and actually does pass without or early hrt is fake and a troll? At what point do people start harassing people because they think theyre a troll with no 100% proof. Dont get me wrong there  probably are some accounts like this but theres a difference when its just a recognisable stolen photo and likley genuine picture but how do you know they arent just begining their transition and expressing their true selves online and then into their real lives. Some photos use filters and faceapp too becauss it may help thier confidence in passing and are simoly looking to get affirmation on that. Just saying maybe not ""ALL"" are hateful trolls or anything just because they dont post often. There are other possibilities
I think this sub should implement something like ""have x amount of karma"" and/or ""be x days old""  
that seems to have curbed out most of the trolls in r/furry_irl(? also of note. not SFW)
Maybe we could require verification for posts - holding up a sign with the date and subreddit name? Like they do for AMAs or r/roastme.
What the actual fuck
‘Passing’ is a problematic concept in and of itself. I dislike it’s common usage within this community. It’s a bit gatekeep-y to be honest, and promotes fitting within the arbitrary cisnormative paradigm. 

You are who you identify as whether you ‘pass’ or not.

Despite that, I sadly admit that it is a personal goal of mine in my transition to ‘pass’ myself, but this is merely for safety reasons.

I make it a personal principle to never ask for or expect validation from the larger outside world. It’s a fool’s errand.
Being a new account could mean the user doesn't want to share they're trans on their main account.

If you're noticing this I'd report it to the mods instead of complaining about it.
That’s such a bummer! I guess one thing we can do is try to look at profiles who posted this, to see if there’s an actual post history? I dunno. That’s despicable. Thanks for informing us.
Yeah a lot Probably are which is why I usally check their post history before commenting
Huh. Was wondering about this. Good PSA
Is it unusual to not give a shit about passing?
Thanks for your post. I've wondered some times and I've gone back to look at history. So it's a coordinated effort...these people have too much time and too much effort.  If anything it makes me stronger.
I had been wondering. I assumed there was something weird about these posts, but I didn’t quite know what the angle was. Been trying to approach any new account with caution 😕
Weird. If that's the case those types of posts have always had the opposite effect on me. Like I end up going ""Wow! Look what's possible!"" 😄
Just wanted to pop in and say thanks for bringing this to attention. I wasn’t aware of the issue and it’s so thoughtful and wonderful of you to take the time to write this up.
That's a damn shame. People really suck
Mods, in the interim, ban ""Do I pass"" altogether. Implement the karma to image rule.

Wait..... A month. Then allow Do I Pass again, subject to updated rules.
Tbh the whole ""weaponising dysphoria"" isnt really working, im mostly just unsure of the gender bc they didn't provide it so I don't respond bc im scared of misgendering someone by being ND.
Seeing the comments here about it being TERFs doing it, it makes sense now. I just really don't like ""do I pass"" posts in general, whether they're legit or not. I understand it might be helpful for some, but really it should be about asking for advice and not just ""do I pass"". I'm probably gunna leave all trans subreddits except ftm anyway because the Internet is getting me dowwwwwn as of late.
Jokes on them, most of those posts just tell me we're as normal as The Cis and if they do fool me, they make me happy to see trans people win. But if it helps, you can tell it's the case when they don't reply to comments at all. I look to r/transtimelines for reference a lot more.
I wonder if an additional aim, as well as to increase dysphoria in non-passing trans people, could be to cause paranoia and division, in that it will make us suspicious of any trans people who ARE lucky enough to pass well enough to ""look cis"", and also make a new account for the simple reason of not wanting their face tied to their main account. So, like, trying to trick us into turning on each other. Just something I was thinking.
i mean i’ve seen a lot of posts but i didn’t really think they were reverse image searched
So they took our trust and us being friendly and us being supportive and uplifting and all that good shit and used it against us that's pretty fucked up imagine who they hurt or the really nice people coming here because they need someone to talk to just to see the do I pass post at least the ones that are fake maybe one way to stop it could be that for all DO I PASS post some type of proof somehow could be needed it might not stop it completely but it would definitely lessen them use Google images to see what comes up things like that might work I really hate that they would come on here just to do that I hope we can find away to stop them and honestly who in their free time dose things like that I'm definitely gonna think of some solutions to the problem
That's heartbreaking... I thought I was encouraging and helping young trans people when really there's someone with ill intent behind it. I'm going through a challenging time right now and this makes me lose so much hope
Holy shit, thank you for bringing that to public notice!!
I don't tend to interact with selfie posts, mostly because I tend not to have any reaction to the appearance of anybody regardless of what they look like. But this makes a good point and will make me even more wary to do so
Apparently farming karma with dummy accounts and then selling them is a thing, too. 🤷‍♀️ Capitalism is fucking dumb idk.
Sometimes people don’t pass (to me), and I feel bad saying it, so I don’t. However, would constructive honesty be appreciated? Are people actually asking or just looking for validation?
Tbh, I fully agree with you. Its kind of hard seeing those pic, especially when the post say pre-hrt. I feel that my body is wrong and that I will never achieve such progress, even with hormone. 

Anyway, a nice day to you !
It’s ok to post something silly for a bit of validation euphoria. We all need that boost from time to time.
Ya i noticed a lot of these “do i pass (pre hormones)” looked like they have been on hormones for a WHILE. It started making me worried that i’d lost time since I’ve recently realised I’m trans
I've been wondering about this for a while now. Some people take have nothing better to do with their lives.
Honestly, I think those posts in general do more harm then good if anything. The idea of passing is kind of loaded* and from my experience, not at all what I was expecting before I came out, especially based on the online culture about it. 

*It is important to many people and you’re no less valid for being concerned with it. Some people are concerned for their safety, especially in more conservative areas. Everyone has a million reasons for the things they do, and I only intend to speak from my own experiences. 

Personally, I love being visible, and I feel more proud the more comfortable I get with being me! I’m a 6’6” NB trans woman, and before (and well into) transiting strangers would asked me if I played football because of my size and broad shoulders. And yet, after only a year of transitioning I get gendered correctly by many strangers. But not everyone, and that’s okay too. I like seeing other queer people, and I hope that if anyone who ever felt like I used to sees me, the know that they can become their authentic selves and THRIVE. 

You are valid. Period. Your feelings about your gender and however you express it, are valid. You do not need anyone else’s approval. Everyone has different experiences and backgrounds, and I guarantee there are people who will have different opinion on every “pass or not” post because it truly is a subjective opinion. As many people have pointed out when TERFs dog pile on their own unknowingly, even those who claim they “can always tell” don’t know shit.
WTF.. I don't understand why people can be so hateful.

I'm a cis female & I joined this sub bc I wanted to learn more about transgender individuals. (I just wanted to add this bc if I say anything offensive, I am not doing it maliciously but only out of ignorance and PLEASE correct me if I do say anything that's offensive. )

I do not even try to pretend to understand what it's like to feel trapped in the wrong body. I mean, I'm overweight & want a trim body but that's not the same AT ALL.  I can imagine what it feels like to be trapped in a *situation* where there does not seem to be any hope except for making risky, truly life altering decisions. And with that I can fractionally empathize and wholly sympathize with y'all when people degrade you based on your *situation*.

I dunno where I was going with this.. but I just want y'all to know I love you guys and you keep doing you. Keep your head up and know that you've got a friend in me.
I see some that are so obviously crossdressers that are making fun of us
Thank you so much for posting this. These posts have really been getting to me lately for the exact reasons you mentioned.
Am I the only one who feels fantastic when they see a trans person passing well? Honestly that gives me hope. It makes me feel like maybe hormones will work as they should but it’s just a matter of time, or maybe there’s something I can do better with my style etc. And if anything, at the very least I’m always happy to see a member of my community successful...
Yeah, it's fucking pathetic.
I’ve seen a post of someone claiming to be pre-everything mtf, yet having visible cleavage. I was a little suspicious about that…
Yeah. It hurts. A lot. 

It needs to stop, however, it is very difficult to moderate something like that....
That would only work if I wasn’t smoking hot.
I know, and it sucks, especially to people who are questioning and early to their transition!
Why the hell would people even do this?
To be honest I genuinely think that some people are actually concerned about whether they pass, and I think one of the reason they post their faces on a new account is because they would not like to be doxxed with their actual accounts.
Did we just get psyop’d? Feels lame tho.
I don't think they come from TERFs and I don't see the logic there at all from what I know about TERFs. 

I have noticed fake trans accounts on reddit for years now, and on Quora.  I have gotten messages from some of them where they tried to start a conversation and so I think they try to talk to people and then spam them or rip them off (looking for friends or relationships or something-only to rip them off later, by scamming them or getting them to look at a website)... sometimes it would be like 'I work for this really awesome company', or 'I am on this dating site, check it out!' And I think other times they are trying to appeal to people's sentiments, 'I need money, please donate to me with gift cards,' etc... scammers use whatever they can to appeal to people and good looking people get people's attention online very well in general, so it's just a way to get attention.
Can we have a rule added banning this activity or maybe require 100 karma to post photos? 

I've reported 4 or 5 of these posts and I'm reporting them as trans disrespect.
Thank you for letting us know, this subreddit is very important to a lot of people and what yall are doing is not overlooked, especially after bringing it to light here.
Maybe you should pin this post?
is there a way to set up a bot to automatically do a reverse image search on a post, and remove the post if it gets any matches? And have an accompanying rule that any ""do i pass"" posts must be flared as such (so the bot knows which pics to search) and must only contain original photos not posted to anywhere else on the internet?
Thank you for the work you do to make sure this is a good place to be. 💖 It doesn't go unnoticed.
I totally agree it's important people be allowed to post without much gatekeeping. Maybe you could enforce karma and/or account age requirements for ""do I pass type"" posts only? I know some people may want to make alts to post selfies for good reason, but maybe it'd be still be worth it to cut back on this type of behavior. Alternatively, you could require something like having your username in the pic to verify, to make it harder to farm other people's pics. Maybe even both, one or the other? Like either meet the account requirements or have verification in your pic
i have an idea, make image posts limited by karma
What if you made it a requirement to prove your identity in the ""do i pass"" posts? Like, not necessarily showing your drivers license to the mods, but at *least* providing a video wherein the user speaks the date and their username, or something similar. Like just, ""Hi, its October 29th, 2021 and I'm VulpineSpecter4."" Then the user gets ""verified"" and their post goes up. No RIS required.
Thank you for your work. :)
Maybe there should be a new rule, where users are only allowed to post their faces if they provide verification by holding a piece of paper with their reddit usernames. Similar to what other subreddits often do.
What’s the likelihood of the sub banning “do I pass” posts altogether? I really really hate them at the best of times and if we are getting slammed with fake posts then can the mods maybe make a poll to see how people feel about that just being a banned subject? I personally find the whole concept ridiculous & ive been banned from other subs because I’ve been honest & said that the person didn’t pass. I’ve also seen plenty of trans pages go from great diverse interesting places to nothing more than a place where people ask that question & it’s sad. It’s also hard for the subs to come back from when they go that route because those of us that want a little more depth end up leaving before the mods realise there is a problem. 

I’m a trans dude so I understand that ‘passing’ is a lot easier for me, but being trans isn’t just about passing and people shouldn’t have to pass to feel like valid women/men.   
     It’s also pretty toxic with people just seeking asspats and the answer to the question *never* being honest. If you wanted to know the genuine answer then it’s a bad way to go about because people don’t want to hurt their feelings so they often lie or they just don’t say anything if they don’t think you pass. Besides, anyone that says no is lynched in the comments so there is nothing to gain from asking it.
> We try to remove these when it's obvious, or when another user is able to provide some kind of evidence

How about making it part of your duties to reverse image search on 'selfie' posts before approval? It shouldn't take a user doing it to prove it to you when you can right-click and reverse image search in most browsers.
Thank you for doing what you do <3
That makes a lot of sense and is so fucking terrible.
can you imagine this being what you do with your spare time?  Like this is the best way you can think to entertain yourself, damaging people.
That’s really shitty. There are a lot of posts where I’m like “is this the trans subreddit? Did a cis person post a pic here?” But to be fair, lots of trans people genuinely pass that well.

Backfires on the TERFs in my case because I find those posts encouraging and uplifting. Now that I know many are fakes I’m going to be skeptical though :(
im absolutely positive this has been happening, i try to call it if it's obvious because it's just plainly evil
That’s so shitty who’s got the time for that 😞😞😞
Literally what the fuck
Know thy enemy
Wut theee efff. Terfs are lower than low.
This

Got a DM from someone saying that there are threads on 4chan and websites alike that purposefully do this for the exact reason you said.
That's so fucked up
God I may be opening myself up to some awfulness but I am curious about seeing some of these threads. I wanna know what to look out for, what to recongnise as an attack. I want to see what these people say. I’m so blessed to live and work in a community of artists and other queer folk in a country that has relatively okay opinion of trans folx. Where should I look to see the vile shit?
lol imagine this was how you spent your free time.. these worms need a life
The old Stormfront way of ""raiding"" reddit.


It never changes
I’ve seen ppl be honest saying no to ppl but it’s kinda rare
Pictures are the worst reference imo. Very very few people look decent in pics anyway. The best way to guage passing is by how the world interacts with you. Im pretty sure I pass because my new coworkers treat me WAYYY differently than any I had worked with pre transition. Just my 2 cents, pictures suck
That’s why I’m not a kind person for no reason it makes it hard to trust you when people think your a angel
Yeah, hard same. So many “MtF pre everything” (note that they’re basically never FtM posts meeting the same criteria) posts that’re basically a flawless femme appearance and it’s like “congratulations, you look amazing, I hate you and myself”.
Yes! Completely agreed.
I understand and feel similar. My problem has been mostly the post been the same nonsense and using faceapp with high expectations of looks. Then on top some of the stereotypes in our communities.
I fucking hated my facial hair even before my egg cracked because it always ended up in the form of some hideous pedostache. It's even worse since I realised I was trans. Shaving always makes me super dysphoric but so for obvious reasons does not shaving. Facial hair is hands down the hardest part of being trans.
Youre right, it doesn't matter. That's exactly the problem. These posts plant false expectations to how trans people need to look and it can bring down a lot of people that have a hard time passing
It absolutely doesn't matter. If you identify as a woman you're a woman.
Same. Quick glance, then move swiftly on to the meatier topics like self-esteem queries or where to get informed consent meds
I haven't seen your photo, but I don't think you should feel guilty for being good looking. If other people who are less fortunate in the looks department are hurt by it then that is something that they need to learn to deal with, it isn't your responsibility.

Pretty trans girls sometimes make me feel really jealous and depressed, but I try to remind myself that I have a lot to be grateful for and that it's healthier for me to try to be happy for other people rather than jealous of them.
The goal is to hurt. The goal is to demoralize. The goal is to take away our will to live. It won't work. We Gladly Feast on Those Who Would Subdue Us.
Thats like asking why do people commit crimes hun.

People do terrible things out of hatred, the best we can do is find good ways to defend against it.
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll be able to pass adequately anyway. Even if looking THAT GOOD is unlikely, the fact of the matter is that most normal people aren't constantly on the lookout trying to figure out who's trans and who's cis so as long as you look and sound reasonably like your true gender very few people will notice. In fact, I'd say trans people would be more likely to notice than cis people would.
Did you even read the post
Yea, not gonna say OP is wrong, but I'd have contacted the mods with some screenshots to use as receipts. This is one of the few subs that a new account doesn't immediately raise a red flag for me.
Nope, not at all.

Just depends on how you feel and how safe the area you live in is.
I like the karma idea; I'll pass it on to the other mods.

Catfishers are gonna catfish, so a rule banning this likely won't phase them;)
> require 100 karma to post photos

Karma requirements are good for stopping things like trolls and spammers, but they're also bad when it comes to providing welcoming and supportive space for nervous and anxious trans folks on throwaway accounts.

Generally speaking, we try to err on the side of caution, but we also try to keep our communities open to all trans folks who need them, regardless of who they are or where they are on their transition journey.
Not sure, but I just added a ""Do I pass?"" post flair.

Personally, I'm hit or (mostly) miss with the reverse image searches. Not sure if it's the trolls modifying the images 'just enough', the services sucking, or my Google-fu being subpar, but I rarely find anything when using them.
I'm 99% sure that AutoMod can't support that and I'm also fairly certain that custom bots can't perform moderation actions
It *seems* like some combo of karma + account age might be a good place to start for this. I already use that when I'm on the fence about approving/removing a post, but we don't have a hard and fast rule.
Thanks; I'll pass that on to the other mods.
I believe that's something like what other subs do to verify users.
I hear and feel your concerns. There *is* already SFW content that we prohibit in an effort to keep the sub lively: videos, advertisements (OF, IG, crowdfunding, etc) and research study announcements. I think if we allowed those, they would quickly inundate the sub.

We seem to get waves of fad posts, with *What name do I look like?* being a recent one. By themselves, they can be innocent/cute/fun for the user and affirming for the OP, but when there are 30/day it becomes overwhelming and makes the sub less interesting. There *are* subs dedicated to more niche Trans topics, like r/MTFSelfieTrain, r/FTM_SELFIES, r/lgbtstudies, r/transnames, but the complaint we've heard is that those sites are too small to generate a lot of responses. And you're somewhat right about honest constructive criticism getting downvoted in favor of hugboxing.
I'm not going to mention the RISes that I use, but they often come up empty when searching on these posts.

As far as our ""duties"" go...

I can't/won't speak for the other mods, but I do RIS if time allows, but that's not always possible. Tonight it took me about 90 minutes to clear more than 200 items from the Mod Queue and respond to a bunch of ModMail messages/reports. It *seems* like it'd be easy/quick, but the Pareto Principle kicks in to overdrive; 20% of the comments take up 800% of the time.

* Looking at user's post history, account age, and karma
* Trying to tease out meaning/context or poorly-executed sarcasm; this can be complicated by submission from users whose first language isn't English
* Documenting user bans. This is ~~necessary~~ helpful when they appeal their bans.
* Dave Chappelle. We've seen increases in traffic, legit and trolling, since the Netflix special debuted.
People that go out of their way to do this are usually sad excuses for humans, have themselves been traumatized, are being pressured, are actually in denial, or some combination therein
Yeah im concerned cuz I have 2 post that I constantly go back to cuz their before HRT body frame looks like mine (it's a wide masculine frame) so wen my dysphoria hits I like to look at those. But idk if there fake or not and idk how to find out.
Yes, lots of trans people DO genuinely pass that well, but very few pre-everything trans people do, if we're being honest. Not saying that they're any less valid for it, of course, but that's just unfortunately the case.
People who have no fulfilment in their own lives, who also know that we are actively searching for our own fulfilment. It makes them jealous that they don’t have the emotional maturity to seek their own fulfilment, regardless of what that may be.
Miserable people like to shit all over other people. That’s pretty much it.
I've caught a thread on here before. It had an absurd title like ""Been on HTR 5 months, how am I doing?"".  So I reverse searched the image and it turned out to be some random CIS woman who doesn't deserve to have her picture used that way.

Then I did what I should have done to begin with: looked through the OP's history. Their next post was to some edgy shithole sub, bragging about ""trolling /r/trans"" with 4chan's new tactic. Total fucking loser, that one, and I'm sure there's more where they came from. So, I'm glad you made this post. There's already /r/transpassing, which more users should be made aware of.
Hey, look...I can't tell you what to do, but as someone with a very bad habit of looking through those boards, I'm going to strongly caution you against this. It's not heathy, and I usually find myself doing it when I'm in a depression (depressed brains find ways to keep themselves depressed). I firmly believe that good self-care is not allowing myself to do it, and I definitely can't participate in helping someone else engage in an activity that could be harmful to them.
i mean id rather have honesty than fake praise
I have to agree. I look way better in 3D.
100% I just want to be rid of it. The more I look into LHR I keep seeing conflicting reviews saying that it permanent and not permanent, same with electrolysis.

I'm at the point of get Laser hair removal until my hair is so thin that I can then just safely epilate everything
Thank you for giving voice to something I've been thinking about since I came to this sub.
not only that but as you mentioned they get upvoted then we see 5-10 similar posts back to back. Rules should be stricker of tyoe of account that can post. A lot of places have that rule.
Honestly I wonder about the ""do I pass"" posts even when from a legitimate source.  I feel like the hyper awareness of the ways I do not biologically fit my desired self image feels like a anorexic assessing their body fat. My jealousy toward a different body standard can't really be addressed given my other circumstances without giving up some things in my life I truely value so I have learned to live with it... And I feel in some ways it's a little healthier that way.  

Recognizing that it's just another beauty standard was a healthy move for me in the long run. Those who can pass basically just have the privilege of a different physical beauty but if you don't have that, that is okay. In fact it shouldn't be as big a deal. Seeing those posts always makes me feel a little bit the way I would if soneone asks ""do I look fat?"". Yes we could trade tips for compression underwear or whatever to achieve the desired effect but the kinder answer might just be ""It doesn't matter. You are lovable. You are you. ""
Thank you, I'm feeling lost rn, this has helped me a lot!
Yes I did.

Like I says if people are actually stealing cis womens photo you should contact the mods.
Thanks
At least it’ll waste their time. Deterrents are better than nothing. 

You want to steal from my car, that’s cool. Just watch out for the rabid badger.
""To post photos""

You can communicate via text posts and offer support and foster a welcoming environment without the need for posting photos.

Yeah, it's a bummer, but as always, a few have screwed it up for the many.

Also, we don't know the ends these people have in mind.  There have been multiple individuals popular on 4chan that have been implicated in mass shootings and singular homicides that have resorted to similar tactics.

All we need is for someone to organize a Reddit trans meetup in a large city and kill everyone who shows up.
Custom bots can perform moderation actions if we add them as mods. However there aren't any bots that are good enough to find the pictures that trolls would use, as they typically steal them from places that aren't cached by Google or other websites that I use to try and find them.
reverse image search! People looking to be harmful gotta have mad balls to post an original picture of their own face
Easiest way is a reverse image search.

A lot of low-effort catfishes are just pulled off the internet and will instantly pop up in a reverse image search. Doesn’t catch em all, but since a decent chunk of it are low-effort posts it’ll catch a lot of em.
It still give you motivation to work on yourself. Maybe you won't look exactly like the pictures but HRT isn't going to do your makeup, take care of your skin or pick your wardrobe out for you. These are things all women work at. No HRT for me but my mind feels like its in full transition on its own. This is really perplexing but I like it.
You are probably right. Its probably for the best that I don’t. I’m lucky I think. I’m transitioning at a time in my life when I have a very strong sense of my identity. I’m surrounded by a very kind and supportive community so I honestly don’t get exposed to any of the vile stuff. Worst thing that happens to me is my mother says dumb things sometimes. I’m so blessed to be spared it. I suppose my curiosity is coming from a place of wanting to be better equipped to support people who do experience the bad stuff? I want to be a better ally to my trans brothers and sisters cause I feel like I have it easy. And if I can better educate myself (without having to get a fellow trans person to do the emotional labour of recounting their awful experiences) than I think I should. 

I totally get your advice and it is damn good advice and I am very grateful for you giving it. Stay strong. X

Please don’t epilate ever!

Instead, do LHR until the hair is thin, then do electrolysis. Epilation is basically “fast tweezing”, and not only can it scar your face badly it also often prevents you from *ever* getting electrolysis. 

Our facial hair is sadly not like cis womens, it is deep rooted and coarse. This means it’s never safe to pluck or tweeze- you’ll always have a risk of scarring. And if you do despite that, it’ll over time cause the socket that your hair grows out of to shift or twist, which prevents electrolysis from working. 

LHR isn’t permanent in the sense that over our lives, “peach fuzz” or small clear hairs can be promoted to thick dark hairs. So you’ll see some “coming back” but it’s really just the newest recruits. LHR does kill permanently the hairs that it zaps, which are the thick dark hairs. Electrolysis is more “permanent” feeling because the tech basically kills your small clear hairs too, which laser can’t do.
Thank you so much. I thought I passed when I posted here asking if I did, but when I was told that I didn't pass I felt like a 'lame' trans guy for not doing anything in my power to look the way I want, and it truly fucked up my mental health. I should have been more careful with wording. Looking at posts of other people who pass perfectly was painful after.
I did.

Did they do anything about it?

Nope.
We already had a bunch of organized transphobes on reddit, trying to encourage trans folks to commit suicide, but they're mostly gone now. That was not a pleasant year, not by a long chalk.
How do you do a reverse image search? I've never known how to do that.
Yeah I understand but I wasnt worried about makeup clothes. The styles they had don't match match mine. I'm always concerned about my body shape. I have a very wide masculine frame with broad shoulders and and ribs. The posts I saved show them before and after hrt (a few years after starting mind) but it's the before picture that show then having a very similar build to me. If there after pictures are fake I'm kinda nervous what will happen with me, have I been buildingsomething off of false expectations?' These thoughts get to me a bit.. As to everything else you said I fully agree. I'm in control of what I wear and how not hrt. I'm still gonna go through with everything tho, there no sense it not
:/ well fuck I guess tweezing off all my facial hair yesterday wasn't a great idea then
I'm fine with clear peach fuzz. If I can't see it and I feel smooth, I'm 100% fine with that. If it's peach fuzz but I can still see, I may end up doing electrolysis
I know there’s specific search engines somewhere but one of them is just searching “google image search” or i think clicking the camera in the google searchbar? and then you can copy/paste a photo in.
If you’ve only done it once or twice it shouldn’t be the end of the world!
Yeah, especially if you’re on hormones LHR should be more or less permanent. I think the “it’s not permanent” mainly applies to the rest of the body; running an estrogen dominated endocrine system I think makes it way less likely that your facial hairs get promoted. 

For me I had 6 sessions done and it killed almost all my dark hairs; I’m now getting electro done because I want to remove the remaining clear ones too (I can feel them but not see them). But none of the dark ones have come back after over a year.
Tineye.com is the original that google copied.

Yesterday, i cried	" I had my FFS done last week. Yesterday my surgeon took of my bandages and i don't think i've ever cried so much before in my entire life.

Even though i still looked like I got run over by a truck, beneath the blood and the bruises for the first time in my life i saw myself in the mirror. No dysphoria, no judging myself, just pure Happiness. I never thought that I would get this far, and now that it finally happened i can't even begin to describe this feeling. 

Just wanted to share, and i wish everyone the best of luck with their transition. We can all get through this, life can be so great <3"	"[deleted]
whats ffs?
This is wholesome and inspiring. I'm so looking forward to my FFS for all these reasons. I know I am there beneath the mask ♡
I can't wait to get mine! I've only just begun this whole journey, but everything I see on this subreddict makes me excited for the end of it!
I'm so happy for you, that sounds amazing and I hope we all get to have days like this <3
I’m so happy for you. I can’t wait to start hormones and get top surgery too.
I wish you a speedy recovery!
So vicariously happy for you
I'm so glad I don't need major surgeries like this, because I'm afraid of surgery. I'm so lucky that I look just like my mom
That’s awesome! Congrats :)
I kinda wanna see your beauty now🥺👉👈
That’s so wonderful to hear! I can’t wait to get ffs some day. Right now I think it’s financially out of reach unfortunately.
Congrats!!!
mazel tov!! that is so wonderful!
If you google what FFS stands for it says “For Fuck’s sake”
Im so happy for you! 

My hair is starting to get long and although I have masculine hairline and I’m very afraid of loosing it I had a very feminine hairstyle and when I tried new feminine/androgynous clothes I no get I got tears too.. I was just crying l - out of happiness.. Irish you the absolute best, I bet you look incredible!
I just got FFS a month ago! Same feeling! I didn't cry myself, but emotionally I've been so high, everything looks so different, my face looks so much brighter and happier, I love it! I love it so so so much. I feel so much more put together
That’s amazing I’m so happy for you!
I am MtF but have look quite feminine as I am, would I still be able to get this surgery?
If you don’t mind, how much did it cost? Mind sharing the doctors name?
How long into HRT were you before you got your ffs surgery?
What's fss?
Lots of love to you 💞
In fact, now I’m crying.
Congratulations welcome to the first day of the rest of your life
I’m so happy for you!!!! I thought this would be a different story because I almost cried the other day when I looked in the mirror. Im pre hrt and have been transitioning on other areas and  I usually avoid mirrors and when I looked I felt horror so I’m soo proud of you
😎
I want to transition to a girl but nervous my family will not approve. I’m turning 21..I don’t want to wait any longer but I also don’t want to lose my family over it
I had mine three weeks ago Monday, and all the bruising is gone. I think all the swelling and the horrible pain for the first week was preventing me from appreciating what I’ve gained, but I looked at myself in the mirror today and smiled at my reflection for the first time in my life.  No tears of joy... just intense satisfaction for the results of all of the money, time, and pain.

Oh, one other tip I didn’t see - to get the bacitracin out of your hair wash it with conditioner. Only needs two rinses to get it all. Further, you are going to have a dismaying amount of hair loss... I struggle to cover the incision... so start using Nutrafol and minoxidil as soon as feasible. Also the horrible headaches mostly went away when the sutures and staples are removed.  Also get a good sunblock and wear it religiously.

Good luck girl... your life is really about to begin!
When you feel comfortable, (and if  you're comfortable sharing pre transition pics, totally valid if you aren't) I'd love to see the results!
That's amazing for you!!! I hope you have a speedy recovery and we get to see your smiling face soon!!
i could not be happier for u!
I have my consultation in August I'm so excited :) I've been waiting so long and it's finally in motion!!!
So absolutely feeling for you right now.  Love to hug you and give all the comfort and love you deserve.  Like a miraculous cure for testosterone poisoning.  I am so looking forward to my FFS because of testimony like yours.

Lots and lots of love to you 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Remember not to take grapefruit with antidepressants though. A lot of us are on them and you would be suprised how often they forget to tell you stuff and instead leave it in a dense jargon filled document
Thanks so much for the tips! So far I am healing very well, even the doc is surprised. Like you said only major swelling left is my nose and i still have some bruises under the eyes and on my cheeks but no pain at all, i've gone off the pain meds today and I am still feeling very good ! :))
Also- for swollen nose, running it under cold water / applying ice will allow you to breath. Witch hazel will reduce the bruising faster.
Facial feminization surgery, its multiple procedures in one 😊
For Fucks Sake.

Jk it's Facial Feminization Surgery
Thanks so much! I hope you can sit still, waiting for these things can be so tedious but it's definitly worth the wait :)) Good luck to you
Im glad to hear that! Surgery really should be a last resort, transitioning is challenging enough already 😄
haha, i was thinking about making a post in trans timelines but i still have some popped bloodvessels in my eyes making me look like a ghoul :D if youre still curious just dm me
Thank you! I really feel that, without the help of my family i couldve never afforded it at this point in my life. Being comfortable in your own body shouldn't have a price in the first place but i guess here were are. I sincerely wish that you can get it some day, you deserve it!
Very relatable, growing out my hair was the first thing i did and the euphoria that gave me fueled me for a long time! Thank you so much and best of luck to you aswell :)
Ohh thats so great, thats exactly how im feeling! Its just so motivating, makes you wanna go out into the world :))
Sure! You can always get it since it is a cosmetic surgery, but that means insurance often won't cover it
if thats something you want, absolutely. consultations between doctors will give you a sense of what you may need, but its all up to you :)
Sure can do since he did a really great job and would want some advertising! My operation was with Dr. Funk in Munich, Germany. The cost was around 28.000€ for a 7 hour opeartion including procedures on my chin, jaw, nose, brow, cheeks, forehead and scalp.
1 1/2 years on hormones at the point of the surgery 😊
Facial feminization surgery :)
I hope i didnt make you sad! :(
Beautiful way to put it! Thank you ❤️
Yeah, I also can't count how many times i've cried before when i looked in the mirror, but this was the first time it was from happines and not sadness or disgust. The pre hrt times are the toughest ones, but if you are making progress already thats great! I hope one day I'll see your post when you can look in the mirror without fear, you can do it! :)
That's completly understandable. I was insanly lucky to have a family that not only accepts me but supports me every step of the way. I wish you the best of luck and that you find a way to become yourself while keeping your relationship with your family intact!
Woah thanks for this lol I never knew that! But now I want grapefruits
Not only antidepressants is worth further pointing out. I would consult about each medication, and if you have been eating grapefruit regularly, keep in mind that you may need a dose adjustment if you stop. I am not a doctor.
[deleted]
ahh
i want this now
I can’t wait to get for fuck’s sake one day
I can barely wait. I have been for about a month now and hope i’ll get the appointment soon ;-;
But thank you so so much!
I'd really like to see. I'm looking into surgeons now myself
Thank you! 😊
Thank you so much!
Okay. Does this apply to the UK or are we taking about another countries health care?
Thank you! I’m very happy for you! Congratulations 🎉
When you were doing your consultation did they say anything about how long you should be on hrt before getting ffs?

When did you stop seeing changes in your face from hrt?

I'm only 3 months in and definitely feeling inpatient. Thanks for the replies - I'm hoping I feel the same way when it's my turn.
Nonono it’s okay I’m so so happy for you!!!<3
Thanks babe!!! Keep me posted I’ll send you a dm
Thank you sweetie! Hopefully with time they’ll be more accepting of this and I can finally come out and live my life as the girl I’ve known I am since very early on.
If you don’t mind me asking...How did you come out to your family?
And don’t eat grapefruit if you take Lipitor
You are way too kind <3 <3 I am already feeling so great, I cannot wait for it to heal fully! It scares me that this went over so easy, i thought it would toughen me up for SRS but this was so uneventful i dont think it really prepared me 😄 and great now i know how the stuff is called that was in my hair, also took me ages to get out, i cant really feel my head rn so that made it even more difficult

I am really overwhelmed by all this positive resonance, ive never shared anything about my transition before, and now all this positive reinforcement really makes me tear up. Thank you for your support, hopefully I can do the same when someone else here needs it 💖
It removes what male puberty did to the facial bones
Me too. For fucks sake I m looking forward to for fucks sake
All over the world! It costs more or less, depending on country, but most consultations are free unless you work with the best of the best in business. You will need to do a lot of research (there's a lot of doctors who botch surgeries, so be wary!). Most cost on average of 20,000-40,000 dollars for the surgery and recovery time.

&#x200B;

My wife and I are in the USA and hers is 30,000 with Regina Rodman out of Texas. :) Her consultations are free.
We talked about my hormone treatment yes, I dont think the changes in my face have stopped yet but its quite minimal, cheeks still getting more puffy and so on.

The surgeon will take into account where you stand in your transition since he is going of the structure of the bones in the face anyways. The surgery is then constructed in a way where further changes from hrt will only enhance it :) 

Best of luck to you, its a huge decision and I hope it will make you just as happy as me or even more :)
No problem, but it's a really boring story 😄 My sister is also trans, and she outed herself way before me. So when it was my turn to out me i just basically said to my mom when we were waiting in the car: ""mum, uhm it's me aswell."" She had to think about it for a second then she almost fainted but then we laughed and thats it!
I do take SNRI/Stabilizer/Stabilizer daily, propranolol and hydroxyzine as needed. I wonder if it’s bad for propranolol.
Ironically I felt like FFS was harder than SRS after getting both. The bone healing has been a lot more rough for me than the flesh lol
Thanks for sharing! That’s awesome that you have an older sister to help you with this. One of my lady friends from school kinda knows. I haven’t told her specifically but I get the feeling she knows. I will probably open up to her about it first. 
Would be easier if people in general were more understanding. I think transgender individuals are still looked at negatively by many. 

Here is to a better future, where there are more awesome and understanding people just like yourself 😘"	msob50	trans	2021	0.98	2021-04-17 10:26:23
Just had convo with HR. My Manager LIED to me about not being allowed to wear makeup	"When I was hired, after training he told me i can't wear makeup as it's part of the ""dress code""

i agreed as I really needed the job, and suffered a lot of dysphoria from it. A few weeks ago a woman on our team came in wearing full face makeup, so i texted him and said ""I thought we weren't allowed to wear makeup?"" - he didn't even REPLY.

So I called my union, and just had a conversation with HR and my union today. My boss made it up. He lied. There is no policy saying makeup is forbidden, only that makeup needs to be ""conservative""

so wtf. I could've been wearing my makeup THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME??? I see this as pure transphobia. This comes from somebody who couldn't get my pronouns right for over a month when he first hired me. Somebody who has been toxic and wrote me up for refusing to work overtime shifts (which HR also disputed and threw out). 

&#x200B;

I feel happy I can finally wear makeup but I'm just super annoyed this whole time he has been lying to me and disrespecting me. I hope he gets fired. It's to the point where I have had to block my own manager's cell phone because he won't respect my boundaries - he texts me and calls me at early AM hours when I work til midnight and typically don't wake up until mid morning yet he constantly is texting and calling me at 8am multiple times a week."	"Got receipts of your manager denying you? If so, let HR know you’ve got a potential lawsuit.
Don’t block him. 

Get those receipts and take them to HR. If HR doesn’t act, take them to your union. If your union doesn’t act, take them to an employment lawyer.
This should be a easy lawsuit, talk with your union and get a lawyer, I think many lawyers would love a case like this.
It's good that you knew to dish with hr/the union about it. Definitely document everything and keep in mind anything you do could be documented too, so think twice about being sarcastic with you boss. Don't say anything that could get you in trouble especially in writing or email. Cooler heads are the winners if you take this to the union or a court of law.
I hate putting on makeup but I'll admit I'm a lot more confident once I have it on. It's like our armor going into battle. What kind of person would deny us that?
That's textbook discrimination. Document every time he treats you differently from other employees with dates if possible. Save every text.  Do this at any job, even if you don't feel discriminated against. It's important to have a record of mistreatment if you want to build a case for discrimination.
This seems like a pretty clear violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as per the Bostock v. Clayton County SCOTUS case that ruled that discrimination on the basis of gender (including gender identity) falls under its prohibitions of ""sex discrimination"" in employment
Talk to your union to see if they can't take action against the company and/or your manager
And yes absolutely evil and it sucks.

But, girl, you just struck a blow for all the trans folk coming up next.

Be proud of yourself!
Wows… 

Idk what to say,.. 
in spite lol.. wear makeup to the court if/when you get a court date
Sounds about right. I had a boss who referred to me (trans dude) as “it” rather than the he/him I asked for, and my gf at the time (trans woman) as “he” constantly.
Document all of this and everything going forward because that's discrimination.
Sue them into the ground sister, all the love to you!
Put your phone on do not disturb. The phone won’t ring, but you can see the notifications when you wake up.
Number of commenters here confusing ""at will"" with ""right to work"" is...😖

Very different legal doctrines.
Yeah that sounds like harassment and a law suit waiting to happen.
Did he hire you??? I mean, why would they be so toxic AND hire you? You have advocates some place in that company. ""F"" that guy for being such an AH!! Good for you and your union and your HR.
That sucks:(:( what a control freak.... I never get why people even care 🙄.. I'm sure he lives by a long list of arbitrary standards 😆
Lawsuit time!
Glad you called out the hypocrisy! Extra glad you have a union that’s standing up for you. 

I went down a similar road with my very powerful union. It was years of stress and though I did win, the settlement was absolute peanuts compared to the effort I put in, but the union was very proud to have won a grievance and they said it would help protect other members in the future.

Sending you strength!
Since disphoria is a very clear mental health issue I could think of an argument in the direction of ableism. I mean he literally made you suffer more and basically denied you a pretty easy fix, that random other people use too. He caused suffering and he did it intentionally - that's so disgusting.
Mothrr fucker I can believe he did that to you
[removed]
Yes.
Don’t talk to HR, talk to your union rep.
See this is what baffles me.

Hate and bigotry aside, it's just terrible business to be transphobic. Why bother?
Blocking just puts his messages in a special folder and muted alerts.
NOO!!! If you have a Union, NEVER go to HR first!!! NEVER!!
This! Agree, unblock and document the shit out of all of it, download your phone bills to get dates and times and go to your union rep, there has to be something in company policy.  If not just stay calm until he power trips and document it
Never go to HR first.

If you don't live in an ""at will"" state, always go to your union first.

HR's main objective is not to help you to be treated right. Their main objective is to protect the company from lawsuits. If HR determines that it would be easier to fire you for a bogus reason than deal with your complaints, they just might do it.
Personal lawyer (if affordable) then Union then HR

Avoid corruption opportunities as much as possible, HR is just the “manage the serfs” division of any company and unfortunately a lot of modern unions are just an extension of corporate BS (shout out to the IWW keeping it real)
Union FIRST! HR is there to protect Corporate, Unions by law, are there to protect employees!
Chilllllll
Don't talk to HR about a lawsuit until you've met with a lawyer first.
It’s time to call Saul
Where is this folder located?
Yeah, don't block his number, but do put your phone on do not disturb while you're asleep, then you also have evidence of his constant harrassment outside of work and at unacceptable hours.
NO, NO NO!!! UNION first! If they think you need a lawyer, they’ll hire one for you!!
yeah i strogly disagree... corporations wouldnt fight unionization as much as they do if they were just ""extensions of corporate bs"", and they have done wonders for workers rights. Unions being ""corrupt"" is a classic conservative talking point cause of the italian mob in the 80's. If i was in this situation i wouldnt really truly trust any side and id probably get my own lawyer before i went to either side, but id definitely still get the union involved
I am aware HR is there to protect the company - and supervisor is likely breaking company policy and may be breaking local laws. Disciplining him does not necessarily have to do strictly with protecting OP but with protecting the company. 

I had one supervisor try to pull a fast one on me when I was early in transition but in violation of municipal laws, so HR moved fast to cover their ass.
102 
On the periodic table
I'm not talking to HR without my union present
Yeah HR 's ONLY FRIEND is the employer.
Transphobic douchebag boss? BETTER CALL SAUL!
...on my phone...
I’ve just had friends fucked by their union before when bringing up legal concerns so I’m hesitant to trust any hierarchical organization
Depends on the union. Some are shit
A union is still far better than no union, pretty much across the board. But unions today are very different and far less effective than they were in the early 1900s when major concessions were won. Striking made illegal, stuff like that. You do see some modern victories with teachers going on strike in the last like five years or some thing, then the thing with the rail workers in the last year (although it didn’t seem to actually get all the concessions necessary to prevent a bunch of people dying from preventable safety concerns)

I’m strongly in favor of solidarity unionism not hierarchical structures that reproduce the bureaucracy inherent to capitalism and the state. I hope I don’t come off as anti-union here, rather I think the unions that exist need to engage in far more radical & direct action in order to further workers rights and put an end to capitalism. I’ve had too many people completely balk at the idea of unionism because their experience of modern unions was regimented bureaucracy where their union reps wouldn’t even fight against literal criminal acts done by the corporation.

Need better unions not no unions.

https://www.iww.org/preamble/
Good. Consider talking to a lawyer for yourself as well. But the union is much better than nothing.
that is 100% the best practice.

HR isn't there to help you. They'll hang you out to dry if it's easier for them. Their #1 concern is to protect the company from lawsuits.

Always go to your union first (thank the gods you don't live in an ""at will"" state oof).
This is the way
Please do keep us up to date too!! Both individuals and companies NEED to learn this kind of hate just isn't acceptable.  Hope things work out in the best possible way for you <3
Sweet, how do I access it?
Wow, gotta love America... 😒
True. BUT unions are among the most democratic social structures we have! With a union, you can run for office, negotiate rules and contracts for workers, support political candidates. HR is there to protect the CORPORATION, not employees!
YES!!! Talk to your Union FIRST!! NOT an independent lawyer. Your union has access to union attorneys, or will hire one for you! Lawyers are rarely the union’s first response, for good reason! And READ your union’s contract! It will give you lots of information about your specific rights! Good luck!
gettin a little creepy i see
Jeesh guys, is it really not obvious I’m asking about how to access the folder on my phone?
Wtf
Lmao wtf
[deleted]
Op was being a smart ass by telling me it was on their phone; no one would ask about accessing someone else’s phone, I was talking about where is the folder on peoples phones in general…

I mean I’m somewhat autistic, but people here are on another plane of existence altogether—like what kind of people think such gutter thoughts in this type of conversation and think I’m wondering about anything but my own phone? Blows my mind, truly
before i read that you were autistic i was thinking your whole thread is what it feels like to be autistic and have people misunderstand you all the damn time lmao. 

anyway, on my phone the spam folder is inside the text messaging app. i'm sure every phone is different but you go into the menu (usually three horizontal lines) and one of the options is spam and blocked. hope this helped :)

So cute ❤️🥰
I find that dysphoria can come in waves some days I hate everything about my transition and other days I love who I am and what I look like I try to remember there are no solid rules to dysphoria or solid causes
Yep you bloody well should, you ARE A SPANKTASTICLY GORJUS woman, and may I say PHHHWOAR,

I'm constantly fighting the urge to cover myself in so much plant and nature themed jewelry and clothing and to end up looking like some kind of woodland fairy lol

I should just embrace some form of cottagecore tbh
If only... Idk how to explain it but you look way better as me than I do lol

Feeling a lot of dysphoria after dealing with police	"Last night me (24 mtf) and my girlfriend (cis) got into a fight. Nothing physical or anything but due to a neighbor who strongly dislikes me and us yelling in front of him the police were called. The fight didn’t last long at all and we had made up but then the door was knocked on. I’ve never had any sort of trouble and never have even spoken to a police officer but I knew it had to be them. I went outside and spoke to the man. He was decently old and at first decently receptive. My girlfriend then came out and we both assured him we were fine and it was just a short yelling match. The officer then began to look at my girlfriend and ask if she was ok (he had not once asked how I was) and if she was hurt or feeling not safe. I knew then he had made me and realized I was a “guy” thus I had to of been abusing her. He demanded I go get my license and my girlfriend (who was ignorant of this) said she’d go get hers. He said no no he wanted “his” referring to me. I went inside in which the office again asked her if she was ok and safe. I came out gave my license then had to also give my social security number and then be placed away from my girlfriend so they could see if I had any warrants. My girlfriend sweetly told the officers to ask me if I was ok and if I was abused or feeling unsafe in which the cop said he didn’t need to do that. Eventually I was cleared and before they left they asked my girlfriend if she had a ride if she in fact had to leave at any point due to safety and she said she did. They then told her to call them if she needed anything then left. I have no issue in police making sure people are ok and separating us to ask in private if we’re ok is intelligent it just hurt me that apparently I wasn’t worth the same treatment. Sorry for the long text just wanted to vent my frustrations. Thanks for listening 

TL;DR policed were called on my and girlfriend and I and only she was treated with care and respect while I was kept at arms length of all involved"	"Had something very similar happen to my not-directly-neighbour actually with some variation. But instead of just assuring them she was okay, that girl defended the shit out of her girlfriend so loud I actually asked them the next day what was up (so they told me).

She apparently reported the officer for harassing her gf unprompted.
Yes they do that and it is horrible to experience. I’m sorry you went through that.
This is also why most cis men won't report abuse when it is inflicted upon them.  Many wind up being the ones taken to jail and the abuser knows that is what will happen, using it to manipulate them further.  

Yay for the gender bias in our society, in all its forms! /s
Did you get his name or badge number? Report him for discrimination and discriminatory actions against you. Hopefully he gets fired or karma removes him from the planet :) I can’t stand cops so much these days bc there’s to many bad eggs in the baskets.
This is why I will never call the cops for anything.
I went into the psych ward exhibiting all the signs of having been emotional battered and experiencing ptsd yet no one thought I was doing better until I started taking credit for my own trouble…. I was being emotionally abused daily


Should say 43yo mtf presenting as cis at the time
ACAB
Fuck, I'm so sorry that happened.

You might look up the laws in your area and see if you legally have to give any ID to a cop when you're in your own home in this situation. Driving is a different story but I've never heard of ID *and* SSN, especially with a house visit.
I'm so sorry. Even reading it makes me dysphoric
Sorry to hear you went through that, your neighbor sounds difficult too. 
It seems like we get the worst of gender discrimination from both sides of the gender spectrum and all sides of society. 
Maybe thats a reductive way to put it but it feels true. 

Hope you're feeling better soon.
That’s messed up, I’m sorry that happened to you.
Yup and that’s why I will stand by my fear/dislike of cops, I’m my home country they always seemed hostile and aggressive, I haven’t once felt safe near a police officer (thankfully haven’t had many run ins)
Its pretty sick that some cops will only worry about the people they read as female. Hope you're doing okay. Do some self care and I hope your gf is being there for you, sis. Dysphoria sucks
I'm so sorry about your experience. Reading it actually made me dysphoric because I know if this ever happens to me it'll probably go the same way. I'm sure your wife understands your feelings and I wish you love and hugs as well. ❤️
Well, there's a reason the police didn't get invited to our pride parade
I'd report his ass
What you should've done was asked for his warrant number/badge number and filed a report
ACAB.
Have a problem? Call the police. Now you have two problems... ACAB
Fuck the police. Now and forever.
Op heads up if your in the US then if cops show up ask if they have a warrant if they say no then you can legally shut the door in their face after saying “have a good morning/day/evening/night officers” still be polite about it and always record interactions
As a wise man once said 

Fuck the police
Thankfully I have never had that happen. But I constantly live in fear of cops for reasons just like this.
No thats really fucked up but not really surprising, and you shouldn’t let that stand, sorry that the ignorant officer made you feel that way☹️, but ooooh that pisses me off, he not only misgendered you (I assume) multiple times, profusely checked if your girlfriend was ok (which I understand why, and that abuse is too common that you should be careful, but assuming that because you are a “guy” that you immediately abuse her is ridiculous), and THEN when directly asked by your girlfriend if they should check on you, he said no? Fucking ridiculous and frankly misogynistic 😡😡
I'm so sorry 😞
Im sorry for this experience. Sadly a large amount of the police is garbage. No matter where you live. Hope you are feeling better meanwhile.
Sorry you had to go through that. I hope your doing okay x
I'm so sorry that happened. A lot of police just suck, with policing through ignorance, bias,  outdated training, full on crime . . . ugh.
That biased ignorant behavior from someone who is supposed to be protecting everyone . . . gross.

Long texts are so much better than short btw <3
Yeah most cops are transphobic from my and my close ones' experience. They are pretty horrible, don't let them drag you down.
This is a daily struggle for cis men. As a cis man I can say I feel for you because although you may be trans a lot of people are going to see you as a man no matter what. I’m not saying they’re right but I am saying that that’s a reality for anyone seen as male
It’s the police off shit like that would happen sadly. The police are dumb as hell their racist and treat shittly like that.
They are need to separate partners because in the possibly that one is actually being abused they maybe afraid to speak out in front of the officer.

You were still misgendered and that is awful, yes he should have asked both of you privately (I believe cis men should be asked in private too for their safety, abuse goes both ways) I'm so sorry this happened and I hope you and your girlfriend don't get in anymore fights.

Take care of eachother please and don't forget to take care of yourself.
ACAB all the way. They're evil by nature.
I’m not an adult yet so I haven’t had a chance to go through this, but you have my sympathy. Honestly police need to learn to respect people and treat all suspects equally and fairly. The whole sex bias thing is messed up, and they should have also questioned that shmuck who called the police on you.
that would be so infuriating im mad just hearing it. I would’ve punched that cop tbh
Never open the door to the police. Call 911 and talk to them. Explain someone is trespassing and you want them to leave. Explain the TV / Video game may have gotten loud during an action scene.  The police were doing their due diligence. You can never forgive yourself returning to the same address and finding a dead spouse.
ACAB
I don't think I'd be sweetly anything if they did this in front of me. 

NOT that I think you're gf was wrong or anything! I just mean that I am a special kind of ""can't shut me the fuck up"" kind of voice. I'm not a quiet person by any means when I'm upset, & this would've pissed me the fuck off. 🤬
Wow who would have thought the pigs would be transphobic and do their jobs poorly…
Disgusting pigs. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Fuck 12, what an asshole. Sorry you went through that.
What a good girlfriend im glad she stood up
❤️
Exactly this. I can’t believe they wouldn’t get a confirmation of both of us being ok. It’s terrible having to deal with such nonsense and it breaks my heart thinking about all those in my shoes who actually were abused and ignored or not even asked because of guy
Exactly this also
Fuck gender norms. I’m a rock now
AMAB and masc presenting at the time (before I realized I was enby) Yeah no. I got physically and mentally abused. You gotta suck it up. It's the reason I have trust issues.
If this is the US, reports don't work. That's like writing a complaint about your boss then giving it directly to him
the only time i had to use that ""service"", iv grown to despise them even more than i already did before.

so anyhow... this is why i always carry a knife with me...
That's messed up. Hopefully you are in a better place now.
Those assigned cop at birth are all bastards
All cats are beautiful?
This systemic crap is EXACTLY why we say things like this. The law enforcement community, as a whole, is deplorable. Police are corrupt, lazy, racist, sexist, abusive, discriminatory, a disproportionate number of cops are themselves violent criminals, and the ""good ones"" can't both fight that reality and keep their job. ACAB indeed, they're even worse than that.
I’ll definitely look into it yeah i figured it may be normal I have no experience in it but will definitely check to know for certain
Unfortunately you do have to provide ID in this situation. In some states when cops get called to a domestic complaint they are required by law to take a report even if an arrest is not made. If you don’t ID yourself you can be taken in for obstruction. Bummer. Also because it’s a domestic complaint they were probably also checking to see if an order of protection was in place.
Thank you ❤️
Thank you and I hope you don’t have to ever feel such ways
Warrant is only needed for searches and arrests under certain circumstances. No one was arrested and no premises was searched = no warrant. I spent to much time working in courts. It got depressing.
That could be taken too ways. Kinky.
I worked in family court for too long. Very depressing place often. Unfortunately “Do you have a warrant” aren’t magic words that make them go away during a domestic investigation. It sucks being investigated like that. Nosy neighbors.
I wish we could rely on the police to make sure we're safe sadly we cannot as they allow themselves to fall victim to prejudice (a good amount of the time there's definitely a few Good ones but that doesn't make up for the fault's of the rest)
I agree I just hate that it’s a thing to deal with for men and trans people alike.
I think it’s great they separate to ask questions and such but yeah I believe both parties should always be addressed. Innocent until proven guilty and such. I appreciate your words and will take care
When I was in basic training I had a short latina drill instructor. One day her assistant was in charge of us. Apparently the night before she was arrested for beating up her husband.
I had my ex make a false report to child protective services in Florida on me when my son was in the hospital for a nasty flu. Sheriff Deputy shows up with another officer to my sons room while we waited for his discharge papers to confront me. Took me to a corner of the hospital floor, and questioned me like I was a dangerous abusive person and all the while the uniformed officer ( both were female) had HER HAND ON HER GUN WITH THE STRAP UNDONE THE ENTIRE TIME. This was infront off my kids and wife and the whole hospital staff and other families with small children. They had my wife and kids questioned while I was out and were pressing them to say I was abusive to them all. (My wife is a Bronx raised Puerto Rican gen X’er. She would spatter me if I ever laid a finger on her or the kids so the insinuation was laughable to her)

It was a false report and was dropped after weeks of harassment and my ex admitting it was false. The cops treat anyone seen as male like a violent criminal even if no crime has been committed. It is humiliating.

( i had the kids with my ex, my second wife was at the hospital with me and we have full custody of the kids together)
yeah its really shitty one of the things im not looking forwards to as a trans man
Trust me darlin, it sucks immensely. I’m very sorry that it went the way it did. My first wife was an abusive narcissistic b!tch, verbally, emotionally, and on rare occasions physically. It never got reported because I was a big “guy”, I should be able to handle any situation with a little ol’ woman. She now REGULARLY tells the world that I was the abusive one. I only fought back when I had had all I could take of her emotional bullying, and would then be shut down with the threat of loss of my daughters. She took my daughters away from me anyway when she divorced me 20 years ago, to be with my cousin. It royally sucks. Good luck with your neighbor.
It needs to be reported at a federal level cause any police department will always come back with a investigation saying otherwise https://civilrights.justice.gov/
This depends on the city. I have had my own interactions with the police department in my own city. 

Ever trans person has to realize that like it or not they have to be an activist
Yeah, it went a while longer after the hospital, not being abused now and getting on track to start transitioning.  Much better :)
TACABAAB
Honestly I read ACAB in the same way I read AMAB/AFAB *every damn time*
Take an updoot
A Cool Ass Bus
the only good interaction iv had with the police was when i interacted with my moms ex-coworker.

the other time, i literally got robbed, had to find everything myself, go there THRICE, and after all of that they hold my phone hostage FOR HALF A YEAR, all while me worrying that iv lost one of my most prized possessions (that being my steam) that iv spend even more money on than my pc, and when i got the phone, they've factory reset it so i couldn't even get in for like 3 hours.
I mean it also sounds like he was trying to find a reason just to make an arrest, then theres the blatent misgendering, so Id defs send a letter off at a federal level about this.
If you’re in the US you probably have to. They have probable cause since the neighbor called so they were detaining you
A warrant number is just the UK equivalent of a  badge number
It can help sometimes
I am so sorry for your loss. I hope one day those who matter will see the truth
my head didn't even connect the cop bits so i just assumed it meantAssigned Cool At Birth...

sorry guys I'm just a bit of a genius /j
if you know tumblr lore, that's the Down With Cis Bus
The cop asked for a SSN because if the OP didn't sound like they credibly had one, that cop was probably going to call ICE.
Interesting.
Sure but it depends on the situation. They know when they need one but, mwah ha ha ha 😈, they sure aren’t going to tell you lol.
Thank you. My oldest might, one of these days, but I doubt it. We lost my youngest to domestic violence 10 years ago. She was 20 years old. She died hating me and believing her mother. That’s even harder to take, than her loss, to be completely honest.
Yeah, it wouldnt surprise me tbh. Cops are pretty trashy tbh. They always seem to look for a problem, if they cant find one, they find a way to make one.
And police a legally obliged to give it to you if you ask they're also obliged to tell you their rank and name
When folks pass over I believe they lose their earthly limiting beliefs and come to understand everything and just feel love and peace, so from that perspective I would say that now your daughter will understand and love you. I hope that helps. I wasn't spiritual like this until I lost my dad
That's why you don't talk to cops. The problem you think you have may not be the problem you actually have. It's kinda like dealing with the Fae. The less said, the better.
That is also true in the US. In my interactions they usually introduce themselves by name anyway. Nice no to have to say hey you there.
Thank you hon, sincerely. That thought hit me fairly strongly in the “feels” department. I’m having a bit of difficulty seeing through the tears brought on by your simple kindness. Kindness isn’t expressed nearly often enough these days. I miss her every single day, even after 10 years. You get use to the pain after a while, but it never really goes away. 

Thank you,

Robin
Oh for sure. I mean its also in the miranda rights. ""Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.""
UK they dont unless they're detectives
Aw you're so welcome. Grief is such a wild ride, and we totally don't have the knowledge and rituals to do it properly. But stuff like this really helped me. 

I came out as trans the year after my dad passed, and felt so sad that he didn't know this about me, so i was advised to write him a letter telling him. And I did. And a few days later I wrote a letter from his perspective, back to me, trying to channel his voice, telling me he loved me and was proud. And I wrote to him again. Back and forth for a few months. That helped give me a strong sense of his presence in my new life.

It sounds like you're a bit stuck in your grief still, and that creating a bit more space to grieve might be helpful. Do you have an alter for her in your house? Could be a tiny shelf with a picture of her, and a few things she liked. Somewhere you could put a letter if you wrote one, or you could sit there and talk to her.

Sending hugs
Don’t give their name?
They don't introduce themselves by name
That seems odd for anyone police or otherwise. It happens in the US but it’s usually a grumpy one. Some won’t even acknowledge a hello. I’m the type that might have fun with this. You could give them all funny names. Just let them know what names they have been assigned so they don’t get confused.
I'd just say you're PC plod and you're PC plumb
Perfect. You have the idea. Could say PC Clod. Steven universe reference. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MaleS9L8crM

I want you to know that  you are a gorgeous human and your style is impeccable. When your dysphoria is fucking with you, look at these photos and how drop dead gorgeous you are. Good luck on your future endeavors but never forget the lovely person you are.

Wishing you gender euphoria and a positive self image.
Omg I want your style! So good
I haven’t been feeling the best lately bc I’m a trans girl that likes death metal and I think that’s too masculine (I know it’s stupid). This has made me feel much better THANK YOUUU
Hella cute vibes!
Shes rocking it!
Damn, all my band hoodies have elastic around the bottom so their tighter to my waist. Might need to find a way to change that
The hoodie *chef's kiss* vibin
The hair just-I have nothing for the hair it just perfect
I will refrain from any cat-calling.
You look very pretty.
Buenas fotos, bella chica y de que banda es la camisa?

Thanks!
Oversized stuff is my favourite look I think, so thank you! Also trans heart looks amazing omg 💙💖🤍💖💙
You're genuinely too kind, I really needed this at the moment so thank you so so much!! 🖤🖤
My favourite song is either Flesh and the Power it Holds or Voice of the Soul, they have so many amazing songs but those in particular grab me
R.I.P indeed, he had so much left to show the world
Metal (and for the matter, all music) should be available for everyone to listen to, sometimes it can be hard to reconcile the two since metal is predominantly male in its audience, but music has no gender. I'm really glad you're feeling better!!
Your very welcome
Wow no leprosy? Rude! You look gorgeous!
Idk what was it 🤔
Both amazing songs and I agree, it's hard to choose with their lineup. I love 1,000 Eyes for the relevance to our modern world. The guitars are so mystifying in their songs 😖. Anyway, you look amazing and I'm gonna have to steal that look!
Wow you aren't even a real fan it's rocky road everyone knows that. /s"	kygvof	trans	1746	0.99	2021-01-16 10:49:40

Very pretty lady :D
Gay girl/queer girl
I would not of even noticed you were mtf
as female
Looks like a girl to me
Femme, possibly androgynous as others have said. I think most cis people would just see femme though, theyre not really geared to account for/consider non-binary identities like we are.
Janis Joplin vibes
Punk girl, you're giving strong sum 41 enjoyer vibes
You look like if asuka from evangelion decided to become a cute rocker girl
Fem <3
a very alt she/they with v good style
You look like you’d be a guest girl character in an episode of iCarly back in the day /pos
You look like a gal, but weird. Not weird in a clocky way tho, like in a fashion way.

Either a girl or non binary

Adorable/10! Definitely a girl, you're very cute!!!!
It’s giving power from chainsaw man if she was chill
Woman, definitely. Your eyes do good work, especially with those cheekbones. I can see a few things that probably cause you dysphoria, but only because I'm looking for them. If you hadn't been posting in a trans sub, I wouldn't have seen them at all.
Female
Absolutely freaking stunning you have everyone falling head over heels Have a great day
Girl with excessively shaggy hair.
Me jelly! You have like my dream hair! ""Besides the color, I'm more of a blond person""

I'm sorry but could you help me understand why asking others to gender you would help you if your Dysphoria is bad? :/
You look like the one girl in orange is the new black, and I loved her so much
You do look like a girl.

Hi
Oops
I would not sell fakes tho, also no selling only sharing!

I sure do Love Punk :3
Trueee, i can be all over the place with fashion sometimes hehe
Im kinda stunned on how this got so much attention. Thank you <3 and u too
Hmm, I tend to be prretty hard to myself. That kinda leads to me focusing on the features i hate the most about myself, all the while I overlook about the progress I have made.  And I have found a lot of support in this Community, with a lot of nice words but also upliffting and helpfull feedback <3 For example a lot of comment in this post gave me some quiet stunning transition goals I feel I can actually achive :3
I guess u are just being honest about your view. Love ur Avatar :3
hahahah , i suppose u came here from my comment in R /memes , nice try
I wanna let u now that u made me do a squeeking sound of Happieness  :3
Thats fair <3 And thank u :3
Hi
Hi
Yay! Hehe ;3
I didn’t think you’d answer btw Thanks
Its the adams apple, i like your hair tho.
Hi <3"	yg2qij	trans	1737	0.99	2022-10-28 22:38:33
Under Texas law, I'm now considered a sex offender. See y'all when I'm out of prison.	"Edit: I was slightly misinformed at first. The law hasn't passed passed, it has up to now *only* passed the senate. Somehow that doesn't make me feel entirely better, but here's hoping the house still has some sense. It passed the Senate 20-11. I also found out today the guy who created the bill is a senator in the same city as me. He's literally MY rep. How did I get so lucky?

To my knowledge the law hasn't taken effect yet but it did pass. But it's worded ambiguously on purpose, like most laws are, enabling the enforcers to discriminate at their discretion whatever poor sap they choose. This law in particular bans drag ""performances"" in any public space where a child might potentially see it, including in grocery stores or restaurants. It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a way that doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth. According to the law, simply wearing ""women's clothes"" when you're ""biologically a man"" could be construed as ""drag"". It goes deeper, also including other typically gendered ""accessories"" such as long hair on a ""man"", makeup or having your nails done. What does this mean in practice? It's simple. I could be seen as grooming kids, and arrested for it, for simply having makeup on when I go to the grocery store. My options? Keep doing what I'm doing and hope nothing bad happens (this is what I choose) or get scared, let the fascists win and just conform and comply, let my gender dysphoria return with a vengeance when it's finally starting to dissipate, and probably before too long, return to suicidal ideation. (This is not what I choose) Aren't you guys glad we live in the freest country in the world?"	"Start reporting Republican women when they wear pants
I am speechless. In which universe is the wearing of clothes related to grooming?
Keep the ACLU contact handy: [https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas](https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas)
Call fhe cops on every priest wearing a robe. After all that's a dress. Maybe they'll even find actual grooming going
Easy solution, get all the menopausal republican women reported for being too masculine. This law is so easily abusable that they'll soon realise they're going to have to sift through a thousand non-trans people before they can even find a single trans person
wtf is happening to america
You know America really prides itself on being ""land of the free"" yet every day so many people become less and less free, and I don't think they're actually considering how this is going to affect people in the long run as well

Because this is just beginning, theyre taking rights away from us and others then sooner or later we're going to see them take rights away from so many more, Just because it doesn't affect someone now doesn't mean it's not always going to and that's what these close-minded selfish dumbasses need to start thinking about. If they don't care about us maybe they'll care about themselves when they get their own rights taken
Fucking Texas.
My solution? Blow up call centers about politicians and right wing news anchors wearing makeup and how your son is now asking why men wear makeup. Why are sex offenders trying to indoctrinate my children into their trans culture?! I can’t even. 😤 

Texas is a joke of a state. Doesn’t have a working power grid, kids dying by the dozen from shootings, but clearly the biggest issue is men in makeup. 😑
I am also in TX and dont know what this is about

Do you have a link my friend?!?

EDIT If anyone also in TX wants to message me my inbox is open. Sylvia Rivera kept a list of all the trans folks she knew and their emergency contacts in her bible. that, along with her other activism, inspired me to want to network to other trans folks near me. so my inbox is open  and i would love to hear from you 🩷
Jeans, pants of any kind, shorts of any kind, t-shirts of any kind, short skirts (ever heard of kilts anyone), hosiery, heels, combat boots, cowboy boots, gladiator sandals, Oxford style shirts, polo shirts, tank tops, cowboy hats, boyshort underwear,"" boyfriend"" style shirts, business suits, aviator glasses, tennis shoes,... the number of cis women they'll need to prosecute for wearing these traditionally masculine and often clearly meant for men clothes. The  number of retail stores being fined for daring to sell these make items on a mass scale to cis women.
Ted Cruz's senate seat is up for a vote in 2024, Start by voting that POS out. Lots of down ballot races too. Take a stand! And if not you're always welcome here in Oregon.
The concern is valid. However SB 12 has only passed the senate. Holding out hope for the House being more sensible.
A similar law was shot down by the courts in Tennessee. Hope you can get the same justice!
Returning to suicidal ideation is what they want. They want “the 41%” to go much higher so that they can act holier than thou and blame free. “iT’s nOt mY fAuLt tHeY cOmMiTtEd sUiCiDe.”

Yes. Yes, it is. It is 100% your fault, GOP politicians. Cut the “we want small government” shit. You love big government when it’s used as a means to harass, persecute, and subjugate. If y’all would just leave us the fuck alone and go back to privately pretending like we don’t exist, that would be super.
This is what eventually caused the Stonewall riots, just to be clear. Here we fucking go again, I guess.
Civil penalty of $10 each?...lol cmon Texas, ya dumb af!

Don't be scared hun, stay educated and live your life...all the bathroom bills passed when I transitioned in deep red Texas a few years ago and I worked in the state capitol building...let me tell ya, no one said a single goddamn thing...

Pardon my wordage! ;) <3
“Hey Patrick! What am I now?”
I concur with any suggestion for malicious compliance and weaponization of the law. However, what's missing is basically how to go about that safely. 

First up, be in contact with a law professional. This law WILL backfire so there's probably some legally-inclined allies out there waiting to help use their knowledge and abilities to help it get overturned in courts.

Second, loopholes, loopholes, loopholes. Study up the law like it's the Bible and figure out what you can do that you can't be arrested for. The ambiguity inherent in it will allow you to exist comfortably as you want to, just with a few caveats.

Lastly, break the law. Not by direct illegal resistance to it but by using itself as a weapon against itself. This circle back to my first point of getting in contact with someone who knows legal stuff because you want to do things that would get you in trouble, put you in a courtroom, and force the court to evaluate the legitimacy of the law. You want to coordinate this with a community of people who the law effects (which include basically anyone who works with clothes and makeup) so that no single individual bears the cost of the case and the number of problems with the law become more apparent. 

But above all else, survival while oppressed is better than death while oppressed. Be cautious, focus on your health and well-being, and make enough sacrifices to keep yourself safe. Do not conform totally but don't risk it all just to lose it all in prison unless you plan on writing a book.
What? It's normal for men to have longer hair, and I hope there's a fucking outrage this is a violation of human rights! Aren't the Republicans the ones who love America bc of our ""free country?"" It's not freedom if people are being forced to comply to rules that sound like they came from religious transphobes
I live in one of the states that followed Texas, and managed to pass a law like this. It's super scary and difficult, because I've already socially transitioned and changed my name. At this point, I don't own anything that wouldn't be considered Drag under these bills. I've been transitioning for 3 years, I don't have my old clothes or name or anything anymore, and can't afford to buy a new wardrobe to re-stealth. I haven't been able to afford my hormones either for about a year, so I look obviously trans right now. I'm stuck in a terrible place. Even going to the store is a terrifying ordeal.  


I really wish we didn't have to go through these kinds of things. I wish I could help you, but at least I can say you aren't alone. We'll all get through this together somehow.
>It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a waythat doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth.

This isn't fair. I completely agree that sex, nudity and raunch shouldn't be exposed to kids, but drag queens typically aren't doing that stuff around minors. I've been to the drag queen story hours where I live. Reading Babar books while wearing a dress isn't sexual or offensive.
Do they realize that practically every painting of Jesus he has long flowing hair, and is never seen wearing slacks or a button down shirt? 


Hey Texas, I learned in school about a bunch of men who wore curly wigs, tights, and high heeled shoes: the founding fathers!  (Some of them even spoke French) 


And how about makeup? I'm sure tough guys like Trump or Chuck ""Texas Ranger"" Norris would never wear make up,except every single time they are in front of a camera. 


Anyways, good luck in prison, along with a very large chunk of the rest of the state.
Wait they arrest men with long hair, nails and makeup? Can't wait to see them arrest a Black metal musician
Just move a bit north up here to New Mexico where your rights are protected and the community is absolutely fine with you being here.  We have legal weed, free college, and the most bomb food you'll ever ear.

&#x200B;

We even passed the ""Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act"" which codifies our rights.  We even allow people to change their gender on their drivers license without a doctors note.  Even ""x"" if you want to identify as non-binary or gender neutral (That's what's on my license)  


  
This place kicks ass.
Can someone link me the law that passed? Is it SB12 or something else? Thanks in advance
Are you referring to bill [HB4378](https://translegislation.com/bills/2023/TX/HB4378) ?
Leave. Even Mexico is better than this shit.
Nothing says freedom like forcing everyone else to conform to the exact lifestyle you think is best
I’m having fun imagining effeminate trans men and masculine trans women mess with their brains x)
As people above say once a stupid amount of reports get submitted and people use it against them then it’ll soon stop being enforced.

It’s the same concept as the book bill that was passed lately, the intent was to stop being able to teach about lgbt and sex under the guise of it being inappropriate for children so people have started to report the bible for the same thing and under their law it’s entirely reasonable to do so.

They will not have thought this through enough for the consequences that will happen
Sorry for spamming the hell out of your post OP. thank you so much for making it or I wouldnt know this even happened. The disinformation makes it hard to sort fact from fiction. 

Sylvia Rivera was arrested over 200 times for ""upper head female impersonation"" and what did she say? She said ""I REFUSE to pass!"" She compared it to a POC passing as white. 

OP I encourage you to listen to her old interviews... Making Gay History's first ep of their podcast has an interview with her and a lot of other fiesty historical queer folks that will comfort and motivate you. Ive been listening to it and it helps, i promise, to hear people from the 70s or 40s talk about what they went through and hearing the radical shit they were saying/doing then. 

As Chuck Rowland in s1e7 of the podcast, who got fired for being gay and fought it for 15 years until the government sent him a letter apologizing, said... This is how people get radicalized--  they get fucked with! And they see its bullshit, and the light comes on and they fight back
This has not been passed into law yet!!! Texas SB12:

https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2771604#:~:text=Texas%20Senate%20Bill%2012&text=Bill%20Title%3A%20Relating%20to%20restricting,penalty%3B%20creating%20a%20criminal%20offense.&text=By%3A%20Hughes%2C%20et%20al
So basically no Scottish bagpipes, no rock concerts, no football (paint on the face), no male news anchors and no actors existing in the state of Texas
a similar law that was passed just died in Tennessee recently (one of the most sickeningly red states in the country). keep your chin up, girl! 🥰
So…go naked?
They will have to arrest all women wearing jeans and shirts and other male clothing.
fun fact: most state legislatures personal info including: phone numbers, addresses, full names, emails, etc. are available online on either their website or the states government website, i was able to find that the one who introduced this bill (gov. dan patrick)  has a p.o. box which i’m not saying what it is
This is horrible.. we live in an AWFUL place now.. what happened to everyone..???? 😔✊🏳️‍🌈🤍✨
Please encourage everyone you know (well those who are open minded & progressive) to register to vote and then actually vote. We have to get our country back on track and the only way to make positive strides is to vote these conservatives out of office. We need the majority vote in both the house and the the senate.
The land of the free. Equal rights for all.

Except black people, asian people, hispanic people, jewish people, gay people, women, muslims...

Everybody who's not a white man.

No y'know what not even white people. Nobody gets any rights.
You have another realistic option too, and that's move out of the christostan caliphate to an actual free part of the county.  Life has never been better for us in solidly blue states.
I hate it here. I wish I could be taken away from Texas myself
I swear to god this is one of the most flawed fucked up laws in American history. Imma start reporting Republican women for wearing pants, Republican politicians for wearing makeup(how else does trumps face get that orange), maybe be a little malicious and report everyone I see because how would I know what’s in their pants?
Or, leave the state if you can, return later with ...... Not reddit safe intents.

Theirs either human rights, or bullets flying in the defense of human rights
It doesn’t matter what happens. I’m going to fight for my happiness no matter what
Wtf doesn't the US have more serious problems? Like in general? Oh well divide and conquer right? How can there be a majority for any laws like that, not just within the general population but even within the gop?

Well in for a country that feels comfortable incarcerating 505 ppl per 100000, which actually is a huge improvement if you can believe it by about 190 from 2018, it kinda tracks, I just guess they felt like they were missing a couple of prison slaves in their prison industrial complex to line their pockets.

At this point it seems the only 3 options left would be to either take radical steps to strip them of their power, generalstrike have EVERYONE lay down their work until they step down [maybe just have everyone dienie just republicans any type of service might work] a revolution something like a civil war or removing your self and as many people and money as you can from the economy and move it to a different country maybe even Mexico, that would be fun to see the reaction of politicians when Mexico economy is growing while the US economy is falling into a deep recession 

Internationally how about sanctions? We're more than just one nation. Maybe have all US trans people ask for asylum and force political action of other nations, because of draconian prosecution. If Western nations condem Russia for this type of shit a couple of years ago they should do the same  to the US.
Only word of advice for you: join your local Pink Pistols, Socialist RA, or EFJBC chapter, organize, and be VERY cautious. Don't go quietly into the night.
My biological sex is transgender woman.. because my Brian tells me I am a woman and I was born with a mistake. And my Brian is my biology 🧬
(This is just anger and nothing SERIOUS however I feel like I have a point)
Today marks the day that I declare war upon those who have forsaken us. No longer will our country of ""Freedom"" be defined by who we are at birth, but who we are on the inside. Now...

WHO'S WITH ME
So sad. These fascist hoes be fucking with us. I am here if you need me.
Last I heard it only passed in the Senate. I hope something happens that stops it before it passes the house. Otherwise, I’m right there with you!  I’m not going to do anything different, but my wife and I are already making plans.
This could lead to some very terrible things or situations, this is wild but not really totally a surprise considering it's texas. I feel for all the people down there in that area who have to worry about that kind of thing... Worry what might happen to them since who really knows at this point, the law is so ambiguous it could be anything.
💔
Does anyone have a source for this? I’m trying to google but I can’t find much. Just trying to make sure I understand which states are safe to go to and which ones aren’t and why. Thanks!
I unironically would feel more safe living with that one isolated tribe on north sentinel island than in America. Luckily my family is getting the fuck out the moment I turn eighteen but at this point I don't know if we'll even get the chance
Same here in Tennessee.  Except here it's only a temporary judicial order keeping it from being currently active.
Get as many people in texas to report as many people as possible, flood the system with false reports, that should piss them off and hopefully anyone “guilty” will slip through unnoticed, then burn the system to the ground (take that as literally as you feel like taking it)
i’m usually pretty good and understand the “other” person’s side.  like even if i don’t agree, i can still understand where they’re coming from, even if their logic’s really flawed, but how is dressing as an opposite gender grooming?  what could you possibly be grooming a child for by wearing a dress?  and by grooming, i mean the textbook definition, how tf is it grooming?
Well they define drag pretty clearly I guess. How do they define ""performance""?
We will not comply!
How bout report cis women for wearing traditional men’s clothing
freedom country and the war against freedom, ep 1
Seems all are welcome here in Maine where I live. Even the womans restrooms are ok for us girls. Everyone seems to be easy going on this issue and I really don't understand why other states are so stupid.
This law doesn’t make sense. I’m gender nonconforming and under this new law, I’d be a sex offender and so would just about anyone else. WTF are Texan girls wearing these days, prairie dresses? Fuuuuuuuuuu
This is dystopian how does the land of the free call itself such when people want to dictate how people express themselves
Why is it that trans women seem to get all the hate but I never see lawmakers or others targeting trans men? Do people outside the community just not think trans men exist or what?
Reason #230984230948239084092384092849023849023 to never ever visit Texas.
Report everyone for everything. Men with long hair, women with short hair. Men who wear bracelets (you know those “manly” bracelets?) Women wearing pants. Men with earrings. No one is safe report them ALL.
Some people in the thread are talking about reporting women for wearing men’s clothing to make a point. Please do not do this. That behavior is going to enforce gender checks for trans mascs and POC in particular will be at much higher risk for assault and death. Any older person will remember the articles laws, these gender check assaults impacted all of us, please do not weaponize the police.
have you ever documented anything about your transition officially? name changes, gender changes, anything like that?
I just want civil war & to divide already, or Die trying.
I'm apolitical, so don't have a strong opinion either way. 

I am curious as to why some people feel so strongly that that drag performers, who present an often sexualised parody of women for adult entertainment, would ever need to interact with children?
[deleted]
The same bill was passed into law here in TN, but it's currently embattled legally.  A judge already put a stay on allowing it to go into effect.
so just having long hair would make me a sex offender even if I have a beard that is crazy.
I’ve always wondered why anyone thinks the US is so free. From the outside it’s a deeply unattractive place, and steadily getting worse. Stay safe.
Okay I've read over this shit and it seems the bill - if I'm reading it correctly and assuming the word ""and"" in law between two criteria/conditions in a legislative document means that both the terms before AND after are required for it to apply... - says that it performances in the nude generally, or cross dressing in the context of...a performance that ""appeals to the prurient interest in sex"" if people under 18 are around or if it's done in a public space one can reasonably assume a minor could see. Now what that means legally speaking - and thankfully it's not just some new string of words in law - is... well

>material appealing to prurient interest as material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts, and defined prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion 

However, of course, this is subjective to some extent. And all the above is simply defining what counts as a ""sexually oriented performance"". More importantly perhaps is that - again if I'm reading the damned law correctly...it's a law prohibiting owners of commercial venues as well as anyone who might be able to authorize these types of performances. And, even with the vagueness of the legal definition above...it seems that ""Drag queen story hour"" would be a stretch-armstrong type reach to prohibit. Further it doesn't seem to say anything about arresting people. Mostly just fines - for business owners or people able to authorize public performances. 

So, if all parties act in good faith and to the law as written, it literally does not prevent you from presenting fem in public. It just states that if you are presenting fem in public...and acting like...sexual in fairly performative ways or just otherwise inappropriate ways then you might have a problem, or in a place of business be asked to stop/leave. So like...don't play grab ass or anything and it \*shouldn't\* be an issue. ... 

Kind of underwhelming as far as these laws go, tbh. A different state iirc is doing a law where if you're a ""male dressing as a female"" you can't even ""monologue"" in public...whatever the hellish fuck THAT means. 

If any legal buffs wanna correct my interpretation of this shite please do so.

My boss, is a very manly cis man, viking looking fella with a huge beard. And he wears black nails. So I guess he's a kid groomer or something ? What a joke this law is.
Jesus Christ America is retarded, can’t wait for the next civil war due to all these retarded decisions
Ok the usa is becoming more and more sensitive than ever
Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
I think organizing marches of trans people and allies in unisex clothing would be perfect.
Idgaf at this rate, if this shit passes in my area and they try to put me in jail for it they are going to have do drag my cold dead body there because, there is absolutely no way I’m not going down without a fight.
I hope the best for you! These people in office are such disgrace! They need to stop worrying about what trans and lgbtq people are doing and worry about bigger issues! LGBTQ DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!!!! i give you luck 😔🏳‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Texas? I made a video about all this if you wanna check it out. It targets freedom of speech and freedom of expression in general. This is a terrible bill that if passed will be an attack on most media
That's wild I hope it wont pass cause damn that's sound a lot like a nazi bullshit
This. If it’s not struck down by a court, this is how we end laws like this.
YES!! Malicious compliance FTW!!

Texas
Unfortunately its not just southern states.  I live in a liberal state in the northeast, and my TERF sister in law, who is a self proclaimed ""progressive"", lost her shit when her trans 12 yo kid started talking to me about gender stereotypes and i told them i presented as femme.  Lost. Her. God. Damn. Mind. Literally the conversation involved clothes and nail polish. I would never have guessed in a million years she was so transphobic. But I might as well have been being yelled at by Ron DeSantis.

Point being, unfortunately, while its a minority in most places, many people we would think would be our allies, still hold this sick transphobic bigoted view.
You know cops would turn a blind eye to that cause Jesus
How about female cops wearing pants?  That doesn't sound like it conforms with traditional women's clothing.
Yes report all of the women wearing jeans. Or just anything other than a dress. Then report the men for wearing shorts saying they look effeminate.
Yes. This. Totally this.

Just like someone in Utah turned that state's book-banning law on it's head to demand the Bible be removed from a school
Report any of them that have short hair. Report them for wearing pant suits. Report them for not wearing heels, makeup, jewelry etc. Hell, you could get really petty and report ones with broad shoulders and square jawlines. Menopause can also cause facial hair to grow, report that. Literally anything to abuse this barbaric law.
Okay, yeah, all that, but like. They KNOW these laws will be challenged. That's the goal. They want it to get to higher and higher courts to:

1. Waste time and


2. Give the generally conservative-filled courts a chance to support them officially.
It is the fascist takeover after all the political infrastructure was put in to ban abortion.

Conservatives got involved in their primaries. Conservatives worked locally in the political machinery. Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative states. The most reliably conservative judges were put in at all levels. The Supreme Court was even taken.

The zero-middle ground polices of anti-abortion activists and religious groups built the infrastructure and led to this.

Anything diassproved of by conservative churches will be torn down.
Look up Seven-Mountain Dominionism. It is, unfortunately, not as crazy as it sounds. It’s basically the root of all the anti-abortion, anti-LGBT+, etc. legislative nonsense
Short hand notes… government people (state and federal) are upset at a minority and want to make it impossible to live as said minority or just straight genocide said minority because it’s getting too hard to control and loud to ignore anymore. Some people think it goes against their “religious beliefs” to understand people who are different from them and use their “faith” as a shield to deflect all criticism or wrong doing. Should mention government and religion should be separate entities but they in reality mix way too often in the political affairs of the USA.
They’re turning American into hunger games American, next they’re gonna pick 24 children to fight to the death in an arena /j
First they came for the socialists…
I'll say it again...all the great metal to ever come out of texas isnt even enough to mitigate all the texan shit anymore.

It really REALLY sucks here.
My boss literally makes all the phobic remarks and his favorite band is kiss.

“Uh…really transphobic?”
Yes it is sb 12
My post is specifically about sb12, which I thought passed passed, but apparently just passed the Senate and still has to go to the house. However hb4378 is just as bad and disgusting. And we aren't at all out of the woods with sb 12 also. I'm holding out hope tho for a positive result in the house.
This is how those laws get struck down though. Troll them into oblivion.
I want to pass so I'm safe from laws like these.
Ahh, America
There's a problem regarding the little green pieces of paper with dead guys on them. I don't have enough.
This is what they are actually trying to do - get a super majority of legislatures in 35 states to be red by making anyone that could potentially be blue or moderate move to the other states... at that point, they control the entire US because 35 states let's them rewrite the constitution to be whatever they want.
I think we need to start looking into non profits in our states to help our family in other states at this point, much like the Aunty network does for women seeking abortions.
Good. Don’t stop. 

Ever.
Search for Texas SB 12. It passed the senate and is going to the house. [TX SB 12 on LegiScan](https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB12/2023)

[Equality Texas’ 2023 Bill Tracker](https://www.equalitytexas.org/legislature/legislative-bill-tracker-2023/) is good for bill summaries.
Anyone who sings, lipsyncs, dances, or otherwise ""performs"" in front of an audience. A performance could be something as simple as ""crossdressing"" as an actor in costume. They word these things super ambiguously on purpose. They want them to be able to be abused. It accomplishes 2 things. This way, of course most people fall for it, because of course you don't want sexually explicit drag queens dancing in front of kids. The 2ns thing it accomplishes is that it enables any transphobic or homophobic police officer, store manager or even just a regular person, to say they see it as a performance, they see it as drag, etc. And you can catch a lot more people in the net. That's not something that's possible to happen with more specific wording. Go back and look at all the bills republicans have made in recent years. They're ALL worded this way. It's on purpose.
Patriarchal valuation of masculinity and devaluation of femininity.

It’s the same reason why the culture warriors obsess over (especially feminine) gay men more than lesbian women.
Not legally no. But I am in the process currently of getting my name and gender marker changed. Surprisingly easy in this state, it just takes a while for the process. Equally surprising is that Texas is not one of the states in which you have to have had srs in order to change your gender marker. All you need is a court order, which judges in Austin will all too readily and happily give, which is why they are so backlogged, and all you need for that is a letter from a physician. There is no law that says judges have to honor the letter and getting one doesn't guarantee your petition will be accepted, but I've heard of exactly zero cases of anyone getting denied out of Austin, which is why everyone goes there. I'm trying to hurry up and get that done before that changes too.
You don’t have a “strong opinion” on whether any random “free” citizen of a “free country” should be abused & arrested for, literally, just existing in society, while wearing “any 3”  of; clothing, shoes, accessories, makeup, hair &/or nails, that some power-tripping, stick-up-their-“***” puritanical authoritarian “moralist” arbitrarily decided, does not “match their AGAB”?

So, I guess that means you don’t care about equality, freedom, & human rights? Or, at least, not enough to “have a strong opinion”…?
It's Senate bill 12.
Everything I've read said it passed 20-11 but hasn't taken effect yet.
Constantly deconstructing these bill’s tripwire spiderweb, Machiavellian legal language, is exhausting, and decidedly bad for my mental health. So, I’m just going to leave a few quick points for your consideration, regarding how this “law” could be used.

First, understand that those pushing these bills, see any “deviance” from, what THEY CONSIDER to be, normalized cis-het gender presentation, as based purely in ego & sexuality, & therefore serving NO OTHER PURPOSE than “appealing to the prurient interest in sex”, to the presenting individual, & to any other person who happens to see them.

Further, seeing as how they deny that being transgender is a real thing, & that being “trans” is not a “legitimate ontological state of being”. They view ANYTHING, other than “AGAB appropriate presentation”, PURELY as “a PERFORMANCE”. This includes, but is not limited to, walking down the street, engaging in casual conversation, friendly waving to another person… you know what? Just put LITERALLY ANYTHING here, & it would apply.

Honestly, that’s enough. I’m going to stop there.

I hope it helps view the language of this bill in a more illuminated light.
I would rather not see this country descend into civil war over this dumb culture war bullshit. Civil war means our families and friends are now on the menu. No thanks. I’d rather see an amicable split. I grew up in Vicksburg, MS. The losing side never really recovers. Ask me how I know…
Also, report cis women for wearing women’s clothes. They will need to prove they don’t have dicks.

This will not end well for fascists.
It's been said before, it will be said again. Malicious compliance is the greatest tool of a civil activist
Yea but they act likenthwyre straight outta the 60's
I’m an Aussie but from what OP’s said about this law it totally could apply.
It's 2023 we shouldn't have to defend what we wear

And you're delusional to think they won't go that far
And Tennessee. And it’s in the works for Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska (but that one is being filibustered into oblivion), Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia. 
*sigh*
Yup, plus who do they think they are parading around as a police officer? That's a MAN'S job. /s
No kidding. It's like the republicans haven't seen 80's metal bands before.
Probably only do this if you're positive they're an evil neocon demon. Don't want innocent people who live in these states and don't even support these laws to be hurt just because they're cis and typecast as a boomer Fox News enjoyer.
I'm worried this could backfire.

They might actually make all women wear dresses
Not just jeans, sneakers/trainers too...no more skate shoes, no more running shoes, no more B-Ball shoes

It's high heels and dressy flats from now on.

Malicious Compliance, comrades!
Could I have more info on that ?
Not if we tear them down first.
> Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative and non-conservative states.

FTFY. If you look at Wisconsin, looking at the results from recent state wide ballots, they should have close to 50/50 R and D representation in the legislature, but they don't. Their electoral map is so heavily gerrymandered to weaken Democratic voices and strengthen GOP to where the Republicans have a supermajority in both the house and senate.
Wanting to bring about the end times and make the US a theocracy isn’t the sanest notion in my book, but yes, they have been at it for a long time.

The Dominionists aren’t the only ones involved though. Alliance Defending Freedom, Heritage Foundation, Family Policy Alliance, Focus on the Family, and American College of Pediatrics (not the AAP) have backers from multiple demographics, not just Dominionists. Gotta love the BS in those names though.
Exactly, as time goes on they're just going to keep taking more and more of peoples rights so just because it doesn't affect some people now doesn't mean it won't down the line

People think it's bad now but sooner or later it's going to get a lot worse if this carries on, I mean seriously what's next? Are they going to start not allowing women to work again or maybe they'll start separating places by color again. Because there is literally no end goal here besides people getting more and more power to just take away rights that everyone should have over their own life
Right?! No no no. Men in makeup who perform things I ENJOY are okay. What you enjoy is clearly evil!
That's facepaint, just like GI Joe isn't a Doll, he is an Action Figure
OMG I meant call obsessively in high volume to drive them insane! 😅 how’d I forget this is America?
This has not been passed into law yet!!!
Grew up in Portland and moved to Texas, now sadly in Missouri and my spouse is trans and was just getting brave enough to transition and now…all of this! Enjoy Oregon, visit the falls in Corbett and Ashland! Good luck and we will probably be right behind you :)
$10 civil penalty similar to any other civil infraction such as parking tickets.
“No! I’m Texas!”
I’m so sorry. I’m originally from Texas but I moved out last year. I hope you stay safe babe 💖🫂🫂
Thats fair! I mean same, but im inspired by how radical Sylvia was and how she believed we had the right to be openly queer. I think what she was saying was we shouldn't have to pass to be safe, and at the time ""pass"" meant passing as cishet and assimilate into white cishet society. I mean Sylvia also says ""if you walked down 42nd street and even LOOKED like a f-ggot you were getting arrested."" The point I think she wanted the hate to STOP, not find ways to navigate it and just survive it. She wanted change. She wanted liberation!!!!! Theres an underground documentary about Sylvia on youtube I recommend called ""More than Stonewall"". If you havent listened to the full interview that quote is from I encourage you to!

Edit i see this is getting downvoted. Why downvote our own history? Like yes I want to pass to avoid violence but it doesnt end there, I dont want to quietly pass and leave everything as it is just so the violence hits the nonpassing folks. I want the violence gone. Why downvote that? Very curious if anyone wants to lmk
just learn 2 code, duh
To those downvoted me... I was being sarcastic....
You don’t need tens of thousands of dollars to move, and you can take as long as you need to squirrel away bits of cash here and there. Advising somebody to move doesn’t come with the expectation it can be done immediately and effortlessly. 

I moved cross country for unrelated reasons in 2011. It took a little over a year and a half of scrounging whatever I could from the $8/hour I earned at the time until I had enough to survive a few months without work. It was hard, it was a grueling wait, but it was worth it and I’d do it again without hesitation.
I fear since this witchhunt started, that this is the real reason behind those bills.
This! The solution is to take back liberal majorities or at least get rid of supermajorities in Red States, not to run and let the bigots win. We need to keep up emigration from places like New York and California to progressive cities in the Deep South like Atlanta, Austin, and New Orleans. At the same time, blue states need to make themselves as unattractive as possible to the right wing by implementing progressive policies.
So which four of the current 19 solidly blue state legislatures do you think they're going to try to switch by forcing Democrats out?

Virginia is the only one I could possibly see flipping anytime soon.
Anyone who sings, lipsyncs, dances, or otherwise ""performs"" in front of an audience. A performance could be something as simple as ""crossdressing"" as an actor in costume. 

Please refer to my other post much longer on this thread going over the law itself. The criteria is not JUST that. Now unless the law doesn't view the word ""And"" between two sections when describing what constitutes the offence itself as binding them together and requiring both to be true. 

This one seems to not be worded the way some other more psychotic bills are worded, strangely enough. Did you read through it and check the definitions and all that jazz?

Furthermore it seems to be targetted towards owners of establishments as well as any person who can authorize a public performance - I assume that to mean someone who's job it is to schedule events like that or give the go-aheads. It doesn't seem to specify anything about the PERFORMER being charged with breach of this law - unless they're also the owner of the establishment I suppose.
Then I strongly recommend you leave the state as soon as you feasibly can. Texas is trying to make lists of trans people with records of name and gender changes; it’s possible the list has already compiled and they’re pretending it needed tweaking.

Ok wow thank you so much
So what does this mean. As a trans man on T, if i was in drag would that be considered legal? But me being masculine and wearing masc clothes would be illegal?
That still doesn't change the fact that the bill isn't targeting individuals on the street, nor even performers themselves, but people who own venues who allow it on their venue, as well as like...public workers who authorize performances in public spaces. 

Not in this bill, at least. 

This does not seem to allow one to be arrested for being trans or even cross dressing.
I don’t know shit bout the us but wouldn’t be surprised if that shit happens
Report cis men for wearing men's clothes. Claim that they are really women who are just trying to make men look bad.
Report any female officers who respond for wearing pants.
transphobic republicans are unironically already doing this tho. in some ways i think this was kind of their goal. i remember hearing about a case in a literal elementary school where they wanted to check all of the little girls to make sure they didn't have dicks. its absolutely insane they can talk about wanting to do this and people support it and don't see the obvious pedophilia but are so brainwashed that they think trans people just existing is pedophilia. its absolutely insane. but i dont think we should be doing what the transphobes have been doing. maybe im wrong, thats just my opinion. idk i guess my point is that transphobes have already called me and other allies the t slur ""because of my jawline"" (in other words because im an ally. im a cis woman btw) and i just dont really see why we would join sides with them in that? i dont know, if someone could explain this to me that would be greatly appreciated, im just trying to understand!
exactly. lots of 100% passing trans people, you want that bulked up dude with a beard and biceps the size of a watermelon, wearing skirts and using the same bathroom as ""our innocent children""? like okay, im transmasc. im not allowed to use the mens room because im biologicalpy female, but (hypothetically) if i was on HRT for 5 years, top surgery, full male presentation... theyd still want me in the womens room?

i think they only hate ""non passing"" trans people because it has nothing to do w being trans because guess what, you cant always tell 😭
Still can't argue that to a judge in 2023.
No judge is going to interpret women wearing pants as women in drag
Tennessee got theirs struck down by the courts
Edit: sorry not struck down but blocked. We shall see how long the block will last.
The Secession States.
The West Virginia bill died in committee and the session is adjourned sine die.
Damn right! Haha
The malicious compliance venom in that was golden…we probably could take it a step further and start saying Y job before sufferage is considered a “MANS” job so no women should be allowed to be x job title. Asumming the law is that ambiguous. Probably not but it would get a good point across if the law is that broad and grasping at straws. I hope we don’t have to do that to make a point but if we must we must.
Which is ironic considering so many have used We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister as a campaign song (or whatever it's called) and yet... have any of them actually looked at Twisted Sister?
You're probably not wrong. They did just make it so women in the  Missouri house can't show their shoulders. I'm sure the Christian right wing would gladly make every woman wear a burka
Eeeep. The Handmaid’s Tale.
Actually, high heels were [originally and more commonly seen on men in cavalry positions](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-high-life-a-history-of-men-in-heels/iQJCgMgwSKV5Kw) \- by traditional conventions, all male soldiers should be wearing high heels. See how the transphobes reckon with that one.
Sure...

Strangely, while they have managed to influence backers from outside of the traditional dominionist fold, all of those organizations were founded on 7M values and by 7M members. Just because they don’t currently claim direct dominionist end goals, that doesn’t mean they aren’t dominionist organizations. They’re all pushing for those seven mountains. Whether the members realize it or not, that’s what their leadership is reaching for.
well there are conservatives talking about taking away womens right to vote....
If they’re allowed to continue unchecked, gay rights and marriage are absolutely next.
Yep still needs to pass house and govenor, but yaknow abbot so just the house really
My wife used to live there and we’ve traveled there many times.
Oh gotcha
“What’s the difference?” 🤷🏼‍♀️
I get frustrated when people say ""just move!"" as if anyone can do it if they work hard enough. You ever considered that maybe the person has family they support? Old/sick relatives, a kid that can't move away from their other parent? Maybe they're sick themselves and can't lose their medical support? They have too much debt to save any spare money? They're underwater on their mortgage and the house won't sell? They work in an industry that can't be relocated? All their spare change goes to supporting someone else who'd be homeless without them? Being in the state they're in literally prevents them from saving money due to the financial hardships created by that state's laws? They can't work because they're disabled?

""Just move, you can do it if you save enough!"" Is ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" rhetoric. I'm glad moving worked for you. It worked for me too. Doesn't work for everyone.
There were some republican state politicians late last year that actually said the goal was to drive all the liberals to blue states so they get a super majority in 35 states.  I can't remember who it was, but there were videos circulating for a few weeks about it.
Austin has tried to fight the state numerous times. Abbot, Paxton, and Patrick have smacked them down multiple times. HISD has been taken over. AISD is next on the retribution list.

Austin will lose. The local liberal tech companies don’t have the stomach to fight. They have shareholders to answer to and shareholders don’t give a damn about a few trans people getting their lives ruined.

Ok, l guess I’m doing this, after all. Let’s go, then…

*I have taken the liberty of adding quotations & parentheses for personal comments, & to aid understanding, & edited out excess legal jargon, not relevant to the point, for ease of digestion.

(From) [Section 1](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2771604)

(applies to) Performances on; 

PUBLIC PROPERTY, 
(anywhere that is not private property)

on the premises of a commercial enterprise, 
(any business holding whatsoever)

or, in the presence of a child 
(literally anywhere).

So, as to where this can be applied… well, you tell me. Can you think of ANY PLACE where these conditions would fail to be met? (Other than specifically licensed establishments for “adult entertainment”). It’s literally “everywhere” a person could possibly find themselves.

(From) Section 3.

A “sexually oriented performance” means a visual performance that features:

A.(ii) a male performer exhibiting as a female, or a female performer exhibiting as a male, who uses clothing, makeup, or other similar physical markers and who “performs” before an “audience” (2 or more people); or

(B)  appeals to the “prurient interest” in sex.
(Examples of “Prurient Interest”, taken from [LawInsider.com](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/prurient-interest): 1. ""Prurient interest is an appeal to an unhealthy, abnormal, unwholesome, degrading, shameful, or morbid interest in sex."" Id. at 117. 2. Prurient interest could be said to be the lowest common denominator, the assumption being that the material is bound to be sexually arousing to at least someone.)

(b)  A person commits an offense if, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER COMPENSATION for the “performance” IS EXPECTED OR RECEIVED, the person engages in a “sexually oriented performance”:

Please take particular note of the language, “A *PERSON* commits an offence if… *THE PERSON* engages in a… performance”

This is regarding the “performer”, being charged with an offence, NOT a business, or property owner. 

Also, PUBLIC PROPERTY is stipulated as an area of effect. Who owns public property? Who are they going to bring an offence against? Themselves, the government? No, of course not. The offence is given to THE INDIVIDUAL “PERFORMER”. This legislation makes it possible to EXTEND the responsibility, for the offence, to property owners, allowing them to be charged/fined/sentenced, AS WELL AS any individual “performers”.

The primary offence is on the “performer”, themselves.

If not specifically codified in this particular bill, believe that other presiding bills have already laid out the legal consequences for the person considered to be the “performer”. I do not have all the specifics off the top of my head, and I don’t have the time to take this explanation further. You will find it, if you look for it. Being able to charge the property owner for an illegal performance, is not possible without the performance having been already made illegal, & consequences & proceedings for the initiating individual already being in existence.

So, combine this information, with my initial response, & begin to see how dangerous & discriminatory this law would be… 🤷🏻‍♀️ Hopefully…?
me neither and I’m gearing up to be able to flee if it happens
We’re mostly just venting and showing the illogic of the bill. The idea is to overwhelm the system with reports against conservative people they have to abandon the law. But I’m reality we know they’ll just ignore these and only prosecute people they know are trans, no matter how many false reports we flood them with.
Yeah it seems like these laws are focused on the vulnerable trans folks still In awkward phases of transition. The right is clueless about how many of us will look like cross-dressers if we dress according who our AGAB.
They're trying to ban men from wearing traditionally women's clothing

With that logic, women wearing traditionally men's othibg should also get in trouble

It's just to maliciously comply with them
No doubt. But a shittonne of reports, considered legitimate according to the vaguely worded law, could potentially get it repealed. It’s been done before.
Most likely long enough that it will be struck down.
What does sine die mean?
Their predecessors from the 80s (and maybe themselves if old enough) were diametrically opposed to using this song or anything else vaguely metal because of the Satanic Panic. And men in 80s metal bands were often made fun of for being ""femme"" or suspected of being gay or just sexual deviants.  The language that we have today to describe gender variance pretty much didn't exist, but take a look at bands like Poison and other glam metal bands (including TS, actually).  These are all cis men who didn't  cross dress outside of performances or videos,  but that slight amount of gender bending style was enough to implode the brains of most of the conservatives back then.  

Tl;Dr I can't fucking believe any of them are using that song for their campaigns.  Dee Snider and whoever else is left of Twisted Sister should sue the fuck out of them.  Ridiculous fucking people. 

Edit: i guess the whole thing where he said to stop playing that song already happened.
Nah because they are so racist that they wouldn't want their wives looking like ""terrorists""
And show them the portrait of Louis XIV (14th) in his red-soled high heels!

I believe it was the Persians(?) who either pioneered the use or at least popularised them for cavalry use, I could be wrong.
Thanks :)
I didn’t know about that law
Oh yeah I really wouldn't be surprised if they start passing laws that don't allow women to work especially considering all of the laws they've been trying to pass banning abortions and allowing forced pregnancies during literally any circumstance and any age
Seriously? I can't say I'm surprised but fucking hell. Do you have a source or anywhere I can read more about this?
I need a source to show my family.
100% agree with you, they are not going to stop if this continues
It will almost certainly pass. There is no doubt in my mind 😞
i understand that. I'll be fighting with you guys until the end tho. stay strong. i know its hard. but they want us dead and we should stay alive even if solely to spite them
absolutely. they dont understand the nuances and facts of it. they know the caricature of a trans person that these right wingers have made up and then decided to blame for everything, subsequently catching real trans people in the crossfire. no we have to deal with the repercussions of some fake radical groomer trans person that they made up who doesn't even exist
I get what this is about but no judge is going to consider pants for women to be traditional mens clothing in 2023.
“Without a day”

It means the session is over for good.
No, you're right, it was first the Persians as far as I know.

My first time seeing a man in heels was with the Swedish band ABBA. ABBA is awesome.
In theory suits should still work. That's only a past-decade sort of thing for the most part. Sure it's been worn before that and it's gained popularity since, but by no means is it traditional
You're missing the broader picture and thus the point. It's not about actually having a judge decide on these, it's about flooding the system with reports to drown out any actual reports submitted by transphobes. They won't have the resources to investigate every single one, at least not in a timely manner.
By their logic they have too but idk

I'm not American so woo
They are.

first man in heels for me was Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like it Hot"""	12hw16y	trans	1690	0.98	2023-04-10 20:59:15
I just found out my trans friend’s deadname, should I tell him that?	"My Friend [16FTM] is a trans man. I met him while he was transitioning and I never knew his deadname, and in out of respect, since I met him, I never tried to find out. I never looked through the yearbook, I never looked through his instagram comments, I just always knew him by his preferred name, and wanted it to stay that way. 

But yesterday after he got off work, I was on the phone with him and his mom started lecturing him, and his mom isn’t all that supportive of trans people, so she deadnamed him. I immediately hung up afterwards because I didn’t want to find out anything else, but I now know something I’ve been trying my best to not find out. 

What is the best course of action, should I tell him that that I now know, or should I just not and pretend I never heard. I am sking you guys because I am not trans, I am a CisHet male who still has a lot to learn about trans people, and I am hoping you guys can help me. 

P.S: This person suffers from gender dysphoria"	"If you know a trans person's deadname ***no you don't.***
put that knowledge into a box, burn it, scatter the ashes and forget it.
thank you for asking and for being supportive. don't say it, don't mention it. if he wants to talk about it he will start this conversation first. it's not your fault, you don't have to actively hide the fact that you heard it or lie that you don't know it, but still, just don't mention it.
No say nothing pretend you never heard anything.
Nope. Your friend changed their name for a reason, because they don't feel they identify as the person that name is associated with. If they ever told you it, then it might be okay to mention you knew it. Otherwise don't say anything.
do your best to just forget it. it's not his name anyway, it's a random name that doesn't belong to him.
Ignore it, its just the devil trying to get you to hell by giving you wrong knowlege, this isnt even a deadname, cause it never existed!
Burn this down to the ground, let it burn into ash and wip this wrong knowlege out of existence!!!
Don't tell him. What would that even accomplish? More likely than not, he'll just feel shitty that you know and wonder if you're thinking of him with his deadname. Just don't say it and don't bring it up.
“You forget a thousand things every day, pal. Make sure this is one of them.”

-Michael de Santa, GTA V
No, that name does not belong to him. That's It. And that info Is just useless.
Three times Ive found out a dead name due to mail being left out or finding some old mail. Three times I’ve gone and forgotten the name again. Easily. Don’t speak it into existence. Don’t acknowledge it to your friend.
Don't, just keep it to yourself. 

Pretend you never heard it
If you learned a married woman’s maiden name, would you bring it up (outside of wondering if you’re related cause your family also has Jingleheimerschmits in it)?
Simply knowing it isn't a crime, just dont call them their deadname and your good.
No don’t tell him
I have met trans people and I only call them by the name they give me. Whatever name I find to be their deadname you just have to let go.
what name? you didnt hear a name
It's called deadname for a reason. Let it rest, it has no place in that person's life anymore. I'm not sure what you think you'd get from letting them know you know about it either. It's useless knowledge.
Aa a trans man, I would never want my friends to repeat my deadname to me. Just bury that shit and burn it, bro.
I wouldn’t say anything, you will absolutely trigger his gender dysphoria if you do
pretend it never happened, it might give him more anxiety if he knows you heard it. a lot of the time, if somebody doesn't tell you things like that they probably would prefer if you didn't know.
No. Not only is it an utter waste of breath, it would also be downright rude to bring it up with him.
Knowing his deadname isn’t much different than knowing he has a deadname. Doesn’t really matter nor change anything. 

If it seems especially relevant, sure, tell him. But, more likely than not, it isn’t relevant and thus isn’t worth discussing.
pretend thet name was a reference to someone else. as soon as you know a deadname you ignore it, don't aknowledge it, it doesn't have any significance at all, as far as you're concerned You Do Not Know It! just keep calling him his name and you're good to go
Don’t address the name. Tell him you heard his mom go off and ask if he’s ok. Let him bring it up if he needs to. Put aside his prior identity, and imagine he were a cis guy. Imagine the dead name was a slur, like calling him a bitch. That’s basically what this was. You didn’t hear his name, you heard an insult. 

I’m kind of a bit on the gruffer side, so I’d say stuff like:
“Dude, are you ok? I heard your mom go off on you. That’s not right.”
Or
“Your moms a bitch. You ok?”

Don’t bring up the name. That’s not part of them anymore. It’s just a slur and slurs don’t belong in our minds with our friends faces. It sounds like you’re concerned about him which is the only reason I’m telling you to bring up the incident. You’ll get more comfortable navigating these things as you go. 

You’re doing a good a job, my man. You’ve got a good heart and your friend is lucky to have you. 

(Dunno if this matters but I’m FTM)
No you don’t. You don’t know his deadname. You. Do. Not. Know. His. Deadname. Don’t bring it up, don’t talk about it, don’t even mention it.
Please do not do this! Dysphoria is a really cruel thing to live through. I recently had to use my dead name, and I was sick all day afterword.
keep asking yourself if you're even sure you heard it or if it might have been another name. ask yourself with as many different names as possible and imagine her saying them all the same way it originally sounded when you heard it in your head. you will forget
Nope, as far as you should be concerned you don’t know it at all 👍🏽
Telling him won’t make things any better, only worse, him knowing you know won’t be helpful so I’d just try your best to forget it
Yeah you’re better off not mentioning it. He’s probably worried you heard it on the phone so just try to forget about it
You never found out. Erase it from your memory
Unless it is to inform him that its somewhere people can see, you should forget it
I agree with the consensus here. Dead name stays dead and buried.
No. It's not your fault that it happened, so no shame against you here, but you overheard something that's ultimately not your business, so you should just forget about it and not bring it up.
So here’s a story which answers your question : one of my best friends is a trans girl, and me too. She once showed me a message her father sent her because she was happy he tried to understand her. In this message, his father, by lack of knowledge, said something like “now I know I must not call you [deadname], how should I call you ?”. She didn’t give a shit about the fact I knew her deadname. The funny and best part is that my memory is really bad, and I just totally forgot her deadname. The reason is simple : I don’t care about her deadname, and my memory isn’t good with things I care about but way worse for things I don’t care. 

Point is : your friend doesn’t want to know that you know how he were once forced to be called. So the solution is simple : you continue simply using his name. For his deadname, you take this memory, you put it in a box, and you throw it away. Your friend really doesn’t need to know you know this name that is only hurtful for him. 

Also, you’re a great friend. I like how you are being cautious to not do anything wrong. You’re really the kind of cishet friend I would like !
Don’t say anything
Don’t tell him
My friend is also a trans man [FTM]. I knew them before their transition. I was the last of the friend group to know about it. I came back from school after a summer of not having my phone or social media and it was math class.

My friend came back looking different, they had just started transitioning and they had a little bit of a voice change. I was shocked, didn’t know what was going on. 

We were in math class together and looked and saw their new name on a worksheet.

I looked up at them and said, “Hey [new name] I missed you a lot over the summer!”

I switched the names in my mind, never brought up their transition and still continued to be their friend. 

Just be their friend.
When my gf and i started dating she changed her name, and i haven't mistaken once. Even though the deadname still appears in all her legal documents i don't wanna call her in a name that she doesn't like. And also i like the new name too much hehe
I mean it's completely irrelevant to him now so I don't really think it matters
Also, don’t tell anyone else. It’s not him. It shouldn’t be associated with him. Do what you need to do to unassociate it in your mind.
Best not to tell him
No. Absolutely not.
No you don’t mention it. It’s a deadname which means it no longer exists to him. That part of him is no longer in existence.
Forget that name, best thing you can do
It’s ok that you know his dead name but don’t use it; never ever.  Also, he probably knows you heard it over the phone so you don’t really need to need to tell him anything. I’m sorry this has caused you so much anxiety.  This is a good place to talk about it and get it off your chest.
Why would you say it and potentially trigger something for someone? What would you get from telling them you know?
Use a memory ray and forget it as fast as possible. You heard nothing, you know nothing.
An old friend of mine was out as trans in high school, and he made some new friends that all saw him as a guy and called him his preferred name.  Eventually, one of his friends found out his dead name and said “I didn’t know your real name was xxx” and he was so upset by it.  She misgenders him a lot now even though she’s always known him as a guy, but the point is that a deadname is supposed to stay dead.  If you find it, then forget it because it’s not their name anymore and it doesn’t really matter.
Take the dead name, put it in a mental safe, tie that mental safe in industrial grade rope, attach a reinforced chain around it, lock that chain up with a mental lock that will make the lockpicking lawyer blush, attach an anchor to it, and then drop it into the deep abyss of your subconscious never to be seen again.
Please don't tell him. You never heard it and that never happened.
NO
I hate my deadname I changed it for a reason never want to hear it xx
Don't tell him. Pretend you don't know
Here's my advice;

Play a game with yourself. See how well you can overwrite their name and forget it. Every time I hear a deadname I tend to run the reel out so I overwrite the moment (I guess trauma is at least able to inform us in a positive way; yay dissociation!) so I can secretly take pride in not knowing.

Anyways.
You never heard that name. You did hear their mom's attitude though and can be supportive of their need to have people in their lives who care and are not judgemental of them.
pretend you never heard it and continue as you always did. You never heard it, it never happened. It’s not his name
Unless they specifically told you what their deadname is (do not ask for it) you don’t know it.
Say nothing. If you for some reason slip you can say something then, but otherwise you heard nothing and as far as you’re concerned his name is the only one he’s ever had.

I don’t mean that as any kind of offense, even if I sound hostile. Seriously, thank you for being concerned enough about what you should do to ask
It's not his name, just forget about it
 If someone came up to me and says ""wasn't your name hannah?"" I'd feel very uncomfortable. 

(My deadname isnt hannah, just a generic name for arguments sake)
NO. Bury this name in your subconscious and never ever ever acknowledge it. It’s called deadname for a reason.
Accidentally hearing someone’s deadname is like accidentally seeing your bff naked-it’s too personal and invasive to bother keeping around in your head…
No. If they haven’t told you, then there’s a reason. You’re better off acting like you didn’t hear it unless they ask you. I’m that case, I would be honest and say that you just happened to hear on the phone and you still see them as their true name.
You heard nothing and you rember nothin atleast in this matter you dont
You don't need to tell him anything because you didn't hear anything 🤷‍♀️
I genuinely don't understand the comments. If someone I cared about knew my deadname I'd want to know and I'd be upset if years later I found out they knew the entire time when I assumed they didn't.
All of the sudden, you couldn't hear right there and then!
If you see a person's dead name. **No you didn't!**
Ok some of the comments here don’t pass the vibe check. I agree with the majority who are saying not to bring it up and to continue to think of your friend using the name he uses. At the same time I just want to affirm that it’s not your fault you heard this information! I hear your fear that you will use the wrong name — that’s a valid fear! You know that using the wrong name would hurt your friend’s feelings and you don’t want to do that. It’s okay to be afraid of hurting your friend’s feelings. Now how about you focus on how much you care about him and want him to feel well? Practice using his correct name by saying phrases like “I respect x” “x is a friend I care about” “I’m grateful to be friends with x” and smile! Simple let yourself continue to see him in the way he wants to be seen. 

And if you do mess up, say sorry, correct yourself, move on, and forgive yourself. We’re all human and torturing yourself about an honest mistake doesn’t help anyone. Go easy on yourself and try your best because your care about your friend.
What deadname idk about no deadname
I found my friends deadname, but forgot it after 5min because im bad with names
Don’t tell him, don’t use it. Lock that word in a crate and slingshot it into the sun. 

Also; your approach was super good, and I wish all CisHet people would go about these things like you’ve just done.
It's dead for a reason. Let it die.
No. Forget it. You don’t know it you never did. Don’t tell them don’t tell anyone.
Keep it secret. Keep it safe.
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT, it's better off to just ignore it
Roofie yourself so you forget it.
Why would you care or mention it?  So weird.  If you heard my maiden name, would you tell me?  Why don’t you understand that his name IS HIS NAME.  It’s simple. If you referred to me by the name I had before I got married 20 years ago, I’d be confused and ignore you.
Why? 

Sounds like you want to blackmail him.

Just store it with all the other useless information in your head. Like why popcorn are called popcorn and how to make a lightning rod out of paper. That stuff is put to use when dementia comes a knocking.
If the Mum had called him “sh!tbag” would you be worried about calling him that?

I’d view it as a term of disrespect rather than their old name. And then move on, you’ve always known him as whatever his name is. Continue!
Absolutely fucking NOT.

I'd get rid of you so fast as a friend your head wouldn't have time to spin.
This kinda makes me sad. 

Thanks for checking in cis dude, but maybe more empathy towards your friend who suffers from dysphoria, an unsupportive family, and being hung up on mid convo.

Ya know, being a friend and an ally. A ***gigantic*** apology is in order from you hanging up on them because *you* were uncomfortable. I can only imagine how horrible your friend felt.

It’s very difficult to read this and ignore the immense power imbalance. Power ignorance? Power apathy?
Dude no Idc if your a cishet male you should still have the common sense to know that this is the dumbest thing you can do. If you do this I hope your friend goes non contact with you because in my opinion that's just plane toxic
In this ocasion I think it's best if you just completely ignore his deadname/forget about it
Don’t do anything and stop thinking/stressing about it. If he wants to talk about it he’ll bring it up. Otherwise there’s zero reason to have a conversation about it (it’s useless info really).
I’d only tell him if he’s under the impression that his mom is using his real name. Otherwise just leave it.
Don't bring it up, don't say it, put it in a box and burn it.

If the subject ever comes up and they are the ones to bring it up, then you can mention ""Oh, I think I knew that but it doesn't matter now.""
Don’t ask, don’t mention it. Not all trans folks want the dead name known or discussed. It’s dead to them.
The first rule of deadnames is that there are no deadnames! Seriously, there is nothing good that will come out of mentioning it.
Never ever say it. It’s not his name, so don’t address him with it.
Personally, i think i would appreciate knowing how you reacted and that you understood how it could make him feel, and just try to be supportive and tell them you understand their pain.
Just forget about it. You will never need to use it if you are good friend. Never mention it again for the sake of friendship.
just ignore it and pretend it didn't happen!!!! if he is concerned you heard something on the phone and/or wants to discuss it with you, HE will start the conversation. it is SO SO uncomfy knowing someone's deadname, i've been there. but the ultimate goal is to keep the person as comfortable and affirmed as possible and the best way to do that is to just continue using their chosen name and pronouns just like you always have!!

Fuck no
A lot of people have no idea what my dead name is and some people still call me it sadly but me personally I could care less other people may not like that
If he asks you if you know just say yes and do not use it. If he never brings it up, you never bring it up! That name doesn’t exist to you only the preferred.
No
dont say anything, just pretend you dont know it, and slowly forget it
Nope. It's not his name anymore. Just forget about it
just don't mention it and act like you dont know
The name should be dead to you too.
literally just. *forget*. ofc it's not that easy, but do not bring it up and do not use it. lock that shit in a safe, chuck it into the deepest pits of your memory, and destroy the key.

thanks for asking btw dude!
Don’t tell them and just forget about it. All that info is going to do is make your friend sad and make you stressed so tbh just pretend like you never saw it and eventually you’ll forget
NOPE forget the name, like it never existed. Don’t bring up a past he doesn’t want to exists anymore.
If you want to tell him you know his dead name it's okay. When he ask how his dead name is you can tell him but if he not ask forget his dead name
Yeah, just never use it. I don't entirely get why you'd be afraid of accidentally using his deadname. How long have you known him vs how long have you known is deadname. If youve been using is actual name for way longer than you've known his deadname, surely it would be easy to never deadname him?
I can't stress this enough, but don't ever say it and don't tell it to ANYONE ELSE. I don't care if you think you're being funny or relatable or supportive, you NEVER HEARD THAT NAME.  


I can't tell you the amount of times some cis person thinks they're supporting me by telling me the deadname of their one trans friend. It's always like ""Oh she transitioned but she used to be \[deadname\] and now she's \[name\]"" like DONT FUCKING DO THIS. WE DONT WANNA KNOW.
Don’t let him know, honestly if he was deadnamed over the phone he probably knows you know. You’d be a good friend for not mentioning it at all really.
Absolutely not. Pretend you didn’t hear, never think of it.

There’s no need to mention it *ever* without their permission.
if he didn’t tell you he doesn’t want you to know, don’t bring it up and just like do your best to forget it. I saw you were worried about accidentally saying it because you’ve been thinking about it and I have an idea of something that might help. (this is gonna be dumb so like ignore it if you don’t want to) but like maybe use that name on an inanimate object, name your favorite plate or something this dead name and then you’ll associate that name with the plate rather than your friend but like no one would talk about their plate by name so there’s no chance you’ll talk about it in any other context. Idk that’s just something that works for me to stop associating things with a certain person
I wouldn’t mention it unless HE mentions it. If he’s like, “oh hey sorry my mom said my deadname on call” then you can be like oh it’s cool you’re *whatever their name is* yk? Just keep being supportive and good luck with the rest of your endeavors
Ok so I'm cishet too and might not understand something but why tf would you bring it up? Like... who cares? You'll just make him upset with no reason. Just pretend you didn't hear anything and forget about it. Don't associate him with his deadname obviously. Just. Forget. It's useless information.
Leave it buried where it belongs
No you shouldn't. No need to tell him, no need to remember it. If he asks you about it, you should tell the truth but (I think) it'd be comforting to say that you don't care. Anyways, you sound like a good friend.
I believe the best course of action is to just not bring it up. Just still call them they're preferred name! I cannot really think of a time it would be important to know their dead name unless its an emergency (Ex. Friend gone missing) and the friend hasn't had it legally changed yet, so just leave it be! :)
Absolutely do not. I’ve read you’d aging that you’re afraid you might say it— just don’t. Forget the information; it never happened.
Unless he asks you if you heard it, just leave it be.
You do not know his deadname, he has only ever had the name he told you, and you burn that knowledge and scatter the ashes, hon. 🔥 You're a good friend.
Why would you tell him?
I see nothing beneficial to gain from telling him, and it might give him anxiety knowing that more people know than he thought. I'd say keep it to yourself.
i mean, if its really bothering you, you can just say ""hey your mom deadnamed you over the phone the other day."" and follow it up w/ smth like ""what a dick!"" 

otherwise, its not that big a deal. its like finding out your teacher's last name changed because they got married. not that riveting.
The best thing you can do is support live name as much as you can, but let live name know you feel awful having heard (but do not use dead name) and let live name know you have his back. Also there are TikTok people who will be his mom I forget the clock app person off hand but the white woman’s live name’s son’s name is John. Maybe someone else knows who I am referring to? Follow her and have live name follow too. That is such a supportive person.
completely forget that information
burn it
if you remember/find out again, repeat the process
do not tell them. If they do not know that you know, don’t tell him. it’s rude to just say ‘hey, i found out wha your ‘girl name’ was’
So what you are asking is if you should subject your friend to emotional, psychological, and mental abuse....or be a decent human and not mention thier dead name and forget it fully
There's no need to let him know that you know. The deadname doesn't mean anything or will cause dysphoria. Basically a dead name feels like a name a bully would call u in school. U wouldn't want ppl to remember or know that. Just telling you to prevent an awkward situation and put it in perspective lol
Tell him where you heard it, but NEVER say it
just don’t bring it up. it’s not his name anymore, so don’t remind him that it ever was.
It sounds to me based on your other comments that you’re fixating on the fact that you know something you shouldn’t, and are therefore worried that because you’re fixating on it, you’re not going to be able to forget about it and you’re going to end up accidentally using it and hurting your friend.

Which is a very understandable concern, and I’m glad you’re supporting your friend! You sound like a really good kid. 

Try not to treat it like a big deal in your mind, because ultimately, it’s not. It’s just a name that they isn’t theirs anymore. Treat it with the same gravity as if you found out that your friend used to have a different hair color before they met you. You’d probably go huh, didn’t know that before, and then shrug and move on and probably forget all about it. You’ve done nothing wrong, it’s not your fault that you found out, and if you make an effort to remember their current name, the old name probably isn’t really going to stick in your head long term. You’ll be fine, just keep doing what you’re doing, and if you do slip up just apologize and move on.
Don’t. At all.
You are an awesome friend for trying to figure out the best way to go about this! Pretend you never learned. Try to forget if you can. In the community, it's generally understood it's bound to happen that someone may find your dead name. But it's a ""Pretend you didn't"" thing. I always joke and say ""I suddenly can't see/hear anymore"" and distract myself until the deadnaming is over with.
You never knew them as that name so I dont see why it would be hard.
Nope, not now, not later, not ever.
No, it’ll probably just make them uncomfortable because that’s not their name, that’s their deadname
Short answer: No.
i don't think you should mention that you heard his deadname. it's not like it's secret knowledge, but i think bringing it up would just make him uncomfortable. You could ask about if the situation with his mom is okay because you heard her on the phone if youre worried about him, but i don't see a reason to tell him ""by the way i know your deadname""
Don't tell him you heard it. If you do, he will forever know that you know possibly one of the most painful and vulnerable secrets he probably has. I'm not gonna tell you to forget the deadname because I feel like thats out of your control.

But do not ever call him that. Especially given that you never knew him as that, slipping up and calling him that would reveal that that's what you (subconsciously i guess) consider to be his ""true"" name. Plus it would be horrible for him to find out you knew because you messed up and used it..... so if you think you're at risk of slipping up (somehow even though you never knew him by that name..) then perhaps it is better to warn him that you heard. Idk.
It’s a dead name leave it buried
This is a secret that must stay with you forever
You dont know his deadname it never happened and it should never be mentioned.  it wont help him and can only cause hurt. Don't hide this if asked but don't initiate that conversation. You're not in the wrong and the fact you asked clearly makes you an ally great job :). If someone found my deadname and told me that i'd be upset but not because they found it but because they told me.
You sound like a great friend- just think of it as useless knowledge. Something like a social security number but less useful. And breathe and move on. He’s not that person and knowing that about him doesn’t make him that person to you. I actually just experienced this (as a trans person) with another trans friend. I simply moved on and I don’t even remember the name anymore. Even if you did it’s ok you sound like an amazing friend.
Birth names are arbitrary anyway. They are given to us before we are even known as people in general. Think of those people that have names but you look at them and you are like, “ but you don’t look like a Gerald. You look more like a Dax”

Forget what you heard and never speak of it.
prolly not. this isnt very useful knowledge unless you're going on a time trip, so might as well forget this happened
No, if they didn’t tell you their name then there’s no reason to bring it up. Just keep it in a box and leave it there.
See the positive. Now you know which name to avoid mentioning near them even if not directly addressing them.
Burn that from your memory having your friend hear from you could be very hurtful to him
No. Put that knowledge in the depths of Tartarus. Never speak of it. If you can, just block out the memory. In this case, it's ok not to say anything.
Off topic but W fucking friend (coming from a ftm that wishes he had more supportive friends)
no. you address him as his chosen name, thats it. Bringing up a deadname will just be an awkward experience bc what do you want him to say? “oh congratulations for digging up my past!” ?? maybe a decent comparison is like finding out someone used to have really bad cystic acne and you’re like “hey i saw a picture of you and you had really bad acne!” like….yes….now i dont. and you asking has nothing to do with advice for yourself bc you have always had clear skin. its just unnecessary. He is now male, no need to remind him of what he was. he’s fully aware
I seriously don’t even remember or recognize my friends dead names I’ve known, when you don’t recognize like their name, which it isn’t, it simply faded away
A very similar situation happened to me with this and I just pretended like I never found out. Best way to handle this.
Since you got to know him by his real name and is used to calling him that name, you should have an easy time forgetting a dead alias. 

I don’t even remember my internet friend’s real name even though they told me once before because I only know them as their username.
You don't know it. The second you stop worrying about if you should tell them, the easier it is to forget. I hardly remember my girlfriend's deadname, and I only know my bf's to pick up his prescriptions and help schedule doc appointments.
There’s no reason to mention you know it, and sure as hell not to use it. But think of it as a “shed name” that is no longer useful like a snake’s molted skin, and not a “deadname” per se. Your friend is very much still alive when countless young trans men and women, especially those of color don’t make it to age 16 or much beyond.

I know a lot of people use the term deadname as a noun (or verb) and it is absolutely terrible when we have actual murdered trans people and those succumbing to their own demons every single day.
DEADname. It's dead. You don't know it!!!!
It’s a deadname for a reason! It’s dead and his preferred name is just his name. Put that name out of your mind and forget it!
I am going to tell you what I would do.

So, I would tell him what happened, but never mention his deadname. Just sincerely tell him how the situation went and let him know that you feel bad about that and would prefer that never happened. Then I would keep being his friend and treating him nice, respecting who he really is.
If I were you I’d just pretend not to know. 

Deadnaming sucks but once it happens you can’t really do anything about it except move on. Lingering on it is just painful and unproductive.
You can just ignore the fact that you know it. Don't bring it up, he probably knows you heard it, but you should just act like you don't. That's what I would have wanted you to do if I was him.
If he doesn't bring up the incident don't bring it up. If he does be supportive and never call him it as that's not his name. You might be one of his only support systems so just stay thoughtful in what you do or say.
you don't know his deadname, that never happened
Here's the thing if it was someone behind his back you should absolutely inform him that someone is doing that without his consent. Given that it's his mom he knows she's not going to stop. So the best course if action is to just go on as if you never found out.
You can just say you accidentally overheard. It sucks but happens. You’re his friend, and I’m sure it goes without saying you’d never use his deadname.

That said, you don’t have to say anything either. I mean if he brings it up at some point or confides in you their deadname then yeah. But personally, if you know they don’t even like the knowledge of their deadname being heard, I wouldn’t recommend saying anything. 

To avoid this in the future, tell your friend if his mom starts getting on him to just hang up themselves. That sometimes his mom says some hurtful things that you don’t like listening too, after all nobody likes listening too friends argue with their mom, it’s awkward. This ensures it doesn’t happen to anyone else in the future so his deadname doesn’t get leaked further.

I appreciate your concern too. I know you must feel a bit guilty. Don’t be too hard on yourself. He’s your friend. I’m certain he knows even if you found out accidentally, you still wouldn’t use his deadname. It’s the mom to blame. She knows his deadname and explicitly using it hurtfully. You did nothing wrong.
Nice of you to ask here but yeah no, you just never think about it again. Sometimes you learn deadnames by accident, it happens all the time. But when it does; you take that knowledge, crumple it up, and throw it in a fire. He doesn’t need to know because thinking about it will just bum him out
No. Just No. Act like  you Never Heard it
Deadnames are such cursed knowledge lol. I think view it as if the mum just got their name mixed up with someone else. It can become an intrusive thought because you're so focused on not fucking up, but you won't slip up. Just chill and keep using their name and you'll be fine.
don’t tell him
The name is dead for a reason. There's no excuse to bring it up.
No
It would be rude if you tell It. Please keep it for you.
No? It’s not his name
Just never point out you know if and try to forget it.
What?!
Put it in a locked box. Put that it a large chest with other things. Burn the chest. Get the ashes. Go dump them in the closest ocean.
First, I want to say thanks, you seem like a really cool person, and yay for asking. 

&#x200B;

You definitely should just try and wipe the memory from your brain, and go along with your life. Bringing it up to your friend might make him uncomfortable, and sad.
It sounds like you need to be more of a friend. Have a conversation with them, let them know you heard more than you wanted to but can feel his pain still support them. He doesn’t have the support from home he needs. Just let him know you are his bro, the past shapes and molds us but does not define him.
I encourage asking yourself why you feel the need to tell him? 

If the reason you want to tell him is you feel uncomfortable withholding this information from him, you can do that. You don’t have to bring up his dead name, just tell him hey, I overheard this conversation and they brought up your dead name, it made me uncomfortable and I didn’t want to feel like I was hiding this information from you which is why I’m bringing it up. Keep the focus on you feeling uncomfortable knowing information about him that he would prefer you didn’t. There’s nothing wrong with us, as it shows you care about this person and their privacy.

If you want to bring it up with him because you are curious about any aspect of some thing, i’d encourage you let it go to the side. Bringing up someone’s dead name solely for the purpose of being curious about it I would Akin to asking a burn victim how they got their scars. Some may be willing to tell you, some may not find it a big deal, every time however, it’s rude to ask.
K pretend you didn't know. He most likely doesn't want to be reminded that he's trans. I wouldn't want that, it would throw me into so much depression I would actually take drastic measures which would lead to panic attacks that would be dangerous for me. Please don't chance it if your his friend. Treat him like a regular human instead of trans because it can make a person feel like a freak people point fingers at.
He knows you know it and the best thing you can do for him is to keep calling him by his name, without saying anything about what you heard. He probably just wants to forget that day. I'm sure it'll also make him happy that someone who's heard his deadname keeps calling him by his name.
>I just not and pretend I never heard

You already know the answer.
If he asks you you should be honest but otherwise just don't mention it.
I don’t think there’s really a need to tell him, i cant speak for him but in my mind its not too big of a deal, most my friends know my deadname and it doesn’t bother me that they know so long as they never use it, it would probably just make me uncomfortable if they brought my deadname up. just try ur best to forget about it! and I think your doing a great job as an ally! thanks for trying to learn more!
Ah, so like if I see someone stealing food, which I never will see.
If someone was maliciously telling people my deadname I'd want to know. Other than that, yeah. You don't know it.
I recently met a trans girl friend. She invited me to play online games and we played two games with one of her older acquaintances and, I can only assume, she hasn't told him yet, so I awkwardly kept listening her deadname.

I did not elaborate on the matter with her later. It's her own process and, that also, I apply that rule. I listened but **that's not her name. Period.**
Happy Cake day also yes I agree
Exactly.
As someone who is trans, there is no point in telling them anyways. Its not thier name and would only cause harm. Besides, they props rather no know if you do know thier deadname or not, like Booji-Boy said.
Happy Cake Day
Best reply! Also - happy cake day 🍰
*slams table* YES
It’s just like if you see someone camping in a tent to survive; no you didn’t.
Keep it secret. Keep it safe.
Happened to me recently as well, would have preferred my friend didn’t let me know. 

It’s not a real name, it deserves no power or attention. You’re friend is simply who he is and not who he was pretending to be.
this
Happy Cake day
Honestly if you're bad at names you'll eventually just forget. I saw my ex's deadname once and I legit can not remember what it was, like not even the letter it started with or anything. The only friend whose deadname I remember is because I called him that for like 3 years before he started transitioning.
I wouldn’t say burn it just in case someone tries to use it against them or you end up seeing posts or  articles using their deadname. I think that’s probably one of the more fair reasons especially if it’s an issue of identity theft Like you see someone trying to use a credit card/ create a profile etc underneath the dead name. I have seen it happen with divorces when they’ve changed their name back their name back to the maiden one. Obviously OP is not in this situation but just important to be aware of and another thing that makes transitioning hard
Ok! but I’m worried I might accidentally say it, it’s been on my mind ever since I found out. what is the best way to refrain from saying it?
^^^
It did exist. It has just changed. That’s how I view deadnames
Not out of the blue for no reason, but I certainly wouldn't be spending anytime sweating worrying about it, but say I recognize the last name and had friends with the same last name or something I would feel no issue whatsoever with asking whether they know the people or whatever, I mean why the heck not it's just their maiden name. I think maybe on this one for you, it was a bad example to compare to.

Honestly though and I see this quite often post after post about how it's just a name & has 0 power over you yet people are literally quaking in their boots at the mere thought of slipping up and mentioning it, don't know about you but that sounds like power to me!
Apples to oranges, but a way to think of this just to drive home how unimportant it is:

Imagine you have a friend that went through a divorce before your friendship. Now imagine you stumble across what their last name was during that now-over marriage. 

Would you bring up the new finding? 

Like, “hey I know your last name from your last marriage!”

No. You probably wouldn’t. 
What’s the point of it? 

Now clearly this isn’t the same thing. But it’s kinda just a pointless little factoid. Not relevant, important, or worth discussing. 

Unless, of course, they bring it up for some reason.
You pass the vibe check.
I don’t understand why youre mad at OP, they arent being disrespectful at all and they asked a genuine question? Im trans ftm, and i can understand not knowing if you should tell someone that you know it. I agree that i wouldnt like to know/care if someone knew my deadname, but be more respectful honestly.
What gives you the impression that I’m trying to blackmail him? I would never do that to him, did you not read my post or the part about me never trying to learn his dn?
I was just asking because i don’t know the best course of action 😭😭 but it’s fine, I understand where you’re coming from, and thank you!
I've never seen someone steal food before.
What the fuck are you smoking? People don’t steal food that doesn’t happen.
In this specific situation, would it be appropriate to ask how to talk to this third person about her?
She doesn't seem to be out to him so I think it would be best to ask how to proceed to avoid accidentally outing her / wrongly joining the dead naming by assuming either reasons.
Well I mean you did, but it's not a crime it's just a person who could use some help
 > Your friend is simply who he is and not who he was pretending to be.

I love this phrasing. What a perfect way to put it!
agree with the other person, best way is to drill in his correct name instead. try repeating phrases in your head with his name if you need to, like “X is a great guy, i’m glad he’s my friend” type stuff. like the general conversation in r/transtryouts if you need inspiration
Just.. don't say it? Idk think before you speak and get his actual name into your head so you don't say the wrong name
I totally get your fear, I'm trans and have trans friends all of whom I know their deadnames and sometimes they pop into my head like intrusive thoughts. just like intrusive thoughts try and chill and let it pass and think about their proper name instead. I wouldn't mention it to him as it might sound like you feel like you've learned his ""real name"" and overwritten the original name you knew him by with it, even though you haven't, you sound like a really great friend by the way!
Just don't say it.
I know a number of my trans friends' deadnames and that is of absolutely no relevance to me.

From your OP it appears as though you have never known that person before they transitioned and so that name has no tie to them or you. I'm not sure why you would associate that name with them now just because you know it suddenly.

But try to relax about this knowledge, it's nothing of importance to you or your relationship with them. It changes nothing, just carry on.
I had a similar experience right when I changed my name, I learned this girls deadname the first night I met her and was so afraid I’d not be able to stop thinking about it and deadname her. A week later, I had forgotten what it was and it wasn’t even an issue
I think it's unfair that you're being downvoted for this because I can relate to concerns like this: ""I could throw my keys down this cliff and be stranded here. Oh no, what if I really do it? I'm thinking about it too much, what if I lose control and throw them? Why do I feel the urge to do that, that'd be awful!""

Rest assured, thoughts like those happen to a lot of people. It's called ""The Call of the Void"" and AFAIK they're the brain trying to remind itself not to do something really stupid.
If you knew him first by his true name then why on earth would you think of him by his dead name? 

It’s one thing to slip up on that if you knew the person for years under their dead name. Totally doesn’t make sense if you never knew their dead name.

If you did that to me I’d be pissed off and likely not be your friend anymore.
Just think before speak its easy
how do you accidentally say their deadname after using their real name for so long??? thats so jarring to me
You met him with his current name. Why would knowing his dead name change that?
no don't do that :( be supportive but never mention that name to him, imagine your friend is cursed and if he hears his deadname it brings immesurable pain to them
The more you try not to think about it the more you are thinking about it. Just chill and there'll come a day when you realise you haven't thought about it and you're good.
that's like a white person being scared of saying the n-word, like you will not say it unless you want to. If your friend asks you, say you didn't hear
Why would you ever think of him by his deadname?  If you heard the maiden name of a teacher who had been married for decades, would you feel compelled to use it?  Your question is weird and very transphobic for someone who claims to be an ally.
Try not to think about it. Try to ignore it and hope you forget.
I don’t know why everyone downvoted you. It’s like the white elephant. If you aren’t supposed to think about it that’s all you can think about…I would say maybe try repeating his name over and over in your head until that’s all you think of when you think about him. It works for me when learning peoples’ names and it might work for this
Words that aren't part of your active vernacular don't come out of your mouth accidentally. It's like how if you have never said the n-word, you're not going to accidentally say it.

How likely you are to accidentally say your friend's deaname depends on how often you say it (and associate the name with your friend). If you never refer to your friend as his deadname or think of your friend as his deadname, it shouldn't be possible for you to slip up.
Why should you? It's not their name anymore. Do you call other people by random names as well?
No offence but if I were that dude I wouldn’t want you as a friend - you’re way too hung up on the trans aspect. He’s a man, move on.
*facepalm*
Dude wtf. Are you really an ally. I met someone who knew me by my preferred name but she then found out my deadbame and used it all of twice and I got so upset and dysphoric that I cut her out of my life and I have refused to go anywhere that she'll be since simh because it's not fair on me to be deadnamed by someone who shouldn't connect that name to me because they shouldn't even know it
Try and forget it. If you can't try and make it seem like that name belongs to a different person. Do not call him that
To be clear, do you mean you're scared of accidentally telling him you know his deadname or accidentally calling him by his deadname?
It's kinda silly. I bet you don't call any of the famous people you know by their ""dead"" names, or anyone whose changed their name, anyone who has gotten married and changed their name.

It's not a ""deadname"". It's a name people used to call him. It's not his name, so why would you call him it? Like it's pretty silly.
if you are really concerned about saying it on accident, you could try to pretend to talk to him out loud as practice. stuff like “name is my friend. name is 16. Name and I hung out recently.” I did this to practice not saying “dude” “bro” and “man” when my friend came out as a girl.
He is X name now and he was when you met him. His name is the same. The previous name was another person.
Then don't! Literally end of.
Why the fuck you are thinking it? It's not your friend's name. 

And just don't say it. I example have seen nudes of people I shouldn't have, I have found porn collection of persons I wasn't supposed to, I have heard stuff that wasn't meant to me to hear. Not a single one of those persons know that and I have never accidentaly said anything about those things to them. Just don't say it. Not that hard.
My fiancé's family deadnamed me once or twice when they found out, even after I introduced them to me and they knew me as Jamie. It's hard to not think about it, so I won't say to do that, but remind yourself of your friend's name whenever you'd think of their deadname. Just remind yourself ""they're called [name] not [deadname], they don't use that name.""
Just keep reminding yourself and being a good friend.
I'm sorry you got downvoted for this. That type of anxiety can be a real issue, especially for younger people.

I recommend learning to work through the anxiety. This could be a good opportunity for you. Are you afraid of something, or is it guilt you're dealing with? If you're scared, what are you afraid of? If you feel guilty, remember that you're innocent in that situation. It's not your fault you overheard something.

Do you often get intrusive thoughts about things you know you shouldn't do? I know I have this issue--I used to think it was me being evil, but now I see it as my brain reminding me of things that I don't want to happen. Studies have found that when people stand next to cliffs, they often get intrusive thoughts about jumping off, even if they're not suicidal. It's not because they want to jump off; in fact, it's theorized that this is an adaptive response brains use to get people to move *away* from cliffs.

As an adult, my intrusive thoughts have calmed down and now they're about more likely things--like, ""hey, that cake I put on a ledge might fall off and that would be really bad maybe we should move it"" rather than ""hey what if you had a ridiculous Disney-esque fall sequence and accidentally knocked over all the hospital machines and they got unplugged and all the patients died"" or something improbable like that.

You're not actually likely to blurt out your friend's deadname out of nowhere--unless you convince yourself that you *are*. If those kinds of intrusive thoughts are an issue for you, or even if you're just struggling with your fear and guilt in general, I recommend meditation. 

I guess hearing your friend's deadname is kind of like accidentally seeing someone naked or something. You saw something you weren't supposed to, it's really embarrassing, and maybe you'll feel ashamed even if you didn't do anything wrong--but these things happen. It's not a big deal. You can move on. The less importance you give that situation, the less it'll bother you.
It’s downvoted because if you really see your friend as a male u wouldn’t ever say the other…
How would you accidentally say it if you only ever knew him by his chosen name?
Don't worry, you will eventually forget. I've learned by accident half of my trans friends deadnames (either by old internet posts, or paypal/cashapp them money, etc). I literally could not remember a single one of them if you paid me.

Just don't worry about it, and you'll eventually forget.
You won't accidentally say it, I think you might just be feeling the weight that calling someone by their deadname carries. If you do, it's gonna be painful for both of you. Depending on your friend that might apply to you physically 🤷‍♀️
Lots of stuff I shouldn’t say pops up in my brain all the time, doesn’t mean it just pops out, kwim?
Y'all are both half right.

The name EXISTED, now it doesn't. Simple. It didn't change, it died. Even if you never liked it from the moment you were conceived, other people knew and used the name, so in some capacity it existed.

But now it doesn't, because it's dead and buried.
Negative people will continue to be negative in every possible situation, just keep doing what you're doing, the fact that you are worrying about this shows you care about a friend.
Yes, we read your post.  That’s why we think you have nefarious intentions. Why would you care about his deadname otherwise?
[removed]
Sorry I was a harsh I'm just a lil bit sensitive about this stuff because of how recent I got deadnamed by someone who is introduced myself to as my prefgersd name
Nor will I ever see them in the future
Unfortunately, it does-big companies often take produce from local farms and sell it worldwide, even when the towns those farms originally grew for are starving.
That surprised me so hard it felt like a punch to the face.  Ive been spending to much time with bad people ig.
Thing is... We did not speak about that later, but she seemed pretty uncomfortable to add insult to injury. If anything, I could call her by the nick she uses or the character she chose if available.
Also trans, if it were me I'd want to have that talk beforehand but I don't know what she would like.
Well, that’s how I feel about me, so it felt apt. Thank you all the same! lol 💁🏻‍♀️
ok! Thank you!
It's really not that easy for a lot of people, and I don't think it's all that fair for OP to get downvoted to oblivion over it. I'm trans myself, and I still worry about deadnaming my best friend all these years after knowing her, since I know her deadname and every now and then it gets stuck in the back of my mind. Tbf I haven't ever actually done it, but it's not like the worry just magically went away or I was able to forget that information. It's legitimately hard, bordering on impossible to just actually will yourself to forget something - if anything, that usually reinforces the memory of it.

I don't know the name of the phenomenon, but I remember a study where a group of subjects were told to go 20 minutes without thinking about polar bears. They all overwhelmingly eventually thought about polar bears, because of course they did - the human mind is hardwired to be inquisitive, plus we typically don't like being told not to do something, especially something as easy and instantaneous as thought, which can easily spill over into speech. I mean, how often do we actually pause and stop to process what we're going to say before we actually do it? Not very often, and tbh we shouldn't in most instances - it would take too long to get everything out, so I totally get the fear of accidentally saying it.
No I know exactly what they mean, it’s like now you know it you make a rule about not saying it, and now when ever you say his name you have to check it’s not the wrong one but that leads to you making a misguided mental shortcut to always attempt to say the one that isn’t the one you first think about and then you become paranoid that you’ll say it by accident despite the fact that you likely won’t and never would, it’s very weird but I get you.
hey, I have ADHD and I misgender myself on accident  
should I just not say it? should I feel like a bad person for misgendering myself?
It‘s our minds messing with us. That’s why they are called intrusive thoughts. Stuff you would never dream of saying to anyone just coming up more the less you want to say it.
Right? Usually the argument is that they remember you by that name and it's hard to remember to call you by your proper name...  this question just makes no sense whatsoever.
I mean, that's the actual truth for most of us. You don't really have to pretend there's a curse to create the pain.
for me (a trans man) with anxiety and intrusive thoughts, the fact that someone’s deadname can cause them dysphoria makes me ruminate on accidentally doing that very thing. calling a teacher by their maiden name for the most part does not have any pain associated with it, so there would not be a lot of anxiety about slipping up. similar to the N word - i haven’t said it in like 10 years, im not going to say it, but the fact that it would be VERY frowned upon and painful for someone else to hear me say it makes me think of “oh god what if i accidentally say it right now oh god”. so i don’t think it is a transphobic question, it is just an anxious question.
That's absolutely untrue - especially if you're anywhere on the Tourette's spectrum or struggle with severe intrusive thoughts. I've gotten to points where I've nearly said awful things that I've never said once before in my life during severe episodes. Those moments happen during heightened emotional states combined with high stress. To my knowledge I've thankfully never said of them, but I've been addressing it with my therapist in regards to treating my intrusive thoughts, and the potential to say something you know is taboo and hurtful can be amplified immensely by the stress of *not* wanting to say it (kind of the crux of most intrusive thoughts) - which does not reflect on the quality of character nor daily behavior of the person in question.
sorry, I’m still learning about trans people
They’re concerned and probably just having intrusive thoughts (think when you’re given a baby and the first thing you think about doing is dropping it. Of course you would never, but for a bit it’s all you think because you’re anxious)
[removed]
I understand! and sorry about what happened to you
I think the nickname from the game should be a safe option. But I could imagine having a short talk about this should be ok?
Fucking up is akin to stabbing him in the chest, so try your best to not do it. But just in case you fuck up, the procedure is quick apology, correct yourself, and move on. Word for word ""Sorry, *real name *, *continue what you were saying *."" You don't put any emphasis on it, if he brings it up you can talk about it but otherwise don't, you never remind anyone you fucked up about this. You do your best to forget the deadname. Got it?
Agree with you!! He shouldn’t have been downvoted that agressive. Its just a cis person trying to be supportive to his trans friend and not fu** up anything
On second thought, I think a good way to “trick” the brain is to train to say sentences in front of a mirror or just by yourself using the correct ones. Instead of focusing on not saying the deadname, focusing on saying the correct one and affirming that repetitively
Yeah I remember the thing you're talking about as well, but I don't recall the name of it - the basic concept is the brain is bad at remembering not to do something, as it checks that it's not doing it... by obsessively checking for the thing. It's stored as ""don't do X"" rather than ""do Y"", and you end up thinking about X a lot more because of it - which obviously causes distress in this circumstance.

So stuff like ""don't eat junk food, don't think about junk food, you don't want junk food"" is more likely to trigger a craving than not, or trying not to swear in a certain situation, and then fucking up because your brain keeps checking for swear words and trips you up. Similar phenomenon except the end result is hurting their friend by accident :/

Tried to find the name but just turning up OCD-related results, RIP. But I know the thing you mean.
That sounds stressful, but I get it.
This is different because you knew yourself before you started transitioning, op only knew their friend has his chosen name so realistically they would have no association with the person and the name
Absolutely not, precious one.  💜🙏
I do the same thing. Don't be so harsh on yourself.
I'd like to say that I'm trans before adding my opinion, or rather question. 
Now that it's said, wouldn't op be afraid bc they know something (the dead name) that they aren't supposed to know? It seems to make them (rightfully) nervous, and what makes you nervous usually has a hard time leaving your mind. 
Now I know that everyone is different, and maybe I'm saying shit but this is my guess, what do you think? 
(Please note that English isn't my first language so maybe I'm not being clear, if so I apologize)
its more of a metaphor for an ally, not meant for actual trans people, we obviously understand the pain by living with it :)
Ah, I see. I suppose it's on me for assuming op doesn't have any disabilities or conditions that would lead to them involuntarily blurting out things they've never said before or don't want to say (whether that's due to a lack of control of verbal stuff, due to heightened emotional states, etc...). I use to deal with intrusive thoughts, but never bad enough where saying something awful involuntarily was a risk, so I never knew that was a risk in the first place.

You bring a valid counterargument, and I won't try to ""no true scottsman"" my way out of what you said. Thank you for sharing your insight
Okay maybe I was too harsh. We just assume cis people will get it 😂 but to say you can’t stop thinking about his dead name? Why? It’s irrelevant. Trans is irrelevant. He’s a man, his gender is nothing to do with us. Would you learn about homosexuality lol? It just is.
Nah it's fine bruv it weren't you. Atleast I don't think it was you
got it, thanks for the advice!
That’s great advice! I once had a therapist who misgendered me and then said something along the lines of, “I don’t have a lot of education on trans people, you should know, I just called you ‘she’” I was only with her for two sessions.
Your English is good :) . I have no problem with the op asking what they should do with that information, my issue is with the statement afterward of feeling like they might call them by the wrong name. I understand that it may be hard to get it out of your head once you've heard it, but there would be no reason for the OP to ever even think to refer to this person by their dead name.
It’s just that I have been trying not to figure out what it was for a while, and I am kinda panicking that I did. I tend to overthink things and say stuff out loud that is on my mind, and I’m worried ai might have one of those moments. But after reading the advice from others, I will try to not think about it!
You'll only fuck up if you don't actually view him as a dude... in which case, the fuck you doing?
Also, if you internally deadname him, correct yourself. Multiple times if you like. That’s a good way to break the habit of deadnaming/misgendering someone, and in your case a good way to stop the deadnaming habit from forming. You’ve likely gotten his deadname stuck in your head because you’ve been so stressed out about knowing it now, so it’s just about replacing that name with his actual name whenever it comes to mind in reference to him.
Practice practice practice ❤️‍🩹👊
Thanks! 

Ah yes, indeed, that would be strange of them to refer to their friend by his dead name instead of his actual name. 
The most probable mistake would be inadvertently telling him that they KNOW their dead name I guess, I don't know if it's that probable but some people just talk before they think or can stop themselves.
Like, I'm taking myself as an exemple so it's not like something too serious or that applies to everyone, but sometimes I'm like ""we are NOT going to say that, we'll be in trouble"" and then blurt out exactly what I was supposed to keep to myself, but yes, it only works if I was thinking about saying that very thing at first, which isn't supposed to happen for op. 

Anyway all to say that yeah you're totally right!
As for now I just hope op won't think about his dead name and even less about using it

Also, thanks for taking some of your time to explain your point further it helped me understand more your previous message

Edit: I might have messed up a pronoun my bad
😂😂😂 don’t worry about it dude, seems like you’re just trying to get your head around it. Clues in the name dead name, it’s dead. I find dead names so weird like they don’t belong to that person I know lol. It was just sucky of his mum to dead name him around you.
That’s more about misgendering once u find out somebody is trans after u didn’t know b4 and were getting it right, than dead-naming after hearing ur friends deadname u didn’t know before 

Obviously it would suck and hurt him, but I don’t think it’s the same
You're welcome, thank you for taking the time to ask.
Bullshit. If someone else tells you they used to be Catholic do you suddenly start assuming they are Catholic? Same fucking thing bro.
If I find out you used to be really short as a kid is it cool to start calling them shorty now? If someone used to play the harmonica is it okay to start calling them ""harmonica""? No... then why the flying fuck do you think this information has any goddamn relevance whatsoever in his male friend being a dude.

Fuck off with this ""well, they should have made it obvious they were trans so we could treat them different before we became friends"" bullshit.

Grow the fuck up and call the dude by his chosen name and forget that you ever heard a bigot call him a personal slur.
This feels very aggressive for no reason… I’m literally a trans man myself and I’m not even defending… deadnaming him? It would still be an ass thing to do, I’m just saying that in my opinion those two things are different."	x02rfr	trans	1575	0.94	2022-08-28 18:46:09

I wore my first Feminine outfit. It was a crop top with high waisted joggers. :) It felt so cute and no one really cared. I was about to cry but two of my friends surrounded me and hugged me and insisting I look amazing. :) . hopefully this year I can try different styles. I also came out to my mom... which she still have me the -_- look.... but at least she agreed to let me see a therapist.
Hell yeah! I'm going to have to try going full-goth instead of Victorian goth. Maybe once I can rock a dress like you can. ;P

You look like the neighborhood lady who everyone thinks is a witch, but no one ever sees you long enough to ask because you're mysterious and evasive. And you look exactly like someone who'd make an awesome friend. I really love your style!
Cutie!
It’s giving fairytale/storybook character
Your hair looks so good! Your makeup and outfit fit really well. :D I hope you have a very nice day! You are loved and you are beautiful <3
You’re gorgeous and you literally have the hair i wish i could have omg, idk if thats a perm or curled or natural curls but I want it!
Its also been a long time since ive seen a girl pull off that colour of lipstick but it actually just outright suits you wonderfully!
your so pretty! The makeup and outfit together is just so PRETTY. I hope you have a nice day! :D
Well, you look absolutely stunning and gorgeous
Your hair, lipstick, and dress are beautiful! You are incredible!
You are really beautiful. 😍
Your outfit? Amazing
Your hair? Stunning
You? Insanely pretty
Relax, You're pretty and have style. Double threat. Makeup is fantastic too. Triple threat. I have to ask.... What do you use in your hair? It is like silk. I really need to know what product you use I have hair like that but it gets so frizzy I don't know what to do about it. Hugs!
I really tried to see a male in you but I can’t, you’re so beautiful!
It's never dumb to ask for help or validation ❤️

You're gorgeous hun
Sweetheart, it's not dumb. many of us need validation. I often seek validation for feeling and/or saying that I'm genderfluid. It's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about.   Hugs & Love.  And yes, your dress, with that sweater is so pretty. :-)
You might like the band Against me!
HAWT! (Respectfully!!) super cute and i am jelly of your lipstick game

I think you look beautiful!
Wow!!!  What!?!?!!?   
I'm so sorry, but You're so pretty!! You're like this evangelic, wonderful hybrid of tolkienistic elf and hobbit. This dress, the wonderous hairstyle(and what a lovely texture of hair!), lipstick, piercings, everything!! And all that I write is so sincere.  


Thank You so much for the bravery to write asking for support, I personally also tend to all of a sudden fluctuate into unbearable disforism sometimes. Bravery suits You <3
You look like a 17th century artist did a portrait of a royal lady, but with modern style and clothing . . . and photo instead of portrait?

I'm bad at unique compliments sorry :( 

Just you look very beautiful!
You are beautiful don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise.
you almost remind me of a fantasy setting protagonist/deuteragonist?? yr aesthetic is very ethreal in a subtle way and im such a big fan of the curly fringe and your piercings!!
Your hair and makeup fit so well! Especially matching with your outfit! You could make hearts drum and angels sing!
You look like a beautiful Renaissance painting!!!!
you woman. no man
Girl you’re literally so cute
You look like royalty ❤️
You look beautiful!  I agree, romantic Victorian princess vibes.
If I just saw you on the street, I'd say you're a woman. Also, we all have those bad gender dysphoria episodes and they are horrible. Got through one recently, and it was not fun. Good luck, sis!
G-g-gender e-envy...

G-good girl!
You would be a Classically *beautiful* girl *without* the nose hardware, but maybe that's just me.

I mean, this picture, sans nose stuff, could be a really neat Classical portrait.
You. Are. Very pretty. Don’t bring yourself down
You look soooo cute and feminine in this picture 🥰
You’re absolutely Beautiful ☺️☺️
Aww, but you look so amazing! 😍
You look so pretty, i'd say for you to be more confident on who you are, but i know that's hard sometimes, so what i can say is that you surely, 100% are beautiful for a looooot of people. From that on, all that counst it's your personality, which i assume would be really great too. s2
Very cute
Gorgeous!
Never dumb to ask for help. Slay it girl, you got this

You kind of remind me of the spy family wife
Very cute
You look fabulous
You look gorgeous and I hope you feel better soon💫
You’re a lovely woman. It matters who you are o the inside, not on society’s standards. I’d be so happy to have you across the table at a nice restaurant. Getting to know you would be wonderful. ❤️
It's not dumb, and you look super pretty
Well you look amazing and pretty and gorgeous  ❤️🏳️‍⚧️❤️
We are our own worst critics. Trust me, I see every flaw, when others don’t. I look at you and see a woman who is beautiful in an exotic way, who could walk through any room and turn heads. Classic, in the timeless way. I wish you only happiness and light

Girl you are absolutely slaying
Soo cute
it's not dumb, sometimes we need a little validation to pick us back up but you look great luv
Your very very very beautiful don't let nothing or no one tell you different
I'm sorry your dysphoria is awful.  I wish I looked like you.
Thank you so much 🖤
I agree with you she's so perfect and just beautiful, stunning 🤩
Happy cake day
Hit the nail on the head with the eccentric description 👀🖤
You're gonna make me cry 😭🖤. Thank you 🖤
My curls are natural! And a pain to maintain 😂
Thank you 🥺
Aww thank you 🥺. I hope you have a lovely day too 🖤!
I'd recommend asking for advice on the r/curlyhair subreddit. They're really lovely and inclusive there! Mine would get soooo frizzy before I started treating it. I use an Eva vitamin supplement in my hair around every 4 days (applied when it's wet) and then diffuse it till it's dry. Wash my hair once a week because any more than that and it becomes a frizzy mess
That's really really sweet 🥺. Thank you 🖤
To be fair, she is a conventionally beautiful girl with the nose hardware as well.
Im ftm
Thank you
Dont cry. You are stunning. I love the hair and outfit. Even the pose with head angle is on point. So I know two things. You are beautiful and talented. So you got that going for you. See no reason to cry.🥰
Happy cake day!
You are so sweet, thank you so so much 🖤
Thank you"	zlwrv2	trans	1524	0.98	2022-12-14 17:23:46
TW: suicide | Talked to my coworkers about gender dysphoria and how it can lead kids to suicide if not treated, one’s response was “that gets them out of the gene pool”	Im incredibly frustrated to say the least. Most were respectful, but that comment was straight up eugenics. People are that bold that they will advertise themselves not caring about kids killing themselves but instead caring that it gets them out of the genepool	"You’d be surprised (not really) how many people are suddenly 100% cool with eugenics provided you don’t call it eugenics and only use it on people they personally don’t like.
Yeah that's the kind of statement that needs to get reported to central HR.
That is infuriating. So sorry you have to deal with despicable people like that regularly.
Wow, just a straight up, mask-off Nazi then, lovely.
Bring it up to someone in charge, get it documented.  If it happens again, then you have standing to have your state's labor department bring its full fury down on them for permitting a hostile workplace.
What is wrong with that person??? That's awful, cruel and disrespectful...
I wish you were out of the gene pool

Is what I would've replied to that

Edited for clarity
That's just horrifying and inhumane. “Ah yeah this person isn't something I like so I wish for their death and eradication” ?????? I'm so sorry they said that to you. You deserve so much better.
Don't put sugar in their gas tank.
The person who said that should get out of the gene pool.
State labor relations board report, that is a targeted threat of eugenics against a group of people. once the report has been acknowledged go as public as you feel comfortable.

Let their words be the match.
Absolutely report that to HR
""you're a Nazi baby""
Can I ask do you have a labor board? Like a government run labor board? Cause in Canada that comment is a fireable offence
I'm sorry you had to hear that. May they be visited in their sleep by three trans appiritions and persuaded of the error of their ways...
Document everything,  make a note in your phone, who said it, what time and day, what they were wearing, if you talk to the boss about it Document that too. Contemporaneous notes are admissible in any sort of arbitration or other circumstance.
TELL HR. NOW.
That's an HR report
I’ve learned not to talk about concepts like dysphoria and chronic ideation with coworkers. 

It tends to end in harassment via “welfare checks”
report that shit to HR, your boss, your bosses boss, or the local labor commission.  one of those exists.
god, that's disgusting... can't believe people actually think that's okay. sorry you have to hear shit like that :(
Dude the fact that it’s nowhere near a genetic thing gives me a *tiny little bit* of sadistic pleasure knowing that that goal will never be fully achieved and there will always be new ones no matter the genetics
Just stab him and get his DNA out of the gene pool.
One has to wonder what’s going on in their gene swamp when they can see the bright side of dead children. Absolutely unacceptable response morally and definitely not ok in the workplace.
What…the actual *f*ck*…Like wow, ok Jerry, thanks for sharing. Tell us how you really feel. 🤨.
What a stupid comment! You can’t pass trans genes on, cause that’s not a thing. I’m so sick of hearing we have a mental illness, uh no you do. Because you can’t understand how things work… get yourself out of the gene pool thanks in advance. I’d seriously move to planet transgender if they ever come up with it. I love all our differences it makes us so unique, but our differences segregate us in real life.
Shitty, difficult, challenging people will always be with us. They are the very fabric of life. You can't make them go away. Educate me otherwise please. Much sympathy to you
I'm sure that person would claim they are ""pro life"".
that's the kind of comment I'd loose my job, in handcuffs, too.
I kinda feel like comments like this should be something that causes the government or something to take note, like ""okay this person may or may not allow or participate a hate crime."" Maybe some form of blacklisting? Idk maybe that could be problematic in the longrun, but it's better than letting a Nazi loose.
That is exactly the kind of people you want out of the the gene pool.
Report that coworker to HR. Good opportunity to filter. Fuckem.
…people like that are the real ones who shouldn’t pass on their genes. Влять, like what the fuck!
It's not logical, that person doesn't know genetics
I've told told a coworker who didn't support gender affirming care, ""wow I'm surprised you support child suicide, would of expected more of a Christian"" they walked away angry from that one while the other two coworkers started laughing.
I guarantee that person considers themselves ""pro-life"".
Please, give them the nickname of ""X the child eugenicist""
""Cocksucker"" would be the next thing I'd say to them.

Fuck 'em dead, let them know how stupid they are.
That comment was not only eugenics but completly dumb and shows how little clue this person has of biology and probably about anything else as well.
Testify's some bad education in general.
Beeing trans cant be inheritted.
And this colleague is just a nazi now. They talked the same shit about jewish people. As german my alarm bells ring on that kind if shit.
[removed]
Good to know theres no shortage of human garbage out there.
Given that people with 1 awful belief tend to have several others, I wonder what their thoughts are on other beliefs of the nonce club, like the great replacement conspiracy.
I don't have time to read the responses to see if this has been said, but nazis think people with peanut allergies should be out of the gene pool. Hope this helps.
While it wouldn't work out for you, I'd be very tempted to say ""Cool, drink bleach."" Though I think I basically have said the same but for antimasker/antivaxxers before so callousness for unaligned people is super common across the board.
I would definitely report them if possible.
Oh that’ll be a fun trip to HR
Wow!  If someone said that in my company they would be gone and banned from ever stepping on site again for life.
I have no idea where you work and my experience is skewed in that I've almost exclusively worked for large tech companies. Anywhere I have ever worked, though, if someone said that I would report them to HR and their ass would be fired with cause and they'd be jobless so fast their head would spin. That is completely fucked, if you have a trusted superior I would speak with them about this. If nothing else, it clearly demonstrates a bad moral compass and inability to understand the viewpoints of others, both of which make for shitass coworkers. Sorry, that sucks.
I would've told him ""go take yourself out of the gene pool"".
I mean I’d probably justify eugenics for people I don’t like. I acknowledge that this is amoral. Anyway, fuck that guy.
But the statement ""that gets them out of the gene pool"" isnt entirely wrong or am I missing something? 
Its not even hateful because its simply stating the obvious: if you act on your gender dysphoria you (probably) wont have bio kids. 

I find it hard to compare a statement you don't like to eugenics so can someone explain to me where my fuckup is ?
Don’t talk to coworkers about trans stuff! You’re literally just painting a target on your back
Wtf guys, read the comments. You are the hateful ones if you think it's okay to write all that stuff. 
Ill ask you a question: can you still become a biological parent if you've treated you body dysphoria ? If not ""youre out of the gene pool"", that has nothing to do with eugenics or what he wants or what ever.
Not only eugenic, it's child murder support. 
Report this person to HR
Dear fucking god that's horrifying. People actually think like that, they hear suicide epidemic and feel relieved???
Frustrated doesn't begin to describe how I feel.  I hope they don't have kids.  That's infuriating to hear! I'm sorry you had to be in the same room with that person.
I want to respectfully throw him into a dumpsterfire to remove HIM out of the gene pool.
The only part I was surprised about is how he just said it openly in public honestly
Oof i feel that. See it a lot as a autistic person
Unless you bring up abortion then they are pro life. They care more about it that a live child who should have the right to live their life how ever makes them happy. All children  should  have  the right to proper health care including Tran kids.
Oh yup. Both of my parents are disabled, so I've been directly and openly told that it would have been better if I was never born.
I think you should at some point ask him questions about these things and video record his answers, Then dox him on social media as the bigot he is and get him fired!
We dont have an HR :/
I think you mistyped something here; I hope at least.
They won't, i will! :)
I mean I'm sure there is a tiny genetic element, but admitting to such opens the doors to hate groups and eugenicists. Although I assume that there's a latent possibility in the wider gene pool, andt trans people have been documented for so long that I'm sure any such genes are in nearly every single human alive. Hell, it was probably baked into our genetics before modern humanity came into existence.

 Honestly, part of what frustrates me about transphobia and homophobia is that it blocks avenues into legitimate research on genetic and environmental influences. Because the argument is that it's ""only okay to be gay or trans if you literally had NO OTHER CHOICE and it was 10000% RANDOM"", which..... Is really messed up. Being queer for any reason at all should just be... Okay. Normal.
Oooor just cut off his balls and put them in a jar on your desk
uuuu yt
Oh my god definitely they would
I mentioned how puberty blockers are absolutely necessary for some, not all. It’s not the only treatment in general but for some hormone therapy is the necessity
Who said it was? Certainly not the trans community, however, far-right commentators consistently lie and pretend it is. **Children DO NOT get gender surgeries**. If children wish to do so they socially transition, name, clothes, haircuts etc. This has a significant positive mental health impact. When approaching puberty they can be given puberty-blocking medication which just acts as a giant pause button and gives room for them to decide what they want to do. If they want to continue with a medical transition they can be given hormones, this can start at around 14-16 depending on who is prescribing, the latest guidance says age 14. At age 18 they can then get whatever surgeries they want.
[M] Because the same people who advocate “mental health” appear to be in league with the ones who make comments about the gene pool.

Jerks like the one encountered by OP have almost *guaranteed* no one will want such treatment, even if one feels they could benefit from it.

It’s not about the choice anymore, it’s not about the science, the sheer violence of the rhetoric has made any compromise untenable.

To advocate mental health in some ways does not evoke self-discovery but more, self-denial.  It’s no longer about what we want.  It’s what we need.

Our own greatest drive as humans, the one we all hold dear, is our will to survive, and as long as we are human, we will go to any length to keep living.

And if you doubt this, consider the absurdity of an OP saying someone implied they don’t deserve to live— and this being interpreted politically.

We live in a society.
nobody said anything?? not even a weird look?? did YOU say anything?!?
I've just been diagnosed and am already hearing stuff like this. It's hard.
Yay! Aspie gang? :D
Same, however no one has ever said it to me I have heard about people saying that about us.
Then it needs to be reported to the boss then. If the boss is one who made those comments, then the owner of the company.
That is very illegal
Yeah sorry, I meant that's what I would've replied to that person.
>admitting it opens doors to hate groups

no the fuck it doesn’t, plenty of genetic conditions wont get you fucking killed. admitting its genetics changes nothing because that wouldn’t make it okay at all eugenics is still evil
I just said it wasn’t a genetic thing
Love that I get downvoted for asking an honest question instead of getting any legit answers or discourse.
Bro what are you saying I don’t understand
I gave him a weird look but I didn’t fully process what he said until after the conversation with my other coworkers was over. After I did I wished I said something in the moment. He wasn’t exactly in the conversation but said it on the side while I was talking to the other coworkers. I don’t think anyone else heard it but me
Honestly Im trying to convince people that we’re just people and Im worried that me doing that could possibly just have the boss tell me to not talk about sensitive topics at work.
Mayhaps if not either of those people, then something similar to the better business bureau?
I mean depends on where you live
I was confused at first! :p glad you clarified
You're right that it still wouldn't be okay, but if we admit there's possibly a genetic element, they'll say ""okay then let's kill/let die those with the genes."" Even if that doesn't actually happen, it would at least give hateful people material for their hate speech.
Yeah this is just getting a bit confusing😅
because you're not asking the question in good faith, but instead, you're trolling.
[M] I didn’t downvote you.

Also I tried my best to discourse 😁
[M] Which part.

It’s basically “mental health treatment equals death,” even if it’s not.  A good comparison is the autistic community and ABA.  Some of us learn not to stim, and decide we don’t want to.  While others… are just built differently.
oh wow thats even harder to deal with, so not everyone heard it and you’re not sure who can back you up. good luck with that, i truly hope he gets fired but we all know how this world works ;(
That's ok, you don't have to inflict that to yourself. Stay strong
“Your employee just told me to kill myself. Do something about it or I leave”
I would def talk to the boss, and most HR adjacent entity if it exists.
US UK or EU it's illegal

Edit: I may have misunderstood, the behavior exhibited by the coworker is illegal in those places, not the fact that they don't have an HR. Your company doesn't need an HR to sue them or file a complaint
Except I’m not? Actually trying to educate myself but being labeled as a troll for asking a real question isn’t helpful
They wouldn’t care less if I just left. I’m a part time worker in a college town and they’d replace me just like that. Unfortunately I need the job right now
""Your employee just told me to kill myself, do something about it or I *Go to the press*""
Better yet do something or I sue. This is workplace discrimination if nothing is done.
Very sophisticated
I’d definitely look into other jobs then and explicitly tell your boss that you’re leaving due to a toxic and hateful environment where apparently letting kids kill themselves is acceptable to “get them out of the gene pool”

If you’re a part time worker in a college town, I’m willing to bet there’s plenty of other part time work around
Is this for a chain or and independently owned place? If it's a chain, report it to corporate. If not, I don't know what else to tell you.
College town. That’s the silver lining… make other students in the community aware so that they can make an informed choice whether or not to work for them.
College town?  Contact a professor at the college, or even the dean, and see what avenues you can take to just warn them that the business is transphobic.  If you’re in a one part consent state, record abuse, go to your boss with proof, and if they do nothing, then when you quit, share the recording with activists from the college.

They’ll boycott that place into the ground.
Inform the police. Inciting a suicide + discrimination is very illegal.
Supreme Court never said that you can’t discriminate based on being trans. So your SoL
Nope not a chain unfortunately so I just really gotta deal with it for now
You could also file an EEOC complaint, though they cannot protect your anonymity so you would want to be absolutely sure you want to follow through.
[I'm pretty sure that they did.](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/protections-against-employment-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-or-gender)
Fuck that. We are just people trying to survive, but we can't be ""just people"" until we are treated just as another person. If you report, maybe the next trans person that gets hired there will actually feel like just another person at work.

If you're in the US UK or EU this is def illegal. Email or text (paper trail) your supervisor, whatever is more appropriate, outline what happened. They are legally obligated to make sure that never happens again - if it does, contact a pro Bono labor attorney and you can sue and get paid while they get fined. 

Cis women are just people trying to pay rent also, but they're not expected to put up with murderous misogynistic rhetoric while at work - the same principle applies to us. 

Laws to protect us are here to help us. If we don't take advantage of them, it only helps abusive bigots in the short term and in the long term. I'm sorry this sucks

Bought some items to help combat gender dysphoria. (My favorite is the bottom one.)		"The... bottom one?  I'm confused; aren't they *all* for bottoms?
Where did you get them from?
Where did you get them, and can the size be customized? I can never find any in my size
God I love chokers so much. Where did you get that bottom one?
Hear me out, bottom one but pink 😍

They are so cute tho!
My favorite thing to do with clasp collars is to put them around my leg (usually only fits around my calf) for a lil bit of flair 🥰
No joke, I have that exact middle one.
How do they help with this? I mean how do they apply to gender in your viewpoint. Just really curious. (And I’m partial to pink so the top one is my fave of these 3)
we're all asking the same question: where'd you get them?
Do they help?
I am a choker/collar queen myself. Yeah my handmade chainmaille one was expensive but….I look hot 😂
They are all heckin adorable!!!
I have the middle one.
They're all bottom ones when you think about it
I've got the bottom one too and I LOVE IT
I’d love to wear ones like these, but I can never find them big enough
I bet you'll look beautiful
God I want one of those but I'm way too old and way too shy to be able to do it.
I have the bottom one as well, but all black. A friend gave it to me, it was actually the first girly thing someone gave to me <3
[removed]
Kyyyuuuuutteee
All 3 are really nice. Love the top one ❤️
I got one very similar to the bottom one not too long ago. It's nice cuz it fits around my fat ass neck easier
Damn i want that
Holy shit, they are so cute 😍
I have the top one:)
There are some gorgeous ones on Etsy I’ve been eyeing that I’m SO excited to get. One of my favourites that I’ve chosen also has chain on it 🥰
How do you even get gender dysphoria
Pretty
Out of those three, that is also my favorite. If you like bells I'd recommend getting a bell choker too, I love mine! It has like a little leather bow under the bell and it's so cute.
What are these ??
Do they fit? All the chokers I've found are too small for me.
Why does every trans girl ever have one of those ? And I know my subject, I have the pink one
Hot I want to watch
i like the pink one

Scratch that I want the very bottom one
Aren’t these sex collars ??
Gotta go log in with my other account to up vote this twice...
Welp 💀
Came here to make this joke, have an upvote
Speakin of bottom, how much effort does it take bein a top as compared to bein a bottom ? (jus curious to know)
Okay maybe it shouldn’t but that made me laugh 😂
Fuck you beat me to it

I'm one of the few trans people that doesn't know how to program so I don't know what that means
Don't worry, it's just jibberish. Code is surprisingly easy to figure out the purpose of"	xochrm	trans	1474	0.98	2022-09-26 07:36:53
I'm being denied HRT due to depression, and the depression is caused by not having HRT	"This is just an endless loop I can't escape. The medical reason is that I'm too unstable due to suicide attempts, and estrogen will just ""make me more emotional"". I'm 16 in South Africa, and have no other option outside of the medical route. I've been out for years now, and it's so so disheartening to see my hormones fuck up my body with puberty. My blockers are also being put on hold with dosage increases, and is wayyy too low to actually do much. I literally have no idea where to go from here, as the source of everything isn't being treated. 

Neither my family, nor therapist will do anything about how I feel.

What do I do? I can't just ""hold on"" anymore. The dysphoria is soul crushing. I've tried everything, and I've been in this limbo for months now."	"Lie to them. Tell them your depression isn't as bad anymore so you can get your hrt. This is totally fucked, my doctor tried to do this to me but my dysphoric panic attacks got so bad i couldn't function so she just gave it to me. If your doctors are going to make completely unreasonable demands to gatekeep lifesaving medication then just lie to them till they give it to you
That is such bs, I'm sorry you're in this situation. My healthcare greenlit my HRT after a suicide attempt and alongside antidepressants, and humans across the world dont just work differently because of a border. If I got it you should too.

Maybe appealing the decision would work, or finding a different provider.. You will get what you need, eventually. You won't /not/ get HRT. Good luck 🏳️‍🌈🖤
My GP (also specializes in Trans issues) denied me too, same reason.
I did point out that a significant part of my depression was from bot being able to live and present myself as female. 
Insidently, I ended up seeing a gender therapist at a large teaching hospital / university. They referred me to an Endocrinologist at the hospital, that also specializes in Transgender patients.
Lie to them. Your mental health and well-being could take a tole from not. Usually you shouldn’t lie about it but in this case lie
Just lie. Give it a few months, come up with a classic reason for your ""recovery"", like diet or excercise change, new romance or friendship, new job, anything really. They are just checking boxes.
That's horrible ><

One thing is that a low level of testerone without the oestrogene to replace it can lead to depression, you need either of those, the lack of both can be really bad for your health in general.

I don't get why you get denied that since you NEED it to feel better.

As others said, the best way would be to lie and have your stuff.
Better out play the système rather than just being in pain all the time...

I really hope you'll manage it =)
Mask. Then mask again, and then mask some more. And then keep masking, and go deeper if you have to. Just keep doing it until they finally think you're good enough for the medications.

That's what I did - and while it was terrible it did work, which counts for something.

I really wish I had better advice, but this world is determined to make trans people suffer.
I’m so sorry you have to go through this. I had the exact same experience when I started my transition at the start of the year. My doctor wouldn’t sign off on hrt because I “didn’t want to live” which was ironic. I decided to just play the long game and lie my ass off. It works if they believe they see progress in you. Sometimes it’s just the only way to get what you want and actually help yourself when nobody else will.
Testosterone is necessary to support brain function! Perhaps your blockers could be influencing your depression.
Either way I'd lie to get them as ""estrogen makes you more emotional"" is a lie.

All estrogen does is tune your body to the right frequency. The signal becomes clear in a way.
I am so sorry. That is deeply frustrating.
Lying is free. You don't have to follow non sensical medical advice that goes against established medical science.

Either, if you can, find a new provider, or just lie to them.
I lie about my depression to avoid hospitals no reason you could t do the same for HRT.
Maybe see a therapist for the depression and they could help get hrt?
Pretend to get better. I mean you may not feel like it, but act like it. This is obvious, but don't attempt anymore. Force yourself to get involved in some kind of hobby so you seem busy. Then say you got really into meditation and it helped your depression. This is what I did when i was denied ADHD treatment for being too depressed. I just waited like a month and said I was feeling better bc all the meditation I had been doing. Complete bullshit, but it worked. Wishing you luck.
This is exactly why I pretend my life is perfect when I have to see my doctor
DIY then
That is horrible! I can’t imagine how difficult that is. I mean, I did struggle with depression and some suicidal ideation, but I guess I was quite stable when I requested access to hormones. 

I will say from experience that there is some justification to making sure you’re more stable before you start hormones. Yes, your emotions will deepen and you will become more emotional, but I don’t think that’s the main concern.

Since being on estrogen I experienced some heavy depressive episodes sometimes for an hour or two. It was such a heavy depression that I hadn’t experienced in many years. I noticed the episodes always occurred 8 hours after taking my estrogen.

I started on a daily dose of 1mg, and increased by 1mg every three months. About a week after increasing my daily dose to 3mg, I became so incredibly depressed almost all the time. I felt like I was underwater. I can’t express how much I struggled for more than a week. My wife called my doctor to let her know that something is seriously wrong with me due to the hormones.

So, as it turns out, once estrogen levels deplete, you become depressed. That accounted for the depressive episodes 8 hours after intake! My doctor told me to take 2mg early in the day, and the final 1mg 8 hours later. I was still depressed the day after I started doing that, but I noticed a significant relief. I could finally breathe again. The depression lifted swiftly after that, and hasn't returned since.

So in principle the depression can probably be avoided by distributing your estrogen intake, but I don’t believe it’s standard protocol. You get check-ups every 3 months, but some hormonal influences can happen quickly, and I imagine clinics don’t want to be responsible for having someone who is already unstable end their life due to an adverse hormonal effect. So as painful and unjust as it must be for you, I also understand their concerns.

I know you’re struggling to hang on, so my advice may come off as dismissive and easier said than done. But I think you have to find a way to change your mindset. I understand being denied access to HRT feels like a rejection, and like they're keeping you from your happiness. But I would urge you to try to see going into therapy to stabilize yourself as a stepping stone to HRT. See it as part of your transition. This is the first step of your transition, and the next step is HRT.

I really don’t think you would be fooling yourself by seeing this as part of your transition. I started doing laser hair removal about 3 months into HRT, and realized I would have been better off having started that before publicly presenting as a woman. I get the lower half of my makeup wiped off before the laser treatment, which always makes for a slightly awkward walk home. And for electrolysis hair removal which I’m doing once laser stops working, you have to grow out your hair before each session. I’m dreading that.

So if you have the means, I would start focusing on things like that; things you would end up doing during your transition anyway, and which you can already do pre-HRT. This could give you the sense that you're already working on your transition, and working towards your happiness.

Finally, I want to say that HRT may be momentarily unnecessary in a sense. I imagined that I would start wearing increasingly androgynous clothes and then feminine clothes, in accordance with how feminine I would appear based on the hormonal changes. I figured that process would take about a year. But to my own surprise, only 1.5 months into HRT at which point it wouldn’t have made any noticeable changes in my appearance (certainly not my face), I switched to presenting as a woman overnight. In hindsight, all it really took was learning makeup and getting a good wig that boosted my confidence, and I suddenly started wearing dresses in public.

I probably do have genetics on my side, so that switch may not be as easy for you. But I am tall, yet I don’t think I tend to get clocked until I open my mouth.
Never ever be honest to these people.
As shitty as it sounds, it’s true. You have to play the game to get what you want with sone doctors. If you don’t want to do that, then switch to another doctor. One that does informed consent would be best.
Actually im in the same position as u rn. Ive done some thinking from the doc's perspective. To keep it short i think they are trying to help you find confidence and happiness in what you already have.

I believe its more of a test to see how long you will stay on this path before you give up so they dont have to spend time and money.
Im so sorry you are going through this. I think at this point the best thing to do is bullshit your way through. Deep breaths and saccharine lies about having the most stable, jolly mind ever.

On the other note, it’s absolutely insane that a supposed healthcare worker is denying you necessary medication. It’s the equivalent of denying someone antidepressants because they are “too depressed” for treatment. Once possible, seek a new provider. It’s very difficult for a minor to do so, but as soon as you get the opportunity, do it. Also, consider researching LGBTQ support groups/organizations in your area. These kind of groups usually have a list of reliable sources and providers available for the community. Human rights groups and WPATH provider directory can be helpful too
My heart goes out to you, I hope you get some useful advice.
Well that's odd, cause I told the gender clinic I was on medication for depression and they didn't deny me soooo what?
Hay I'm also south African who is your therapist?
Honestly if all else doesnt work, doctors are shit at medical records.  Get a friend to get you a prescription and then try to fill it from a different country.  Think about the networks of folks that flew abortion pills from china or india into ireland or the UK.  It's the only way to dodge these fuckers.  Heck you need to do that these days for diabetes medicine.
Probably not the healthiest solution but if it were me I'd probably just try to pretend the depression went away. Sure, it would hurt to force myself into a state of fake wellbeing but I'm a good liar and it's worth it if the results mean I can get things that will actually help the depression. Then again, not a perfect plan and maybe not a great idea. Up to you babe.
If you're in the USA just get Galileo health kr some other online program that just gives you the hrt that you need without making you jump through hoops
This is why I Will not get therapy until I get on HRT. They cant stop me if my depression isnt documented anywhere
Lie. Lie your ass out, but dont' tell them a complete lie. Dont' tell them you're suicidal, just tell them that your depression isn't as bad now.
diyhrt.github.io
This is why before meeting my gender therapist I went off my depression meds. So they’d have no liable reason to deny me. A good life lesson to live by is: minimize risk if there is no risk to minimize it. Example: There is no risk of you lying to them, but there is risk of telling them the truth.
Get your depression figured out, then HRT (thats what im doing rn)
I’m always careful being super honest with them bc of this exact situation. Say you’re depressed but the hrt has been helping alleviate some of the depression you just need continued mental health therapy. That seemed to work for me. Hope it gets better 💕💕💕
Shit, I have to agree. As immoral as it feels, it's far more immoral (not to mention cruel) to deny someone much-needed healthcare. You have to play the system sometimes.

At first I was told by a gender clinician that I wasn't dressing femme enough to be given HRT, and had to wear low cut tops and skirts/dresses. In other words, I had to cosplay as the floweriest, pinkest gentle pixie (like Carol's façade in Walking Dead) in order to get a good rating, before going home and changing back into my black jeans and band shirts. And this is the UK's primary gender clinic, run by people who don't even know what a gender is.
I think I might just do that if it comes down to it, I'll just have to practice hiding emotions
Inb4 you're not depressed must not have gender dysphoria
I'm in Germany and also had to lie. I had to lie about my marriage, my dreams, my habits when having sex, my childhood and mental health. And now I am here, almost 7 years on HRT and I am fine. I know the best what is my gender. No one has to decide that besides me. When I say I am trans and need HRT then it is true. End of story.
This.

Just read the comments. Forget what i said. Screw those a** clowns, only trying to save money and time. Lying is the best option.
Can't afford DIY, and people wil find out eventually. My mother also opens all packages that arrive here, and our postal system is awful. Not something I can do unfortunately.
yup that's fucking awful. I can't even imagine, i fucking hate wearing a lot of fem clothes because they just make me look more masculine and dysphoric, plus if you're a non passing trans woman wearing that stuff it would put you at a much higher risk of hate crimes. I fucking hate these people so much
the things that doctors do when denying medical care and accessibility is more immoral than telling a lie because ultimately lying on your end will benefit you but nothing can please those sadistic scamming fucks.
In this situation it's not immoral if it's for your health and wellbeing.
Im in the UK and had to straight up lie about how well I was doing to start after listening to how Im neurodivergent meaning I can't know who I am and that a history of depression means Im not stable either. I had to listen to a doctor in a room with a chaperone who was a woman in suit, tell me Im not presenting feminine enough because i didnt have a skirt.

At this point, I think lying to win against systems so unfair that they would happily allow the deaths of the people they claim to help is more a moral obligation and a proof of willingness to not take shit and continue to exist.
It might feel immoral but it’s not immoral to lie in this case at all. This is why the suicide rates are so high, why can’t they just provide basic medication.
Woooow who are they to tell you what feminine should look like? This comment made my blood boil...and I'm a cis female! The last time I wore a dress was my brother's wedding. I don't even dress the way they were forcing you to. Some people really shouldn't be in charge of this type of health care.
Yeah, i really hope you can
lmao yes

Anyway, to address your point here. The doctor is putting OP in a catch 22 situation which itself is highly unethical. It's not like depression necessarily makes people act irrationally. In fact most doctors are actually incredibly uneducated on the transition process and it is far from uncommon for trans people to have to guide them through their own care. Anyway, back to the catch 22 thing, this situation is like refusing someone with cancer chemotherapy because the person is sick and chemo can make them immunocompromised and being sick with something much more dangerous. Except the thing the person is sick with is the damn cancer.

...and it's quite likely that if OP were to be no longer depressed, the doctor could very well turn around and say that they're clearly not trans or don't need to transition because it's no longer causing them anguish.
Do you have any friend you could send the packets to ? Also ask the local trans or lgbt orgs if they can help navigating this.
They lack empathy! That's what it is. The GIC also lack the funds and resources (thanks to politics), but that's no reason to keep employing people that essentially bully patients.


Everyone I've spoken to recently has been very nice. Admin used to suck, but now they and Endo teams have been great, and the last two clinicians were 10/10 kind and knowledgeable. I can't be mad at the whole organisation when it's only the leader and a couple others that screw it up.
Yes. Hell, I'd even argue that it's worth staying alive just to spite the bastards.
After hearing about the unwarranted discharges from care they've made I dread to think how many suicides they've caused. And yes. The rest of the NHS is tax funded and therefore free, why is the gender section different
Precisely 🖤 but that's how it is at the moment. What they can give us we need, it's not just 'gender-affirming' but life-saving. The GIC has followed outdated guidelines that rely on society's idea of binary genders, in order to get help from them we have to jump through hoops and present as strongly as the opposite sex as possible to avoid being told we don't qualify. I don't have a clue how they expect to help NB or non-conforming/divergent folk.

I feel like everyone is a mix of masc/femme energy, even if that mix is 99%-1% or 3%-3%, and the remainder is neither. With this idea, it's like the current UK gender clinics are turning away any women with 70% femininity or less, even though it takes only a majority of femininity in a predominantly male body and masculinity in a predominantly female body to create dysphoria, and lack of a comfortable life to create depression strong enough to kill or severely impair.

Everyone deserves a chance to live happily.
yes and in great detail and what positions you have when you dream about sex
thanks, but I also think there is so many worse places in the world. I am really privileged to live here
Unfortunately there aren't local groups that'll help me, and I don't have a friend to help either.
I had one doctor who literally gave me freudian nonsense, claimed I agreed with him about his refusal to diagnose in a letter he sent to my GP despite the fact I immediately asked for a second opinion and the stink I ended up making got me that second opinion, only to be put in a room with four doctors who then told me I didn't have a 'good enough' situation but then told me to just go private. One appointment into that visit with cost me £400 in one day to travel to said appointment I had Gendercare tell me the GIC's have wasted my time and given they used to work for them, even he failed to see how i didnt get a diagnosis.
What would they say if you told them you don't have those sorts of dreams or aren't interested in having sex?
idk, maybe they'll try to turn it some way?
Turn it? What do you mean?
i mean trying to influence you into saying something that you wouldn't normally say to turn the outcome of it to one side or the other (sorry, english isn't my native language)"	w5m5o3	trans	1475	0.99	2022-07-22 21:37:42
Passing.		"Yup, I have a friend who is the same height as me. She gets misgendered more often than me. She usually just introduces herself with her pronouns or goes I'm a girl.
can confirm! my sister is a trans woman and we bonded a lot early in her transition because I was also in my teens and experiencing a lot of similar issues -- unwanted hair, misgendering, random emotional changes, etc. I am cis, but I look myself in the middle every day and think, ""do I look girly enough to convince other people I am a girl?"" I think most feminine people I've interacted with in my life have experienced some degree of this 😊
Man if I learned one thing from transitioning, it’s how much of what I _thought_ was dysphoria is actually just insecurities and social pressures that every woman deals with. Like, it’s not 100%, there’s still definitely things about being trans that cis women don’t really relate to, but at the same time it’s kinda comforting to learn how normal some of these feelings are.
TERFs will be out here screaming at hairy cis women, or fat cis women, or tall cis women while pretending that they're the only thing 'protecting' us. 🙄
Real. TERFs are cringe.
Not just women but everyone wants to feel like their gender.  Still, this still mindfucks me.  Just feels weird relating to women at such a core level, that really want to appear like women too and every and have similair struggles.
This is true, i look fairly masculine, and hobbies are similar. for years i struggled because i got called lesbian/butch/a man/whatever  
Now old enough that i dont care as much because im happy with who i am, Also realized it says more about THEM that they think those are  insults
Are they actually TERFs or just transphobes?  Because there’s a big difference between a *trans-exclusionary radfem* and someone that just doesn’t respect trans people.  There’s a lot of people throwing around the word TERF lately without understanding the acronym.
TERFs have far more in common with the misogynistic alt-right than they do with feminism.
Almost as if trying to define and enforce strict gender norms or holding people to unreasonably high beauty standards is a bad thing. Almost as if cis women have every right to be who they want to be as much as anyone does. Almost as if having a picture perfect idea of how you think the world ought to be and throwing a fit, or violence, when someone/something doesn't fit said subjective ""utopia"" is a horrible thing to do. 

If a girl wants to wear a dress, great. If she wants to smell like a campfire, build a wood cabin, kill her own dinner, skin it, and wear its pelt she has as much right to that as any ""truly manly man"" does. 

And the same goes for any gender, sexuality, or what have you! Gay men do NOT need to act how you expect them to act. Lesbians are NOT required to meet your expectations. Trans people do NOT need to get the body modifications you think make them ""true trans."" 

It's almost as if life, including human life, is SUPER DIVERSE and shoving people into predetermined boxes is bad.
Yeah before I realized I was a trans man, I was not exactly butch , but I had short hair, was somewhat muscular (I did karate for 6 years ), and had a very slightly deeper voice than most other afab people. I would get stared at, glared at, told that this was the womens changing room, and once got told I didn’t belong in there. And all of this was in a dojo that was run by a butch and fem lesbian couple, so you’d think the people going to it regularly would not have such a strict idea of what a woman looks like. Transphobia is ducking stupid. Tho to be fair in the end they were right
Word. Thats why I dont worry about passing. Cis women come in different shapes and sizes, so do trans women.
I knew a couple once. Super femme trans gal and butch cis girl. The trans girl was terrified of using the ladies room, so her gf escorted her in. This total Karen apparently took one look at both of them, scowled, and left to get a security guard. They couldnt finish up fast enough and when the Karen came back she pointed at the butch cis girl and said, ""Remove that *man* from the *women's* restroom."" They both burst out laughing before leaving since they were all but done at that point.
Embrace the ""just being me"" life. Same as all trans and enbies etc are valid so are you as a ""non girly"" woman
Idk, TERFS in practice seem to care a lot more about the trans exclusion than the feminism.
Its definitely some of both.  Many TERFs aren't exactly great to women who don't fit in their picture either.  Quiet a few are against gay marriage, look down on those who are fat, old, etc.  They're just not nice people.
""radical feminism"" as used to refer to terfs and swerfs is inherently misogynistic, sexist and also varying degrees of fascist, so what tumblr OP is getting is absolutely on brand with them. They're alt right transphobes who appropriate feminism to justify their hate"	xwn86p	trans	1467	0.99	2022-10-05 21:40:32
After going over a decade without swimming because of dysphoria, I finally had the courage to get a swimsuit to swim with my friends 😊		"oh my dear god you look amazing, I absolutely loved your hair colour

I know dysphoria can really suck, but I'm sure you're a lovely girl/person (sorry I don't know your pronouns)
Look great! I miss swimming, I can’t wait to get back in the water after surgery
You look so cute!  I love your bangs with your hair pulled back, it adds to the retro styling of the halter top.
you look wonderful, comfortable and happy!
Looks great, I love the hair and matching top.
omg i haven't swam in so long hehe- even wearing swimtrunks and a swim shirt is just too revealing of my body shape and chest, can't handle the dysphoria. I'm happy you got to swim again :)
Good for you!! I know personally, the feeling of seeing another trans person at the beach makes me very happy.

Have fun swimming!
your hair in the second pic is amazing
Those look like very comfortable bathers lol, what material are they?
You're really pretty 💙💙
You look amazing! I'm your fan 

Also gender envy
AHHH THE BUN ITS SO CUTEEEE
it looks so cute on you!
You look lovely! I’m definitely feeling the style with your hair it’s a good choice.

You look so good! :D
You look really pretty❗️

Kinda weird but you look almost EXACTLY like this girl I kinda dated a few years ago 😂
Congratulations on finding yourself! Hope I get where you are some day 😀
It looks fantastic on you!
Good for you  - get out there and enjoy life!
I still hate swimming. Feel like I went from one dysphoria around swimming to another. Maybe in another few years
You look gorgeous love to know where you got the swim suit?
Good for you!  Really happy you’re feeling more confident.  Feels good to be yourself, right?  😊
You are hottttttttttttttt

And congrats
Yay! I'm so happy for you 😊 One day in the far future I might think about considering the possibility of an attempt at it!
You are lovely and my best friend suffers from severe dysphoria. What I tell him is that I know it's extremely hard but you always have and always will have my support and try not to let anyone get to you. You be happy who you are and you life to the fullest. Fuck others and what they think. Just politely correct them  if they say something wrong and of they're dicks about it, leave it be because you won't be able to change their way of thought. But to me, you're beautiful... And I'm Pansexual, so lol :) but yea I wouldn't be shy if I were you.
That swimsuit is so cute on you! Love your hair color (and the matching top)!
Congratulations and you look so beautiful
You're absolutely beautiful! Never be scared to show your body!!
I just was yesterday because of my training and Dyshoria didn't like this
You go, girl! You're absolutely rocking that swimsuit ♥️ I'm hoping I'll get to go swimming again one day as well 😔
Please what? I can't believe how beautiful you are. There'e like no reason why you should feel ashamed or bad for how you look if dysphoria wasn't a thing ofc
Beautiful… have fun!
Thank you! She/her
It was honestly so amazing to finally get to enjoy something I used to love doing again. I’m excited for you!

Aye mine just came in today and I'm looking to get the epilepsy bunny for my sister for xmas:)
Cute bunny! Cute top. Cute skirt. Happy Cake Day.
I've been wanting him so baddd! But $40 is so much and I is broke sadly :b
I have several of the plushie dreadfuls but didn't get this one as it was overall a bit feminine to me (no judgement at all, just not my thing). I'm FtM. I have BPD and don't like their bpd rabbit either lol... I'm a fussy bugger when it comes to my plushies.

I do have the distressed white rabbit, the love bear (with his little beehive), the sleep paralysis rabbit, the  8 pack of mini bunnies that don't seem to be on the site any more... very tempted by the 4 bunsmen of the bunpocalypse and the medusa bunny too...
I got mine a few days ago, it's so cute and was honestly amazing quality. I'm actually surprised on the quality tbh. Definitely worth buying even if it's a bit pricey. I'm glad I spent like $57 (USD), it was way too cute to pass up.
Holy fucking bingle :3
D-did you UwU the bunny? The bunny looks so... crushable between those thighs >~<
AHHH I WANT HIM SO BADDDD. I want to get him for myself when I start T as a lil gift.
Awww! I'm super jealous!!
I like my mocchimocchi Shy Guy.
Where did you get this at?
Are these baby safe ie no buttons or detachable stuff? Would love one for our little one ❤👭
I have one too! And their Ace bunny! I love them

Yeah, mine came out to about 70 bucks CDN. It does come with a tote bag but it's still very expensive. Good quality, at least.
Yeah there's like 5 of the plushie dreadfuls I really want; but every time I put in some extra hours for a big paycheck, something expensive breaks and I have to replace it >_<

They're fekkin adorable but 45+S&H is just a knife in the heart

Having a hard time fully accepting that I’m trans	"I’ve heard this from others as well, I guess I just wanna type it out to really see how irrational it looks from an outside perspective, haha

I logically know I’m a trans girl. I feel dysphoria when I feel too masculine and euphoria when I feel feminine. I would do a whole lot to get the body of a cis female and to live the life of one

And yet there’s always part of me that tells me that I can’t be trans because I don’t feel enough dysphoria, that I’m probably just lying to myself 

Maybe the human brain is just very bad at gender identity, who knows"	"If you’re not too sure you can go as non-binary/genderfluid and kinda ease your way across the spectrum to find where you fit the best. Gives you a feeling of stability in your gender identity.
This is normal trans shiz...
Here's an interesting link. I have NO physical dysphoria so it's really confusing for me. (Not the article, i meant my gender experience)


https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5


I don't ""feel"" like a woman sometimes but I KNOW I AM a Trans woman.
There is not a single trans person that doesn't go through this at some point or to some level, if society was more accepting maybe we wouldn't have to deal with the self doubt, but honestly talking to an accepting therapist would help.
I think its hard for everyone to accept it at first. No one wishes to be trans, but once you accept it and start hrt like theres no turning back, i couldnt never see myself go back to where i was before
What you experience is called imposter syndrome, and it's an indicator that you are in fact trans. 😊
“I don’t hate being a guy but I REALLY wish I was a girl instead… it’s not crippling Dysphoria so I must be faking it or something”

-Me to myself on a daily basis
I am a trans guy and I have the exact same issues. It doesn’t help that some trans people like to gatekeep and say only certain levels of dysphoria and self hatred “actually qualify as trans.” Many of us choose to be nb before coming out, figuring ourselves out etc. and every step of your journey is valid. I just try to be extra nice with my inner voice because it doesn’t ever help to be mean to yourself - you don’t need to hate yourself to be trans. In fact it’s a lot easier if you don’t, and if you can meet yourself where you’re at (in my experience anyway.) You got this babe keep your chin up ❤️ WE GOT THIS!
Have you tried talking to a therapist about it? I’ve been seeing one for about half a year now and done a lot of personal work towards just self acceptance. 

I think some of the questions she would ask that may help you would be, 
How do you feel as your female  vs your male identity ? 
What do you think makes it hard for you to accept being trans/non binary?
What experiences have you had that make you possibly feel that way?
Being trans is not an easy thing, this is always understandable. Our brains instinctually know who we are identity-wise, but I think it's our conscience minds that need time to fully process and accept it. Just know that there's no such thing as ""not having enough dysphoria"". If you know you're a girl, you're a girl. But may I just say that I'm sure the majority of people go through something similar. For a few solid years, I identified as being fully agender to not have to accept that I wanted to transition. I hope this message got across what I wanted to say, and hopefully it helped a tiny bit. ☺️
In my head i know im transmasc, i get chest and body dysphoria, i hate when people use feminine pronouns and I'd give anything to be a cis guy. But for some reason i can't seem to accept it properly
That's a normal trans thought you're a trans girl. I'm a trans guy welcome to the trans club
I've heard it said that while dysphoria is common, its the euphoria that is a better sign. I had doubts too, but the joy i get is unmistakable
A lot of us definitely feel this way sometimes. I haven't started HRT yet and I haven't shaved my beard off yet, so I definitely have these moments. 

One of the things I try to remember is that I've been living as a man for 32 years. Even if I know that I'm a woman, being male is something that's familiar, comfortable, and safe— relatively speaking. I'm going to have a natural inclination to question myself because transitioning is stepping out of my comfort zone in a big way. 

We don't have to hit some bar or fit some checklist of things to prove definitively that we're trans. And you are perfectly where you need to be for this moment.
I feel you, tbh I feel the same way cuz I’ve always had this mild, background uncomfortable feeling about being/looking/acting like a guy, and I stopped feeling it for a while once I started embracing what I thought was just my “feminine side” (painting nails, wearing lite makeup, dressing I’m tighter clothes stuff like that) a few years ago while still identifying as male but then like a year ago I realized that uncomfortable feeling is still there whenever I try to like, think of myself as male, or say out loud that I am, or when someone specifically refers to me as a guy, or when I fill out a form of some kind I always feel weird about circling “male” and I’m realizing that whatever I am, I’m not a guy, cuz I’m obviously more comfortable in my own skin the more feminine I look and feel. But like, I’ve had a super hard time accepting that I’m trans for the same reasons you’re talking about-cuz it never felt like dysphoria in the same way a lot of my trans friends or trans folks online have described it, it always seemed mild in comparison as just like this, background uneasiness about my identity and expression that dressing and looking more feminine assuages. So yea I feel you, and from what I gather, it’s not at all an uncommon feeling. And I don’t think it’s that the human brain itself is bad at gender identity, I think society is, and because our brains were all pretty thoroughly indoctrinated with rigid gender roles that exist only as a static, invariable binary, our brains can have a hard time grasping the fact that we don’t fit into that view of gender.
After a decade, it still is difficult to accept.
It's so nice to know that others feel this way to. It's really annoying that this is normal trans stuff but I'm just hoping that it'll get better with time. I hope you are able to live your best life free from doubt!
Hi! I’m so happy you’ve found out who you are! Have you considered hormone treatment or if surgery is right for you? There’s also a sub called femboys which may interest you. What do you mean not enough dysphoria?
That's pretty textbook [imposter syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) with some [no true Scottsmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) fallacious thinking thrown in for giggles and grins.

I'm fairly active in the autistic community, and it's super prevalent there too. [Cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) are exceptionally common, and especially so for that revolving around identity. It's an irrationality due to a lack of self esteem/self respect/confidence in one's ability to know. While it's expressed differently between the two communities, it's the same phenomena.

You are essentially gatekeeping yourself.

To touch on your dysphoria/euphoria, I'd like to state that neither are a requirement for being trans. At all. Nada. Zero. None. Zilch. And to be perfectly clear, I am not saying that one can be absent as long as you have the other. One can have no dysphoria and have no euphoria and still be trans.

While it's valid to feel that you don't have enough of either, it is also irrational to to gatekeep yourself because of it.
My brain tried to say the same thing. It hit me hard and I cried when I realized this, if I wasn't a woman, I wouldn't feel heartbroken at the idea that 'I couldn't be a woman'. If the worry that you aren't the identity you yearn for hurts you, worries you, doesn't that itself show dysphoria? Find any girl and tell her she isn't feminine enough, pretty enough, womanly enough to be a real girl. If she's hurt, heartbroken, or has her hopes ruined.... That's normal. You tell a cismale he's too manly to ever be a woman, he laughs from the heart and thanks you for the compliment. You tell yourself that you could never be pretty enough, feminine enough, girly enough- and it crushes you? Why wouldn't it hurt you like it hurts any other girl to hear that? Heck, the more I've become more aware of my own feelings since cracking recently the more I realize I had become numb to my own pain. I noticed in my anatomy lab today that I was being chatty and extra.....naturally. I was being a chatty, prissy stereotypical 'basic white girl' and it was flowing out of me naturally. It has been for years. Instead of forcing myself to tap down on it out of self-loathing, I paused, smiled and realized I should chill out a hair as it wasn't super situationally appropriate while we were cutting open brains. To be honest out of a group of 25 students, more than half women, I am at least in class, the most 'basic white bitch' of all of them. Sure that's a gender stereotype, but it's a behavior naturally flowing out of me. It's not a thing I put on out of fear or repression. It's a heady feeling seeing your natural behavior you've naturally had for years as 'female' and you either repressed it or didn't even realize it.
A lot of us have A LOT of social conditioning to break before being truly accepting of ourselves and what we know. There's no need to compare or say you don't have enough dysphpria. Each trans persons journey is unique to their own experience. Honestly what's helped me a lot is not focusing so much on the labels and simply looking at what makes me feel good about myself each day. Slowly add on to the routine and just keep taking it day by day. ❤💙
As so many have told me it's not a very CIS thing to worry about your disphoria levels.
You sound like me from about 3 months ago. Turns out me was definitely a trans girl.
I'm a trans boy and i understand what you are saying completely.....:)💜
well don't accept you're trans... accept you're not cisgender first.. then accept you're a girl
If your questioning if your trans, chances are that you’re actually trans. The more doubts, the more chance what your feeling is true. Bc well,, cis people don’t question it that much.
Lying is a conscious choice. Therefore you would know if you were faking. If you question if your faking, your not. 

(If that’s any comfort to you!!)
You don’t need dysphoria to be trans, this is something that other trans people go through, and it can be hard dealing with it but once you get through it an understand/accept yourself it’s better from there on out.

I didn't experience gender dysphoria until I was 23. I spent years and years wondering what was wrong with me and actively wishing to feel dysphoria just so that I could know that something was wrong. Feeling euphoria is what makes you trans, not the dysphoria.
Yeah
Girl, I feel the exact same thing everyday. I'm afraid to say I'm trans alot of the time because I sometimes feel unsure. I feel like people can sense that unassuredness and that they will think I'm faking. In the end tho, I have yet to have anyone question my transness.
Start from a perspective that 50/50 you could be cis or you could be trans, then add all the evidence, then choose based on the new odds.  IDK if it's possible to be 100% certain before you transition, at some point you have to trust yourself.
> Maybe the human brain is just very bad at gender identity, who knows

Psycho-social conditioning is a helluva drug

<hugs> ❤️
bleh same lmao im on a 5 month waiting list to see a gender clinic to start HRT but im still like ""what if im not dysphoric enough. what if im faking it"" LMAO its just irrational brain stuff i guess. it is emotionally taxing though
I get that I’m the exact same way from how I was raised I just think I’m the back of my head that it’s not except-able for me to be trans, I have a hard time biting the bullet
Same I always use my deadname and wrong pronouns in my head
Lol I feel the same way in fact going through it right as I typed this out 🥴
Might be helpful to hear a little bit about a similar journey to yours. When I first started to figure out my identity, I started out as purely non-binary because I was like ""Well, being trans is such a big deal, I don't want to take a label that isn't mine."" And then a friend of mine referred to me as trans and I was like ""oh haha but I'm not trans, right?"" And her response was, basically: ""?????"" She pointed out that non-binary folks are also trans unless they don't want to be. And I very much *did* want to be trans. From there it's just getting past that built-in societal filter, the one that tells us we're wrong for not conforming to the gender roles. 

If you're happier with one gender presentation over another, then that's the one you should use. The labels are there to help us quickly communicate parts of our identity to others, not to put us into boxes, so don't worry *too* much about picking or accepting a label.
Maybe take a good hard look at yourself and make a call on what makes you happy and go with that. You can sit in two camps and you will waste your life with indecision and what if’s. If you have a hard time accepting you are trans then maybe you are not. But if f you are just get on with it and transition you don’t have to slice everything off and have implants.  and if you don’t like the uninvited opinions of others the discrimination the ridicule and ostracising from the generally community as a   transperson you can a always change your mind and go back as you said you are not fully accepting you are trans.
>And yet there’s always part of me that tells me that I can’t be trans because I don’t feel enough dysphoria, that I’m probably just lying to myself.

Little known secret, it's not really about the dysphoria, it's about the euphoria. The dysphoria tells you what you *don't* want to be. The focus of transitioning should be seen more as a way to maximize your gender euphoria. Cause what's the point of not-disliking yourself if you're not going to enjoy yourself?

People who transition don't stop being trans when they stop feeling (as much) dysphoria, it's when they experience the most euphoria.
This has been a constant struggle for me as well. It was only the realization that I'd been stuck on this question for years that allowed me to realize it wasn't just a passing phase and to move forward.

Even given that, given all the ways my experience tells me I'm trans, the lengths I'm going to become the person I want to be... The doubt and fear still creep in here and there.

I guess what I'm getting at is that those feelings are normal and the impostor syndrome may never totally go away... But I think you know deep down what you want, it's okay to get what you want and you feel better about things over time even if you never reach 100%
ah yes, imposter syndrome. just eject the little shit out ! it’s the easiest way to get cured ever ‘cause it makes so much sense
The human brain is also very good at throwing random thoughts on top of those that you feel uncomfortable about. My point being: what you describe sounds a lot like dysphoria, if that's what you're worried about
I for years didn't include me in the lgbt even when I was thinking in my head. I was out to ppl. It took me time, therapy for other stuff, entering uni and a quarantine to help me come out come out and choose a name to my close friends. You will get there. You need to understand that there are no masculine or feminine things. Basically you need to deconstruct what gender is in order to accept. Or to be exact, this helped ME a lot. Basically when I deconstructed gender enough and I felt safe I manage to overcome a lot of problems.
i feel this. sending hugs <3
I didn’t accept I was trans until a friend squared off to me and said that suffering was not necessary to be trans. So let me tell you directly, trans identity does not require any suffering. You are allowed to exist without justification. Your identity isn’t validated by how bad you hurt. 

If you know deep down you are trans, let yourself be trans. I was content before I acknowledged my truth, but, now a year and some into being out, and 9 months on HRT, I am free and flying (except on bad dysphoria days lol).
From my experience, if you ignore these feelings, they start going to the gym every day, start a training montage, go through a few character development story arcs, and then come back with a vengeance to beat you up until you listen to them a few years later. 

The second time it works 😊
Yup same shit here, kind of dealt with a bit. As much as it sucks the only way I figured was time and conscious acceptance.
Oh my god, I thought I was the only one like this, every time I look at this sub, I see people with extreme dysphoria and I felt like I am tricking myself thinking I am trans
I loved the article but I just want to say something else to all of those younger people that are reading this don't wait don't wait until your life has passed you by before you are willing to at least try to take the steps to find yourself life got in my way and here I am at a late stage of life asking myself questions that I wish I could have been asking when I was a teenager and wishing the world was a different place when I was younger because all of this information and support didn't exist
if you’re unsure thats okay!! labels aren’t always necessarily, good luck in finding yourself friend
I'm the same
r/51%
You're valid!!! Dysphoria is not a requirement of being trans hun! I didn't feel too much dysphoria either, someone once told me that being feminine gave me gender euphoria and that's totally valid! Best of luck, feel free to message me or anyone else here for any advice or just to rant!
The medical establishment has tricked you into feeling this way. Just do what feels right to you. If you feel better feminizing yourself in various ways including hormones then do that. You don’t have to classify who you are, it’s not a requirement to be you. If you prefer she/her for pronouns or not it makes no difference on your gender presentation. To be trans is simply to be on the spectrum and not totally in line with your assigned gender at birth. If you’ve ever felt dysphoria at all, you are trans.
Disclaimer: this is reflective of my experience only (31 AMAB MtF).  Don't take it as gospel -

You have to jump tf in.  Nothing changes until you sit down, look yourself in the mirror and accept that you may have to sacrifice everything to be happy.  I went from being petrified of anyone thinking I'm not totally masc to going outside in yoga pants and a white manicure to straight up sitting in Planned Parenthood in a chick outfit (I looked dope btw in case you were wondering) waiting for my hormones.  In the span of a week.  Granted I have been trans my entire life and this is like the pinnacle, but what I mean to say is that you will AMAZE yourself with what you are able to marshal internally.

It gets easier.  Your armor builds up.  The woman that I am is way stronger than the guy I was born as ever was.

Don't give up.  Don't let your haters push you backwards.  You have to be the person you feel like you are.  Don't get discouraged about looking or feeling too masc.  Electrolysis, HRT, FFS, AM, there are tons and tons of ways to push the ball down the field.
I think a lot of people have that doubt, that they're not trans enough, not gay enough, not whatever enough. You have dysphoria about masculinity and euphoria about femininity. That's more than enough to count as a trans girl. You are enough! Things don't have to be any worse or any more extreme for you to claim that identity!
Dysphoria comes and goes.  

The human brain has never been a logical machine. Some days you may well know who you are. You know what feels right and wrong, and who you're meant to be. Sometimes it's not so clear. Instead of looking back at times when you knew for sure, the brain forgets. Maybe it was just a dream after all, maybe it'll just go away.  

But it comes back the same way every time.

The human brain has never been a logical machine. Part of what held me back was trying to fully understand myself, and all this constant analysis and logical deduction and all that, it kept me from just living as myself.  

I realised that I didn't need to understand, I just needed to *be*. And labels, as beautiful and wonderful as it is to know where you belong in a world as terrifying as the one we find ourselves in, would come secondary to my continued existence, not for anything, just *because*.  

The human brain has never been a logical machine. But if it was, it wouldn't know pain, or happiness, or beauty.  

So maybe we should stop treating it like one. <3
This is completely normal. I hate to say it but there is nothing anyone can say to you to make that feeling go away. The doubt will linger no matter what anyone tells you or how much you accept it mentally. accepting it emotionally is the only way to free yourself of this doubt. How to do that is something only you can figure out
Don’t dent your nature. Embrace it.
Start with , let go of this or that binary. You are a delicious mix of who you are! Let you be you. No need to trade the boy box for the girl box. About changing stuff? It's not a race, but maybe a little here, a little there? But really, is it a race? Stay true to you, is all you can do and enjoy life the way you want.
i’ve felt the same thing for a while, you just have to except who you are, it’s hard sometimes and it might take a while but i believe in u!
I spent a long time in that same headspace.
It’s hard to provide a definitive answer —which I imagine is what you are looking for— but I can promise that irrational part of you will go away over time. I remember I wrote something like this once, and found myself irrationally annoyed at the suggestion that maybe I was genderfluid or something else instead of a trans girl. As it turns out it’s a bit of both because gender is weird, but the point I’m trying to make is that that logical part of your brain is the part to listen to, and the rest will follow.

It’ll take longer than you want —it always does— but eventually you’ll have that part of you in sync. In the meantime, try to remind yourself that a lot of people here felt the same way at first, that we are lying to ourselves, and that a cis person wouldn’t feel that they need or want to experience (more) dysphoria because generally, cis people don’t have anything to prove to themselves. But, hun, you’ll get there — I can promise you that. There’ll come a time you won’t have to doubt yourself anymore.
The brain is hardwired male and female no matter what it’s always wired that way you can’t change it if you really want to become trans do it I’m not stopping you no one stopping you but it’s your brain telling you to be yourself

Ps I saw this on a friends phone and thought I’d just put my 2 cents out there
[removed]
People have said this before, and I'll say it again. The validation of a trans person doesn't come from the amount of dysphoria someone has. It comes from the euphoria one gets from being perceived as their true self. 

At least this is my take on it, as a trans person myself. Hope this helps!
It's okay! The way you feel is normal. You are a woman, and your dysphoria is just a reminder that you are in no way a man. Your thoughts, perceptions, hopes and dreams are that of a woman, because you can only be who you are.

Everyone, whether cis or trans, has masculine and feminine qualities. With the way society is, it's normal for women to desire to have more or only feminine rather than masculine qualities — and vice versa for men. These qualities never define whether someone is male or female or nonbinary. What defines you is you. If you feel comfortable being feminine, you are feminine. A feminine woman; and a woman can be as feminine or as masculine as she wants. There isn't a right or wrong way. What makes you euphoric is just you being you, so continue to be you and do what makes you feel comfortable and happy. It's important to always embrace your womanhood. No one can ever take it away from you. Every woman has a desire to be seen and respected as a female, and that's all it takes to be a woman.
something something impostor syndrome
Tends to happen... we all got doubts...
if you feel like you’re not feeling enough dysphoria, just remember that cis people feel NO dysphoria. 

being trans isn’t an easy or fun journey but it’s one you will find yourself through and be much happier than if you stayed as something you’re not
What makes you trans isn't the dysphoria it's the euphoria
So personally this sounds like you’re underplaying your feelings. It sounds very similar to impostor syndrome and I think you should maybe look into that but also and more importantly, go see a therapist and they can help you work on that self doubt
I’ll be honest with you. For most of my life I didn’t even know I was trans until about like 4 years ago or so and suddenly a lot of things made sense. However, some things didn’t like how I didn’t show these “signs” when I was younger or at least not when I was super super young that my family was able to tell that I was different. My family had no idea because of the fact I never said I had a girl brain or liked to dress up with “feminine” clothing so that’s something that comes back to me every now and then and makes me doubt things. However I am so much happier now than ever and I take so many pictures of myself now and I still like to dress up “masculine” but also super “feminine”. Idk where I’m going with this. But my point is, you have to take time to learn more about yourself and your journey and don’t downplay it just because others have a different experience than you. There are trans people who don’t wanna take hormones or get surgery. Hell there are even trans people who don’t feel dysphoria. So yeah just take time to get to know yourself more but don’t compare the way you feel to other trans people because we all have different experiences and history behind our transition. That is all. Thanks for hearing my Ted talk lol
When I first figured I was trans, I felt almost no dysphoria at all. It took a good chunk of year until I started to experience it. Meaning to say, dysphoria isn't what makes you trans. Its simply a possible side effect
That is also how I got to my current identity, I just still sometimes have to deal with my annoying brain, thank you for the advice though :>
Yes I can confirm that this works perfectly because at first I thought I was genderfluid!
Yeah, if only it was all a bit easier
Yes I cry everyday because of this
It was indeed quite interesting. I feel the same way as the author, just with some added dysphoria that my brain won’t acknowledge

Thank you for sharing it :>

And you are indeed valid <3
This article has a really interesting perspective that very much sounds like my own, with the only difference that I don’t believe I ever really desired to be a woman, and instead just never felt fully comfortable as a boy, even though I accepted I was one for 26 out of the 27 years I’ve been alive (hence my username which bugs me a little and I’m probably gonna make a new account soon lol) but yea I always thought I was just a boy even though there have always been things about me that always set me just apart enough from the rest of the guys that I never felt like I belonged as one of them, which I always just chalked up to me being weird and having had a unique upbringing. I’ve also always been more comfortable talking to, being around, and opening up to women and I never knew why until recently, which is cuz I’m either a woman or non-binary with a general preference for femininity in my gender expression. But yea the way I’ve heard dysphoria described never seemed like what I was feeling but that article kinda put things into perspective for me a bit and helped me come a little closer to accepting my own experience thus far so thank you 😊
This describes me own experience better than anything I've ever read.
Whoa that that was like reading my own biography
huh I.... just huh....... I seriously remember laying awake as a kid of like 12 thinking wouldn't it be cool if I woke up as a girl. Then like growing out of that phase. Now here I am at 28 like OHHHH THAT WAS IT. I was the author with less of the fantasy in between my awakening and my original musings.
Underrated comment!

Read this comment I only want to bring attention if possible
WTF I have been battling what OP is battling and OMG this literally has me in 😭😭
Please anyone who is questioning read this!!
I can not possibly tell you how powerful this 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for this article
That's the most relatable article I've read. Thanks for sharing it.
This fits me. Thanks
Wow that was pretty interesting to read because it was like I was reading my life story up until the point you were talking with a therapist and started to transition in some ways I think it's worse when you don't have dysphoria because it's like you don't have proof that anyone else can see but your whole view on desire hits home with me very hard I'm glad there's somebody else out there like me I'm not sure I'll be able to get to my endpoint but it makes me feel a little bit better about the way I feel on my quest to figure out who I really am
thanks so much for sharing this, it really helped me!
The posting in the link is very insightful, and describes my feelings right now.   Thank you GolemNardah for sharing.
Thats really interesting. I know I and some other trans people have a hard time understanding what it’s like to be trans but have no physical dysphoria. Thank you so much for sharing this
Do you still get euphoria?
Thank you so much for sharing this! I hadn't seen it before and I needed it today
Thank you so much for sharing this article. 💜
Wow, that’s fits me so well. Thank you for sharing this!
Thank you for sharing this, I wish I had read this years ago
Excellent article!
Thank you so much for posting this, it is so similar to my experience and it is so wonderful to hear I'm not the only one.
Holy crap that article is so ridiculous accurate to how I've felt my whole life. It put into words what I've experienced as a trans woman who didn't really have much dysphoria growing up and definitely didn't always ""know"" Thank you for sharing it.
Yeah, I agree, hopefully I can talk to one sooner rather than later
Yeah, that’s true, I can’t wait for that
Well, that’s really nice to know, and it made me euphoric for some reason
Those are basically the exact words running through my head. I recently realized I’m most likely trans but it’s been such an emotional rollercoaster of self doubt. 

Hell some days, I even wonder if it’s all just a fetish, which makes me feel awful and disgusting because I feel like I’m making slight of something very serious.
…yeah okay I can see now that I’m very clearly trans hahaha

And also, you’re valid, girl!
Thank youu, I’ll try my best not to be too mean to myself, it probably isn’t too healthy for me

And you’re a valid guy no matter what anyone says <3
Yeah, that would probably be the healthiest thing to do. It won’t be long before I turn 18, so I’ll have a look at my options at that time, but thank you very much for the input
Ah, I also identified as agender for a while for the same reason, in my case it was only a couple of months though

And it helped a lot! I couldn’t help but smile at being called a woman
I’m also in that exact situation, except with flipped genders, just remember that you’re a valid guy :>
Thank youu, I’m happy to be part of it :>
Hmm, you’ve got a good point, I also get a lot of euphoria sometimes
So much in the same boat right now! Even the beard…
I should engrave this onto my forehead, because I keep forgetting that this is the real path. No labels, just following what makes me joy.
Well, that’s actually a quite good point and helped me a bunch, thank you :>
She should accept herself, don’t be transphobic.
Well, it really can be

*hugs*
I am afraid I will be a weak woman. Both physically and mentally. I am not feeling content as a man now, but at least I am independent and outwardly strong…
Sorry for the essay. I am write many words.
Sadly I'm also in ur shoes and need to reset and forgive myself constantly for nagging thoughts. Most are pre-discovery feelings that I don't know how to communicate now that I've discovered. Ya know?
Yeah, it's pretty exhausting emotionally.
I’ve run across that article before, and I’m ad she posted it. I’m getting at least as much out of it the second time is the first time.

“And that was exactly how it felt — like a wish — a childish fantasy as absurd and wonderful as being able to fly.”

Toooootally fits exactly how I’ve been fit a looooong time. 

“My gender identity began as gender desire. Being a woman began as a desire to have a feminine body and to be seen and treated as a woman.”

So much. 

I relate to your Op too 

Oh my gosh, I stumbled across that detrans group earlier, and they are soooooo gross. One thing to question who you are and discover you are your agab, quite another to think and say the grotesque things those people say.
I think we're in the same boat generally speaking! That article helped me a lot feel comfortable with the label ""woman"" ❤
Ty for this comment. It mirrors my experience pretty closely.
Ditto, but going in the other direction. 😳
I felt the same when I read it ❤
My life literally changes SO QUICK after reading this article, I understand it may not do the same for everyone, but after 25 years of fighting myself one way or another I FINALLY found PEACE with myself and the world. It is TRULY amazing the feelings I am having now and the COMPLETE change in perception, everything I did before was honestly done in part by hate and disgust, disguising itself as good feelings, and now I feel like all I want to do is put LOVE into this world ❤ Every person in the world should feel what I felt last night, I was crying for an hour and a half straight, then couldn't stop myself from smiling for almost 4 hours. I really really wish that the MESSAGE can be heard by ALL and if you are reading this (or not) I love you and LOVE truly makes the world go around!!! It is one of the things that is ALWAYS present, like your nose, but you fail to see it until it's POINTED OUT. Words cannot describe these emotions, it cannot POSSIBLY capture the beauty of feeling inner peace. 😍 I want everyone to know regardless of how you feel towards anyone or anything, you are loved and once you feel that LOVE, your life too will change!!!
You're welcome, love! ❤ I hope it helps.
You're welcome 😊
I don't have proof that there is an end goal for us (I'm a baby trans) but I full intend to go full woman because I have a lot of SOCIAL dysphoria.
Yupp! Socially mostly but I plan to start exploring physical expression soon.
Same haha
When i doubted if transition was the right choice and maybe i would regret it, ive told myself well if you dont even try it youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life anyway
Mission accomplished. 😊
ABSOLUTELY!!! If I’m not casually pulling myself out of it with those initial thoughts my mind immediately goes to “I’m just a sick pervert with an intense fetish that is destroying my mental health”
Oh don’t worry, I’m even further back in the denial phase than you are lol. I can’t even take my own advice! But if I can help others then that’s a silver lining :) thank you
Hey thank you!
Oh wow you’re so young. There is resources I think for minors that need gender therapy too depending where you live. 

Remember that self discovery is a process, it doesn’t have to move quickly so don’t feel pressured that you have to figure it out or make any changes you’re not comfortable doing yet. I’m 34 and still figuring things out :)
I'll swap bodies with you promise😩
While the label means a lot for some people, so many focus too much on that and miss out on a lot of potential happiness. 

Enjoy your journey and remember you deserve all the love and happiness this universe has to offer ❤💙
But correct me if I'm wrong; doesn't it feel like paper maché anyway? 

In my case I felt like I had to put up this strong front all the time, I was absolutely never happy though. Now I feel like embracing my femininity takes WAAAAAYYYYY more guts. You will start to feel strong because you are doing something for yourself. People don't like it? Fork them. They can remove their bigoted forking behinds from your life and you will be better off. 

Be inwardly strong, you deserve it. And I promise you can do it. Give yourself a chance
Doesn’t have to be ❤️
That’s amazing and I’m super happy for you 🥰 it always makes me happy when someone who’s been struggling with this stuff comes to find acceptance of themself and their experiences and until I accepted that I was trans I always wondered why it made me so genuinely happy to see trans people go from confusion and struggling with their identity to finding themselves and accepting it and being happy and comfortable in their own skin, until finally I was like “well duh ofc it makes you happy cuz *that’s what you want you dumbass egg* lol
Ofc! I’m honestly happy I’m finding a bunch of others who have a very similar experience to mine.
What I meant by proof is that if you feel dysphoria that's strong enough I'm pretty sure others can tell there's something going on where as if you don't feel dysphoria at least not strongly it would probably go unnoticed and it's much easier to push aside as did the person writing that article it sounds to me like you very much do have an end goal in sight and I hope you get there and find your happy place
You’ve got a good point, I can’t spend all my life in constant dysphoria. I still wanna be fully sure first though
Still pre everything but this reasoning is basically my top motivation for transitioning when I'm doubtful
It’s like you’re reading my mind and voicing my thoughts word for word. I have never had as much doubt about who I was as I did (and still do) after telling myself “I’m pretty sure I’m a woman”.
No problem!
Yeah, I’m guessing it’s getting a bit easier for young people to discover now, thanks to the internet :>

I’ll take my time with self discovery, I don’t wanna do anything I’ll end up regretting, and best of luck to you!
Yesss, that would be amazing
You are totally right! I was never brave, where I have already been much braver since I came out to some people.
You are totally right! I was never brave, where I have already been much braver since I came out to some people.
You are totally right! I was never brave, where I have already been much braver since I came out to some people.
I would definitely like to know how. My emotions are crazy dealing with this.
Usually if u only go on hrt for a month you would know if its for you or not  and only a month would not really cause irreversible physical change
Right! The first time I ever got a chance to fully transform my appearance with shaving, clothes, wig, and makeup I almost cried because I was so happy… that’s gotta mean something right!?
Message me and we can talk about it. Last year this time I was in such a horrible depression I nearly didn’t make it out and now I’m happy and thriving. I’d love to share my experience and possibly help you
Oh right, I didn’t really consider that, haha

Thanks a lot, I have a clearer plan of action now :>
6 weeks into HRT and all my doubts are fading away bit by bit. It just feels right. I am still uncertain about some things, but I've accepted that I will probably never be 100% certain, as Non-Binary.
It sure does! I know our biggest enemy is our mind but I hope we both can one day overcome it and focus on the good feelings, rather than the negative ones.
Yeah I’m having a hard time right now as well. I definitely feel like I am not dysphoric enough to be trans, and I had a demiboy friend who told me that me using the word “dysphoria” to describe my feelings was insensitive and wrong since I wasn’t depressed enough (this really hurt me and ironically gave me more dysphoria). Im gender fluid and have had a really hard time accepting it and sometimes just opt for ignoring the fact that I’m male sometimes. I end up feeling as if it’s not possible for people to love me because my gender fluxes.
Yea in the begining when everything starts to feel right and i still had doubt i was like, i might not be sure what am i yet but i now know 100% im not a boy 😆 i was like am i enby or a girl? But im pretty confident now being a women is the right way to live my life
Virtual hugs!! We’re gonna be alright. 

We. Are. Valid.  regardless of where life takes us. And we’re not freaks. Just need to remind ourselves of that every once in a while
I’m so sorry that you feel that way :( I should have mentioned that I’m trans and transitioned socially back in June and that’s the reason for me being happy and thriving"	r7bsws	trans	1425	0.97	2021-12-02 16:56:57
Anxiety, Dysphoria and Depression: Being transgender in Russia nowadays is fucking hell.	"I am very, very tired.   


Now my country is getting isolated from the outer world and there would be problems with my HRT evidently. Moreover, I am got expelled out of my second university due to my desolation and depression. I can't do anything: studying, chilling, even getting outdoors. My parents are vehemently against trans\*people and I can't even dream of getting on anything, but blockers, with them. I am living in immense pain every day.  


And as my country is at pointless war right now and I am expelled from the university, and we have mandatory army service, and I am MtF transgender, I could be sent to Ukraine to kill innocent people. To die in misery, hatred and dysphoria.   


I hate myself, this country and this world."	"I am sorry that you are in such a despondent situation! You don’t deserve to be denied access to trans health care regardless of what views you held in the past and I very much hope you can find a way to avoid military service because you certainly don’t deserve to be forced into the army either. You deserve like anyone else to be who you are without fear 😞
Fuck. I have been keeping y'all trans Russians in my heart. As a trans Texan, we are used to the government coming for us, and seeing y'all is a chilling reminder of where things can end up. We have to keep fighting where we can. If we can change even one mind, it's a huge victory.
And, yeah, I lost nearly all of my friends due to suicide threats, whining and aggression attacks. .\_.  


Death.
There's mandatory army service even with something like depression? I'm pretty sure you would get disscualified here in my country if you have anything that prevents you from functioning normally, but not much would surprise me with Russia anymore. I'm sorry you have to deal with all that
I don’t really have much to say about your situation on the whole, and I *really* don’t know how likely it is you’ll get conscripted and get sent to the frontline, but if you (or someone you care about) is, 

If you surrender to Ukrainian forces and say the word “million”, the Ukrainian government will offer you asylum and 5million rubles with which to start a new life. 

I don’t envy your situation, and if you were conscripted and forced to make that kind of choice, it would be a massive decision, no doubt. But if the worst comes to pass for you (or again, someone you care about) just know that option exists.
If you get sent to Ukraine, ditch Russia. Literally seek Asylum. Maybe you could start a new life somewhere new..
I feel you. With our country's anti-LGBT policies and just general homophobia among the population I am basically forced to live in the closet. I've been essentially robbed of my youth. And now with this """"""special military operation"""""" and the subsequent sanctions from the west, I am being robbed of my future as well.

Apart from all that. Is there a chance that an F64.0 diagnosis can help you dodge the military service?
Is there a way to get out?
Try searching for a doctor that could diagnose and help you with your depression. I doubt that someone's interested in forcing a depressed person into army service, especially if you pose a risk to yourself. Find a doctor that could help you. At least someone must know how to make the correct diagnosis.   
I was depressed for almost all my life, and it took me a while to understand that it's not about my character but because of my brain's dysfunction. I've tried various doctors and therapy methods, and I almost gave up and fell into despair and suicidal thoughts. Thanks to my friend who spent all his time with me and convinced me to give it one more try with ketamine therapy he learned about on https://www.andalahealth.com/condition/treatment-resistant-depression/. I can't say it made me a joyful optimist, but my life became better, and I see more ways out than simply dying.
Friend we see and hear you.

It takes so much courage to be yourself when you don’t easily line right up with your peers and environment.

Wish I had something more concrete to offer, but keep telling and writing your story. There are fellow humans who care and want to know you.

Also, hope you do get little happy moments once in a while and can embrace and hang onto those.
Same as Polish trans person I understand you well, only saving grace I got out of shithole back in 2008 and I live in the UK - which I would take any day.

Still danger of conscription is always here, my past doesn't let me escape. I am enrolled as reservist and I get anxiety daily if I get conscription letter in mail any day because of this madness.

Not much I can tell you, just after this bullshit calms down and world don't collapse yet, do get out of Russia, it's not a place to thrive as trans person.

I admire strength to people like me and you, who are having to deal with backward countries like the east - stay strong, we as slavic people always had strong tolerance to life obstacles and always will

Sending love,Alex
If you need out of Russia, please consider contacting the Rainbow Railroad, and come to Canada!
I’m sorry of what are you’re passing through, you deserve to live in a better place
Can the Russian LGBT network help you escape?
The world really is an awful place :(
Come to New Zealand and claim asylum, fuck living like that! Can also send a plane load of haters to Russia and other non accepting countries (this would include some politicians too!)
Sister we're here for you! *Hug* My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with you. 💜🌈🥰🙏
ik its hard to hold on but i believe in you! someday you can move on from the past and become the person you know you are, and it'll be worth it. good health to you sister!♡
Join army - go AWOL and surrender to Ukraine. They treat Russian prisoners well there, and you may be able to take an immigration plea if it seems possible you'll be executed on return. It's risky as fuck but really about the most viable option I can see unless you want to wait a while
I was in the shower last night thinking about you all. Sending so much love your way. You all aren’t defined by y’all’s dictator in this Americans eyes.
I feel you, I'm studying here. I fucked up my higher mathematics exam recently because of spending most of the time to ease my depression instead of learning how to solve damn integrals and Fourier series. And after my another failed relationship (she broke up with me yesterday) I'm close to this fucking hole again, after half a month of feeling euphoric. The fact that I can't find E here makes everything even worse. Хотелось сказать ""прорвёмся"", но уже и сама выгорела. Держись.
I really hope things will get better for you and your trans peers in Russia. Much love from Hungary.
I am sorry you are on that situation, keep yourself alive and get out of rusia ASAP!
I'm so sorry you are trapped in the shitshow.😪
We’ve never met (and idk if this is helpful in the slightest) but I don’t hate you. And I’m glad you posted on here. It’s a horrible situation but your life is worth so much. 

You are courageous for every single moment of patience that you exercise. 

[poetry = medicine?](https://buddiesinbadtimes.com/blog/trans-day-of-remembrance/)
You are loved by your community and I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this.
I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I'm an America who's a trans woman and I fucking hate my life. I'm hoping things will get better when I tranisition.

..but if you ever need to chat or vent lemme know
Bruh, the worst thing I can totally relate to this... Fuck Russia and stupid transphobic ppl. I hate it here. I can't even afford to buy a binder now
Я ничего не могу сказать... Мои соболезнования, подруга ((

Держись там. Надеюсь, будущее будет лучше...
Western intelligence agencies are predicting the collapse of the Russian invasion by Sunday, within the following weeks sanctions and restrictions will slowly reduce back to a state of normalcy, faster if putin gets assainated which becomes more likely with every passing second.
Op Listen I know things are tough the fact that you have to deal with this is devastating but please don't hate your self I hate hearing about this and I wish i could come straight to Russia and give you a hug I so sorry if you ever need to vent I'm here to lend and ear. I hope your situation improves and you get all the support you need. I am here to support. I may be young but I hope I can make  your day better. Things will get better Op I promise.
Aww, my country is in a terrible situation. And I feel really terrible for the trans\*people who  are in the end of their transition, because I am at a start :(
Yes, I've heard that things are also getting worse for you recently. My heart is with you <3
[removed]
Previously I was an avid Putin supported, hated LGBTQAPPI+ folk, minorities and everybody else, so obviously deserved.
In Russia it is the case with endogenic depression, but I don't have it ""out of nowhere"".
Thank you, but what 5 million rubles?
Oh, I don't think so... Army will kill me :E
Yes, I bet, but my psychiatrist refuses to give it to me due to me being too emotionally impaired and depressed, so she is scared I will start HRT and kill myself.
I can get Armenian citizenship, but it is also a very conservative country and only after transitioning :з
Thank you <3
Does Poland also have mandatory service?  


Thank you, lots of love!
Thank you!
Oh, I already seek it.
Sadly, yes :(
Thank you! But seeking asylum is very hard, it is guaranteed only when you are really persecuted.
Thank you!
Thank you <3
Thank you <3
I can feel you too, especially since first time I was expelled exactly from the faculty of mathematics. Yeah, now I can't study at all, I can't concentrate on anything and even start a task due to enormous anxiety. Death.
Are you willing and or able to relocate to another country?  You might be able to apply for asylum based on persecution.
Please be safe.
[removed]
First and foremost, your guilt does not take priority over your survival. You have the right to EXIST and LIVE. You are not in a country that welcomes your unique challenges right now, and your social context can actually be a threat to your safety. Do what you have to do to stay safe and stay alive. As far as your previous viewpoints in life…

No one *deserves* suffering. Suffering, in retribution for an injustice, is not justice. At best, it’s revenge.

Justice for wrongdoing is by doing what’s right. Rehabilitation, reparation, restoration. If you can’t fix what’s been wronged, then do better. Right away, by admitting who you are and realizing that your earlier viewpoints were wrong, you’ve already done so much better.

If someone has done something wrong, and they refuse to do better, then maybe we can talk about that. But I get the impression that isn’t you.
No, nobody deserves to feel the way you are.

Yes, you held some shitty beliefs in the past, but that doesn’t define the rest of your life. You deserve to be able to live freely as yourself, like all people do.

I would suggest you look into the process of applying for asylum in the EU. Many EU member states will accept LGBT  asylum seekers who are at risk in their homes countries.

Your opinions have changed, you don’t deserve this hell because of what they were.

If you do get conscripted, look for the first opportunity to surrender to Ukrainian or EU forces (if it gets to that point). Ukraine has been good about accepting surrender, especially as it’s clear a lot of Russian forces are just scared kids.
Perhaps you have some insight into how to change minds then? Would anything have changed your mind short of survival?
That’s not true.

There are a lot of us who were in the same boat as you starting out, holding bigoted views of LGBTQ+ people. Even I did, when I was very young. I was raised Catholic and went to a religious school. It was only after attending a public high school and becoming an atheist that I realized what I believed about LGBTQ+ people was wrong, and that I too was part of that community. 

No one deserves to feel the pain of dysphoria. I would not wish it on my worst enemy - let alone a fellow trans person who is clearly repentant and has changed their views.

I have seen someone mention Rainbow Railroad here. I would heavily advise looking into them, if you are able.

My thoughts are with you. Stay strong and know that there are so many people out there who love you. If there’s anything I can do to help, no matter how small, just say the word.
A mark of intelligence is being able to recognize when you're wrong and change your opinion based off new facts.
Keep on growing and maybe one day you'll be the voice of reason everybody needed to hear.
Not deserved, you weren’t you! You were a character designed to survive socially and in front of your parents. Please sister take care and get out of there as soon as positive! I send u a hug!!! ❤️
I’m not quite sure I understand your question? As in which country’s currency? Since Ukrainian currency is not called rubles, I can only assume it would the equivalent of 5m Russian rubles
We have seen videos of Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian civilians. They are welcomed. They know you did not start the war Putin did. From there I think you would have a better chance at asylum.
Would I be possible to use Reddit to get in contact with Ukrainian forces/people ? Or maybe someone to vouch/sponsor you?
I agree that would be a dangerous move. But the army will already treat your life as forfeit. At the right place and time, you could have an opportunity to get out and away before anyone can do something about it. Worth keeping in the back of your mind at least. 
I'm so sorry you are in this, my dear. Thank you for telling us what's going. Grace to you.
Excuse my ignorance 🥺
I recetly read about some trans woman coming here to Czechia and it's not bad. I'd welcome you here if you were able to move here.
No, but every male got to sign up to get their military fitness category at the age of 18 - I was forced back then too and got category A, which means fit for war and peace call ups. It's like territorial (reserve) army pretty much.

Little they know stuff changed a lot and being trans gives u category D - which means unfit for call ups during peace, but fit for war.  
Also developed crap ton of mood and personality disorders, so yeah I bet I will make an excellent soldier...
any results? any progress?
That's why we need to try and make it as good as it possibly can get!!!
That's sad. Btw have you tried to save up for a comission? AFAIK it could help you avoid the army
Thank you <3
[removed]
Thank you a lot, but I mean, that making other suffer always causes inner suffer. Hatred and bigotry is internalised suffering.   


I try <3
I am sorry, but I don't think they will accept me. EU has strict rules about this, and I don't think I qualify, sadly :(
Thank you <3
Uhm… Dysphoria did that to me :D

And brought a lot of pain. I don’t think I have parents now, which is especially painful.
Thank you a lot <3
I mean, from which country? I bet that Ukraine will give me money in Russian currency :D
I don't think so. The situation is quite heavy
Thank you!
I don’t think, I will, I nearly have any reasons to run :>
Oh, unfit for call ups? In Russia we have it unfit even for war, but they are rigorous on the diagnosis.

I heard someone on reddit say Poland (not the greatest for LBGT rights, I know) is offering asylum to Russians that surrender. Don't know if it's true or not but it's worth exploring.
I’d look into getting asylum in Germany personally … the rules aren’t very strict or demanding and there are a lot of Russian and English speakers :)
Being able to change your own views, whatever the catalyst, is a sign of intelligence. Being able to admit you were wrong is a sign of humility. You're in a terrible situation right now that is caused by things that literally have nothing to do with you. You (and the vast majority of Russian people) do not deserve what's happening to you. 

As for parents, I know it's hard. I lost my mom to cancer when I was young and my father was emotionally abusive. I finally cut contact with him about three years ago, and honestly, that's been freeing. However to be an ""orphan"" when your parents are living is a strange and difficult way to engage the world. Knowing that on some level they love you but can't or won't accept you for who you are is very painful indeed. But I can say, a few years down the road, it feels good to be able to stand on your own two feet, despite not having support from them. 

I'm very sorry for your current situation. For what it's worth, you have my love and support. Do everything you can to survive this. Hopefully it will be over sooner rather than later.
Just looked around a touch, looks like they’d be willing to pay in cash, to a bank account, or in cryptocurrency. Annoyingly, I can’t find a source saying what currency it would be in if you took cash (I would assume they’d give you the equivalent of 5m rubles in Ukrainian Hryvnia, because giving you a useless currency would be an asshole move), but I don’t think it would matter as much if you took payment to a bank account or in crypto. Hope this helps
Yeah there is category E too, which means unfit for both war and peace military.  
You gotta be pretty 'messed up' to get it

[removed]
I really don't want to go to the war though :<
I don't think so. I am severely embarrassed by what the majority of Russians are doing with this war. All of my parents and relatives are cheering for this war, this is disastrous :,<  


Thank you!
Maybe it is Russia? I've heard Russia pays its citizens 5 mil for the world.

Visited a psychologist to tell my problem of gender dysphoria with really high expectations	"Went to a psychologist today (he was a franciscan friar) and opened up my issues to him(I'm a closeted trans girl). He told 'keeping myself busy' can help like seriously? I'm having problem with my gender identity from my childhood and he thinks that can help? Is he insane or what?

Edit: Thanks for all the supporting comments🥰 (idk if it's the right word English isn't my first language lmao)

Edit 2: Thanks for 1k upvotes💖 Sorry if I missed any comments"	"Oh yeah totally, closeted ftm transgender here and I “distract” myself by crying in the shower almost every night 😐

Get a real therapist! They have no idea what they’re talking about!
Didn't you know? Wordle cures dysphoria.
that is not a good psychologist someone who tells you to just sit and let your problem stir... that doesnt help that doesnt fix anything

I would recommend finding someone else
*facepalm*  get to a real therapist!  One who specializes in trans issues and identities
Keeping yourself busy actually can help, but if it's the only thing you're doing then that's a problem. You can only transition so fast, and in the meantime you can still be struggling, so that would be a good time to occupy yourself.


When I was waiting for my HRT appointment I felt horrible, and distracting myself did in fact help while I waited.
In language arts I did vocab last week. Time to put it to use. This person's brain is *void* of any brain cells.
That is is really hard! I am sorry! <3 I would say if you are under 18, try to talk to a school counselor (make sure to ask them if the information you discuss with them will stay confidential. Some states, districts, countries have some rules about disclosure that are different for lgbt folks, unfortunately.) otherwise I would google “LGBT therapy near me.” There might be some resources that are on a sliding scale depending on where you live. I live in the US, so that kind of effects my knowledge of resources. Most importantly Stay Strong Sister!
Keep yourself busy by finding a new therapist. Therapy is challenging, but it’s never dismissive.
The crazy thing is that even at the most Christian of social work schools (Baylor) their program is absolutely trans affirming. That doesn’t mean everyone graduates from there learning to be trans affirming, just that there’s no excuse to not be. 

I don’t know if they still do this, but police used to send kids into gas stations to buy cigarettes and then they’d fine the store if they actually sold them. They need to do that with medicine. Send in actors posing as patients and fine the practitioner for giving non-evidence-based advice. Like I know my 71-yr-old father is trans affirming with his patients, it is possible for everyone, no matter how old, to stay on top of recent scientific findings in healthcare. These people are just letting their bigotry get in the way of their knowledge acquisition.
He's mostly wrong, but we spend a lot of time waiting so keeping yourself busy can help when the solution to your problem is still months/years away. That can't be all you do though, you still need to work towards your transition just not all the time.
Religious based background told me from a million miles away the dude was gonna be about as helpful as a strainer on a sinking boat.
> he was a Franciscan friar

Found your problem
I tried ""keeping myself busy"" for like 24 years, It. Does. NOT. Work. 

Cis people really shouldn't be allowed to dish out advice on dysphoria, gender identity and transitioning, idk why so many think they're an authority in the subject.
Ah, yes distract yourself with idle tasks in order to help run from your problems.

Sounds like another cis therapist who doesn't ""get it"" you can't run from being trans, it will either catch you or leave you depressed.
He is way off in left field.  Find someone better to open up to and ignore the friar.
I had a therapist who said and i quote 

""Some men like it to wear female clothing, its a common fetish and nothing to be afraid of""

Yeah let that sink in. Btw he was 2 years before  Retirement
I really hate “trained psychologists” who have all these qualifications and yet they have no clue and the passion in helping and understanding their patients, that its essentially sideswiping their problems.

Find a transgender community counselor where you are from. You will find a better time, advice, resources, and price overall. 

I wish you luck girl🍀🙂🏳️‍⚧️❤️
I have had 3 psychologists speak to me like this! I live in Central Georgia and am waaay beyond frustrated! I can truly sympathize with you but do not have a solution…….. sadly enough………sigh😭
Maybe he’s onto something. Transitioning has kept me pretty busy.
It distracts you from your dypshoria quite a lot. I got into airplane and rocket design and its done wonders for me lol
Unfortunately a lot of mental health providers are extremely ignorant on Trans needs.
Bruh you talked to a member of a cult that is always doing homophobic/transphobic shit about being trans, of course they're going to say transphobic shit about it.
As a psychologist, I'm sorry this happened to you. We are people too, and we are all ignorant and lacking knowledge in various areas to some degree. It's important to find someone who is both knowledgeable about what you want to discuss and has a compatible personality. I'd recommend looking for a therapist who specializes at least in LGBT clients if not specifically trans clients. Then you'd only have to weed them out based on personality. Wishing you the best of luck.
It’s actually working to some extent. I’ve kept myself busy all the years to forget who I really am. I was kind of workoholic. The downside is it’s not solution forever. Once the pandemic hit and The activities have been reduced I was hit by dyshoria big way for two weeks in a row. That time I’ve decided I have to start HRT. But in general yes keeping busy, running etc. actually helps to reduce dysphoria to some extent, but it’s not solution and it might not work for everyone.
I knew a Franciscan, they are not accepting in private. In public maybe, but they’re Catholic. Preach “hate the sin, love the sinner” essentially. They try to pretend as much as possible and then speak up when they feel things have “gone too far.”

I’m pretty sure the one I knew suspected I was lgbt and he knew I was a struggling student because I’m neurodivergent. he worked at my school) and I often felt like he thought of me as less intelligent or able because of those things. Whether he’d admit that or not is really the problem here, so I’ll never know…
When I needed an evaluation on my identity I went to a psychologist who was trained on gender issues, I believe that not all the psychologist have the right training to deal with this topic.... May try to find one who's specialized.... Good luck❤️
Hello 👋😊 Which expectations did u have? Like I can imagine to find a person in medical field who is able to understand and comfort u in ur problems right? First of all, I am so proud of u, that u did open up to a person with medical profession and even u don't see it, but just by open up yourself to this person u did make a change and a step forward especially in the medical field to be more open about being trans! Thank you! 

I believe that you are not alone in your city environment! The chance is that there a lot more people who are closed! But as I said u did a step to open up, you learn from it, you get reinsurance here and from yourself. See it as a kind of practice to live openly ☺️✨ you get through it, i promise 🤗
I see a lot of people commenting to get a “real” therapist and just wanted to add, in addition to criteria like specializing in LGBTQ+ issues, make sure    
the therapist is still licensed to practice psychology. A 
PhD or doctoral level psychologist will have “LP” at the end of their name, for example, “John Smith, PhD, (or PsyD)LP.” A masters level psychology will have an LLP, “John Smith, MA (or MS), LLP. 

It’s one thing to have the degree, but being licensed means that there is additional experience the individual has had. I’m hold a Masters degree in Clinical Psychology, so I have 500 hours of clinical experience, but I’m not licensed to practice, (for other personal reasons which I won’t get into) which in my state requires an additional 2,000 hours plus taking and passing the licensing exam. 

Just information to spread for anyone seeking therapy!
Replace the therapist.
That's basically what I did for a solid decade of my life to repress shit, just focused on school/work every waking second. What a miserable waste of my teens and in the end you backslide into depression and end up friendless without the motivation to get out of bed.

So, all in all, fuck that advice.
Sounds like it's related to the stereotype that being trans is for young people with too much time on their hands, like it's because you're doing too much introspection when you should be working. I might be wrong, but that's what came to mind when I read it. I hope you can find someone more professional.
Definitely not a psychologist to stay with... keeping yourself busy can distract you, sure, but it's not gonna fix the deeper issue. It's like a bad marriage that gets temporarily patched over by having a kid (not a fix, but happened to one set of my grandparents so it's a familiar comparison at least). Sure, you can put your issues aside and focus on a kid for some 18-years, but once that kid moves out you're stuck facing the issue again...

I'm sorry it didn't work out, though. There are unfortunately good and bad psychologists, but please keep going for yourself if you're able two. I'm on my third and he's the first one I've felt truly comfortable with as well as the most helpful. Gender incongruence shouldn't be pushed off as just an impulsive thought that can be waved off
I'm not blaming you for your experience because it's on him, but I don't know why you expected anything else from a Christian therapist, and a Franciscan at that.
-.- 

Time to replace that therapist.
""keeping yourself busy"" basically just means ignoring the issue or pushing it back. Basically, that psychologist is a fucking prick.
Tried that one in high school and college, didn't work...
I tried keeping myself busy as a coping mechanism for gender dysphoria. It got me professional success, burnout and depression, and guess what ... I am still trans.
You need someone who specialises in gender. They have quite a few where I live as it's a requirement to see a specialist before HRT or surgery
He doesn't sound trans-allied at all. He is denying your experience. Find someone unaffiliated with religion, lgbtq friendly if you can, but also look for younger therapists, that may help. Check for interns at schools where there are programs to teach therapists, they are often current with  better information.
thats only reasonable advice if you literally cant do anything else to alleviate dysphoria
If it’s rooted in catholicism, (which franciscan friars definitely are) you can bank on it being transphobic. (And rooted in white supremacy, which is also transphobic) It often comes from projection, because if they have to challenge/change their perception of gender/sexuality as constructs to help other people feel comfortable, it requires them to explore or even think about themselves and that scares the shit out of christians. I’m sorry this person was transphobic to you, and took advantage of you confiding in them, that is absolutely disgusting. I hope you’re able to find a resource for psych help that isn’t like that.
I mean, he's not *completely* wrong. One of the reasons I didn't come out sooner was because school took up so much of my time and effort that considering my gender fell by the wayside. It's not a solution, however, since it didn't address the issues but simply postponed dealing with them.
Idk if it’s different around the world, but that is a reason why you pick psychotherapist, not psychologist
This psychologist is so fucking stupid it sounds like a sitcom where the dumbass of the group has to fill in while the real psychologist is away. ""Have you tried not thinking about it?"" good lord it's somehow worse than telling depressed people to try being happy, what a fucking clown show of a career
That is a crock of shhh...bad stuff. I know you've said you live in a conservative area but so many councils do online now as well. I am proud of you for knowing who you are, don't let those that hate try to change you. Xx
Your first mistake was going to a church affiliate not associated with LGBTQ+ people. Go to an actual therapist- no amount of awkwardness is worth living with dysphoria. Try searching on lgbt subreddits for specific location therapists or your city lgbt resources.
He's not insane, but he IS a Franciscan friar, and he IS a Catholic and he IS not a trained gender therapist. 

He may indeed be a fine dude, and a licensed psychologist, but as an advisor snd confident for ***you*** as his patient/client, he's as dangerous as a spoonful of cyanide.

He almost certainly has NO idea what you're going through. He may not have even met a transgender person before, let alone tried to counsel one.

He means you no ill will nor harm. But he is NOT qualified. to help you. As a Catholic, he likely believes you are morally disordered, and that you somehow chose to be a trans person!

How do I know?  I'm a Catholic, and I've heard those exact words used in multiple masses.

Hate the sin, love the sinner they say. 

Right. Oh, and thanks SOOO much, by the way.

Thank him for his advice, and then find a qualified gender therapist. It's important that this person be a ***trained*** gender therapist. 

As a transperson who's been in therapy for years, I just don't believe you can get the quality service you need from someone who is ***not*** a gender specialist.

You just won't......
Tried that for 40+ Years. It didn't work. I transitioned. Within weeks I was happy.

Coincidence?
This is to be expected. Find someone recommended by the trans community.

And have a read of this

https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index#wiki_gatekeeping
I mean, being a friar and a psychologist at the same time sounds professionally dubious to say the least. Considering that religion and gender issues are like oil and water I don't think there'd be anybody worse suited to helping you
Oh I for sure kept myself busy. It only delayed my coming out
A Franciscan is probably not who you need to be  seeing. While I’m certain they are good for any number of non sexual issues, when it comes to sexual matters an order of monks will not have the knowledge to help you. Do you have friends who can introduce you to a psychologist? However, you may find the questions raised and asked could be very painful and make you question why you have dysmorphia. Sadly for some it’s peer/media pressure that is the catalyst and so they will really need you to be honest with them
Just don't go again to that person. My psychologist who isn't a gender one she wants me to act upon it.
Keep yourself  busy is actually not bad advice, really... You could stay busy with transitioning, finding a doctor to manage medical transition such as hormone therapy, start doing laser hair removal, filing all the name and gender change paperwork, shop for your new wardrobe, watching YouTube makeup tutorials, and finding a real gender therapist...do those things to keep busy and you will probably feel much better...
They are so limited, babe, because it’s outside their experience. And they think being you is a ‘sin’ so double whammy. 

I gave up on religion-based Counseling decades ago. They just don’t deal well with a kinky, exhibitionist, bisexual, parent of a trans teen who has pain and punishment issues.
So his solution was literally ""just run from your problems and pretend they don't exist""... Very ""professional psychologist"" of him ...
I don't believe super religious people should do any mental health anything. I had a therapist tell me to pray when that isn't a tool for abusive parents. You deserve to feel secure. Being busy isn't gonna give you that. Sure people can be religious but that isn't useful to to other people. I hope you feel better.
He is not wrong in the sense that keeping yourself busy can help distract yourself from the symptoms.... But that's all.


It's more important to deal with your issues than to just ignore them.


Hope you find proper help. Good luck.
How does someone have depression just do chores or smth
Keeping one self can be busy for general things like depression and anxiety, but really that's fairly ""Armchair Psychology"" right there.

Personally I find doing my nails, as someone who is potentially mtf, helps with giving me euphoria, but since I don't suffer from dysphoria I don't feel like I can give any great help there, sadly.

I'm self-conscious of appearance so I've worn things that can be hidden like knee-high socks and arguably more gender neutral stuff like painting my nails black and wearing arm warmers. I'm sure others here have much better advice.
That's my go to , to tell to anyone with anxiety depression. Because it helps me so much with mine. I don't see that helping you a bit tho...unless u have high anxiety.... what an idiot. I'm sorry. <3
It seems weird.. but I've heard this before too from others who live in pain.
Maybe he thinks everyone lives in pain. Maybe he does and thinks it's normal. Maybe he distracts himself..
Unfortunately trans people are still not validated even through all therapist - even LGB friendly. When looking for a therapist, make sure they are gender affirming and trans friendly. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Honey, it could be that he doesn't know and possibly doesn't understand what you're going through. In times of stress yes keeping your mind off of it could help but finding your gender identity isn't stress, it's stressful to some but getting help from therapists or maybe talking to someone about it could help.
Are you a psychologist?
Distracting  yourself is what alcoholics with depression are doing oftentimes, its not a cure its just a coping mechanism

&#x200B;

Find a better psycologist
Bullshit answer from therepist, they should have refered you to a gender therepist. Uou can have multiple therepists! Look for a Gender therepist or atleast someone who specializes in gender therepy and/or lgbtq+ issues. I have my first meeting with one next week, but I looked for one that specifically listed those things in their bio. They are a councelor technically but their speciality is gender and trans stuff. I will stay with my regular therepist but will be focusing on things like life goals and relationships with them. And gender/sexuality with the specialist.
I feel like this is common shitty advice because I was told to go to a psychologist for severe ibs and she was like ""just listen to music and distract yourself""

So yeah probably find someone else
I utilized my time going to the gym to work on developing my feminine figure. I got a corset to help shape my torso area and worked on my legs, hips, and butt. I eventually did go on HRT, and now I have a pretty passable body. So maybe try to set a goal for yourself to get a head start on your transition, and work towards that goal. That way you can distract yourself and start changing your body to better reflect your identity
Ikr he's super insane like i literally opened up all about myself to him and now I'm feeling awkward
I have never heard someone be so relatable here. Crying in the shower every night...
Never heard of that lol is that a video game? That's what google told me xD
Dysphoria doesn't exist in wordle world - too many letters 😂
I will try to find someone related to counselling about gender issues maybe
Yeaaaah...as soon as I saw ""Franciscan Friar""... 😬
But ignoring my thoughts to cure my dysphoria won't work. It is like denying myself for who I'm
Lmaoo trueee
True my dad told to go there cause he got phD in psychology. Atleast he should have tried to help me instead of bringing his conservative ideology there.
True lol many cis people (not all) thinks being trans is a disorder
So Truee like does he even know that being trans can't be cured
Yeah true it's jusr a fetish and not part of what your gender identity is

/S
Thanks I will🥰
Also idk but when you called me girl i feel so euphoric 😆
Yeah. Overworking and exertion does distract me a lot, though I do suffer do to it physically and mentally. It does work but it’s not a good idea
Thanks I'll try to find someone who is specialist in LGBT people
I'll come out too one day and i don't think denying myself and keeping busy won't work😕
Thanks a lot🥰🥰🥰you are really sweet🥰
He had a pHD in psychology so that's why i thought of visiting him. I thought he knew more.
Yes he's insane lol
Ikr. Some people think being trans is a disorder which needs to be cured
So sorry to hear, try finding an lgtbq therapist, anyone that’s near you
Im saddened to hear that I’m not the only one.
It's a phone game. There's a word you have to guess at every day. It's pretty simple and essentially a basic distraction.
it’s originally a new york times “game” they have a daily word and you have to guess it just google new york times wordle and you’ll see it. While it’s originally a new york times “game” like i said earlier there are downloadable games of wordle.
I have a gender therapist it's just a therapist who also has a specialty in gender studies. 

it's not like they have any less capabilities than other therapists but the one you just had doesn't sound like they had many capabilities
I tried distracting myself with conversations with myself in my head. It just got worse. I decided screw it this isn’t helping
Look gro psychiatrist, they can also help you if you need the hormones later. Plus more chances it’s get cover by the insurance.
I'm still baffled by this I would even reach out to the practice and file a complaint
But he had a phD in psychology from Switzerland. Didn't knew he was really bad and zero idea of what trans means
I hope you have better luck OP, I know it's not easy being in a conservative blackhole. It took a lot of blood sweat and tears to get out of where I came from to get real treatment.
I mean... the cure for being trans is.... transition, so....
Scientists have been hard at work trying to find the cure for being a boy and I am very interested in their research
Me too. It distracts, but I have suffered the consequences of it many, many times.
A pHD from WHERE?  There are plenty plenty plenty of religious based and backed educational institutions which likely wouldn’t be overly supportive of your situation.
Funny thing... there actually IS a cure for the hurt trans folks feel before transitioning... the cure is to actually transition\*. 

(\* in most cases. There may be exceptions to the rule.)
My place is super conservative so it's kinda hard to find one
If you want frustration, try Absurdle.
Not originally New York Times, they bought it for an obscene amount of money well after it got popular. Originally it was made by the guy who runs this website and that's also where it was hosted: [powerlanguage.co.uk](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/)
I don't want to be judgy, sweetheart, but in my experience most folks connected to a religion have tried to steer me to the straight and narrow...minded.
PhD means Phony Degree, DUH. All jokes aside it means jack sometimes since a PhD doesn't legitimize WHERE he got it from, the institution he got it from could've been just as narrow-minded and transphobic as he is. And it certainly doesn't teach compassion, forward thinking, and understanding.
Anything with Friar etc are compromised, they're religious ranks.
Switzerland is extremely conservative and happens to be quite transphobic.
my conversion therapist had a PhD.  nice guy, well meaning.  didn't have any real understanding of the world outside his own bubble.

lots of fields are really big... if someone doesn't specialize in a specific problem, they can be next to useless if called upon to deal with it.

e.g. i did electrical engineering degree.  i took \*one\* programming course, that i was allowed to pass only cos the instructor took pity on me (i used to sit in his office and he'd help me to do the programs cos i was so horribly lost).  But I was great with designing and building computer chips.  I somehow understood the deep physics intuitively.  But I couldn't do circuit design... just chip design.

So I could have worked in a fab lab and done well.  Anything else?  Nope, I was horrible.  My degree didn't mean I could do all E.E. things... just a very, very limited subset.

So, yeah, you would want to find someone who has studied gender issues and is expert in that particular part of psychology (although even then some of them still have the old Blanchardian garbage in their heads >.< )
I started art, archery and like two demanding clubs, like FRC robotics which I love. They are so trans friendly and it does distract well but the stress and deterioration isn’t worth it.
I've heard there is a service called pride counseling. They are a LGBT centric organisation of online therapists. It has been featured multiple times in Jammi Dodger videos he is a trans guy on YouTube who uses the service as well. But I don't have any personal experience with them myself.
I went to a therapist that said she worked with trans people but really she’d only worked with one trans person before me. She meant well I think and she wasn’t able to give me what I needed. 


There aren’t any LGBTQ therapists in my area so I understand the struggle. I ended up finding somebody good (a few hours away, geographically) who does virtual appointments. I found them through Boston Childrens hospitals GEMS program. Perhaps you could find your nearest healthcare institution that works with trans people and reach out to them for recommendations? Not sure if that helps, just an idea. Wishing you all the best.
Check out betterhelp.com
Check out some video therepy apps maby? Like better help, teleldoc, etc. 

My insurance provides free teledoc services, so I found an LGBT therepist through them. A lot of the actual therepists on there arnt even in my state. So finding someone shouldn't be hard. Also, there are open minded people everywhere even in the deep south, it's just harder to find those people in the south. You are not alone!
or for a challenge try [quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/).
Preach sister!
I'm mainly involved in robotics at my school, and its taken a bit out of me, but the club helped me grow as a person so I'm grateful for that
They get mixed reviews, it depends who you get matched with, but if nothing else you can specify you want a trans person as a counselor. They have to be better than this Friar.
Really depends who you get, I tried out pride counseling and got someone who told me at the end of the first session that my gender identity (non-binary) was definitely because of my relationship with my mother."	umyim0	trans	1339	0.97	2022-05-11 01:46:36
Did some cool makeup but my brain wont stop dissecting my appearance... anyone wanna help me fight my dysphoria? Lol		"You’re so gorgeous! 😰🖤
Can I borrow like .001% of your looks? You look amazing💜
You are so beautiful 🥺💖
OMFG ur gorgeous!
Honestly, when I first looked at this, I though this was Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.  I would say you're killing it!
Well if it helps, I though I was looking at r/fancyfollicles at first, only after I read the title did I notice the actual subreddit! You are absolutely gorgeous and I wish I could do makeup like that!
You look beautiful!!
This is such a lovely photo! You look so elegant!
Aaaaaa your so pretty my little pansexual heart can't take it 💜💜💜💜💜💜
even trying to dissect your appearance, I see nothing wrong here.  
Honestly you'd have to argue with me to convince me otherwise (what black magic did you use to achieve this?)
You are an enchanting moon goddess!
Girl, you look gorgeous! Ignore that mean ol' dysphoria, it's lying to you
I think you look awesome
Very pretty
i dont know what you are talking about but i think you look nice
Your hair is so pretty, as are you!
You are killing it girl I wish I looked as good as you do
Look, I didn’t even know I was on a trans subreddit and was confused because I don’t follow any makeup or hair things.
You look incredible! Beautiful job on the makeup too. I thought I was in witches vs patriarchy...
Literally thought of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman when I saw you! You are gorgeous!
I didn't realize what sub this was in, i thought it was from one of my Makeup subreddits. You are doing amazing!
If you were into other girls I would be all over you :)
BBE - Big Boudicea Energy
You’re good. You look fine.
You look like a modern Celtic queen looking off into the sunset after decapitating several Romans
You look so good! OMG

Unclockable from this pic, for sure. But if I knew you were trans and met you, I would be hitting you up for makeup advice. 

So, uh...got any advice?

There’s dysphoria days, then there are dysphoria days. This I know. 

I’ll tell you this though, that thing you’re searching for, you’re there. I’d go so far as to say you’ve always had it (because it’s true), but so many of us are searching for that piece that still feels missing, like maybe we’re one fine brush-stroke from being complete never quite making it. 

Next time you get down, remember just how beautiful you are. Even if you don’t feel it, do me a favor and look yourself in the mirror and say to yourself, “I’m fucking multitudes.”

14+ billion years of time to get here, an ocean of time after you’re gone, and here you are this bright flash of burning light. 

Keep. On. Burning. On. 

🌚 🔥🌙 ✌🏼 🌊

Edit: things, for artistic flair. Others, because reasons.
To dissect you in a positive light:

Your nose shape is exquisite. Perfectly proportional, smooth skin, slightly upturned, I know more than a handful of girls looking into nose jobs to have a nose like yours. 

A well known masculine straight is the distance between the eyes and eyebrows being small- yours is long and feminine, far away in a very naturally elegant and womanly line. 

You have full, heart-shaped lips that seem to naturally pout, and a cupid's bow to accentuate their daintiness. 

Your eyes are large and doll-like, and I love your eye makeup! Also, ughhh your eyelashes are SO LUSCIOUS!

Lastly, you have a cleft chin which is recognized by professionals to be a trait belonging to more attractive people. 

Hope this helped! :)
You look gorgeous. I love everything about this picture.
Como diría el de V de venganza, eres tú la qué piensa  eso o son ellos?.  Eres un Alinda chica con estilo de princesa gótica. Cuídate 😘

Beautiful Queen!! 
I immediately knew you’re a queen because...

The queen is the most powerful chess piece and you’re the most powerful Trans Queen in this world!!
You remind me of Raven from Teen Titans. It’s a good look, and I honestly can’t find any detail that could clock you as trans.
are you a Jaffa?
Your makeup is bad ass babe. I’ve been trying to do more looks lately
Omg you are sooooo beautiful 😻
You look great! Very feminine, also I really like that moon crescent on your forehead

You’re eyes are gorgeous, I’m incredibly jealous of your eyebrows because they look so good, hair looks extremely fun and comfy, makeup is on point, and the top is cute

Haha, whoops!! I’ve become too nerdy, there was this sci fi show and these alien women would sometimes have patterns on their forehead like that. 😳"	l75cn8	trans	1293	0.99	2021-01-28 19:00:44
I love being trans!!!	"I'm absolutely facinated by transitioning and there's so much beauty, poetry and strength in being able to transform my body like this! Of course dysphoria still sucks ass but I don't feel sad I'm not a ""real men"" or whatever. 

I just want to build this beautiful transexual body of  mine and obliterate gender!! I'll love my scars, my prosthetics and my ""trans voice"" with all my heart. 

Fuuuuuck the binary cisgender norm dude. Being trans rocks, being queer is based and being a freaky gender cyborg is the most poggers thing one can strive for!"	"the gender cyborg uprising is at hand, guys, girls and non-binary hos. We must unite!
The world desperately needs more trans joy. Thank you for your service!
I’ve started exploring who I am and who I want to be, despite the job I hate, a family who doesn’t share my views, and a government who would rather not accept me, I love who I’m becoming and the only the I would change is me exploring myself sooner!
This dude knows what's up! I'm a happy and proud transfem! Join all my fellow proud trans pals, we must unite,  together we shall reign upon this cis world!
Some dude called me a fag but I think the mods took it down (thanks guys!).

Just wanted to say that I totally am one and send a big fuck you to that guy ❤️
HECK YEAH! That's exactly the kinda thing I needed to hear today, thank you. Keep being great!
Finally! Someone who shares my opinion! As a matter of fact! I’ll make a post about it later too! I’m glad your living your life in the positive dude!
Gender cyborg🤣🤣🤣☺️ I love it
You go, dude!!! 

I’m so proud to be Non-Binary… I’ve never been this happy! Let’s unite and statt the trans-cyborg uprising.
I fucking love you
i hate being trans :(
Behind you with all my heart!
I will take control of my body, reforge myself through my will and my efforts!!!
<3 i love being trans as well, even though i am the only person that thinks it's a good idea for me.. i can't stop loving myself and i would rather be trans/non-binary than to be stuck in either gender! It's too much fun being able to express myself in all the ways i can think of <3  


even though my life is terribly lonely, there is so much more joy in it after i stopped telling myself what i should and shouldn't do regarding my sexuality- and instead going with how i feel <3 it feels like i finally belong somewhere..
wow, that's actually really uplifting! you don't usually see a lot of trans folks being this positive, it's incredibly refreshing and inspiring:) wish you all the best man and thank you for making me realize it may not be all that bad!
Gender cyborg should unironically be an earnest goal for trans people and everyone really. For example, ingesting and monitoring hormones has gotten easier over time for us, imagine having an implant that you have fine grained control over. Imagine having agency over the fluidity of your gender. The technology we have for our gender expression is limited by our imaginations, and there's potentially all manner of new genders in the future that we don't have the capacity to express today.
Hell yeah!! Thanks for cheering me up dude!!
Can't tell you how refreshing it is to see a post like this, usually it's all doom&gloom about transition.
I wish I didn’t have to be trans. I wish I was comfortable with myself. It’s scary and it’s a lot of work and I worry I’ll never accept myself. I’m glad you are in a healthy place
Thank you for inspiring to be myself today ❤️
HELL YEAH!!!!! 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Nothing makes me happier than seeing other trans people happy ❤️ Thanks for the shot of hope! 🏳️‍⚧️
We need more joy! And you delivered it!
Hell yeah! I feel similarly about myself and everyone else who's trans. We're awesome!
i love how there are people like you out there who also love being transsexual as hell :+)
heheh ahhh that’s awesome I see it the same way
This post is so wholesome and makes me so happy. I’m so happy that you are happy, friend! And you are absolutely right, being trans is BEAUTIFUL 💞💞💞💞💞
Did testosterone not change your voice?
It do be like that sometimes
i wish i could feel like this
Oh wow! This is such a positive vibe! Getting real good feelings here! Thank you for this!
Me
Good for you, I wish I could feel the same.
I can’t really say I agree, but I like your attitude!
FUUUCCCKK YASSSS QUEEEEN!!!
I don't want to be called a ""freaky gender cyborg"" or seen as ""freaky."" I just want people to see the man I am.
I feel you 100% in loving being trans! If I was born cis then I wouldn’t be who I am and have the journey I’ve had so far full of amazing people from this beautiful community💕 I’m trans and I don’t care who hates it! trans is beauty!
hells yea bro
Same here! Didn't even start HRT but socially transitioning, wearing the clothes I like and changing legally my name are the best things I could do in so many years!
I'm glad we share that happiness and pride despite adversities
Thank you!!!! You’re amazing 💙💖🤍💖💙
fuck yeah! being trans is the best way for us to be!
I’m a pretty stealth dude, and I agree. My trans body is awesome, and I’m glad being trans is a part of my identity.
This was so nice to read, thank you 😊
I love the attitude! wish it was unanimous
Honestly i feel the same, because i can't wait to get those flat chest scars. I can't wait to transition. I think scars are a way of telling that I'm a warrior, a survivor of dysphoria. They're battle scars and something in would be proud of. Sadly it will take a long time before I get them🥲
Well said
haha love the ""gender cyborg"" thing so true!! fucking love being trans
Lol, I freakin love your energy my dude.
I’m having so much fun reading this in a super hyped and fast voice one my head, I’m glad you loving being you ❤️
Just being you is outstanding positive 🙂
Beautiful!!!! Hell fucking yeah I’d give you an award for this if I had one, this is the spirit 😄🤘 celebration of raw authenticity
I can relate to being a gender cyborg. The altering of my body and hormones, thru the use of modern medical technology I'm becoming something ""new"" in society. I'm not a 'real man' or a 'real woman', and that's OK because I'm trans. We exist.
Check my screen name: I couldn't agree with you more (especially about the cyborg part)! :D
I always feel weird about people saying I'm a man. I'm not a man, I'm a TRANS man, for some people that may comforting but to me being trans is a very very big part of my identity, being trans comes before the fact I'm a man. This may have something to do with the fact I don't 100% identify with the male label it's more like 85%.
reading this made me 10x more happy of being trans :,)
i hate it :/
I think the term ‘transsexual’ is outdated and people should stop using it.
I wish I could feel the same way about this

It can be really hard to be ourselves with the world being a fucked up place, but we gotta at least try!! Wishing you the best with your exploration ❤️

By all means do it! I feel like our community can really benefit from different perspectives
This is the way
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Same
In perfect world no one would be trans. There is absolutely zero benefits of being trans, it's only logical to hate it.
i'm so happy for you!! although it may be really rough sometimes, this just shows how absolutely fucking *worth it* it is. i wish you all the best this world has to offer you, and i sincerely hope i can get to that point of self love one day
We can win my dude!! We just gotta keep moving foward!!
Completly agree with you, and I feel like that wouldn't even be for new genders, but that it would just render gender (as the opressive structure that i is) obsolete!

Having control over our sexes and reproductive fluids is simply allowing humanity to thrive!
Oh I'm not on T yet. Gonna start it soon tho :) 

The ""trans voice"" thing is just a name to how sometimes the voices of transmasc people can have a specific timbre to them due to testosterone being introduced later in life + ""feminine"" speech manners
That's completly fair man, all I'm sharing is my own feelings towards my identity! I've always been seen as a freak, so I just embraced it. 

There's nothing abnormal or monstruous about trans bodies and identities tho, it's all about the optics and the beauty of the archetype of the monster. It just speaks greatly to my experience.

I wish you all the best on your journey dude, you deserve to be respected as the man you are!
Duuude I totally relate to this!!
It's been a process for me you know? I think I feel like this because of a combination of having a suportive family and reading gender/marxist theory. I look at the fucked up injustices in the world and my anti-capitalist world view just makes me want to change it all and fills me with energy. 

So when I look at me being trans I only see how it revolutionary and beautiful it is, even if society really fucking sucks
Just did! Cheers dude 🥂🏳️‍⚧️😎
There's nothing more beautiful than trans joy. Being happy as a woman is genuinely the best thing ever for me. Everytime I see a happy trans person I am very happy by proxy. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What are you even on about? In a perfect world we wouldn't have violent binary fictions about people's bodies and behaviors and we could all thrive in our beautiful human diversity. Being trans rules and we only suffer cause our society's sick
True
: )  


it's a good and a bad thing.. loving yourself many times means giving up compromises you had with people up to the point when you accepted your own quirks....  


loving yourself can be a lonely thing- just keep that in mind... but being trans IS WORTH IT..... I would have been either homeless, a monster or stone cold dead at this point had i not started hrt
 I want to feel trans as in ""transhuman"" not just transgender. Trans as in transcendence, not transition. Gender should be an instrument we wield, practice, and create art and beauty with. A revolutionary inversion of power where our bodies are shaped by our consciousness and not the other way around.
I doubt such a timbre would be unique to trans men, and you’ll pick up masculine speech patterns quickly if you hang around enough guys. Just make sure you hang with cill guys, or you could wind up sounding like a douchebag. Oooh, and consider picking up singing!
thanks. I get treated like a freak a lot and it just hurts a lot, I can't get myself to embrace it. all the best on your journey too, dude.
That explains it, my family barely tolerates me and tries to get me to detrans, I'm also in germany where trans rights are kinda not very good and I have to diy my medical transition because there is only a single qualified therapist in my region and he only does group therapy, which won't fly for me.
this!!! it's so rare to see anything about trans people that's not depressing, this really made me feel a lot better🖤
We suffer because our bodied aren't what they should be.
Body dysmorphia isn't caused by this society, need for transitioning isn't caused by this society.

Being trans does not rule. It makes peoples killing themselfs, hating themself and their body, it's fucking expensive, getting surgeries and being in medication their whole life.. 
And no matter what, you won't ever be what you were supposed to be. Absolutely nothing rules about that.

If I were you, I would wait with the transitioning because it sounds like that you aren't planning it for the right reasons.
Oh I'm so sorry about your family and I had no idea Germany wasn't up to date on the access to medical transition

I got misgendered at work then corrected by a little girl.	"I work in an *undisclosed* uk supermarket and while on tills I basically get misgendered by every customer. Sometimes even correctly gendered then they go back and misgender me. It hurts but I just try let it go because otherwise it would drive me crazy. 

Last night though I had a couple come in with a little girl and as I was serving them the mum said “give the sweets to the man” and the little girl said “no... that’s a lady”. My week hasn’t been fantastic because of stress and dysphoria but that comment from her really helped, for the rest of the night it kept me going and staying positive. 

Hope this brings a little joy to anyone needing it :3"	"Sometimes kids say the best things
There is a german saying telling that children always tell the truth ❤
This is one of the few things I like about young kids. I find them super obnoxious but they've lived their entire lives in a world where being trans is quickly becoming accepted, so unlike older adults who aren't as used to it being as widely accepted as it is they just go along with it.
Keep celebrating the little things. And kids are also brutally honest in what you see, so I'd take it as a much bigger compliment.

I got told by my partner I look like a lesbian with my earrings in,  which is something at least.
I just want to let you know how brave you are for working at a place where you constantly get misgendered. I don't think I could stay sane in your situation, just remember that your mental health comes first before a supermarket chain ❤
That’s actually adorable
Kids are great. :) they’re funny sometimes, too. I remember one time, I was at a Cracker Barrel, and a blond lady with her, like, 10 year old kid, walked up to me and said “excuse me young lady, do you know where the candy dots are?” I had no name tag, no uniform, nothing, but before I could say anything, the 10 year old looked at her and said “mum, he’s like 12. He doesn’t work here.” I was 16, but it made me smile a bit. The lady just… walked off to the reception, nothing said after that. Dunno what happened, but it made me laugh.
While I was at work a coworker of mine called me an it, my sister is the manager and took her outside and chewed her out then my best friend Joe (her husband) chewed her out even more with her. God I love them
This is a keen reminder that hate is taught.
The kids will save us from boomer nonsense
Kids voice their minds how the world really is. Clearly the ""adults"" are just abiding by social standards while the kid hasn't been corrupted yet.
Kids are the BEST. I saw a friend yesterday that I haven't seen in person in a few months, and the T has really kicked in since then. Her six year old looked at me really hard for a minute and was like, ""why does it look like you have a moustache???"" I said it was because I was growing one on purpose, and that I was taking a special medicine that would help me grow a beard and change me voice. His little eyes kept getting wider and wider and he was like, ""wow! So maybe you're actually a boy then."" It was one of the best conversations I had all week.
Awww kids are the cutest!
And that’s why children and younger ppl are 100% better than adults.
Awww children are great
I got called a fag by a kid because I am trans so I mean they are a double edged sword
Wonderful! Beautiful story. Hugs to you ❤❤❤
Hate is learned not something you are born with. I do hope that is a sign that the future will be less cruel and bigoted. Bless that little girls heart.
You don’t have to pass to be a woman. 

Just keep going!
I honestly hate kids, but I do have a respect for their ability of non-judgement and the ability to really see people without knowing. I think adults and people probably just over 10 tend to see through a very gendered and strict view of life, but with little kids they just see who it is. I think it goes the same with spirits IMO. I don't know if I believe in spirits but I will acknowledge that children have been able to see more than us on occasion. 

Its really nice to be able to know these children who know nothing about gender and the world of gender identity can be accepting. It shows that you don't need to understand something to accept it. Adults really need to learn from kids like this one.
Love it!  🥰🥰  Lilli~
They really do lol
Wondering what it sounds like in German 🤔
I love old German sayings lol❤️
Oh ! We have the same in french ! ""La vérité sort de la bouche des enfants""
Yeah pretty much lol, kids will say what they’re thinking and it can either be too blunt or super affirming like this ^ 

It’s nice to know that this is the new generation :))
I think children just pick up on the vibes of how someone presents themselves a lot more easily, adults look at secondary sex identifiers, children look at clothes, makeup, etc.
This

Children are so annoying but they usually are less judgy than their elders
This. I came out to my kids last week and they were like ""cool. So... da- oops, mom, can we go play roblox now?"" I had prepped for anything, but my partner was totally right, they're just used to this stuff now.
Thankyou, I really appreciate that. Honestly it’s stressful and can really get me down but each day gets a little better because of little moments like this. Also don’t worry haha, my mental health is a priority when it comes to work lol ❤️
That’s honestly so sweet <3 That kid will grow up knowing you as your preferred gender too which is amazing. Glad to know the next generation is based lol
Sorry to hear that, I’ve been called that too but it’s mostly older kids who will do it. I think there’ll always be people like that unfortunately but there’s definitely fewer and fewer every day. 

Anyway keep doing you and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise ❤️
(Not a child story but still made me feel good) there's a gas station that I deliver fuel to and the attendant looked at me with my hair down and she said I looked more fem to her. It was a small compliment but it really did make me feel better about myself. It happened a couple of nights ago so I'm paraphrasing.
Agreed. One time, my baby cousin called me good girl, I don't know why she did but still, euphoria moment
""Kindermund tut Wahrheit kund.""

Literally translates to ""child's mouth declares the truth"". 

And it does ♡.
Thank you you are a nice person I don't see why someone would be nasty to you
Awh that’s really sweet :3 It’s little things that make the biggest impact. We definitely need more people like this, just people being awesome
If you remove the spaces like so many German words do, it looks even cooler...

Do we all hate mirrors?	"I’ve seen a few comments on various trans subreddits, and have also realized recently that maybe why I’ve never liked mirrors is because of my dysphoria. But, is this a universal trans thing?

Edit: Realizing I didn’t word this the best, as there isn’t a “universal” trans experience. We’re all unique and that’s awesome!"	"I like mirrors, but I hate cameras
I hate them when i see the man, i love them when i see the woman
I definitely don't like em
Don‘t like mirrors. Hate photographies of myself. I only have a few since puberty started. (Still pre-hrt.)
I used to hate mirrors. That changed when I started liking the reflection looking back at me.
Mirrors are fun when I dress up, I kinda dissociate sometimes and instead of seeing my body as well MY body, I just view it as a body. Do I wanna see what the body would look like all femme with a push up bra and a mini dress? let’s try that! Do I wanna see what the body would look like with a binder under this t-shirt? let’s try that! The only time I really hate mirrors is in public places like bathrooms where I can look really out of place sometimes
Pre T I avoided them like the plague. Now I love them. 🤷
I love mirrors. Shop windows. Anything where I can see myself in but I’m probably the exception rather than the rule
I did hate them ye... But now with my hair being longer and starting hrt and having mask on(which all together help me look like the girl I am), I don't hate them anymore. Still hate cameras tho, not ready for them yet
I think mirrors are cool but just remove the weird bug where I can see myself in them?
Yup, never liked looking in the mirror, if I had to, I would focus on only what I needed to, like my hair. Never liked getting my picture taken, and.. never knew why😅 

I dislike those things, quite a bit more now on my bad days, but I'm getting through it
I learned to shave in the shower so I wouldn't have to use a mirror.
I used to hate mirrors, now I understand why and love them until I don’t
I didn’t like mirrors until after top surgery
I don’t like looking at myself or hearing myself but mirrors are an object they did nothing wrong so I love them.
Absolutely hated mirrors to the point of complete avoidance before starting my transistion.  They still aren't my friends yet, but as I see the woman in me finally coming out, we are coming to a better understanding.
Pre-awakening? Yeah, couldn't stand them. Now that I've had a couple years of self-determination, I honestly love them. Whenever I pass one, I can't stop myself from looking in the mirror and seeing a me I like looking back. Hasn't gotten old so far. Even if I don't look great that particular minute, I believe in my looking-good potential and I spend a hot second pushing my hair around and making dramatic faces. idk, it's not even a passing thing, I just like the way I look now. Call me Narcissa Reborn, I guess.
All depends on how I'm feeling. Maybe not hate, but sometimes I'm just not seeing what I want to see. Granted that's true for many folks with body image concerns, be in gender identity or weight or anything else.
There's no universal trans experience. But yeah personally I don't like them
I hate mirrors but it's not hard for me to look at myself in them, I'm used to it at this point.  it hurts but I know I can never be beautiful.  I had this one time when I looked in the mirror and for a single nanosecond I saw a girl instead of a boy looking back at me and it shocked me so bad that I stood there mouth agape for like at least 30-45 seconds
Used to hate them, used really avoid closely looking at them. When I used to shave I would sort of un-focus my vision so l could just see a basic outline. As time went on I stopped shaving all together to avoid looking at all.

If I caught a glimpse day ruined, terror and panic...

Lately it's hit or miss sometimes I can handle it sometimes not.

Still hate photos even though I do photography.
I dislike cameras and mirrors, but only if I'm seeing myself in them
i have a phobia of mirrors, mostly in certain situations. but outside of that i dont have a specific care abt them
I'm obsessed with them. I always check myself in the mirror to make sure everything is still in place. When I'm sitting in the car I obsessively flip the mirror down, check my looks, pick my zits, then when I realize I'm doing it flip it back up in frustration, rinse and repeat.
If I have a binder no

If I don’t yes
honestly, its a love/hate relationship for me... mirrors are cool at a scientific stamd point... but whenever i drop somewieght i look in the mirror with my favorite skirt and then all i see is my gut... i honestly  hate looking at myself. but then again... there are a number of people who call me cute. So who should i believe ? the random coments saying im cute or the self loathing i, myself, dishout.
I love mirrors even though there are parts of my face I don’t care for (lower half). To me they have always felt like another world. *Almost* the same as this one.
both mirrors and camera's
I do. I have always felt insecure and never like to look in the mirror but I didn't know it was dysphoria until a few months ago lol. I feel like that may be a universal thing
Same
I’ve started liking them more….now that I’m transitioning.

My wife sometimes even catches me fussing with my hair in the mirror or a window and goes, “Ok princess, that’s enough.”

And she’s even woman enough to admit she’s jelly of my naturally curly hair. I’m still not thrilled with it, it’s a lot of work and experimentation to get the right look. I’m still working on it. And I’ve heard some cis girls are over 30 and are still working on it.
As I still look masculine, no I hate them.

And there's one right behind my damn desk which is where I spend 98% of my day. Help.
I hate mirrors bc they're evil, not bc I dislike my reflection
Since I was a teenager I've avidly avoided them.
I like mirrors, I hate what I see in them. But dancing around and doing silly shit in them is still fun. Does that make sense?

...because it still doesn't to me. Can't wait to see a girl in the mirror, though.
Mirrors are like portrait paintings of strangers to me, I never recognise the person there, they've never felt like me. 

Photographs on the other hand 🤬
I ogle myself in the mirror now. My actual appearance hasn't changed all that much but I see Her every day, and it's wonderful.
I actually hate mirrors so much, can only avoid being upset by my body if I'm wearing really baggy clothes so I can't see my chest and hips :(
i genuinely thought you said minors. but yes, as a trans person i do hate mirrors
I like mirrors, especially tall ones, I can checkout my butt. 😅
I used to really hate mirrors. Since getting on HRT and seeing how my body and face have changed I'm fine with it. I'm hot af.

Cameras, on the other hand, are awful. Taking a good selfie is literally impossible.
Mirrors are the same as cameras: A love hate relationship. At least to me. Especially on days where I like myself in the mirror and hate myself on camera qwq
Mirrors are weird. They help me practice facial expressions and stuff.  I am pre-hrt and I don't know if I will take testosterone because I'm  agender and don't  want to take too much testosterone for me. I cannot connect my reflection to me. I was so used to seeing someone I didn't like for so long that I don't recognize me, because I look so different. It feels like I'm looking at someone else. And then I realize that it is actually me, which makes me slightly happy because I don't associate  ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" with how I look. It's like seeing myself from a different perspective or something.
I see nothing wrong with mirrors. But cameras I can do without. A picture is just so flat looking and can’t really reflect the real you like a mirror. Or maybe it’s just me getting old.
Gosh i saw minors instead of mirrors help me
It depends on what I look like, as usually is the case. In a really cute fem outfit I look so cute, but in my everyday clothes I look gross and don’t like mirrors or cameras:/
Well, when the mirror is nice to me it's my friend, but when it's mean to me I don't like it.
I put in the work to look pretty every morning, I'm gonna adore the mileage I get out of it.
I break mirrors with my face in the United states
Yeah. I mean before I didn’t like mirrors. And I did everything to change that. Diet, exercise, tattoos. Nothing helped. Only becoming my true self could I stand to look in the mirror every day
Okay, other side. I'm about a year on hormones, and every time I see myself in a mirror I'm like, you are looking fucking FINE TODAY. 🔥🥵🚒🧨
These days I kinda love ‘em… still hit and miss on cameras
From my trans friends and relatives that would pretty much be a yes.
It gets better the further into your transition though and their will come a day when you can look in the mirror and like your body again so hang in there.
I was shocked, i read it as minors. Yes I personally do hate mirrors they give me dysphoria.
I have a pretty good sense of imagination, whenever I see a mirror I focus on my body language rather than my actual body. Being skinny helps as it makes my hips look bigger, lol. My face, tho… I try my best to see it positively, but it’s always a disappointed neutral at best…
mirrors are cool, just not after i shower or anything like that
I hate mirrors I hate cameras
Definitely hate mirrors. Double-hate cameras.

It wasn't until a couple of years after realizing I'm trans that I realized that I'd spent literal *decades* building up habits of *not* looking at myself in the mirror. Like, ever. I didn't even realize I was doing that until somebody, in some post, remarked on how mirrors made them dysphoria. And then it just all... hit me. Like, *wham*. The way I avert my eyes when I brush my teeth. The way I always stand angled to the sink so I'm not directly facing the mirror. How, when I have to shave or brush my hair, I intentionally constrain my gaze to just the immediate small part of my head that I need to deal with in that moment, but never *ever* just stand back to take in the whole view of myself.

Like, JFC, how does someone build up a habit like that *without noticing*? IDK, but I sure did it...

Cameras are worse because they shrink your image down to where you can't help but see the whole view. Mirrors, being life-sized, give you the above life-hack to avoid seeing the whole view. Pictures don't. Hence, selfies can just go fuck right off.

Maybe this will change when I transition. I sure hope so. It would be nice not to feel an overwhelming wave of existential discomfort just from seeing myself.
My dislike of mirrors goes way back. When I was young, I remember insisting on sitting behind the passenger seat on car rides, because I could see myself in the rearview mirror if I sat behind the driver.
Pre-transition I thought it just came with the territory tbh. Not saying I’ve used sheets to cover the mirrors in my house to fight dysphoria but yea…
Kind of? I’ve had problems for years of feeling dissociation when looking at myself in a mirror, but never really knew why up until a year ago once I accepted I’m trans/non-binary. It’s slowly getting better as I make transitional steps.
Mirrors are the worst invention of mankind
YES
wait but seriously, I was terrified of mirrors until I cut my hair. I always thought there was a woman in there staring at me, or a horrible distorted version of myself, and I could never meet my own eyes. now I love seeing my own reflection and I'll even wink at him if I feel particularly cute 😳
same with cameras, I literally despised our annual family photo and being in pictures alone until I cut my hair. and that's pre-hrt!! I still can't look at my chest in the mirror but once I get top surgery I'll literally be invincible 😳😳😳
Since childhood I was scared of mirrors, wven now I have chills when looking into mirrors randomly, but I like my image on a mirror, it's very strange.
I read this as “Do we all hate minors”…. Hh, XD but to answer, I do.
I like mirrors.  I’m hot as fuck.
It’s not a trans thing, it’s an insecurity thing. In general if you’re insecure about how you look regardless of how you identify you’re obviously not going to enjoy looking at yourself. I have a cis friend who is over weight and he hates looking at himself or having his picture taken.
Nah. I dont hate my looks. Theyre fine
I used to HATE them! Mirrors and cameras were my enemy. Pre-transition the only time I would look at a mirror was when I was drunk because I was already numb. Even a couple months into transition I felt gross. Now a few days short of 10 months hrt I find myself able to look at mirrors and cameras and feel well... happy.
I personally love looking at myself in the mirror, but that's because I've spent all my life working on myself until I've gotten where I feel attractive, sure there's still things I hate, but I'm a hottie for now and I'll take it.
Mirrors killed my perants
I guess it depends on the age.
Children 0-10 tend to be sorta annoying especially if I have to look after them but I don't necessarily hate them. Though babies low-key scare me.
12-14 tends to be the age where people are most annoying but to be fair that's the teen years.
15 and up tends to be more manageable
No
I find them oddly fascinating

Might be because I am face blind and I look very different to myself depending on so many different things, expression, lighting, hair and angle to name a few, every time I look some other aspect of me is looking back
Don't mind mirrors, dislike candid pics
Mirrors and cameras lie! That said as transition progresses and hormones make magic even if it is at the pace of watching grass grow I'm hating them slightly less.

I will admit liking shop window reflections. I want to see what other people see when I'm out and about and moving just to get a sense of how I'm perceived. Plus I will confess presenting as a woman is 1000 times more fun than ""the before days"".
Shit am I a stereotype?
I used to despise mirrors, after HRT and top surgery I like them a lot more
I have a very love-hate relationship with mine right now.

Being euthymic means I spent my life looking in a mirror and just...not caring.  I didn't recoil in revulsion as someone dysphoric does, there was just...no emotional attachment to the reflection beyond acknowledging that it's me.

Now that I'm trying t be happy about the body I inhabit, seeing myself in the mirror annoys the hell out of me.  I haven't lost enough weight.  My body hair isn't thinning fast enough.  My head looks completely out of place.
Nah, I'm fine 😋
Try vrchat
Depends on my mood, it literally completely switches
I used to but like everyone else has said, it comes with being comfortable in your body
Personally I love my body since I worked hard to maintain it
Mirrors don’t make me dysphoric- pictures, though….god
I don't hate mirrors, i hate my face lol
I like them only when En femme.
I'm Cis, and hate mirrors and cameras or really anything thar can show me what I look like, it's most likely just a psychological thing, and dysmorphia can definitely have a negative impact on it
No, I love mirrors. I don't judge myself compared to the hottest trans girls. I just compare my now to from before I transitioned and I'm sooooo much cuter and hotter.
I don't hate mirrors, I just hate how I look.
Only when I get lazy with the body hair upkeep, otherwise mirrors and I are generally on speaking terms.
I like mirrors, lol. I enjoy looking at myself. Photos, on the other hand, I don't like, but that really has nothing to do with the dysphoria. I just don't like photos, haha.
I hate going to a mirror and seeing booba, but luckily I have a very square figure that doesn't seem feminine.
always hated mirrors and cameras
I like mirrors because it lets me admire myself now that i have control of my body and long hair after years of thinking i was a man and having short hair.
I don't like seeing my face in the mirror but I like the mirror itself since it helps me shave. I don't like seeing the hair grow in the first place, but I'd rather have the mirror than go without.
Purely coincidence but my room is the only room in my entire house without a mirror, we even have one in the kitchen... 
But yeah I don't really like them haha
I love mirrors. I hate my camera
I'm not gonna say I hate mirrors, but I like them a whole lot more now that I look how I want.
I love myself! when I see a mirror I just think about how much I have overcome - this rings true for anything in my life, But I get it; I find the most important thing is being happy with who you are as a person - which of course has no significance on how we look but rather how you interpret and and rock being who you are not what you are. 

I also just ignore what the image of beauty is according to media etc, real true beauty is from within.
I hated mirrors before HRT, now I'm (checks calendar) oh wow, 4 months on HRT, and even though my changes have been slow I am starting to find mirrors a lot less traumatic
Yup! And public bathrooms
Replace mirror with any reflective surface and you’ve got me. 

I remember when I was like 8 I asked my mom if we could remove the mirror in the bathroom because I can’t stand seeing myself.
I don't hate mirrors, I hate the reflection I see, because I'm still pre-everything
only some times
I thought it was ""Do we all hate minors"" 😂 but yes for my part I only look at my reflection when I need to (shaving and stuff) else it makes me feel weird, like I was looking at someone else
it's a love-hate-relationship. If I'm doing well, maybe took a bit of effort with my looks, I absolutely don't hate the mirror and am gonna look at every reflection of myself I can find. If that doesn't apply, keep those things out of my fucking face.
My distain for my own reflection correlates with my slight dysphoria which can spark into a self fueling cycle of wanting to shave, not being comfortable looking at myself in the mirror, my facial hair and dysphoria worsen and I feel like shit.
Yep, I hate mirrors some days
I don't know, ""all mirrors"" by Angel Olsen is pretty good.

Seriously though mirrors are a babe to my existence but not as bad to pre hrt.
Only on dysphoria days. I hate being in pictures though. I don't usually dislike seeing myself in a mirror, but I always hate seeing myself in pictures.
I hated my appearance for a long time. I didn't like pictures or looking at myself in the mirror.  
  
but now that I know who I am, it's so cute. Even if I'm not feminine, I have a mustache and it's going to take a while to start transitioning I can look at myself and think ""holy shit, I'm beautiful as fuck""  
  
I still don't like photos but it's a start to like seeing myself and imagining what I'll be like in the future.
Well when I finally figured out I was trans it was because of mirrors. I hated looking into them even though I couldn’t necessarily figure out why. There were whole years that I went without looking into the mirror. It took my ex who was trans for me to figure it out. Then I started transitioning afterwards.🤗
Fuck mirrors all my homies hate mirrors
Mirrors make me look like a man wearing make-up. They're all bastards!
Mirrors are the worst
I have genuinely stopped looking in mirrors. If I need to use one, I do, but I almost subconsciously avoid meeting my own gaze in any other situation
I went literal YEARS before I could stand even getting a glimpse of myself, camera or mirror. When I accidentally did, I would cringe and sometimes gag- only Recently have I started being able to look
I hate both I really don’t like looking at my face feels like someone else is supposed to be there
I don't like mirrors
I hate even seeing my reflection on my phone screen or in a spoon lol
I used to hate mirrors. 

Now that I'm on HRT... I don't mind them. I can see the ""me"" that I'm going to become, and I quite like it.
mirrors are fine if im looking at them on purpose. if i accidently see my reflection it makes me feel really insecure and dysphoric
I hate my face, I hate looking at my face, I hate things that facilitate me looking at my face.

Mirrors are fine for other folks, but I prefer to stay away.
I usually like mirrors when they're really close to my face 🤷🏻‍♀️

(and I send kisses to myself if I feel euphoric 😚)
Pre-awakening? Yeah, couldn't stand them. Now that I've had a couple years of self-determination, I honestly love them. Whenever I pass one, I can't stop myself from looking in the mirror and seeing a me I like looking back. Hasn't gotten old so far. Even if I don't look great that particular minute, I believe in my looking-good potential and I spend a hot second pushing my hair around and making dramatic faces. idk, it's not even a passing thing, I just like the way I look now. Call me Narcissa Reborn I guess.
Depends. If I look good that day, I can't stay away from the mirror. If I look gross I hate them. Consistently though  I hate the car sunshade mirror.

Basically
I find that I just can't stop staring in the mirror since I started transitioning! Just looking at what to focus on, things that can make me look more femme. I don't hate thr mirror at all.
I used to love mirrors, but not my reflection in them. Now I still love mirrors and like my reflection in them
Celeste nailed it with the trans mirror thing IMO.
I thought it said minors and was very confused
I hate cameras, mirrors and reflective surfaces 😂
I like mirrors... with good lighting.  🤣
I get why it would matter to people with really intense dysphoria, but I just...don't care all that much.  It's a mirror.  _le shrug_.

I know what I want to look like broadly, and I'll get there.  What the mirror shows doesn't really affect that in any way.
I have a niche (maybe?) Experience with mirrors. I have severe BPD and with that comes intense and constant dissociation. I have bad face blindness and often can't recognize myself in mirrors or my surroundings or others. It's like everything is looked at through a crazy foggy lens and I have to rationalize everything taking place. So sure I kind of hate mirrors but ai also kind of like them but mostly I hate dirty mirror selfies
I hate mirrors.
I hate how I look and am totally discouraged by my reflection 95% of the time.
i kept reading it as ""minors"" at first
I'm better with them now, but yes.
ok ive been scrolling through the comments and seriously i agree with so many of them, mostly the ones saying that mirrors are either decent or not terrible, but cameras are a nightmare
I don't mind mirrors, like I **wish** the person in it was more fem, but it doesn't bother me to see my reflection at all.
I actually love mirrors, i'm an old fashioned narcissist (i stare at my reflection until i wither away).

i guess it's because i have more control over my appearance than in a camera. before i even realized i was trans i would just stare at my reflection extremely often trying to see myself as a woman.
I hate mirrors because I forget I look so feminine and they remind me *it'*s there. Sort of like a when you have a wound you don't think hurts that bad until you see how bad it is, then it hits you and it hurts a lot
Hate mirrors.... it's taken a long time of practice, moisturizing, proper clothing, lots of shaving and waxing, and losing just about 50 lbs. before I was okay being in front of a mirror for the first time these past few weeks... Cameras and pictures are still a struggle without good angles and clothes...
i like them because i love my hair :D otherwise, no.
I have dysphoria but I'm also learning about self-acceptance so I actually pose and smile in mirrors.
I like mirrors. I'm genderfluid, and looking in the mirror helps me figure out my current gender! Mostly because when I'm a guy I think I'm hot, and when I'm a lady I think I'm a bit meh... lol
i hate mirrors bro 😭 one day in a math class my teacher had us pass a mirror around a circle and it was our talking piece, i turned it over because i didnt want to see myself and she saw that and TOLD US TO LOOK AT OURSELVES 

maam id rather not be bombarded with the stress of dysmorphia AND dysphoria in the middle of algebra class thank you
(Irrational fear tw?) Sometimes its dysphoria, sometimes its my irrational fear that if i look in a mirror too long ill see someone or something behind me 😭 but mostly its the dysphoria LOL
I like mirrors. I may not be able to present as who I feel 24/7. But god damn, I see who I am and I love me.
Mirrors are OK, but cameras are evil!
Not anymore! I can't go by a mirror without checking myself out. Five years later and it's still surreal. Also I'm vain.

Comfy in front of cameras, too.
I've hated mirrors for as long as I can remember. Decades before I had any conscious idea that I was trans. I just thought I was unfortunate looking. (I still feel that way, but I have hopes for the future!)
Bruh i read that as minors, I was thinking what did I do to you- and I hate mirrors yea
I love mirrors. I look great. Most of the time. But some days I think I look a little fat. Cameras can make me look especially rotund from a distance so I hate that. I need to lose weight. I loved the mirror from an early age. I had good skin and I didn't grow much facial hair to start with, but as I grew older and my skin grew more oily and the hair started to grow more, I liked it less. I still never hated it though. I like the way I look.
Depends on the day. If I am having a rough day I can’t stand my reflection, but most days I’m impartial.
That's something I definitely struggled with really heavily the first year after coming out to myself. It had been bad since I started puberty (I thought it was just self-esteem issues, but it was dysphoria) and then when I realized it was dysphoria it got worse. It's mostly better now, though I have my bad days, but I still divert my eyes from most mirrors depending on my mood lol
For a sec i thought it said minors and i was like ""Heck yeah, fuck em kids"" /j

&#x200B;

As a kid i would start crying and punching people when they wanted me to see a video of myself (i did lots of acting and dancing). So that should give out a clue about how i felt about mirrors.
Lol
I fucking love mirrors.

I love seeing my transmasc self in the mirror and look at those muscles and those abs I worked so so hard for. It's an unreal feeling of accomplishment.
I misread and thought you were asking about minors lol.
Ever felt good all day about how you looked and then caught a glimpse in a mirror, or a camera, or a video and fall into shambles because now youre wondering if thats really what you looked like the whole time? Yea i have a bittersweet relationship with mirrors and cameras. When I see the woman in the mirror im happy and almost afraid its an illusion that can disappear at any moment, but when i see the man in the mirror I get very dysphoric/depressed for hours/days. If i can control my image I feel better but I freeze up and get extremely awkward when someone throws a camera in my face (i.e. job id pic, drivers license pic, friends/family/coworkers playing around) I hate it. Oh and lets not even start on those security cameras that hang in the corner facing down and how much body dysphoria it can cause making your back/shoulders look larger than your body. Yea i had a video monitoring job and one of the cameras pointed at me and I often fixated on it.
i definitely do
I read that minors...
I sometimes don't mind mirrors. If my outfit is loose on me, then that's fine. It gives me an androgynous look and also my chest is less noticeable. However I tight or patterned outfit makes my chest more obvious and I don't like that. also before showing in the morning I just close my eyes to avoid the mirror.
I don’t HATE mirrors but that’s probably because I love my hair and being able to see it. I do hate cameras and having my picture taken though.
i dont hate mirrors i hate what i see in them
no.
only cause i made the right changes to be myself n have always really Saw Myself so i didn’t hate what i was looking at.
in terms of weight though sometimes ! but that has nothin to do w/ being trans n mirrors, n i rarely ever let myself think that, like my dysphoria, if i look in a mirror obviously i can sit and pick things i don’t like but never really do this in a negative way, just use it to make improvements.
I hate seeing myself in the mirror...I hate it.
Mirrors, cameras, audio recordings,  videos. Just better as a ghost idk.
I generally dislike what I see in the mirror, but sometimes I’ll catch a glimpse of something that actually looks girly. And that gives me a little euphoria boost for about an hour.
I’m a photographer yet hate getting my photo taken lmao
Only when I haven't shaved.  
So almost always yes
I don't hate mirrors, I like seeing my reflection because I think I look enough like my true self. Also I think I look handsome. Before my egg cracked I didn't care about my apperance, now I like how I look in reflections
I don't hate mirrors as much as I used to, still don't like them completely tho. Cameras suck one way or another lol
I mean I love mirrors when i feel like I'm passing as cis man
Tbh I used to, a lot. But the further I get in transition the happier I am to see myself.
I like mirrors
I do like the person I see in the mirror. I just wish he’d look more like… me.

I always thought it’s a dissociation thing
I don't like seeing myself... Sometimes its a pain in my ass when people ask for a selfie of me
I have a hate love. I would not be able to be even a little comfortable without looking in a mirror through out the day lmao
I will stare at myself in the mirror for an hour straight just looking at things I like/popping pimples lol but cameras are different

If I'm taking a selfie then we're all good if someone is taking one of me? No.
It could just be my mirror, cause it was pretty cheap. But I noticed my mirror extenuates my hips, but my camera doesn't. So yea I don't like my mirror
I do hate mirrors... aigh i hope that changes soon alongside with my bodey
I don't mind any of it, including cameras.
I don't hate them,but I always have a weird second when I come across one because I don't recognize the person in the mirror as myself
It feels weird, and the more I look the more the reflection looks like some creepy pasta stuff to me
I think so
I look great in the mirror, the camera is what makes me look like a potato
Why would we
I have a love/hate relationship with them, it all depends on which version of me is looking back
I like mirrors only when I’m in my feminine clothing and have a wig


Otherwise I’m scared of them
I read that as ""minors"" and I was very confused
I hate mirrors too so I understand where your coming from
yes we all hate mirrors
not really, no. i actually love them and can stare at myself in them for hours together, because i feel like i'm a rather good looking guy, and as a pre-T guy that does wonders for my self esteem and reduces dysphoria (odd, isnt it? i've always heard that mirrors increase dysphoria). sometimes i do feel insecure about my body looking too femme but thats ok, it still doesnt make me hate mirrors.
I have an issue looking in the mirror sometimes. If I’m having an off day seeing something I don’t like in the mirror magnifies all other issues by 10. It’s also the reason I just don’t take pictures of myself, it’s like having to look in the mirror but you can’t pull your head away cause the moment you didn’t like yourself has been burned into a point in time that follows you unless you delete the picture lol.
A little bit. But i need it to remove my beard
I don't hate mirrors, I hate what I see in them.
Cameras are a curse, mirrors a blessing to me
Depends of the mood. I like it from time to time to feel eternal like a vampire. I really enjoy darkness.
Yes and no, i like mirrors and cameras but seeing my girl's body makes me feel uncomfortable.
i hate the front facing camera. i have countless mirrors in my bedroom i'm always in front of a mirror or walking by one... i work really
hard on my appearance and ya
know a mirror is necessary to see oneself. much love 💗
Well now I love mirrors and cameras since I'm presenting the way I always wanted to.

My camera roll is almost embarrassing with how many selfies I have 🙈
I've always disliked looking in the mirror, and taking pictures, but I don't hate mirrors they're still pretty useful in certain ways
I also hate mirror’s
Yep. Hate mirrors.
I literally will not change in front of a mirror...up until recently I'd literally hide from a camera
I like mirrors, but I don't like cameras! I feel like I always look so feminine in facetimes and stuff. I see myself as masculine but facetimes, videos, and photos (unless I take them) are a no no. 😞
I play VRChat, so I love mirrors.  Real mirrors are good for making faces at yourself too.
No i like staring at mirrors cus narcism traits, irony because I also have dysphoria... I guess that's kinda helpful in a way
Yes mirror's cameras anything showing what I look like. But less so the more feminine I feel
I was hit woth one once
Yeah lol
Hate mirrors. Get reminded I still got t*ts everyday I wake up to shower
I am fine with both as long as I’m looking the exact way I want cause I know I’m not perfect nobody is but it’s the confidence my clothing can give me
I wasn't a fan, but after therapy and hrt, I dislike them a whole lot less
I do not know how everyone feels about mirrors. But I don't have any.
Every. Single. Reflective. Surface.
I know I shouldn't be commenting on the basis that im not trans but I do support and am attracted to Transwomen....i say mirrors aren't bad at all because you see yourself, I only imagine you see your progress....how far you've come all this way to transitioning & where you see yourself going for yourself in the future. Thats just my interpretation or take on it from what I understand. I may be the only one but I hope im not. If i offend any its not my intention & I apologize.
I like both mirrors and cameras. They’ve helped me accept where I am in my transition, and I can imagine or play around with how I’ll look after top surgery.
I hate mirrors also it’s not just you lol
Everyday, ever since I was little, it always made me feel like I was broken, alone, confused, hate myself because I didn’t know who or what I was looking at because it wasn’t me.
I'm in a love/hate relationship with my mirror.
I myself hate mirrors and cameras tho I wish I had pictures with me and my close friends so I could remember when I felt happy and myself.
Bro fuck mirrors all my homies hate mirrors
No need to have a mirror to know that I dislike my body, a lot
I read mirrors as minors and thought, I too also dislike children
I too hate mirrors
I’m incredibly self conscious. That plus dysphoria makes mirrors and pictures my worst enemy
most days i hate them, but some days i look like a boy and will not stop looking at them
I only look in the mirror to fix my hair and shave, but besides that I’ll avoid them.
Used to, but I love the way I look now. Feels amazing after 22 years of hating what I saw in the mirror.
But mirror selfies are top tier 😳
I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s a universal thing among trans people. Pretty much all trans people experience heavy gender dysphoria. 

I used to hate the reflection looking back at me in it when I was younger but on HRT I actually feel beautiful and feminine enough to appreciate my appearance.

Sometimes I get self-conscious about not having surgery yet but I’m still a young adult so the parts I have don’t really bother me anymore. Some trans people still feel gender dysphoric when taking hormones but luckily I don’t.
I do dislike mirrors and what I see but I still use them a lot
Not a fan of mirrors but they are way better than camera
Depends on the day I'm having. Lol.
At first no, but as you accept who you are and work on your confidence, you will love them, like most girls!
I just recently started HRT, but before I did I couldn't stand looking at the mirror. But now I find myself doing it all the time and it is kinda nice. I feel right; for lack of better words.
I know they have a way of reminding a lot of people about aspects of their body they don't like, which can be a dysphoria issue. I'm usually pretty okay, but I have days where I don't like mirrors, and (since I still have facial hair growth) I prefer shaving in the shower bc I don't have to look at stubble in the mirror to do so.
Im not a fan of mirrors and avoid them same with cameras
I don't like mirrors per se, but they're not bad. Cameras on the other hand... If it weren't for the fact they can take nice pictures of mountains I'd have my camera permanently disabled.
Yea wtf cameras. Why tho?

I know it's about the focal length but still
My wife always wants me to FaceTime in stores, and I dread it every time, but I can look at myself in the mirror no problem.
Well, cameras use fancy mirrors, so that kinda counts, maybe? 😂
I don't like seeing my face in the mirror but I like the mirror itself since it helps me shave. I don't like seeing the hair grow in the first place, but I'd rather have the mirror than go without. 

Cameras though, they can go fuck themselves.
I only hate cameras when it's someone other than me taking the photo.
Generally, I hate looking in mirrors. All I see are my flaws. But I looked in a mirror earlier and was happy with what I saw. Then I had to take a full-body picture. Ruined my whole day.
Fucking F.A.C.T.S
Same, my parents are photographers and my mom constantly wanted photos for any given event, I hated it but never really knew why, I hated seeing myself in the photos, it being a permanent record of me, now I know why.
Now I know why I actively avoided being in any photo for any event ever MY ENTIRE LIFE... \*suppressed memories unlocked!\*
i understand this, i hate all photos where i look even slightly fem (trans masc btw) but i love photos where ive dressed up as a guy, mirrors though, they can go fuck themselfs, i hate them, they make me feel dysforic, and fem, and i always end up crying after even glanceing in one
I hate both camera and mirrors I'm hoping after I've gone through my transition I'll come to love them lol
Fun fact, mirrors are green
Hmm wonder why this is? I’m questioning but I’ve always liked looking in the mirror. I’m a good looking guy, and have always cared for my appearance/hair. But when it comes to pics of myself I avoid it like the plague. I have a lot of dysphoria over my jaw both in pics, and often habitually adjust it in the mirror. I’ve taken maybe a couple pics that I care to look at, but have taken tons in girl mode.
I hate selfie cameras specifically. They make my eyes look funky >;(
I always prefer how I look in the mirror over how I look on camera for some reason and I've never been able to explain why. This is true whether I'm actually taking photos or just using my phone camera as a mirror.
Same! The stupid fish eye lens effect makes me look like the giga Chad meme but the mirror just looks normal.
I love being BEHIND the camera!
Don't have a love for mirrors,. But this camera thing is  so me. Really hit home when I played around with faceapp and realized why.
Same, im a female but my partner is mtf and they hate cameras and mirrors :(
This ^
Trueee.
Couldn't say it better myself.
This is exactly how it feels.
I came here to say the same thing! I went out of my way to buy a mirror for my room, and that might've been a hint I wasn't faking it.

I still don't do well with cameras, have hated them since I was little, but I think I might be able to come around
Its crazy how much alot of us have used dissociation as a technique to protect our mental/emotional state. The irony that the very thing thats good to us is harmful as well.
this exactly… I do hate that feeling tho.
It feels like there is an inflection point during transition, before that folks say they hated mirrors, but after that they like them. Super interesting!
Same, I take hella selfies now too lol
Me too. I've noticed that now that I'm presenting full-time I've become a bit of a narcissist. Every time I see my reflection I think to myself damn your good looking. Makes me feel good about myself.
Same! A lot of my dysphoria over my appearance has faded away, now I’m worried about being too vain. It’s been a weird 180
😆
Same
So jealous

I only get a few little moments when I spot a little cute thing about myself
this sounds really weird now that ive re-read that
Most cameras cannot duplicate the human eye, they magnify the objects in view which actually distorts the image.. that's why most people hate seeing themselves in a picture, it's not quite reality.
The human mind can make you see all sorts of things when you want it badly enough, dysphoria can make you see all the bad but there's lots of trans people that see the version of themselves they want to be.

But when you're looking at yourself from a different perspective there's a detachment where you can't warp the image and so, that false reality crumbles. This is why people always think that they look different in pictures but why other people look the same to us in that same picture. It's actually our own image of ourselves that is warped.
when taking a selfie on your phone move the camera a bit away from your face if its too close itll distort the image
Yep, I can look in a mirror and I like what I see, but I I look into a camera phone or whatever, omg lol
I feel your pain.  
I would give my foot for my fiance to never facetime me again.
I hear ya lol, but ..no .. 🤣
I definitely agree as to the camera part !
That does make sense, I can understand that for sure.
I hate mirrors, and the camera on my phone. For some reason (probably to do with final length), I don't mind seeing myself in video with my full DSLR rigged up.
Oh hun I totally get that .. hugs
Yep, there is a technical and scientific reason photos often make us look bad
Green?
Yep, the camera lens often magnifies or amplifies everything in its view, even the slightest bit, making the object appear different than in reality.
Faceapp is bad... in my opinion lol
Dysphoria is such a monster 😔
Curious, did you buy that when experimenting or after you transitioned. I’ve wanted to get a full length mirror so I can experiment/crossdress.
Seriously! I never thought it would change and now I look every chance I get!
I have a meme I usually share that says “Don’t call me ‘vain’ I deserve to be obsessed with myself after years of hating who I am” 🤣🙌
The more i see myself too the more I’m seeing his face disappear and mine appearing. The hrt has been helping a lot I think
Eehhhh screw being too vain. I believe Loving who you are is the first step to being truly happy. These past few months I’ve found a whole new level of happiness and contentment. I’m even that confident now that I will go to work most days without makeup on and still feel pretty
Also damn!! You look amazing 😻 so embrace your self love 🥰
One eye is a 58mm focal length. And we have stereo vision. A focal length closer to the human eye is 50, 55 and 58, also all focal length in between. But the stereo vision we have is replicated only with stereo cameras.
No but like, that is bullshit. Cameras, particularly selfie cameras, objectively exaggerate masculine features on trans feminine people. They exaggerate foreheads, shoulders and arms, noses, etc. It is about the focal length. What you see in the mirror is what other people see. It is literally the cameras that are wrong.

The reason you don't notice with other people (but they do) is that you aren't as locked in on their exact features because you don't see them all the time.

Idk about the trans masc experience here but have always wondered... Do y'all still hate cameras, or do they make you look more masc in a good way?
From what I’ve learned it’s pretty much all to do with mirrors being 3D and pictures being 2D. Live shots like a mirror or video is interpreted by the mind differently than a still 2D pic. Similar to how we hear our voices differently in real life versus on a recording.
I love the way you described it.
Girl same.
OMG same. Instant dread.
I feel like I'm the opposite I probably prefer closer shots of my face and body to further away shots
No, it’s because I’m trans and it reminds me and everyone else that I’m not a girl.
Yes the colour of a mirror is green as it reflects more green light then red or blue
I feel you.  Its the good, the bad and the ugly. Good to see the possibility and hope,  the bad because i will likely never achieve,  and the ugly as i realize how i feel about my current look
Yeah, this is why i hope they can enjoy their reflection and way they look in photos someday
When experimenting actually! I wanted to see what I looked like and all I really had was my bathroom mirror.

I looked at target and found they had decent door mirrors for like, $7, so I actually bought one. I told myself to pretend was buying it as a gift for my sister when I was getting other gifts 😅

It absolute helped and was 100% worth it! (Bonus points, it's really light so a few 3m picture hanging strips can hold it up)
They make me look more fat lmao
Sometimes yeah, sometimes no. Depends how I'm feeling about myself at the time of taking the pictures.
i hate them, not sure if this is just the camra type where i live, but camras seam to exzadurate the fem fetures in everyone (and all the guys where i live complain about it and all the girls love it so its not just me) so i mean good place to be a trans fem i guess
The farther away I am from a camera, the better I look. I will never again take a selfie from an arm's length or closer!
Glad I'm not alone!
Well, I'm sorry about that, but other than that, there is a technical and scientific reason behind why photos make us look different
Very interesting!
Maybe not never achieve, but a different version of what faceapp shows..
Urgh stupid transphobic cameras. Not even helping out the bros.
😁 Me too!
I once told this to a friend a while back and apparently he has not been able to look at mirrors without thinking about them being green, wait does that mean he thinks about me every time he sees a mirror

Idk, dysphoria has plagued me a lot, I get constantly bothered with my body. But today, I found that my body is beautiful the way it is. Srry my english is very so so :(		"You look great! What are your pronouns?

She has said multiple times now, that if i remove my deadname from my name, she and the whole family will be devastated and she won't use my correct name or pronouns. She has said that i can call myself whatever i want, but she wants me to have my deadname as my middle name. I never liked my deadname, my full name would sound weird and just bad and I'd rather not have dysphoria in my name AFTER I CHANGE IT. I can change my name alone in a few months, but I'm still gonna live at home with my mother for a while for school and stuff. 

What do i do about this, because i cant just hide it, and i cant move?

Edit: reading the comments, ive thought about talking with her about it and showing how many people disagree with her. But i don't really know how to start that conversation? 😅

Edit 2: i tried starting the conversation, she didn't want to talk about it yet, okay well well, i can wait, but she knows i don't want my deadname and i think she might actually just need time. I'll update if anything interesting happens"	"There are other ways to honor your uncle without your misery. Also, basically blackmailing you into keeping the name is just wrong. They should use your name because it’s your name, not because you complied to their demands.
Is there anyway to chainge your name without your mom knowing you removed the deadname entirely? Would she know what you chainged it to if you waited untill you could do so alone?

Your family have no right to demand you keep a name that you don't like, never mind one that actually hurts you.
Sounds transphobic and selfish of your mother. Why doesn’t she change her middle name to her brothers name as a tribute to him?
Using deadnaming and misgendering as a threat to pressure you into keeping your deadname is pretty transphobic.
It's unfair to hold that burden over you. Do what you have to do for now but you're not in the wrong here for wanting a different name.
It’s just a name. YOUR name. It only matters what you think it should be. They can name a dog or something after your uncle if it is that important to them. You aren’t disgracing their memory by wanting to be happy with yourself, and to think that is selfish.
She is not transphobic, but won't use your correct name or pronouns.

Pick one.
can you choose the opposite gendered version of the name as a compromise??
e.g. amelia = amelio or samuel = samantha
Selfish af on her end, and in the end it's not really her choice. She's actively choosing to harm you emotionally, psychologically, and turning your entire family against you. That's absolutely transphobic and she has some biases she needs to address.
My mom is the same way with my middle name, little does she know as soon as I turn 18 in getting a full name change
lot's of people think your life is an extension of theirs, for various reasons.

all of them are wrong
>that if i remove my deadname from my name, she and the whole family will be devastated and she won't use my correct name or pronouns

Yeah that's controlling behavior and emotionally manipulative AF, and definitely transphobic. You don't get to use acknowledging and respecting someone's identity as a ""reward"" or ""punishment,"" FULL STOP. Either she respects you or she doesn't and threatening this kind of conditional acceptance is NOT respect.
Manipulation. It’s not about the name. Good luck, and I would watch what I say in front of mom, sounds like she’s lying to you.
I’m sorry, that’s not easy.

Sounds kinda weird but would it be an ok stand-in to just *tell* her you did her suggestion but not really do it?

Not many people are ever going to use your middle name when talking to you, even your mom.

It’s totally ok to say this is a terrible idea. 

All the best
I kept my middle name as my dead name when I changed my name. I do not recommend doing so.
I kept my extremely masculine middle name because it was my Father’s first name and it felt like it would be wrong to change it. The keyword is *I* felt it would be wrong. If the family tried to pressure me to keep it I would’ve dropped it so fast.

It’s your name.  It’s not a bargaining chip. If they refuse to use it you should just keep letting them know how much it hurts you. Focus on that, rather than on whether giving up your middle name to be validated is “worth it” in your mind.
""my mom is not transphobic, she just refuses to use my chosen name and will constantly misgender me on purpose and actively guilt trips me if I say anything about it""

Say she's not transphobic all you like, but she clearly is.
Definitely is transphobic, she might like your deadname but it doesn't matter. If you don't like it then it's yours to keep or change. If she's going to deadname you and misgender you for that that's really just transphobia and extremely bad parenting imo
If she adds it to her name you'll keep it
Idk dude, my parents are just transphobic, you’ve already made it farther than I ever will
[deleted]
She’s being very selfish, it’s your life and you don’t have to live as a memorial as touching as it is that she named you after him you have to be you. x
That name is not yours.  It belongs to a dead man.  Let it die with him.
""If you like the name so damn much, add it to your own as a second middle name""
Fuck her, a name is a gift you can return. You didn’t get to choose it, and it’s not your problem if she dislikes that you change it. If she refuses to acknowledge your chosen name and pronouns, once again, fuck her
Get rid of your deadname. You can't be ""not transphobic"" while insisting your child keep a name they despise
1) not her choice, it's YOUR name
2) if she wants a reminder of her brother, get a locket or something, don't name a whole person after him
3) absolutely WORST CASE SCENARIO you could maybe make it one of those awkward middle names some people have that don't fit their gender (probably don't if ur first name is gender neutral as most people end up assuming wrong gender from just your name alone) or maybe have some like, feminised version of it?
I'm really sorry you're going through this. I don't really have any advice but I'd like to give you a hug if you'd accept it. 

I'm finding myself faced with a potentially similar situation: my middle name was my grandfather's first name. I'm an adult and I'm still afraid to talk to my parents about transitioning because I'm going to need to change my name and I'm going to have to change my middle name because it does not read as anything but male. 

The first person I came out to in my life was my sister and that was just last night. She was thankfully very supportive but when she asked if I was going to change my name, I said yeah that's gonna have to happen. She briefly said that she really liked my name and all I could do was shrug and say that it's never really fit me.
I hate to say it but she is transphobic, and extremely selfish. She's threatening you, blackmailing you saying if you get rid of your deadname she'll misgender and deadname you. That's horrible
It's not your responsibility to shoulder her trauma and grief
So, she thinks its YOUR responsibility to keep your name so the family can be happy? Pretty bad if you ask me. You should do whatever you want, and shouldn't be blackmailed by someone, especially your own MOTHER like this.

Also, I hope you give us and update and everything goes well on your part! <3
You're not her property. What you choose for your names to be isn't any of her business. She can find other ways to honor her brother than lay him on you.
""My mom is not transphobic""

Okay but she is
Oof. Check out my user name -- you may guess some history. :) 

This is tough. Because it is your life, period. Let's start with that.

If you want to get anywhere in the buy-in with your mother about this, you can't make it about being transphobic or not. You want to frame it as how there are more than one way to honor your uncle.

The reasons you were initially given your birth name(s) came from a position of love and respect which preceded you. You had no opportunity to comment on those reasons. And many people never realize they _do_ have an opportunity to comment. One's name is just ""what you got"" and you gotta live with that, right?

Yes, but not for you. Not for folks with dysphoria or ""baggage"" associated with their name. Some people have more baggage than others -- and yours? It's not your fault. You were assigned baggage which no one realized was heavy when you were born, certainly not your mother.

So what's going on is a ""gap"" between what your birth name represents to you, and what your birth name represents to the people who preceded you, those people who knew your uncle.

Is your mother otherwise fully accepting of you except for your request for your name? Because that's something to look at.

The place to approach the conversation with your mother is empathizing with her attachment to her brother, that you, her child, represents a connection to her brother. The brother is already lost, but you still carry his name -- for her, there is tension about wanting you to be happy and wanting to honor her brother. If she loses his name, she loses her brother all over again.

(i.e. When you were named after him, that was a ""forever acknowledgement"" of your mother to her brother. Is that fair? Sadly, fairness doesn't matter -- emotions must be accepted as valid, and then managed. But you can't help manage emotions until you first accept their validity. Fairness comes last.)

So what to do?...

Well, it is tricky. I don't have enough information to say ""do this"", only ""don't do that"".

If you truly believe in your mother's intentions of being supportive of you, and not ever intentionally being transphobic, don't approach the conversation as being _exclusively_ about you being trans. It's not, at least it is not for your mother. It's about your mother's attachment to her brother and the connection you represent to him.

Approach the conversation from _that_ position. 

No one wins, in any conversation, ever, if you push the other person away before the conversation even starts.

I'm absolutely not saying ""don't change your name"". You should. 

But I am saying ""If you believe that your mother is not transphobic, don't overly simplify this as being -- _for her_ -- about your being trans. It seems more like it is about her perceptions of you ""abandoning your family"", which is a lot different.""

Put another way, in order to be internally consistent in the conversation, you can not claim that ""My name carries meaning and weight"" for you but fail to acknowledge ""My names carry meaning and weight"" for your mother too.

So the case you'll need to make is, to paraphrase:

> _""Mom...I'm not abandoning anyone. 
> 
> I love that I was named after your brother. It's a beautiful name. I was honored, for a long time, to carry it. It's still a great name and your brother was a great person. 
>
> But can you understand that for me, the name carries a much different meaning than it does for you? 
>
> I can now only associate it with my life before I transitioned -- it's all I ever knew, and all I'll ever know it for. It doesn't matter if it is my middle name or not -- it's my life I have to live. 
> 
> How can I help you understand that I'm not dishonoring your brother or my family when I say I've outgrown the name you gave me when I was born?""_

It's damn'd needle to thread. And it's a hard burden for you to carry your mother's emotional water. However, I don't really know another way to approach it without blow back.

And later, the goal should be:

1. You have a name you're comfortable, even excited with.
2. You may look back, regardless of outcome, and know you treated your motherly fairly and with generosity.
3. Your mother may look back and be proud of the fairness, generosity, and acknowledgement you mustered for her.

A lot of us don't have these sorts of conversations with our parents for decades, if ever. That you're having to do it at 17y, get ready grow up fast, and I wish you nothing but the very best.

_____

Some other thoughts:

It has to be asked in the spirt of being through and considering all options: I'm guessing your uncle wasn't named ""Alex"" and you would be comfortable with ""Alexandra"".

Or maybe your uncle had a middle-name which would 

Or maybe you could have a four part name (legally), but for all practical purposes, it's a legal formality...but enough of a fig leaf to have your mother understand you're not ""abandoning the family any more than she has abandoned you""...but you don't actually use it for _anything_ but the very, very few legal documents which require full names.

And then, later on, you can drop the forth name if you want. Or keep it. 

Another option, if you were willing, would be to involve your mother in the selection of your ""new middle name"". Maybe there something or someone your uncle was fond of that has a name which would resonate for you? (ex. Something like ""Uncle Jack's favorite flower were penelopes. I like the sound of Penelope as a middle name...and I don't think I'd mind if my mother called me ""Penny"" on occasion...that's a name I like enough and which, when you know the story, it absolutely still honors my uncle and my family. If it made my mother happy, I'd take Penelope as my new middle name in honor of my uncle.)

You get to choose what to break your sword over. 

Just trying to offer some ideas for you in this moment of stress. You gotta start somewhere, and playing ostrich won't fix anything. So hopefully something will get the juices flowing.

SOURCE: Having a suffix brings up a lot of this sorta ""stuff"", and there is no one right way to do it. But you want to avoid ""wrong ways"". The wrong ways usually involve thinking it's all about you, when in fact, it has very little to do with you -- and that's the source of the tension.

Good luck.
Another trans person named after their dead uncle?! On one hand I’m happy I wasn’t alone but on the other hand I’m super sorry.

But as others have said there are others ways of honoring your uncle without being named after him.
maybe ask her if you could just keep it as initials in your middle name, that's what I plan on doing, as it could mean anything. ultimately its up to you, don't let them make or coerce you into making that decision for you. your happiness is what's most important, you didn't choose to have to carry that name with you and you certainly don't have to keep it because they want you to. this is YOUR transition, not theirs.
>My mom is not transphobic

if she's blackmailing/guilting you into keeping your dead name, she's being transphobic 

>she and the whole family will be devastated and she won't use my correct name or pronouns

this is also blatantly transphobic. cis people that only respect trans people conditionally are still transphobic. only respecting the identities of trans folks that you (general you, not you specifically) like is transphobic.
This sounds selfish and manipulative tbh
My mother is the same way.. Kinda. I changed my first name, but she decided what my middle name is, weirdly enough the name of her dead brother. I don't like it as a middle name, I don't want it. She had no place to choose it. For me, I have to go with it until I move out, talking it out doesn't work in my house. I'd try to bring it up calmly and express why you don't want it to her. I wish you the best of luck mate
Explain to her that you understand how she feels, but that you ultimately have the final say or your identity. You get to dictate your name, and she gets to dictate hers.

Edit: I've noticed quite a few comments saying that you are being ""selfish"" or ""cruel"". Please report and ignore these. They are all transphobes.
not her choice, its ur life
News flash love,  thsts transphobia. Sure, it's not major, but it is still transphobia. You're not her dead brother, and it's kinda fucked up to name someone in ""honor"" of a dead family member.
My dead middle name was that of my late grandfather. I don’t feel bad having gotten rid of it, because felt like I was *dis*honouring him by having his name as a woman, even a feminized version of his name.
Honestly to me that sounds kind of manipulative. Your mom ""honoring"" her brother or commemorating his life should be separate from you and not affect the course of your life. The caveat she added of not using your correct pronouns if you decided to change your name is a big clue. Threats aren't healthy. Remembering somebody is what anniversaries and gravestones are for. You're your own person and you deserve to be WHO YOU ARE. ❤️ that being said I understand how hard it is. I do hope she comes around.
Your mother sounds like a twat. A name is a gift. It is up to you whether or not you keep that gift or return it for something that fits you. The choice is yours and yours alone.
""She's not transphobic""

""She said she and the family won't call me my pronouns or new name if I get rid of the dead name""

That doesn't add up
I would just not change it until you can move out. Then you change it and if she has an issue, just stop talking to her and visiting.

That, or you could try and talk with her and warm her up to the idea. But no one, under any circumstances, should threaten to not use your chosen pronouns or correct name. She does not support you if she thinks that way. 

I would say just go under the radar about it until you can stick up to her.
I will say this, forcing you to answer to a name that she knows makes you uncomfortable is infact transphobic . You are allowed to be 100% authentic. If she values your comfort she will try and understand but purposeful deadnaming and guilt tripping you into answering to something that makes you dysphoric is transphobia.
Maybe time will help honestly. My mom was kind of similar about my deadname but over time once she started to see me as a woman even she was like “yeah that just doesn’t fit anymore.” It took a while though, and your situation might be different.
Ur mom sounds transphobic, respect and correct pronouns should be unconditionally given if she actually didn't mind that you're trans, not only given if you do things her way. Anyways, I say change your name however you want and basically they can cope

>My mom is not transphobic

Your mum is transphobic, if she intentionally won't use your name and pronouns for whatever excuse, she's transphobic.

It wouldn't have been hard for her to find another excuse.
It’s not her name, she doesn’t get a say.
First, For the moment you can At least ask that she refer to you by your chosen first name. If your family isn’t able to respect that before you fully change your name, they don’t deserve to have you do anything for them. 
Second, I’d say don’t make the choice of your name to please your family unless you want to. I myself am considering names and am trying to find ones that fit with traditions in my family that are mostly nonsensical but I like. If it’s something you don’t like don’t do it. 
Third, you might be able to find a version of the name in your preferred gender(I think feminine from context) and add it as an extra middle name, but only if you want.
Tbh that just makes your mom sound very transphobic. If she’s only willing to be respectful if you listen to her, that’s transphobia. You don’t tell a cis girl “ I’m calling you a boy unless you continue to use Jessica “
She needs to move on and deal with her grief over your uncle instead of pinning it on you
Tell her to make it her own middle name
Legally have it as ur middle name but never tell anyone and don’t use it. That’s my solution
Tell her that you're not your uncle, and that it's good to let him go instead of try and hold onto him at the cost of others.
The fact you call it a dead name is all that needs to be said. Your mother and family are heart broken and while you have support it should be noted throwing away your family’s feelings may not be a wise idea. You should not only have a sit down with her as she cares enough to support you for your new name but for a complete disregard for a request like that? 

I’m just some rando on the internet here. I’m not the all wise and knowing. I usually turn to professionals in times of great troubles like this. I’d totally recommend my therapist Bob but I doubt you’re close to him and wish you the best of luck finding one that isn’t trash like many of them are. I also wish you the best of luck through this trial in your life.
Is there potentially a compromise you could make like potentially getting a tattoo of his name or having a feminine version of his name?
Maybe you could have your middle name as his last name? That would still honor him but not have you keep his name
Could you make it your middle name to still honor him?
You can keep it as your middle name. I completely understand your family although it may hurt you. This is a hard spot to be in since I both support your point of view and understand theirs.

I mean I never get called by my middle name really ever not since I was a kid in trouble. Also I know many women with male middle names while some cultures have the middle name be male mainly the father of the child no matter if you male or female or any other. I know you said it would mess up the flow of your true name but some compromise needs to happen as it seems your mother loves you and is supportive so maybe some give and take?
[removed]
shes a selfish bitch, change it and if she doesnt call you your name then ignore her until she does.
Your mom is just manipulative. Do what's best for you.
I'm so sorry your mother is being so manipulative. Helping my daughter choose her name was a joyful moment for her father and I, one I know we'll always remember.

I'm wondering how long it's been since you came out to your mother. I know some parents take longer to come to terms with some aspects, like name changes, even if they are generally supportive in other ways (not that this gives me the vibe your mom is supportive because this is very much not on, and your feelings of hurt are completely valid).

If she can't be reasoned with I guess waiting until you have left and can change it on your own would be your best bet. Try not to worry about her feelings when you do, as at the end of the day our love for our children should be unconditional. It certainly shouldn't hinge on a name.

(edit typo)
maybe if you could find like a feminine version of the name or a similar sounding name but female, like if your deadname was phil then phillipa, just to appease your mum? or you could just say ""fuck you. you do it if you are that annoyed."" or maybe you could find a way to make your name tribute to him, without naming yourself after him, like naming yourself after something he liked? im referring to middle names here ofc
still sounds transphobic. I get shes grieving but she shouldn't put it on you and refusing to use your correct pronouns if you don't do what she would like is STILL transphobic behavior.

Honestly if she can't find a new way to honor her brother without pinning it on her own child she's being a stupid and immature parent anyways.

So what I'm saying you do is you change your name to what you want. I have nothing against your mom because yeah no its painful to lose family but THIS doesn't make ANYTHING better for her and threatens her already existing and ALIVE relationships with her family so it doesn't even help ANYONE ELSE.

Its not on you to keep your uncles legacy or memory alive through your name choices. Its her responsibility to keep her brothers legacy or memory alive through her actions and telling others about him. Names only do so much.

But thats my opinion, advice, and take. I'm not really sure what's happening with you household or you and don't know any of you personally. But I know transphobic behavior when I see it. Even if it isn't outwardly trying to be transphobic.
[deleted]
You could try by just saying you wanted to talk to her. Then you could start with how you don’t want to keep his name since it gives you a lot of dysphoria, and it would make you feel bad if you had to see your dead name everywhere(also make sure you rly jam in how bad it would be for your mental health) also you could always say if she doesn’t use your pronouns or name then you will move out(maybe text a friend or two so you could stay with them for a day or two if she still refuses, just to show you’re serious even if it is just to show) this might be kinda toxic, but if she’s not willing to accept who you are bc of your uncle then that’s her fault and that is something she should deal with.
She doesn't own you, so she's not allowed to force you to be a memento of him.
some people are saying they might want to see the paperwork for your name change,literally justdont tell them,you can do the process without telling anyone close to you about it. And if they want to say no(i know this wouldnt always work) but you could try just saying no,it is not their name it is not their choice,they have no legal reason to see it.
Your name is about you not anyone else. It doesn’t belong to anyone else but you. Explain your feelings about why you don’t want it anymore if she’s willing to listen. If not still change it to what you want it to be. My mom didn’t want me to change mine either because my Grandfather named me. I hated my name my whole life and it was no way I was going to keep it. They can honor your uncle with the next boy born into the family.
It's your name, not your mom's - I understand she might want to honour her brother's name but that shouldn't be used to force you to keep your deadname along with misgendering you.
It's your life and yours alone to live. Don't let them guilt you into keeping a name that you don't want to live with. Yes it has sentimental value to them, but there are plenty of other ways to honor and remember those no longer with us in the physical world. 

Live your life and you'll be happy ❤️💙
This may get lost in the noise, but curious; how long has it been since you told her about the name change? It sounds like she may be in the earlier stages of Grief, and may just need time to process and figure it out. 

Also, if that's the case and she gets to the Bargaining phase (sounds like she's between Anger and Bargaining), is there a feminine version of your uncle's name that would work as a middle name?
Middle name? You can have more than one as well.

 Ever heard of Pippi Long stockings? Look up her full name! Lol
You didn’t choose your dead name, she did, her placing that guilt and “blackmail” on you because it would be devastating to her and the family? What about how it makes YOU feel, how it affects affects your transformation into your real self? Telling you she won’t use your real name OR your pronouns if you do it….manipulation and threats are great parenting when trying to help your child be happy and comfortable in their own skin.
I dont think its a threat worth taking seriously and a lot of people have offered great solutions like changing her own name if it has nothing to do with gender or transphobia.

My mom was critical of my first name and tried to make me share a middle name with my brother because she was obsessed with me keeping my initials. Then to get her way she literally eloped so she could change her name to share our last names again since she changed it back to her maiden name impulsively when she divorced my dad (theres a pattern here) and she did that without even consulting me not knowing I was taking my partners last name and got upset about it.

I literally didn't know she was getting married or changing her name but she's known for years I'm changing my name and its always been an uphill battle because she got shitty advice for some ""parents of trans kids"" online support groups anout how she can learn to accept me better if she has a say in my name.

Idk your situation and maybe thats good advice for parents who actually support trans kids in age appropriate ways but it's a major boundary to cross with your adult children imo.
My mom admitted my deadname was given to me arbitrarily, so I can dismiss refusal to accept me as Irma/Erma as transphobia
you could have your uncles name be your middle name since you never really have to hear it said and it would still be one of you r legal names. might be a good ocmprimise but could also understand if this option seems icky
I was going to suggest middle name but since you arent comfortable with that, how about a ”genderbent” version of it as a middle name? Alexander - Alexandra etc? Idk maybe its a bad idea, or if you’re planning on ever having children you could use it as the kids middle name maybe? Since first name would maybe be wierd? Honestly all the solutions i can think of have major flaws. So well, obviously your mom is the main problem here. So sorry you have to deal with that. I imagine its hard for her when its such a meaningful name, but that shouldnt affect how shes treating you, because you’re here NOW. And he is not.
I'm in a similar situation, but I'm 38. I was named after my great grandmother, Sarah. I have legally changed my named almost 8 years ago but my family of origin still ALL calls me Sarah. It's actually fine, in the beginning I didn't expect them to even try. My mother kinda tries in my presence but clearly never uses my real name with anyone else in the family. It's unclear to me they even know (I didn't waste my time telling people I basically never see or hear from). It's not even a transphobic thing, they literally just can't imagine me with another name and it's not part of their culture. So I just let them, I don't correct. I only visit once a year or less and never see these people so actually when I hear the name it's kinda nostalgic to me, even know I don't really answer to it anymore.
If it's the middle name I wouldn't worry about it too much I've decided to keep mine. As I was named after grandfather was going to go after grandmother as it starts with the same letter but didn't want  to upset several other female relatives named after her. Just work on a nice first name if you haven't got one picked that goes.
I was in a similar situation
My mum asked me to keep my deadname as my middle name as it was important to her
I was uncomfortable and reluctant but I agreed to her request
I decided to agree because almost no one will ever see my middle name
Over time I've come to like it as a middle name, though it does still make me uncomfortable

Obviously you Do Not have to do this, just offering my story as it's somewhat similar 

I hope your mum can accept your decision no matter what that decision is 💞
You dont live your life for your mom or anyone else so theres that.
Wow i can relate to this so much 😭my dying grandfather gave me my deadname and my mom refuses to call me my chosen name and calls me selfish for it... if u ever need to talk im here for u.
Maybe you can change your deadname but tell her you kept it?
I shifted my deadname to middle and added a new first. Maybe that'd work?
My dead name started with H because of my dad's beloved grandfather whose name was Harry. I changed my name but don't feel like a Harry and ended up with an A name. I realized I didn't care about my middle name so I changed it to an H-initialed name to honor my dad's choice. I don't think he's the most pleased but I think he is a little happy I kept that. I wonder if you could eventually bring up doing something similar to see if that would be a possible compromise with your mom. Best of luck!
Maybe you can feminize your dead name and use it as a middle name?
I know what you mean my parents are transphobic so they will force em to keep my dead name and my gender I'm a male that transitioned to a female but my mom doesn't like it
It's just a middle name. Nobody will ever call you by it. Maybe you could compromise and change your middle name to something with the first initial of the Uncle's name?
“I’m not,transphobic, but I’m not respecting your pronouns”
There are a couple of ways you can go about it, what I have done is not really think of my dead name as my name, it is someone else's name, so its not yours, but your uncles name, next if you dont like it as your middle name, you can always have two middle names! And another thing you can do its talk with your mom about the importance of keeping the name in your family, my old middle name was near and dear to my mother heart and I want to have one of my children named with it. Idk these things are hard for parents to adjust to sometimes, they can feel like its an attack on them, when in reality they don't have a say on it. I would continue to bring it up with your mom, so she can one know you are serious about not wanting it, and two have time to adjust to the fact that you won't have the name anymore, and that's okay!

Sorry for the ramble hope this helps! I know it was hard for my parents to come to terms with as well, but when they realized it wasn't about them, they were on board.
Change it to your middle name?
Too bad for your mom. Your dead name never existed. She has to deal with it.
I'm in a similar situation because I was named after my mom's dead friend. It sucks when people try to blackmail you as well as guilt trip you with shit like that
Maybe find a name like you're uncle name or a feminine version but *you're* *name* is *you're* *name* and that's something *you* *get* *to* *pick*, hope this helps you! 😁🥰 💙❤️🤍❤️💙
When I read this, I want to suggest offering her to take it or something. But that's probably a bit confrontational. 

Sounds like a rough situation though, I hope you find some peace with it.
I was named after my grandmother, and when I changed my name legally I made the masculine form of her name my legal middle name to honor her. You can use the feminine form of his name, or if his name doesn't have a feminine form, you could do his middle name! This is all assuming that you actually would want that name though- if not, then it's fine. Your name isn't hers to decide.
If you aren't feeling like super super super dysphoric about it, then keep it until you're in a position to safely change it. I mean if everyone calls you your preferred name, then the only real issue is when you have to pick up prescriptions. Even then, my pharmacy only asks for last name and birthday. I never have to say my birth name.
Is there a Fem Version of your Deadname, it would maybe be compromise to use that as your middle name?
Just put it to your middle name
if she thinks the name is that big a deal then she should change HER middle name as a memorial
I was in a similar boat for a while with my dad since I was named after him and my grandpa, but I changed my whole name, first, middle, and last and it went over well in the end. But I don't know your family like I know mine so I'm not gonna say it will go the same, but I hope it does
Tbh, tell her you'll help her through the process of changing her own name so she can be the one honouring her dead brother instead, and see her make an ass of herself.
How about your mom changes her name to include the dead uncles name? 🤔

I think that’s the only solution here. You carry on with your new fresh name that makes you happy to be you.
IF i was in the same situation as you described it.  i would put a price on her request.  the mom and the rest of the family can pay you to keep it(even if they have to take out personal loans or a second mortgage to meet the price).  The reason i say this, is because transitioning is expensive with everything involved.  I would give her and the rest of the family a dead line, to meet my price.  If its not met, then i change the deadname completely vs keeping it as middle name.  IF they refuse to meet the price or bitch about it, then they must really not care that much about the deadname.  

&#x200B;

This is just me and how my brain works.  For me, if i could have gotten FFS , BA, and BBL paid for just by keeping my deadname as my middle name i would do it.  i wouldnt like it, but i would feel the trade off would be worth it to me.
Now I don't know your mom but you stated she wasn't transphobic and then stated her doing extremely transphobic things
There is no excuse for not using correct name and pronouns. Using the correct name and pronouns does not depend on anything and especially not whether or not you appease your moms transphobic request. 

You’re mom is being transphobic in every possible way. 

Requiring that her kid suffer is not honoring her brother and honestly IMO is very disrespectful to his memory. I certainly wouldn’t want to be the reason that my sister treats her kid like shit for the rest of my sisters life. I’d haunt my sister from the grave.
This is a crazy coincidence, but I am in a very similar situation. I haven't come out to my parents yet, I am waiting until I can't hide my boobs from them anymore. But my uncle died when he was 7 years old from cancer and it really impacted my whole maternal family, but my mom especially. She was only 2 years older than him and they were incredibly close. I am my parents firstborn and my mom insisted I be named after him and my grandparents I feel considered me the surrogate son that they lost. I was incredibly close to my maternal grandparents, and I never felt like I had to live up to any expectations that my grandparents put on me. My grandfather had very advanced dementia at the end of his life. He was the most intelligent man (and my grandmother the most intelligent woman... She was the valedictorian of her graduating class in high school, was the only woman to go to college in her HS and was a big feminist, so was my grandfather) I have ever met. To see him slide down into that terrible disease was heartbreaking. Near the end he actually thought I was his son that had died, and as an adult in college, not the 7 year old with terminal cancer. To see the light in his eyes when he looked at me... I've never felt more pain in my life.

Anyways I am kept up at night about how I'm going to have to break it to my grandmother, and my mom, about being trans and that I don't want to be called by my deadname anymore. I am just imagining the type of response I would get. And the thing is, I know I should feel angry about being placed under the burden of a name by a boy I never met, by people who are supposed to love me as my own person. But the experiences I've had with that side of the family are all wrapped up in it and I feel like I can't cut my name out entirely. I am thinking of making it a middle name of mine when I legally change it.

Anyways, I can really empathize with your position, and it's really shitty that we bear the burden of those we don't even know, even if they are family.
If you holding his name is the only memory they have of him it can't be worth that much.
If she would ever use your dead name and old pronouns as a threat then I regret to inform you but she is transphobic
Your name is your own. She can honour your uncle in a way that doesn’t impose on you and your life. You have to take a strong stance against it and if she doesn’t respect you then she doesn’t need to be in your life along with whatever family members decide to be assholes about it too.
Okay, this is not good. There is more than one way to honor your uncle, you are allowed to change your name to whatever you want, your parents shouldn’t have to decide that for you
I don't know if you want to have any children in the future, but if you do, perhaps you can promise to give one of your children your deadname to honor her brother? Perhaps not as the first name, but at least their middle name? Maybe that might appease her, if you're okay with it?
Is any way you can keep just the first letter?
u love ur mom and want that she is part of your life, i guess she is not ready yet, she choosed your deadname and in her brain all the connections with this deadname are leading to you . i guess it is hard ro rewire the brain structure around names. 

all this doenst mean u have to take care about the time which ur mom needs .. it is your name it is your choice she and everyone else are never abel to change anything about you. your choosen name is fact and nothing to discuss about  - like a fact in a history book, everybody has to accept it bc no one can change! 

wish u well 😊✨
ive got a really weird solution, what was your uncles middle name?
I was named after my two nonnas, so I worry about pushback like this from my dad’s side of the family when it comes to names (my cousin doesn’t even want me changing my surname when I get married 👀💦)

I wish you luck with this. I wish I had some helpful advice but most of what I’m thinking has already been said. 

I hope you can make a name for yourself (if you haven’t already) that you feel comfortable in and that your mom can get over her issues to respect it. 

Take it easy and stay safe <3
That’s some really messed up crap to deal with, that she/your fam seem to give more of a crap about your dead uncle’s memory (RIP honestly)than your happiness & they need to see that she/they may see it as you dishonouring his memory (you’re clearly not dishonouring anything) but by forcing that deadname on you is dishonouring you a living person. 

TLDR: You do you and be happy, meanwhile your mom needs to recheck her priorities
> My mom is not transphobic. 

> She won't use my correct name and pronouns.

These two statements contradict each other. If she won't respect your identity, then she's transphobic. 

There are some things which parents just don't have any say over. This is one of them. This is YOUR life and YOUR wellbeing we're talking about here, not theirs.
I hate to break it to you, but they are transphobic
Im just vier glad, my gromps - whom I got named after - had a pretty androgynous name. Don’t know how to help you, but I wish you all the best!
Your mum is transphobic hun
Tell her to change her name to her brothers name to honor him. She IS transphobic and she's turning a treasured memory into a curse.
That's like the definition of transphobia
All I have to add without even reading any other comments,… is that it doesn’t matter what your “ Mom” wants…. It’s your life,…LIVE IT‼️❣️🎀🏳️‍⚧️
I was given a name that has been passed down from the eldest eldest the eldest son for 9 generations. My Dad passed before I came out and whilst i know he would have been happy for me stepping in to my truth he was very proud of our family heritage and would have been disappointed about the me breaking the tradition and the name being lost. But … as much as I love my Dad and spent much of my life wanting to make him proud, this is my life and I needed to do what was right for me. i’s suggest you do the same.
Your name. Your choice
That's really sad my mom said something similar 
And it hurt me too
Is there like a “genderbent“ version of his name you could use? Or would you not like that
You aren't his legacy, you should be free to write your own
It's not what your mum wants, no disrespect, it's what you want, and want to be known by. It's hardly a crime of the century, let her know that.
i kinda understand why she’d want you to keep your deadname (i disagree nonetheless) but why is she saying she’s also going to reject your preferred pronouns?? like that has nothing to do with her brother i’m??
>and she won't use my correct name or pronouns.

She's going to ""punish"" you for changing your name by misgendering you?

How immature. 

Also, she's putting a dead family member before you.
Just to make an important little comment, blackmailing trans people into following your wish by dangling the threat of misgendering them is blantantly transphobic.
If she wants to honor the name so badly, she can use it herself. She doesn't even have to replace any of her names. People have 4 or even 5 names. She can just add it in there.

How about that?
[removed]
I don't quite know, i know very little about how the name change thing goes, but i know i can do it alone in a few months and that i can probably get help from my school nurse or something
If you're over 18 technically they don't have to know but they may demand to see the paperwork if they're this hung up on it.. 

If you're under 18 yeah.. the parents have more say/control then
This exactly
i was gonna comment something similar. for real comparison she should change her *first*  name to his. if she thinks that sounds uncomfortable, remind her that’s exactly what she’s asking of you in saying you should keep your deadname
My middle name WAS my dad's middle name and his father's middle name. You know how I ""honored"" my dead father. I changed it from John to Johanna. But that was my own choice. And no one forced me.
i don't think she's doing it on purpose i think that she doesn't understand the pain op gets by using their deadname
This is honestly what I was thinking. I realize she probably never thought of it that way, but it really would be no different than her changing her own name to get brother's name.

If after self-reflection she found that that was truly her priority, then she should be willing to make that change for herself.
Maybe she feels like her dead brother will disappear if the name does ?
Total change of topic but we have the same cake day! Happy cake day 🎂🎈
That last sentence said it so well
I think theres room for a bit more nuance here than ""pick one"" seems to allow.

People who are not transphobes on the whole can still make individual choices or actions that are themselves transphobic.  The misgendering thing absolutely is a transphobic action, but in the case of ops mother it sounds as though she will, but only conditionally, which I would assume indicates that as a matter of principal she isnt opposed to using someones personal pronouns like a a real transphobe would be.  

All I can tell you for sure is that shes a manipulator, but I dont think its fair to label her a transphobe based on what limmited info we have from a single post.  Doing that isnt going to help op anyway
This might soften the blow a little? Or maybe google the “meaning” of the name and see if there’s a name out there with a similar “meaning” that you like? 

It’s still your name at the end of the day though, OP. So, you should do what makes you happy.
I tried asking to use another version of the name as a middle name, i don't 100% like it but i worship it in comparison to my deadname, nope, it has to be my deadname
I know your comment is in good faith so im not attempting to criticize you personally in this reply, however I sinply cant get behind this line of thought. 

This ""solution"" really doesn't feel like it respects op's personal agency at all on the matter.  They should be able to pick any name they want for themselves irrespective of how it makes anyone else feel.  It seems deeply wrong to suggest ""compromise"" on a process as non-trivial and of such long-term consequence as shaping your identity just for the sake of not hurting a dead person or manipulative mother's feelings...
I agree that its selfish, but one thing i feel i want to say is that she's not turning our family against me, they're not in the argument, they don't even know about it, and i actually don't know their opinions on the matter
This is a p gud idea imo, but if they are this hung up on the name they may ask to see the paperwork 🙃
Did people continue calling you your deadname?
I never met my uncle either, but I'd think he would be the kind of uncle that's really supportive but so confused, like ""YEAH PRIDE, did pride stand for something or was that the lbtq?""

I hope wherever you move, if you move, its filled with allies and lgbtq+ people :)
your comment was worded beautifully, better than i could ever even try to explain! i agree completely
Im very sorry, im named after my uncle but i got a feminine version of his name, im genderfluid not a girl
i'd also like to say my plan on keeping my middle name as initials in honour of my grandmothers was my choice, not anyone elses. if you don't want that for yourself, dont do it.
Thanks, dude
She's not against of op's transition, it's about the memory of a significant person's passing that she doesn't want to go away. I don't think it's transphobia what this is, it's more that she can't let go of that other person completely
The problem i have with that is that my family would know, and my id or card would give me dysphoria
i dont quite understand what you mean by *""the fact you call it a dead name is all that needs to be said""*
the term ""dead name"" is a very important term for many trans people, it means that for you, the name is no longer in use, think something like a ""dead end"" on a road

and while yes, i agree that it may be upsetting for the family to deal with, its still a wild overaction. it is not op's responsibility to carry on that memory, especially considering how much the name makes them uncomfortable. if their mother cares so much about the name, why not change her own middle name to be it? like i said, it's not op's responsibility, and they shouldn't be made to feel like it is.

names, especially for trans people, are often extremely important. op's mother has actively been throwing away op's feelings, by not only requesting they keep a name that hurts them, but also using their deadname as a weapon against them. she clearly does not care about her own childs feelings and comfort in this situation.

there are many ways to honor the deceased family member that DOESN'T include inflicting sadness on another. forcing op to keep the name is not one of those ways.

i hope this message does not come across as argumentative or angry, but more informative.
Why would OP have to get a tattoo? Why not the mom and the rest of the family?
If u know that its my name, then what is it? You clearly know me enough to know my name 😂. Whats my name?
Awwww thankss i know ur trying to be transphobic, but u failed and u made me smile
im not really sure whos side you are on, but as a trans person, deadnames can hurt so much. its a lot more than just ""something you are called"". the importance behind someone's name, especially a trans person's name, is very much real.

it changes how people view you, and even how you view yourself. especially in this situation where op's deadname is being used as a weapon against them.

being deadnamed is incredibly emotionally damaging for many trans people, and the freedom to get to have a name that fits you as your true self is a very important thing.

that being said, the feeling is different for everyone, some like their name, some are ok with just changing their name to the masc/fem version of it, and others want an entirely different name. all of these are valid, no matter the reason behind it.
My deadname connects to way more than just my dysphoria. It connects to me being bullied for years for it, it connects to everyone saying dumb stuff about it and me. It connects to all the abuse I've went through. It's not ""just a name"".
this is particularly rich coming from someone that less than a half hour ago told someone to use a 12 gauge on themselves.
If she doesn't like the name she shouldn't have to keep it, it's manipulative as shit.
I don't think coming to a compromise is somthing that someone should have to do when it comes to somthing as identity defining as a name.

I get that you are trying to give advice to avoid conflict but the mother is being so unfair to OP. If my middle name was male I'd have chainged that as soon as I could.
I tried compromising with her, my name is a feminized version of my uncles name ('his name'+'a little longer and more feminine'), ive considered using his name as a middle name or using another name that has his name but a little longer and more feminine and i really like that name. She only wants my deadname.
I don't quite understand what you mean by ""you are taking in your play pretend""? But please continue if you'd like, i wanna understand your perspective of the situation a little deeper if i may
if you want to make your middle name a similar sounding name i can help, i keep a big record of names and could possibly find you a middle ground name?
What do you mean by double deadname?
So much of American culture is built around this absurd belief that children are literally the property of their parents. It's really messed up.
I came out in February and told her my name and pronouns, and my deadname is a feminine version of my uncles name (im genderfluid)
Mine to it was inspired but a billboard
Facts.
Works for me. She can make the decision for herself and not force someone into something they don’t want. Sounds like a win to me :)
Uhhhhhh…. Is something upsetting you? Or did you mean to reply in another thread?
If you change it when you're legally an adult (usually 18, but depends on country, etc) then there would be no way for your mom to know unless she saw the paperwork,  your new ID, or if you told her.

 There's definitely help out there for filling out the paperwork as well! Where I am, Ontario Canada, there are a number of lgbt volunteer organization that will help you fill it out

And like many others have said, you are not at all in the wrong here, your mom is. It's very disrespectful and transphobic of her (although she likely doesn't understand that at this point) to insist you keep a name that makes you uncomfortable

When I changed my name I asked my mom if she would like to help pick a new middle name, that might be a possible way to compromise with her?
I hope they can advise you! I know that a lot of these things depend on where you live as all the laws are differnt.

If you chainged your name but told your mom you kept the deadname as a middle one, you'd have to be careful about keeping all your new legal documents from her, but it seems like only way to let you get rid of that name withought having to chainge your name twice.
Name changes require a notice in the local newspaper; does she read the newspaper? It’s usually located near the classifieds. My middle name was also for a great uncle, I ended up shortening it to being only 1 letter, the first letter of his name. People assume it’s just an initial and I kept it, when in fact I just wanted to have the will of d.
She is absolutely doing it on purpose. She is threatening to use wrong pronouns etc if op changes name. This is manipulative and unacceptable parenting. If the name is that important to her she needs to change her middle name to her brothers name it’s really that simple and would ultimately be more meaningful than threatening her child .
Yeah i feel like the mom here has some grieving left to do, and maybe needs to go and speak with someone. I don’t think shes coming from an entirely evil place based of this post. But that doesnt defend her actions.
happy cake day for both of you!!
The definition of a transphobe is, quite literally, a person conducting themselves in a discriminatory and/or offensive way towards a trans person for reasons related to their nature.

Now, we can argue whether this person is redeemable, better than the others or whatever you want, but it does not make her NOT transphobic. At most it makes op's mom LESS transphobic.
That’s her just making up reasons for you to keep your dead name.

She is very clear that she is not willing to take your thought and feelings into her opinions.
She is literally telling you that you don’t have control over your own name.

Relationship with family, especially family you financially depend on, is very important. So I hope you are able to change it without her knowing, because she does not sound like she cares and will not budge.
Lol that’s when I upload the document, amend the middle name (terribly and obviously looking) and print it out 😜. (I have a defiant streak when it comes to people asking me for proof)
Happy cake day btw!
It will constantly remind you of being mis gendered, but if you like the name then go for it.
Not the people that mattered, however it shows up on a surprising amount of things. Which us just a reminder all the time. Plus people have used the excuse to call me by it, because it's still your middle name. A lot of people take to using both names instead of just my first also, which is annoying. Like they are trying to hang on to something from the past. 

I don't hate my dead name, just hate it on me. I kept it because my daughters name was a combination of my wife's middle name and my dead name, which is now my middle name. So it's for a good reason, but still don't recommend it.
Oh sorry that was my bad for assuming!

I’ll edit my previous comment thank you for correcting me 😊
it is transphobic, very much so, though maybe not entirely intentional. using op's deadname and pronouns as a weapon against them is NEVER acceptable, under any circumstance, and would be classified completely as transphobia.

transphobia comes is many ways, unfortunately. like i said, it might not be all intentional, and i definitely think their mother is still suffering with grief, and while i think that properly *explains* her actions, it does not *excuse* it.
Legally (in the US), you can have as many middle names as you want, but only the first one is shown on most ID. So your name could be “Alice Jane Billybob Smith”, but your ID would generally look like “Alice Jane Smith” or “Smith, Alice J”.
Yeah that’s tough :/ depends how much you value ur mom using your name and not your dead name.
Okay, not arguing here. But OP did call it a dead name. 

Family’s feelings are just as important to consider as OPs. I’m not going to force OP to keep their “Dead Name”. But to ignore it’s importance to the family is plain ignorance. 

That’s why it’s important for professionals help if one actually looks for it. It’s not too late to do that especially if it makes them seem the more reasonable adult here. It’s also done me and a whole lot of people good if they actually find someone that takes it serious enough. Thus why it sucks I can’t recommend OP my Bob the Therapist cause he would have done a lot of good for people just as he has done for people like me.
I didn’t think of that, lol
I don’t see why that isn’t a very reasonable and fair thing to do
Ignore him he's a transphobe. The subreddit is being raided.
i would ignore this person. Theyre a transphobic troll account
Don't engage with this person, honey, they're clearly transphobic and most likely a troll.
I'm so sorry if that was insensitive, I meant shes wanting you to use a name that already belongs to a dead person, it made more sense in my head.
Yeah, that's part of why I've been out of my parent's care since 16
Ok, then that legit seems reasonable. You're taking the name still on as if they had a daughter and they wanted to honor your uncle.
is that in the USA here in NZ you just fillout some forms (if under 16 child needs parental consent) get a Justice of the Peace to sight original documents and sign and stamp the copies..

&#x200B;

we recently changed our son's name and no newspaper notice was required
This!! She is transphobic. This mom sees using OP’s correct name and pronouns as a privilege that can be taken away and used as punishment. Transphobia 101
I think she is. Because she specifically said she won’t use correct name or pronouns. 

If she said ‘no <correct pronouns> I want to call you <wrong name>’
That would be more acceptable.

Instead the mom is just straight up transphobic
>The definition of a transphobe is, quite literally

I tried searching webster, [dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com) and [dictionary.cambridge.org](https://dictionary.cambridge.com) only to find that NONE of them had an entry for the word ""transphobe""  so your assertion that ""the definition is quite literally blah blah blah"" is itself in fact - quite literally - just your own words.

""transphobia"" and ""transphobic"" both have entries with definitions, but neither matches what you rattled off, so I don't see much merit in discussing this with you and derailing the thread over semantics.
Thanks!
There's been a few people who assumed that, even a transphobe, that was fun
Ok.. maybe you're right, maybe i'm just trying to justify my own mother's behavior towards me.
i absolutely agree with you that their families feelings are important, my main point was that op is a human being, not a headstone to remember their uncle, and if they do not want to keep their name, they should not be forced to, as there is many other (and better) ways to honour him

and yes, i recognize that op called it a deadname. it can definitely sound odd, considering the relative is no longer here, but the term ""dead name"" has nothing to do with life or death, that is a very common misconception. like i said with ""dead end"" it is supposed to be more of a ""hard stop"" not a ""death"", hope that cleared some confusion up

and yes i absolutely agree that a professional is an amazing resource to have in situations like this. especially considering op's mother is still seemingly grieving, a therapist would be highly suggested. its a bit tricky to find a good therapist, especially with trans issues, but i definitely agree that having a good one is important
Ohhh, oki thanks
Ohh no no its not insensitive, i was just confused
It depends on the state in the US, some don't require the newspaper thing.
It’s real nice this was a vent. Cause I really didn’t need all that. I didn’t need these things explained to me. OP done enough of that  and am going to leave it at that cause this was all for them. 

You don’t need to explain every little thing like people don’t know no better. Should try easing off that kind of behavior cause I doubt people like that unless they asked for it.
erh, well i must have worded something wrong here, i genuinely did not mean to upset you!

i hope you have a good day (or night, whatever it is for you), and i wish you well!
Look, It was probably the meds I’m taking. Though we’ll call it even as friendly advice and bygones be bygones. Appreciate the apology and sincerely hope you take mines back for whatever it’s worth. Don’t need to write back. Enjoy the upvote for being understanding.

Hey all :) my eating disorder has been really eating at me (punny) and I’ve just generally been having a rough couple days with dysphoria alongside dysmorphia. I hope you’re all having a good day!! :)		"It's ok to have rough days your strong and can get through it, also looking absolutely beautiful
I don’t want anyone to feel obligated to say anything however, if you’d like, do you genuinely think I pass at all? At least with my dresses. I feel as if I do and it’s just been a breath of fresh air with my transition
You look amazing no doubt you will over come this disorder
Why are all transbians so pretty


Like wtf is up with u guys?

Do u make some kind of special cuteness soup that you eat?
You totally pass, girl 💖 you look like a female Youtuber I love btw haha

Eating disorders are horrible, hope you have a nice week and have support from loved ones 🥰
Gaddman I *wish* I looked as good as you do! I'm a baby trans girl, so I don't even close to pass :(
Good morning beautiful
Sorry yo hear you are having a rough time. I hope it gets easier for you!
First of all, heckin cutie right here
Sadly relating to you rn. It makes me feel not alone when I see trans people talking about having ED’s and dysmorphia along side dysphoria. I can’t really look into it as much as I used to because ED communities are so, so triggering (even ones masquerading as ‘recovery’ spaces) but posts like this, which don’t go into detail and just show pics of other beautiful trans people make me feel supported honestly. I really hope you can recover and feel comfy. Annoyingly I have to start recovery in order to access hormones but it’s so difficult to start! Best wishes x
I hope you feel better soon! I struggle with this as well and it sucks. Wishing you well 🖤
That top looks so cute!!! Where’d you get it?
Rough days come and go. It's not how bad you feel during its how you keep going and stand taller after that matters. 
You look great and are very passable. Keep going down your path and never forget you are stronger than anything or anyone that tries to take you down.
Lovely face and figure!

Honey I’m sure you look absolutely FANTASTIC. You complimenting me means the world to me as I feel the same as you do. Know that there’s filters, angles, the fact it was simply a good day. There are tons of things at play in these photos that I want you to know you are AMAZING just as you are :) I’m not perfect nor will any of us be. If anything our flaws become the intricate little details that commemorate us. I hope you have a great afternoon darling 🖤
Ello my dood

You all are so sweet, I could never have expected as much of an overwhelmingly kind response as all the wonderful things I’ve read :)) 🖤

Do I pass ? The reason I ask is sometimes I am biased against because dysphoria and other times I feel like confidence makes me think I pass when maybe I don’t thoughts ?		"Almost. You look pretty androgynous but something told my subconscious ""boy face"" but with that said you're still really cute and look cute as hell femme like that. I've also seen cis girls who look like you so maybe my brain is biased from dysphoria too.
Girl you're beautiful!! (｡♡‿♡｡)
I'd say the vast majority of people would just recognise you as female. 

Also I didn't read what sub this was in or the title and so thought this was something about Greta Thunberg.
Yes,didn't even know pre until I read it.
(Pre everything )
My genuine reaction was ""what"" because I was confused as to why a cis person was trying to pass then I realised.
I think so, I don’t think I’d clock you on the street unless you caught my attention and I had something spark suspicion. With that said, although I don’t think you’re in danger of being read as male quite yet, I think you’re pretty close to being very clockable, which is something I mostly get from the quality of your skin - which HRT would  fix pretty quickly. ❤️ You are very pretty!
I don't know if you would male-fail (be read as a woman in full men's clothes) but I think as long as you present female like you are here, I don't think many people will clock you.  If you're on HRT that should continue to get even better though!
I'd like to show your dysphoria this picture and if it says anything other than ""here is a powerful, strong, and awesome woman"" then I'll kick it, over and over until it does.

Because you're **clearly** a powerful, strong, and awesome woman!
Hon, you definitely pass. And you are GORGEOUS
i love the red and black theme you've got going on girl! :)
You look just fine, graceful and feminine.  many cis women have “masculine” traits but that doesn’t make them less womanly🤷🏻‍♀️ you just let that soul of a woman through ❤️
Whatever your doing its working. Keep going.
Yes! I can see a little trans-ness but only because you've revealed you're trans.
You look great. Definitely pass, but (if you are wearing makeup i cant exactly tell) you should practice a bit more, maybe a different hairstyle could match you better becouse your face still looks pretty androgynous. Either the makeup or the hair, i dunno but get something to frame your face better (sorry if i come off as rude)
100% pass, you look just like my cis friend. Honestly I kinda thought this was a picture of her for a second lol
I just thought you were a teenage girl, so I’d say so
Indeed you do milady, I'm jealous of your lips and nose, is your hair brunette with red tips??
I think it’s pretty clear that you do pass, so I’m just gonna talk about something else. I really like the look of that bandanna in your hair, you’re super pretty!
I always look at pictures before I read the titles. I saw you as a cis girl before you told me you're trans.. I'm in a lot of lgbt selfie groups, so I didn't think twice about you.
I think you look fine, passing is a difficult concept and I don't think pictures do a very good job at telling the whole story. What stands out to me is your pose which seems a little stiff and masculine? It's just a small thing. Keep in mind transphobes tear apart cis women for body details, poses and so on to wrongly call them out as trans. Don't obsess too much! You're a woman regardless of what other people think or say.
Immediate impression was cis female. Without seeing the sub, I would’ve thought this was r/womensstreetwear. It was only until after I read the title and started to answer the question that I noticed, as already stated, you’re pretty androgynous, but for being pre-everything, being andro is definitely not a bad thing. One thing I noticed is you definitely present yourself as very feminine, with your pose, which is one thing I’m having a lot of trouble doing without feeling like a mime. Also as stated, you’re hella cute and will absolutely slay if/when you start HRT.
I think you pass.  Keep in mind that sometimes the standards that some trans women set for passing would make a lot of cis women not pass.  You are what you are and you are a beautiful woman.  You have a long road ahead of you and you’re off to an amazing start.
I think the top commenter is wrong. I wouldn’t clock you at all
As FtM my bias might go the other way,  but you look passing to me in this photo. 

Also, I think that looking confident and comfortable can go a long way in passing or at least stopping people from questioning so much. If you look like you know what you're doing, other people at least subconsciously pick up on that.
You pass great, You have a masculine face but that doesn't mess with your charm it adds to it like the face still looks pretty feminine! I'll trade you my estrogen for your tostorone...
For pre everything this is insane your futures golden
[deleted]
I think you do.
Well I mean I think you pass :)
I would say yes.
You pass at 100%
Defo a pass. So long as you feel comfortably and confident, nothing else matters!
Yes yesyes
You pass very well
You pass perfectly honey
You definitely pass!
[deleted]
Pass, pass, PASS! OMG you look great!
Very androgynous, on the femme side. It would come down to talking and movements

Edit i mean you look good though
💗🚬💥💦💦
If I saw u and I didn’t know you I would think you were a cis girl
You definetly pass, pretty sure your one of the most prettiest girls out there
Yes you pass....without any doubt😉
No, you really do pass well 👍🏼
I only see a perfect girl.
You are a beautiful young woman, believe in yourself, my friend.
Beautiful girl right there
I thought this was r/PrettyGirls for a second
Awe dysphoria is evil. You look so so cute <3 I totally think you pass :3
Yes, I didn’t know you were trans till I noticed what sub I was in and read the title, you’re very pretty
Yass queen
Yeah you definitely pass, and very cute
Definitely! Honestly wouldn't have even known if I hadn't seen this on r/trans
Jup, you absolutely do. You have a really cute, round face!
I appreciate your honesty
It's like a tiny shadow of stubble I think? But I wasn't sure if that was just an actual shadow. I would definitely think ""girl"" running across this person in the wild, but a transphobe looking for a reason to be an asshole might see enough to work with.
Ty xx
😂
Oof
Ty xx
Pre everything? Incredible, you already pass. I can only image post everything.
Yeah if you jump on the hrt train, Its GONNA BLOW OUR MINDS.
Yeah, you pass. And I'm sure you'd pass even more on HRT.
Ty xx
Ngl same
Ty yeah I can’t really speak in public because people clock me straight away but I’m working on that and yeah I get what you mean about my skin c
I’m not yet so fingers crossed 🤞🏿 it does get better I have kinda a baby face so I’m hoping that stays until I’m on e
Ty x
Nah I understand what you mean I had it back because it was a windy day as you can see by the look on my face 😂
Ty xx
I am only 16 and ty
Yes sorry for late reply ,but I’m about to dye it black it took a year for it to look the way I wanted (the red I mean)
Yeah that’s why I’m happy about my kinda baby face because that means it will and can be shaped by oestrogen
Ty xxx
Deal 😂
I truly hope so xx
Ty xx
Ty x
Cute ❤️
Ty xx
Thanks. I'm always afraid to be rude but I try to keep in mind when I post here I want people to be honest too.
at a glance you look like a badass female. You pass but you can always improve!
Yo not gonna lie I deadass thought you where ftm (pre everything) for a sec and was curious about why a ftm would not use a binder
Np
I truly hope so ❤️😂
Its one of the first things that will change with HRT, so I wouldn’t worry about it too much. :)
Ahh, things should only get easier for you with time and HRT then! (Once you're able to get it)

Do you have a plan for getting HRT?  If you're in the US and an informed consent state you can get it pretty easily and quickly.
oh sorry then lol
All good mate. Ayyy you're gonna rock that midnight hair, dang you're patient af a year? Are you gonna do pure black or the blue black coloring?
Just make sure you train your voice! Everyday spend some time working on it. I do every night before bed
ZERO doubts. 
Good luck!
I’m in the U.K. so long waitlists for me but I’ll probably get private healthcare which costs money but is really fast
Pure black

Am I not trans? Help!	"I have been feeling like I'm trans for some time now. I have not been getting any serious body dysphoria, but I more thrived on the verbal validation of others.

Recently, I started seeing a psychologist (not because I'm trans) and we got to the topic of gender.

Now, she asks if anything happened to me when I was younger, and I recalled living with my grandparents for a while when my baby brother was born because my mother couldn't take care of the both of us at the same time.

And then she says: ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" 

I'm stumped. What the fuck does this mean?? I mean, the fact that I don't get body dysphoria but if people misgender me I get sad, and then this got me thinking - am I really transgender? 

I know this sounds dumb but am I just coping and cis? When I get therapy will I magically be okay with being a woman? Are my feelings invalid because of early childhood problems?

I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man, and now I feel like my feelings are wrong, I'm lying to myself, and I'm starting to doubt myself again. This is messing with my brain, and I needed to hear the thoughts of other trans folk.

tl;dr - my psychologist told me I was trans because I was ""jealous of my brother getting my parents' attention when I was younger"", and now I'm starting to feel doubt. Any thoughts?"	"Regardless of trans stuff, that’s just bad therapy. Therapists aren’t supposed to tell you their theories flat-out, they’re supposed to let you figure it out on your own. 

OP, if this idea she gave you doesn’t resonate with you and if it doesn’t sound true, that means it almost definitely isn’t. You know yourself better than she does.
Yea nah, that's bullshit. That's borderline conversion therapy, trying to make you believe you're faking it for attention.
Thats just bad therapy. Like other said, a therapist is meant to ask the right questions to help navigate you instead of telling you their own opinions and theories. Just because theyre called a therapist that doesnt automatically make them a proper therapist.
Ummmm yeah this has actually been historically the tactic used on gay people in conversion therapy: that the only reason they are gay was from some trauma as a child. This is obviously not true, and I doubt there is really any evidence this is the case for any gay people or trans people.

I once heard someone say this on trans issues: “if you have been contemplating whether or not you are trans for a while, it means you probably are”

I’d highly recommend talking to either another therapist, or maybe just ask around here on how other trans people feel. I always find that super helpful for getting someone to figure out their own gender identity imho.
At this point i almost want to ask, does it really matter if that is the reason? You say you feel better when spoken to as a boy, for me that is enough to say ""geat then I'll speak to you as a boy"". My own journey was one of discovering the things that made me happy and then labelling came afterwards. I feel happy when binding my chest, and presenting more masc and using the words he/him, so i do just that. It doesn't matter if that makes me cis or trans. I know it can be frustrating to maybe not completely fit in with one label, but in the end, it's all about what makes you happy.
I've been in a similar situation and not having dysphoria doesn't mean you're not trans, but just take your time figuring stuff out sometimes that's all you need and if you don't, ask people for help who you feel safe with or who will accept you. I hope you find what you're looking for.
CHANGE THERAPISTS RIGHT NOW. you are so valid.
You're valid and your therapist is talking shit. I have 2 kids (1 boy, 1 girl) and can guarantee you that kids don't even see gender. My son only started saying ""that's for boys/girls"" when he heard it from other kids at age 3/4 and didn't even form an idea of gender until 5/6. My daughter is 2 and has no clue about gender. If you were 1 you would not have been able to form a conclusion that your brother got your parent's attention because ""he was a boy and you weren't"" (assigned so, at the time, sorry to kind of misgender you there but timelines make it tough). Kids are genderless, in their own mind at least (for a couple years). We gravitate towards what we like. We grow into our gender. We only deny it when society tells us we don't fit its expectations. Sorry for the essay. If you are happy as a boy, then you're a boy.
I mean it‘s easy to answer, isn‘t it? How did you feel at that time, what was it like when you were with your gramdmother?  
How did you feel when you returned home?  
Do you feel the same now?
what kinda Freudian bullshit is this lol. get a new therapist
nah thats bullshit, your valid as heck and shes a bad therapist. 

this is actually a tactic that was used by people to “convert” gay people, they make them question the validity of their identity by saying that the reason why their trans/gay mustve been created from trauma.
Gender euphoria is generally a better indicator than gender dysphoria is. What makes you feel the best? Try some stuff out and see what works. It's all about exploration. You're valid regardless of what you decide is right for you <3
That's not even proper psychology. She is incredibly transphobic, and looking for reasons to tell you it's not real.
I’m not trans… 

But holy shit can I spot a bad therapist a mile away. I don’t know you. I don’t know them.

But a session with your therapist should not have you coming to a question board for emotional therapy, AFTER your therapy session.

Find someone who respects you first.
Your therapist is trash. They often are. Find a new one.
That’s almost like conversation therapy bruh, don’t listen to it and just take your time figuring it out on your own terms or with someone who is accepting, you should really stop seeing this person cause realistically this won’t help you figure out if ur trans or not if ur with someone who by the sounds of it doesn’t like or accept trans ppl
Like others have said, that's not appropriate in therapy. Therapists don't tell you your feelings are wrong and give their version of what's going on in your brain. 

I've struggled with doubts like yours. I've never had anyone say it to my face like that, but I have wondered if I'm not trans but just frustrated with the limitations of being a woman in society (I'm definitely trans). Also 5 years ago I thought I didn't have any body dysmorphia either. I think I was not in touch with my body, because that has changed. But, either way, you don't have to have body dysmorphia to be trans. 

Accepting that you are trans is such a vulnerable position to be in that it's no wonder we doubt ourselves. It might be one of the worst aspects of being trans. Don't feel down if you doubt yourself. I've found it's helpful to think of myself as non-binary. It's true -- I do feel non-binary -- but it also really takes the pressure off of phrases like ""wanting to be a boy"" --- you just wanna be you.
I'm a psychology student. Don't take psychoanalysts (Freud's line of psychology) too seriously, they tend to try to explain what you're feeling from some bullshit occurrence from your past, even though it might not make any sense. There's some truth in trying to find things out from the past, but senseless speculation doesn't get it anywhere. It's always things that apparently make sense, but that can't be proved or disproved. Sure it makes logical sense (?), but that can't in a million years be taken as definitive proof to what you're feeling.

But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn't realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn't know that you're born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity
Nobody knows why people are trans, because it's not an easy topic. 

I know other people have said that the therapist is practicing bad therapy here, but let's hear the therapist out.

What if you are jealous of your brother and wanted to be a boy because of it? You are now an adult who feels happier as a man than you did as a woman.

That's the bit that's functional and meaningful to who you are. Nothing in your past invalidates who you feel like you are today. You are who you are, and you being a man makes you happy.
This bothers me on so many levels. As a trans person, it feels incredibly reductive to reduce something as complex and life-encompassing as identity to a single childhood incident. They're treating your trans identity as a trauma symptom, which is incredibly offensive.

As a trainee therapist, I hate hearing about counselors who allow their ideology to override their professional standards of care. This is the opposite of strengths-based and client-centered; they're treating your identity as a problem rather than a source of strength and telling you what to think rather than letting you take the lead. This person has no business working with queer clients if this is how they approach it.
completely regardless of your transness or lack thereof that is a major therapist red flag
If this were possible, there would be a *lot* more people mistakenly identifying as trans, which we just don’t see. 

You, sir, are almost certainly trans.
Yep, most people already said it, you should either change therapist or just not discuss this with her at all. Dysphoria isn't a requirement for being trans, if you feel like you are a man, then you are a man.
Even if that were true, and it sounds like bullshit, but even if that were, why would it effect who you are now? Regardless of the root cause, you still feel gender euphoria, you still enjoy being referred to as a boy and presenting as such. That doesnt change because your psychologist has a theory. Focus on who you are now, not who you might have been as a child. The child isnt living your life, you are
The best thing someone told me is that gender euphoria is much more important than dysphoria. Feeling good about where you are is much more important than feeling like where you’re at is wrong.

In regards to the therapist, either change or try new another one. If lots of them say the same thing, you might’ve been “jealous” of the attention, but there’s many more steps between “jealous of brother” and “I’m a trans man.” It’s not the “cause,” but it could have opened a new hidden perspective that opened your mind. Childhood memories manifest in mysterious ways. Just know that wanting to be a boy isn’t a bad thing.

At the end of the day, this is about you. Don’t shoehorn yourself into being cis or trans. It’s a long journey, and you can switch back and forth to find that perfect middle if needed.
Everyone else straight up shared my thoughts on gtfa from that psycho.  When I started seeing a therapist because I was worried I was only identifying as trans because I was having a manic episode or something she told me that only I could know that, but did tell me I just seemed happy and I did not seem to be presenting the symptoms of a manic episode.
You need a new therapist/psychologist. You definately are trans, and even if you weren't, that's just bad psychology. Your psychologist isn't you, so they should never be telling you how things made you feel
This is a tactic people have used against gay people for ages. It's the classical ""something must have gone wrong in your childhood and that's why you THINK you aren't straight"".
It's nothing less than a discriminating heteronormative (society expecting everyone to be cis and heterosexual) narrative.
Psychologists should never invalidate your feelings. Have her point you to the research that says being transgender is caused by childhood experiences. As far as I'm aware, no such research exists.
The therapist shouldn't be saying things like that; it sounds like she doesn't understand the trans perspective. I recently had this problem too when looking for a therapist and I realized that even if you aren't going to therapy for trans related issues, it can be a problem that your therapist doesn't ""get it"" for this very reason. If her comment left you saying, ""What? Huh? I feel that way? Really?"" Then it's probably not right. She may be a professional, but without that perspective, she is looking through a biased lens at your problems and offering solutions to what she perceives as a cis woman with trauma. 

At the end of the day, you know yourself the best; you're valid regardless of any opinion, professional or no. Hope you feel better soon, and I hope that this was just a professional blunder on your therapists part.
Regardless of anything, therapists aren't supposed to do that. That exact theory is so full of bullshit that I can't begin anywhere on her thing.
I'm a pre everything trans man and I have almost no disforia (I can't spell and auto correct sucks) but oh boy do I get uforic when people see me as a man. I was smiling all day after some called me brother and I'm depressed as fuck and rarely feel anything other than meh so that day solidified me being trans. Btw what your therapist said sounds like something a shitty tv therapist who was written by someone who hasn't gone to therapy. Please look for a therapist that fits you better.
The absence of dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re not trans.  Focus on the euphoria you get from gender affirmation.  Even if your feelings about your gender were shaped by this event in your early childhood (I’m not saying they were), it doesn’t invalidate the feelings.  There are many ways to look at gender identity. Some say the soul has gender and that it can differ from your physical sex, while others say that the body is simply a canvas for us to make of it what we wish.  I prefer the latter, being agnostic and preferring not to put a definition on the soul.
Your therapist is not a good therapist. You're a man because you were born a man and will stay a man. It's not like you were female and then you became a boy because of your brothers, you're a man and you are valid and you deserve a better therapist. *hugs*
Hello me from whenever I grow enough balls to ask my mom for a therapist (not because of trans things as well). I'm not in your situation yet but remember that not every trans person has body dysphoria also I don't know about you but I did some really egg like things before I found out about that I'm probably trans, to give examples of my own life: I wore dresses to school twice before finding out I'm trans (I'm transfem), in 7th grade I held a presentation about gender swapping in video games, I mostly played female characters in video games. Those examples might not apply to you but maybe you can think of something that you did in the past
that's some of the worst psychology I've ever seen
Please don't speak to that person anymore thats incredibly unprofessional. No life experience can ""cause"" you to be transgender or experience gender dysphoria. You are just trans. Thats all. That person is not only reaching for the stars but is incredibly misinformed and hurting others in the process
Your therapist is not well educated.
Trans is any discontinuity between gender assignment at birth (usually presumed by obvious sex characteristics), and how you feel inside (identity).

It is not required to be a consistent disparity through time.  It is not required to be validated nor negated by confounding or causal factors.

As to the therapist, they are supposed to guide you through your own thought discovery, and not define things for you.  A supposition, “maybe” or “could it be” is the more proper wording from them.

If they are seeking agreement from you, that would be another problem.  If disagreement is a threat to them, that would also be a problem.  You should feel empowered to advocate for yourself, but not required to do so.

In the end, a therapist is someone you can talk about your inner struggles, secrets, etc., who will help you excavate the things you may not realize, or hide from.  If this gets you thinking, then maybe it’s effective.  Questioning yourself is an important part of self discovery.

But, they should have worded this differently.  You should be able to go back and say you are not sure you agree, or even if you do agree, that you can define which parts you actually struggle with vs do not.

Just my thoughts, and not any sort of professional opinion, etc.
Your therapist is probably full of shit, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're necessarily going to benefit from transitioning either. Take a little while to reflect and talk to a different therapist, preferably who specializes in gender therapy
You don't have to have dysphoria to be trans!  I'm sure other comments mentioned that as well but it's so important to remember.  You are valid and you know yourself way better than that therapist.
Oh no freudian psychology
I can’t tell you if you’re trans or not cuz I don’t know a whole lot about you, but it based on the fact that you had no doubts before and you genuinely feel uncomfortable being misgender, it seems like you most likely are trans since the only thing that made you doubt yourself is what your therapist said.

A lot of trans people do struggle with thoughts that they’re “faking” and “just doing it for attention” so you’re definitely not alone! I’d suggest maybe talking to people who have similar thoughts and see what they may do to reassure themselves that they’re trans! 

Lastly, I wanna add that no matter if that’s the reason or not, the fact that you do feel like a boy right now is what’s important. If you do come to the conclusion that you aren’t trans, that’s fine! But for now you do feel like a boy, and as I said, that’s all that really matters!
Do you see yourself being a women in ten years? Do you want everyone to call you she? If the answer is no to those questions then you’re probably trans but just to solidify it.
 Do you want to be your brother or be his brother?
Your therapist is a human piece of shit garbage asshole. You do not need dysphoria to be trans and anyone who thinks that is scientiffically wrong. And also a transphobe. If you think you are trans. You are trans. That's not something anyone but you can decide. Even if they are a therapist. Therapy that makes you more insecure is not therapy. That's bullshit. Sorry for the anger but I genuinenly hate people like that. It just makes you feel like shit. And that's no good.
Ok I can’t tell a lot about trans stuff because I’m still figuring it out myself but one thing I can say is your feelings are NEVER invalid and if you ever need someone to talk to and don’t have anyone close to you to do so (and this goes for anyone) reach out to me
Ignore the therapist. Find a new one.

Only 1 thing determines if you are trans: Do you want to be a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth?

If yes, you are trans. Doesn't matter what else is going on socially or in family dynamics. If you answer yes, you're trans.
If you have no dysphoria of course you’re ‘coping’ with something. You even said it yourself, you thrived off the verbal attention. There isn’t anything wrong with experimenting with your identity or seeking validation.

If you were happy, then be happy. If you are trans or not boils down to what you are happy doing. Your therapists sounds kinda transphobic tbh bc she straight up said that you’re not trans. Being trans isn’t something you can tell by looking at someone or even licensing to someone’s whole life story, it’s something only you can figure out if you are or not, if you were happy be happy.
Your psychologist is full of shit, plain and simple. It honestly almost sounds like a retread of old Freudian bullshit - fucking penis envy, for gods' sakes.

You don't want to be a boy because you're jealous of *anyone*. You want to be a boy because you ARE a boy. Dysphoria is complicated and can be hard to unravel when you've been dealing with it for so long it's become background noise that you've learned to automatically filter out. Plus gender is a complicated fuck period. Lack of body dysphoria(or inability to identify such) isn't particularly meaningful.

^((Also ""sad from being misgendered"" is a type of dysphoria, even if it's not body dysphoria.))

That ""thrived on the verbal validation of others"" thing though? That's called gender *euphoria*, the opposite of dysphoria, and it's a pretty good indicator that you are in fact trans.
what kind of freudian bullshit is that psychiatrist on?? drop that bitch as soon as you can. what shes doing is borderline conversion therapy and if you let that go on for a longer period of time you will most certainly get some scars.

and to answer your primary question, if you were happy as a transman and felt good about being reffered as a man then you are a man. not everyone feels dysphoria the same, i myself hardly feel it sometimes but someone else might feel it in a much stronger fashion. what you're experiancing is a light version of imposter thoughts, you know the ""oh i just like x because x im not trans lol"" most trans people have had them a few times in their lifetime. i've had them like twice but thats about it

edit: side note as well, a one year old does not get the thought

""oh my brother gets more love and attention than me, i should be a boy so i can get more love and attention as well""

that just does not happen. and while im not incredibly well versed in childrens psychology i am well versed in adult psychology. (been having classes for 3 years and still going) and something i do about childrens psyche is that thoughts like that are not only rare but also borderline impossible, a child would think

""why is my brother getting more love than me? did i do something wrong?""

then from that you'd be feeling guilt instead of gender insecurity like tf is that psychiatrist on?? im legit fumin babe oh my god

edit2: and now that im thinking about it even more like what the fuck??.

im guessing you're over the age of 15? making you an adult in terms of psychology, so why the fuck is you ADULT PSYCHIATRIST making statements about a CHILDS psyche. oh. my. god. this is so fucked what the hell??? im so sorry you had to go through this absolute dogshit behaviour from a psychiatrist.
That's not a therapist. I don't know what the fuck is up with therapists on the topic of genders, but what they said it's bullshit. If you feel like a trans man, you are a trans man. No changing that
Nothing wrong with being a boy with boobs, and also if that were the reason you would have wanted to be a boy at the time. Like, my kid wants to be a baby because their sibling just got born. Perfectly reasonable. If they come to me in nine years and tell me they want to be a baby, I’m pretty sure the cause would be something else. 

But also, even if that were truly a reason, so what? Wouldn’t make you any less a boy now.
I'll easily put a bet that your therapist is some kind of religious nut too. That is a ""conversion therapy"" response. If it was a sister it would have been - ""You want to be a boy because you were jealous of your sister and therefore resent women as a whole"". If you parents were divorced and you lived with your Dad it would have been because you have had a male upbringing. If you lived with your mum it would have been because you didn't have a male figure and looked to fill that role. It's ridiculous and stupid. Your therapist/psychologist is shit at their job. Tell them to get stuffed and find a better one.
I have found these links quite useful in the past, I hope you do as well.

That therapist is a piece of shit. Fire her as your doctor if you are able and find someone competent who doesn’t have hate in their heart.
Therapist here—

This person is not trans informed, is not sex positive, and doesn’t seem like they are trained in sex therapy.

Most people don’t realize that most therapists receive almost no training in sex therapy or LGBTQ+ issues.

You need a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, and hopefully someone who is a certified sex therapist.

Ask your therapist for a referral to a LGBTQ+ therapist and one who is preferably sex therapist certified. She is out of her depths and needed to refer you because clearly she is not trained.

Or, you can look for one yourself! There are many out there! You can even go directly to the AASECT website (certified sex therapist website), they have a list of providers who are certified. 

Source: I am a therapist and specialize in sex therapy. Literally the first thing they teach us in sex therapy certification is that it is a myth that trauma is related to LGBTQ+ status. Just because trauma and queerness are present doesn’t mean they are the cause of each other.
That’s bad therapy my dude. Therapist arnt supposed to just mike drop things like that even if they are true. So I wouldn’t take what she is saying as super credible.
Not every trans person has dysphoria! You’re valid
Bad therapist, find a person who has experience or specializes in gender identity therapy. It's not about finding the people who will say what you want to hear. Being told what they told you is bullshit. This therapist trying to lead you into thinking that aligns with their views not yours. Therapist should never try to lead a client like this. 

My therapist never told me I was as transgender or what my identity was or why I felt the way I did. What they did was help me unpack and unclog the bullshit layers of societies expectations, fears of retaliation and rejection, and self loathing from internalize homo/transphobia until I was finally able to say with confidence who I was. They never told me I was right or wrong, they never tried to justify why I felt this way only to help me understand what I was feeling.

Get a better therapist, they are human and can't be expected to know everything. Avoid therapist who aren't specialized or focused. There are no Masters of All.
That sounds like you need a new therapist. Look for specifically trans-friendly therapists.
1. As a healthcare professional, I’m going to use the magic words…”second opinion!”

2. Unless you’ve been living in some PollyAnna world that is only inhabited by nyan cats spreading rainbows across the sky… you know what kind of attention we are most likely to get…. does the psychologist think something happened to you that was so bad that you would want the often negative attention of strangers?

3. Don’t know your grandmother. But in my family one of my afab and cis cousins was primarily raised by our grandmother. You know what? She is the one enjoying her life. Literally the happiest of all of us. She likely got more attention from grandma than we did from out parents.

4. Like physicians, and nurses, mental health professionals have specialties. This one sounds like she stuck back in DSM-3 where being trans was considered mental illness. If she claims to be a gender expert, she’s not a very good one. I would seek out a mental health professional who actually specializes in gender issues. I have one who specializes in substance abuse, gender and trauma. I don’t need the first but the second and third are fantastic for me. She helped me to make up my own mind, and then gave me her opinion, which was to validate what I decided.
Sounds like you need a new therapist ASAP. Try to find one who is allied with the trans community!
I would already be looking for another therapist, that was dismissive and unprofessional on their part.
Wow, that’s quite the leap your therapist is making. If they seriously thought you experienced some kind of unprocessed trauma and wanted to help you work through that then there are constructive ways of doing that without adding another crisis on top of whatever else you’re dealing with. 

This aside, 1) I don’t think that there’s medical consensus on the idea that being trans is necessarily a trauma response. 2) Say it is some kind of coping mechanism, does that fundamentally change things? People are trans for all kinds of reasons, some social, some physical, some political, etc. Why would the root of **your** transness invalidated that identity? Why should it make you “not really trans” when you experience similar joys and pains to countless other trans people?  3) What is her goal in trying to identify why you are trans, and why is she telling you her theory? The only thing I can think of is that she’s trying to “cure” your transness, and that’s incredibly dangerous. From here I’d imagine she is going to try to logic you out of being trans and use her position of authority and superior knowledge in the field of psychology to convince you that you’re wrong about what you know about yourself. 

This isn’t worth the headache or the heartache. I’d say to just get another therapist.
shit therapist shouldn’t have a license
Well its possible its true i would get a 2nd opinion and also discuss your ""trans confusion"" with  specialized therapist. More importantly don't stress yourself over this people are complex and trauma makes things worse and no one is even near perfect so don't beat yourself up trying to please others
Yeahh, you should get a new therapist
Transphobic therapist
I and nobody, but You can't answer if You are trans or not. Ask Yourself if You feel comfortable with Your gender, or not. No therapist can answer that for You.
I think the therapist You're seeing has some... Weird idea that people become trans, because of trauma, or something. But it's a guess, because statement like that is... Well... Weird at least. But idk think about it. Remember that therapist doesn't know You better than You know Yourself. And they might point You to directions, but ultimately it's You who's got to help Yourself.
That was completely inappropriate of your practitioner to say. Dump them, and find someone new who doesn't assume and jump to erroneous conclusions.
Yeah no your psychologist is full of shit. What they're saying sounds somewhat Freudian and Freud was full of shit too. You don't have to have gender dysphoria to be trans, you only have to have gender euphoria when identifying as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth. If being a man gives you euphoria, congrats, you're trans!
Don’t search for gender Dysphoria  search for what makes you (gender) euphoric, because we often try to tell ourself nah thats not Dysphoria but it is. By finding stuff that make you euphoric, you get a more positive viewpoint of yourself 😇
never take the advice about who you are from anyone but yourself, you may not be trans one day and that's okay but if you right now think you are, and feel more comfortable being so then you are valid and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
If the thought of you being not trans makes you anxious, you're trans.
Many cis people have a thought, ""what if im trans?"" But if the thought of you maybe not being trans makes you anxious, you're probably trans.
Btw, it seems like you're mainly experiencing social dysphoria, which is valid. I mainly experience one aspect of body dysphoria which is my chest. Although, I've had an odd gender experience since I have PCOS. When I began to get on birth control to average out my hormones, I began experiencing dysphoria. Apologies for talking about my experiences a bit.


Which makes you most comfortable, most euphoric? Being called a guy, a girl, or a they?
My old therapist tried to say the same thing, but tried saying that since I have ptsd from stuff my cousin and a pedo did that I was probably just using being a boy as a way to keep myself feeling safe. My new therapist though has been very clear that that isn’t a cause of feeling like the opposite gender at all.
Usually, if you're worried that much about faking, you're not faking. You know better than anyone else and even if it can be hard knowing, you're the only one able to tell who you are.
Your therapist either is fake or should be immediately relieved of their therapists’ license, and quite possibly jailed.  You know yourself better than your therapist does, and therapists are literally trained to let you figure everything out on your own with a bit of professional assistance here and there, not to figure it out for you.
A therapist should never tell you how you feel.

Drop them and report them
even if that is the reason, who cares?

If you are happier to identify as a boy, then you are a trans man. no matter how it came to be.

Its not like that's how it works anyway, people don't change their identity over attention. you get far more hate and difficulty living as a openly trans person than you would being cisgender. If you understand that then you aren't faking it.

This is a bigoted psychologist (weather subconsciously or as a conscious decision) trying to invalidate your gender identity. Gender identity is complex and strange and nobody quite knows how it happens or ""how it works"" you cant explain it away with jealousy.
Hot take: so fucking what? I'm gay because my mom didn't love me enough, I'm trans because I was raised religious and women were viewed as lesser. We are all products of our environment, and this cishet bullshit concept that being ""made gay"" is invalid while they simultaneously have conversion camps that try to ""make people straight"" the *exact same way* is disingenuous horseshit. Understanding why you are the way you are doesn't *change* the way you are, nor make it any more or less valid.
This is exactly why you only talk to a therapist that’s a gender identity specialist about gender identity issues. If they don’t, they have absolutely zero credentials to say anything.

What you’re therapist SHOULD have said was they aren’t qualified to give you guidance on this particular topic and looked into places that can.
You know yourself better than anybody! You just have to ponder on yourself and keep like minded people near you! Don’t let someone who went to school a couple of years throw your whole being off. Keep grounded! If you feel your HAPPIER as a trans man, that’s all that matters! We only have one life! Do what feels right for you! She obviously picked at some old wounds for you to be doubtful but don’t worry and continue to live as your authentic self! I too have had family issues and it really hurts. I understand in my own way how that feels. I have half sisters. They got all the attention as well. That doesn’t change who I am though. It does however make me a loving mother to my two girls. Keep your head high. Keep doing you dude!
You don’t need body dysphoria to be trans I’d seek a psychiatrist that specializes with gender identity !
The human brain is dumb... it only wants what it can't have because it's greedy.  

If you want to be transgender, then it tells you otherwise because one is always contradicting the other.  

Your feelings and your brain hate each and life is a constant, never-ending war of unsatisfaction.
That that's the first thing she said after hearing about one experience... That's not therapy, that's conversion, and you need to get the hell out of there. I'm really sorry this happened to you, I understand it must be incredibly confusing. Trauma can absolutely cause gender fuckery, but it's not at all the first go-to explanation for feelings like yours and it's definitely not something a therapist should be looking for (""how can I disprove this person is trans?"")
“If people misgender me, I get sad.” That’s dysphoria.
Your psychologist is full of it.
1. your therapist is a bitch 
2. not getting dysphoria doesn’t make you any less trans. i don’t get dysphoric about my genitalia, but that doesn’t make me any less trans
Honestly, who fucking cares if you are “really” trans, or if childhood trauma “made you” trans, both of which are bullshit— but even if they were true, if being a man makes you *truly* happier. That being a man feels better than being a woman ever did, and it is who you want to be, then you are a man.
Is sad so many psichologists are really bad professionals, I had problems with one of them because she called that I'm a trans woman just by hating men in general, so in her theory I hate men and of course can't be one. (I'm married with a cisgender man and very happy with him)
One of my favorite youtubers likes to say: if you think you‘re faking it, there‘s a pretty good chance you‘re not :)
Having dysphoria doesn’t equate to being trans. It‘s also not a cis thing to like being called the opposite gender, just saying…
What if a friend of yours told you a story like that? How would you react? Would you judge them and their feelings? 

PS: I‘m in a similar situation (little to no body dysphoria, pretty pronounced social dysphoria) and you really help me work through this, thank you!
Yea dude that's kinda dumb. I'm not a therapist or phycologist but I have been around plenty of people who want attention they lacked and they usually just fallow what they're told cause they seek approval and even if that therapist was somehow in your head knowing everything going on in there it's not ok to just tell someone oh yeah the way you live is invalid cause blah blah blah. I had it happen with my parents. I don't get why but it feels as if they just don't want you to feel comfortable. And on top of all of that not every trans person experiences the same thing this includes body dysphoria. Some people just get the euphoria side of it and that doesn't make them any less of themselves so for your therapist to be making such bold claims without knowing much on the subject is pretty unprofessional (I know it's sorta hypocritical to say this while not having official knowledge of psychology but I'm just saying that is that if you're making someone mentally battle themselves instead of helping that not happen you're not doing your job right so yea that therapist may be bias against you or she just doesn't understand trans people that well) hope that you have o good rest of your day bro.
If it's okay with you, I would really like to share this with my therapist and get their perspective on it. Bc this is bullshit and you need some validation.

To be perfectly clear, if you feel more comfortable as a male then that's what you are, no one else has any say in the matter.
Nah this is a homophobic trying to talk you out of it
Report this therapist, they are completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
That “therapist” is total garbage. You don’t need to have body dysphoria to be trans! I once heard someone describe it as, if you somewhat tolerate vanilla ice cream, but love chocolate ice cream and feel super happy when you eat it, why would you stay with vanilla? No one can tell you you’re trans except for yourself!
Phsycologists r assholes in my experience, always enjoyed my sessions with therapists over ones with psychologists
A cis person wouldn't worry about being trans or not
Being trans isnt about hating what you were born with, it's about building yourself into something you love. Whether you get dysphoria or not doesnt determine your transness- I'm willing to bet you're exactly like me (and many, many other trans people) whose experiences are more shaped by gender euphoria (joy at your gender) rather than dysphoria.

I think many people, both within and outside of the trans community, focus too much on the pain of dysphoria rather than acknowledging the beautiful joy of euphoria and shaping your life and growing in a way you control. 

The way people outright ignore gender euphoria in many places sets a warped perspective towards trans people and how we 'should' experience our lives and connection to gender rather than seeing the true rainbow of diversity that all communities contain, which, sadly, tends to steer our siblings who don't fit into the mold of 'dysphoric trans person' away from the community.

I hope you find a better therapist my dude, and I hope you grow more assured in your own identity* as you march on into the future. (*whatever it may turn out to be and however many times it may change and adjust, cause life and labels really do like to play around, lol)
No cis person has those thoughts 😃
Yeah that's dumb. And, really, the concept of whether you're ""really trans"" or not is kinda silly too - all that matters in the end is that you feel happier as a man, and you're not hurting anyone by that. Why the feelings exist is pretty much irrelevant, if you feel them they're there and they're real and that's that
What the fuckl?!?!?!? 

Im absolutely appalled 

dump them
Oh, hell no. I don’t have dysphoria, only a little before I started T, now I’m fine. I don’t experience severe dysphoria my ex has. Don’t doubt yourself. You know yourself better than anyone in the entire world does, even if you’re still navigating. That psychologist doesn’t know shit. 

My mom did the same thing; she listed things out, and I doubted myself, but I was upset, so I wasn’t thinking straight, and later my mind became clear. I KNOW I’m a male, and my mom is anti-LGBTQ+. She’s religious.
your psychologist needs to have their license revoked.
Get a new therapist ASAP!! Look for one that specializes in trans issues.  They seem to be the most helpful in the subject of gender.  My therapist said that feeling of ""what if I'm not or feeling like I might regret it is normal.  She's helped me understand that that is my anxiety speaking and helped me realize that I've had suppressed memories of me trying to express my true gender
Yeah, that therapist is wrong. Social dysphoria is just as valid as body dysphoria (in addition to the fact you don’t need dysphoria to be trans) I’d say find a different therapist.
Nah you're trans  what a shitty psychologist
OP you need a new therapist that's all I have to say
I would counter with your psychiatrist. If you give up then they are right. They are just summarizing what you said. It’s open for debate if you like, or do you just wanna leave it at that? Don’t allow the medical fearmongering on Reddit lead you astray. Remember this is your business. If you are transgender and looking for a reason why then there is your answer. However, if you are trying to resolve your dysphoria there is your answer. Just bc you have gender dysphoria doesn’t mean you are transgender. So the opposite is true, as well. This is what medicine is good at. Weeding out your internet dives and misconceived notions you’ve gathered from the internet. As someone who has to drop their knowledge at the door I have trained myself to be a patient when I’m a physician, as well. Doctors make the worse patients so when you are diagnosing yourself physicians see that, and go with that. Leading you to get to your own answers. Take each session with a grain a salt bc it won’t be fixed in one session unless you want it to.
You should report this therapist for completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
Let's put aside the fact that no one can tell you if you're trans or not, and \*let's say\* that it would be possible to feel that way bc of trauma. Even if we do that ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" is the worst, weakest and the most naïve take I could ever imagine.

This is actually one of the qualms I had with Jules' special episode on euphoria, where she's in therapy. At one point the therapist just kinda makes a connection and interrupts Jules instead of just letting her talk. Like childhood experiences are important, but I think even still a lot of Freudian-esque bullshit makes its way into media representations of therapy and even some actual therapy, trying to make some sort of profound connection instead of actually trying to address the issue.
This resonates a lot with me. I've started to think of my journey as the Marie Kondo Trans Experience. You basically start out by accepting ""these things spark joy, I will do them. These other things do not spark joy, and I want them to go away."" Eventually I cleanly fit into a label, but I didn't have that clarity until I started living the parts I knew. My identity keeps getting clearer over time as I'm on HRT and presenting female, and I'm finally starting to have a picture of the future in my head that I'm actually looking forward to.
Thank you so much. This, and all the other comments, really means a lot to me.
Absolutely agree. My 3 year old nephew loves Disney/cartoons and make believe. Sometimes he changes his name to Olaf or Mario and insists everyone call him this, other times he has been Anna, Elsa, Raya and insists on those names. We let him be whatever name is flavor of the day.
That's the catch, though. At the time, I was a little over 1 year old, so I don't remember it at all. 

As for my feelings, I've started feeling 'different' when I was around 12. I think you see my problem now.
Gender euphoria really is like putting on glasses for the first time. Like ""holy shit normal people just... feel comfortable sometimes? In their own bodies?""
>But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn’t realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn’t know that you’re born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity

Sure, this is the more charitable take. But even if this is what’s going on (which is a pretty big if) the therapist has shown that they are not qualified to help OP. Look at how much her saying this fucked with the poor dude. He went from happy and confident to feeling invalidated because an authority figure told him is entire identity is, essentially, made up. That’s wildly, immorally irresponsible even if it was true, and she’s also very obviously shooting from the hip with pseudoscientific bullcrap.

It’s easy to make trans people doubt themselves - in the world we grew up in, we’re constantly erased, disrespected, questioned, gatekept and belittled.

The bottom line is that this person should not be a therapist, period. They are not qualified. OP, please don’t let this clown plant doubts in your mind. You are valid. ❤️
It's bad therapy because there's no evidence for such a thing. The whole ""looking for attention"" is transphobic propaganda. How many trans people have *actually* just been looking for attention and not really been trans?
If you wanna add it to your autocorrect, the spelling is ""dysphoria."" It's the opposite of euphoria, which should be a word most autocorrects will get right.
Please do not restrict enbies to “in the middle” or “in between” the genders accepted by the binary gender system. Yes, some non-binary peoples identities do fall into that space but there’s so much more than simply being the purple to men and women’s pink and blue. We are all the colours on the colour spectrum apart from pink and blue, from purple to green to yellow to periwinkle to ultraviolet and infrared. 

I would like to know where you think that quack was coming from when you say their words shouldn’t be discredited. How does it work for a one year old to go through something that made them want to change their gender for attention eleven years later? If you’ve been having to put up with a therapist who pulls shit like this on you and you’re just gaslighted, please know that you deserve better than a therapist talking to you like this.
This OP. It sucks to start again but I think you should browse for a new therapist and report this one for invalidating you. Im in college and gender identity is no longer a question of your “beliefs” or “politics” or “religion” . Gender  identity is becoming a part of human biology and development classes, inclusivity studies are mandatory if you want your papers in my country as a clinical psychologist. Sounds like this therapist needs to update their education.
Yeah sometimes they forget that its an individual and the book doesnt always apply 100%
I had one therapist who tried to make conclusions from just a fraction of informations and i knew that i had to change the therapist cuz their opinions and theories just didnt fit me at all and I knew they didnt even hear the full “story” of me (this wasnt gender related but still similar situation)
Exactly how it feels to me too, well said
So she says you were envious without any proof or indication thereof?
Come on, you were 1 year. You probably didn‘t even compute what happened to you, let alone have the logical capacity to conclude „Oh it‘s because of my brother!“.  

Seems a little farfetched imho.
Lol, my euphoria ranges from a shot of happiness whenever I get a haircut or addressed as my gender to a unicorn blasting rainbows out of its ass at mach 10 to fly over the moon, wagging its tail like a puppy.

I swear I'm an adult- but sometimes wearing clothes I like brings out my inner labrador, lol.
The ""looking for attention"" idea is also inherently backwards. Do those people really think ANY of us enjoy the immense and horrible backlash we get for being trans? Is that enjoyable and worth seeking if it's not necessary? If I am looking for attention, I tell jokes or climb on a table and dance. I don't put a bullseye on my back so people can trample me.

The idea also thoroughly erases the existence of stealth trans people. How would we get attention from being trans if we're stealth? It makes no fucking sense.

All we want is to be happy as our authentic selves. Fuck this tyranny.

One year olds surely do not even have a concept of gender, let alone what a brother is or jealousy.
OP said they were a happy trans man until a quack said something stupid, you think that’s questioning? Since you’re defending the stupid that was said by the therapist then explain the mechanics of how what happened to him at a year old made him want to change gender for attention eleven years later. If it “resonates” so well with you that you think that it even needs consideration then please explain why everyone with a sibling doesn’t become trans to their sibling’s assigned gender? 

It’s not about resonating or not resonating. It’s about a therapist saying something incredibly stupid and abusive.
Now you’re a psychic on top of it? Nah, I’m done here, since you seem to know everything but won’t answer as to why you know these things this isn’t a productive conversation."	s4gmja	trans	1079	0.98	2022-01-15 09:27:19
Are there requirements for being trans?	"I feel comfortable in my AGAB but I still like a lot of aspects of being seen as a woman (I wish I was a cis woman, I like she/her pronouns, feminine compliments) . I don't think I'll transition in the near future as its safer for me but I also don't feel the need to do so, I'm fine with being seen as a man by people who aren't close to me. I'm starting to see myself as a woman but and for close friends to treat me that way but I don't plan on more transitions than that. Would it be valid to say I'm trans even though I dont resemble a woman, don't have dysphoria and dont have a desire to present as the opposite gender?

Edit: Theres already opposing ideas and I don't know whats the consensus from the community

Edit2: So after a lot of replies and info which I'll research into I've been cleared up on lots of stuff, I'll do an update post once I've managed to clear my head and figure what I'm comfortable with. Thank you to everyone who replied and is continuing to help me figure myself out, you've been some of the most understanding ppl and I love ya'll 💖💖💖"	"I'm surprised no one has linked it yet, but [the gender dysphoria bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) is a bit of a long read but a great guide for anyone questioning. You should give it a look.
>(I wish I was a cis woman, I like she/her pronouns, feminine compliments)

Sounds to me like you're not so much comfortable in your AGAB then. Are you sure you're not confusing ""comfortable"" and ""able to tolerate""?
idrntifying as a gender other than ur assigned one st birth. the only requirement
You can totally be a valid trans person without dysphoria. However, I thought I didn’t have dysphoria but when I realized I wasn’t cis I realized more and more feelings that I had all along were actually mild dysphoria. That’s just my experience tho.
Slightly different but sometimes I identify as a trans woman even though I wouldn’t say that’s what I associate with the most. I identify as Trans femme. I think we get stuck in this binary way of thinking we don’t realize gender is a spectrum. I’m not saying you’re not a woman but the definition of being a woman is changing. Not just because of trans folx but also cis women. Womanhood isn’t about performing femininity anymore. People chose to preform femininity rather than being forced too. At the end of the day these are all just labels to better categorize and segregate us so do whatever the hell you want! Sending love ❤️.-M
There's no requirement love, you just gotta be a gender different from the one assigned at birth, and that doesn't have to be a binary gender! I'm agender and I use he/him and tsee/tsim, no one can tell wtf I am but I'm still trans. Embrace it and its OK to be questioning ^^
There is no quota of suffering you have to meet to validate being trans. The only 'requirement' of being trans is not identifying as your gender assigned at birth, being trans does not inherently include hating yourself so badly you don't have a choice. For most people it just means you'd be happier as another gender, myself included. 

Could I live as a male? Yes. Do I want to? No. Would I be happier as a woman? Yes. 

This line of logic is probably the closest you'll get to a requirement for being trans.
Tbh there is no community consensus, and likely never will be. Being trans or trans-adjacent is a natural part of humanity, and there are endless ways of explaining the feelings we have, where they come from, what they mean, and how to act in response.

Because of that, any feelings you have are valid by nature. You are what you are, and you aren’t hurting anybody by existing.
the only requirement is to be trans is to identity as a gender other than your agab. 

you don’t need dysphoria to be trans. gender dysphoria is common in trans people, but not everyone has it. people who say otherwise are transmedicalist and truscum. they think that to be trans you have to have surgery and hormones and MUST feel dysphoria. 

unlike what truscum say, having dysphoria wasn’t what made me realize i’m trans. i’ve had gender dysphoria since my teen years but i just thought i had body image issues or some kind of internalized misogyny. it wasn’t until i got called sir the first time, got called a son, was spoken to like a teen boy all because of my masculine appearance that i realized what was wrong. it’s the gender euphoria that’s a part of every trans person’s experience.

while being trans certainly isn’t easy at times, truscum often focus on the negative parts of being trans. i’m not discounting the negative parts as i’ve experienced crippling dysphoria and transphobia from my community. but being trans is about being yourself and being your authentic self however you define that

no one can define who you are but you. and no matter what you define yourself as you’re valid <3 give yourself time to be and you’ll know what’s right. play around with gender expressions and names and pronouns to find what fits best. most importantly: don’t listen to gatekeepers who limit who you are. because as long as you’re safe and happy with who you are, that’s what matters in life :)
first off i wanna say that there isn't a 'requirement' to being trans and any trans person who says that has some internalized shit they need to deal with. second off, i've seen a lot of people talking about dysphoria and stuff and i wanted to add my own,,, opinion? interpretation? idk what to call it, but yeah! gender dysphoria shows up in a lot of ways, including gender euphoria. someone who feel anxiety ridden dysphoria is just as valid as someone who feels euphoria from being called by different pronouns. i had a friend who didnt realize they were non-binary until they were called by 'they/them' pronouns before instead of their assumed gendered pronouns. that is just a valid as me, who feels a lot of painful dysphoria. something thats also important to mention is that dysphoria isnt binary. sometimes you just feel like something is off or a different thing makes you feel better and that doesnt fit into 'oh this is because its feminine' or vice versa and thats okay! your gender is your own. its a unique experience for yourself and its important to love and support yourself through this journey bc its a journey of self discovery and that should be exciting and fun! it can be hard to ponder yourself sometimes, but it can also be very freeing. no matter the conclusion you come to in the end, just know that it's okay and it's valid. you're valid. i hope this helps you or anyone else who comes across this! 💕
Ppl saying dysphoria is necessary are being harmful
a bachelor's degree and 3 years of experience in a related field.
If you really want to dig into this subject, I highly suggest you stop listening to the consensus (or lack thereof) of a bunch of people online who all have vastly different experiences, and instead go read ""Whipping Girl"" by Julia Serano. Get therapy with a gender therapist. There are opposing viewpoints because being trans is kind of a hot button issue, and it's only recently that anyone has bothered to do research on the subject. Research is still woefully inadequate and thus, the real answer is that being trans is just something you identify as. That's it. 

Trans-medicalists will say you need to get diagnosed with gender dysphoria to be trans, but you know how they diagnose you? By you saying you have gender dysphoria lol. There's no hard test that ""proves"" it, just your own sense of who you are. I'm happy to talk in more detail if you want to reply here or DM me, just don't have time right this second.
No, the accumulation of combat points is purely coincidental.
Do and be as you feel. For it is your journey through your own life.
Why does it matter what the community thinks. It’s your life, if you don’t wanna transition, don’t transition, if you do then do it. Personally no amount of encouragement or discouragement will ever have any impact on my decision to transition. And in terms of calling yourself trans. Call yourself whatever you want, just don’t tell other people what they should call themselves. 

It boils down to a simple fact. Transitioning is a personal choice.
Adding my two cents- I didn't allow myself to identify as trans for most of my life despite a lot of thoughts about being different because I didn't hate how people see me. I still don't hate how people see me. I don't care if they think I'm my AGAB or not, I don't feel any dysphoria from pronouns or gendered language or items- Over time, I've become more and more uncomfortable with my own body however.

I really doubt I would ever change my legal name or request people use a specific pronoun for me, but I still know that my body and my mind are playing different songs. They just haven't clashed up until now.

&#x200B;

For the record, I always fall back on this. The trans in transgender *does not stand for transition*. It isn't about that- it's about a feeling inside you that doesn't quite match the feelings outside of you. Even if it's a comfortable mismatch- it's still a transgender identity. Anyone who says otherwise is very literally just gatekeeping. How can you really figure out what you want if you aren't allowed to explore at your own pace? 

&#x200B;

(also [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) made my eyes go big about some things I didn't realize)
As someone who has been in a position like this before, someone who, for various circumstances has not been able to come out, or has their own canon and concept of what being a woman is, honestly, I think one of the best things to remember is that believing is being. There is no hard stipulation or checklist for being trans. There is no concrete recipe. You don't need 3 cups of dysphoria, 1 table spoon of self doubt and a hearty affliction of spinny skirt (though for that last one, that may do it for some).  Being trans is more so about the euphoria experienced from being able to express and present exactly as you are or how you want to present to those around you. There is no shame in changing the presentation or aesthetic, or indeed highlighting the different aspects of identity you wish to present to each register. The experience for each trans person is unique, and anyone who may suggest that there is a rigid definition for what makes a trans person ""truly trans"" is being just about as oppressive as a bigot who denies transgenderism as a whole. 

The journey of the trans person is one of introspection and acceptance. Every path is different, and it is important to be patient with yourself and to remember that there is no hard rule as to what a trans woman, or any other identity for that matter should be. Just remember that in the case of the self-determination of identity, believing is being, and that if you believe yourself to be a specific identity and consistently identify it in a positive way, than that you already are. And you are valid.
1st requirement be trans
2nd idk have fun
no there are no requirements for being trans!! :(
Truly cis people don't sit and wonder if they're cis.
It sounds to me like youre either unsure, in the closet, or gender neutral
The only requirement is not identifying with your AGAB based on dysphoria, or, in other cases, euphoria. It’s also worth noting being trans doesn’t mean you can only be the opposite gender, you can be both or neither too, and everything in between.
Well, dysphoria is something that trans people have, but it's not a constant hatred of your body. It can be discomfort or even manifest in dissociation. If you dont feel fully connected to your body it could be dissociation, which can be caused by dysphoria. 
So you dont plan on transitioning, not because you cant, but because you dont want to? Perhaps that's something to think about, because if theres no real need to transition (socially or physically), and you feel %100 comfortable as a man, then dont rush into anything. Keep exploring. Maybe drag is something you'd be interested in, or just being gender nonconforming. No matter what you discover about yourself, it's still valid, but dont rush yourself or force any labels you're not completely comfortable with
There is only 1 requirement for being transgender. That one requirement is ti identify as a gender different than what you where assigned at birth
There isn't a requirement for being trans except being trans, as confusing and stupid as this sounds. If you feel you're not cis, congrats, you can be trans. setting a criteria to be trans is borderline or even blatant transmedicalism, in my experience
Being a gender you weren't assigned at birth
NO.

&#x200B;

The only requierment is that you, yourelf, figured out you are not the gender you were assigned at birth!
If you identify as something other than your assigned gender at birth, you *are* trans, that’s literally it, not dysphoria, I didn’t miss a “secret unspoken rule” there isn’t anything else to it, no matter what anyone says.
If you don't identify with your AGAB, congrats, you're trans.
For years I thought I didn’t have what I had been told was dysphoria. I was able to generally cope and told myself it wasn’t all bad being a man. It did eventually come to a critical point, but I could have understood sooner if I had gotten better explanations years ago. Looking back, I definitely had dysphoria, but didn’t recognize it for what it was. I had lived for a long time with that “pebble in my shoe” as others have said.

Now that I’ve been on the transition road for over a year, I would fight back intensely if someone told me I had to go back to living as a man.

Yes, you have to appeal to the International Council of Gender and after a lengthy process, they will decide on whether or not you are worthy enough to bear the title: ""trans"".
The Requirements for Being Trans:

1. Do you want to be a different gender identity than what you were assigned at birth?

If you answered yes to this question, you are trans. :)
I am a trans 🏳️‍⚧️ lesbian woman and it’s a different journey for all of us. The main thing is do what you need to survive and what is right for you. I think you will be fine and I’m happy 😊 4 u. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
This sounds pretty gender fluid to me.
Find the right path for you. It sounds like you just started or aren't too sure right now. Check everything out, do/use what makes you feel good, explore.

""Requirements to be trans"" are a very radical view point that will lead to a lot of heated emotions in this community.

Trans/transgender simply means you ""are not the gender that was assigned at birth"". I was born male and it was determined that I was a boy, growing towards manhood, at birth and before I could say how I felt. 

Now that I'm older, I do not agree; I am not cisgendered. I am trans.

If you were assigned at the birth the prescription that you are a boy, leading toward manhood, and you agree with that, you are cisgendered. If you do not agree, you are transgendered. 

As simple (and as confusing) as that 😛❤
If you ask me, if you feel/think your trans, then you can consider yourself trans.

Any ""requirements"" are for doctors to allow you to transition.

If you decide not to do any transitioning or anything, but still feel trans, you can be trans. I'm all about welcoming people and being inclusive. If you want to join the club, I'd welcome you.
Being trans just means you identify as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth. That is the only requirement. Because that's what being trans is, anything else is not fundamentally what being trans is, therefore you can be trans without it.

If you're worried about whether you need dysphoria, here's an analogy.

Let's say you want to move house. You don't particularly hate your current house, but you've seen other houses in the area and you know you'd be happier in another house. So you start looking for houses, going through your things, everything you need to do to move.  
Then all of a sudden someone comes in like 'woahwoahwoah you DON'T HATE your current house?? You need to utterly hate your house in order to move!!!'

Sound ridiculous right? So why should the same apply to gender? If you'd rather be a woman than a man, that's all the reason you need. 

If you feel like you're trans, you're trans. Welcome to the club! :D
Are you cis? No? Then you're trans bam
OMG I feel you so much rn. I am lying awake with a sudden indentity crisis that somehow crawled towards me for some time now and what you describe is exactly what I feel.

Just with AGAB female but I am a roleplayer and cosplayer who always ever feels comfortable in male roles and even though I do not feel dysphoria and am fine with being called she/her, especially at work (don't know, somehow I am a little bit proud of having made career even with all the men I had to work with belitteling and even sexually harrassing me) it gives me such a high when someone calls me bro, dude or speaks of me using he/him.

So thank you so much for your post and the possibility for me to hitchhike it for the replies you got.

Unfortunately I am no help to you at all as I am a mess right now questioning all my past life choices. All I can say: Exact same situation here so it is apaprently not a singular occurence.
❤
I'm kinda disappointed in people to make you think there's requirements to be who you wanna be, no there isn't. Full send whatever or whoever you wanna be!
Enjoy your freedom while you can. You're trans and it will get worse. You will know when it's time. Good journey.
This will get downvoted by tucutes but whatever: you feel comfortable in your agab and don’t have dysphoria? And have no desire to present as the opposite gender? That’s the opposite of being trans 😅 you don’t have to completely hate yourself to transition of course not but transition isn’t a fun quirky trend it’s a medical condition and it’s not pleasant. I think people confuse gender identify with gender expression far too easily.
It's absolutely valid to be comfortable in your AGAB and not wish to transition. The only thing you need to be trans is to be happy when you're perceived/called/talked about as another gender. For a very long time (and a time that I could have used to actually get somewhere transitioning) I brought into the propaganda that truscum spout, that you can't be trans unless you hate yourself. You can't be trans if you don't want to transition. You can't be trans if you don't experience both top and bottom dysphoria. And it's it's such a harmful thing because you are preventing someone from finding happiness by gatekeeping how miserable you have to be to get that happiness. 

&#x200B;

Fuck truscum and trumeds. I know I would be happier today if I could have started transitioning when I had a support network. I don't regret my life as the way it is. I'm married to a wonderful person and have an amazing child, but it could have been so different if I wasn't convinced by them that being trans is about suffering all the time and wanting to kill yourself.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant. I know the community is divided about this.

being trans
Euphoria is the most common indicator, even if you're okay with being your agab if you'd be happier as another gender you're trans
No.
DYSPHORIA
If you don't want people to think of you unfavorably don't display fatherless child behavior
[removed]
There is no consensus, follow ur heart and fuck the gatekeepers. Just live true to urself.
You do you, whatever you feel comfortable presenting as and doing is valid as ling as it’s not hurting anyone or yourself.
Do what makes you happy
Be who you are
I was the same way. I went from being a dude, to a he/they femboy, to a straight up enby, to full on Trans. Although I currently use she/they pronouns, I'm way happier this way. What Im trying to say is it's a journey! Figure out what feels comfortable and go from there!
You very well could be gender non conforming or something
no requirements, if your gender isn't the one you're assigned at birth, and you're comfortable identifying as trans, then you're trans.
Requirements: having a gender identity different to that which you were assigned at birth

Are you trans?: that's up to you really, nobody else can tell you if you are or not, but we can give you some help

Try having a read through [the dysphoria bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb) while I know you said you haven't experienced dysphoria, it may be that you have, but didn't recognise it as dysphoria for whatever reason, remember that it isn't a checklist to see if you're trans, you can still be trans without dysphoria, it's mostly just a resource to see if you have dysphoria and if so, what typed

Another good test is one called ""the button"", if you had a button in front of you that could instantly turn you into a girl with no reprocussions, would you press it?

Cis people tend to answer no, whereas someone who is trans may answer yes, or give a complicated answer

Do also try to note that gender is a spectrum, you don't have to be specifically male or female, you can be both, neither, somewhere in between, fluctuating between different genders, fluctuating in intensity of a gender, we tend to use non-binary as an umbrella term for people who don't fit between the male/female binary

To find out who you are, you may have to look at numerous types of gender identities to find one that describes you best, I wish you luck in your journey of self-discovery
As long as you can pass the written exam, you should be alright.

(no)
....crack....


Nope.
I mean I hate my own reflection image and voice as well as most of my aspects but it isn't a requirement and if you don't have it that's amazing
There’s no requirements other than wanting to be a different gender. Do whatever makes you feel happy, and don’t worry about the people who say otherwise :)
The only requirement is that you don't feel that you are the gender you were assigned at birth. Transitioning is personal, some people don't do it for a multitude of reasons, depending on the person.
Whether or not you are trans or cis is a question only you can answer. If you're confused you should seek out a gender therapist.

Keep in mind that if you feel any distress over not being trans, then you probably are and vice versa.
Yes. You don't feel like the gender you were assigned at birth to be your true gender. That's it. That's the only requirement. There is no box to fit into. Even if it's sometimes I feel like my assigned gender but other times don't. Welcome to being trans. We accept you. Come get your card, refreshments are in the back.
sounds like you might fall under the nonbinary umbrella! looking into those identities would perhaps prove helpful :)
No, gender dysphoria and euphoria manifest in different ways for everyone. Even cisgender people can get dysphoria. This journey is all about finding out who you are and being comforted in being able to express and live that way. Everyone experiences this differently, every path is different, but the journey and that goal are usually similar.
Honestly, I think one of the most important things to remember is just be who you're most comfortable being. As long as that person isn't a serial killer ;P
Did you fill out the application?  Everyone gets approved.
I like to think of labels like ""trans"" ""bisexual"" ""lesbian"" ""gay"" ""gender-fluid"" etc. as tools. They help us explore our own psychology around our identity, and they help us to build communities of identity (i.e. the pride movement or this subreddit), but at the end of the day, they are just labels. They only hold the power we give them. If the trans label makes you happy, or helps you explore your identity more, or feels ""right"" to you, then go ahead and use it. There are no ""trans police"" that will show up and say you're doing it wrong or are acting fraudulently. (At least, no one Should be gatekeeping our community that hard.)

Given what you said about your experience around gender, I'd suggest that you could definitely see yourself as trans if that's how you want to identify: Definitionally, being trans means ""denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex"" (just one of many possible definitions of being trans). Some of your comments about the way you identify and who you would like to be seen as by your close friends/loved ones suggests to me that you could fit that definition . 

But even if you didn't fit this definition: Many of us in this sub and who use the label trans are still trying to figure out our gender identities. We're all at different parts of that journey. Mine feels stable now, but it has changed in the past, and it could change again in the future. My point is that defining yourself takes time - give yourself that time, be open to the idea of change in how you see yourself, and try not to stress about the labels too much along the way.

Hopefully some part of that helps!
Comfortable that’s kind of how I have felt ,I excelled at being a man matter of fact I have hidden so well behind the body I was born with that I convinced two beautiful people to fall in love with me only to destroy our relationships when She showed up! Twenty plus years apart. I actually thought after the first I could bury the witch in my soul ! Now don’t take witch wrong for I truly embrace the pagan priestess that I am ,unfortunately my second wife is not so understanding either but this time I can not go back! If you’re questioning you probably are. 
Most cis folk do not entertain thoughts of gender , just saying, they tend to just be.
I was always 'comfortable' in my AGAB, until I wasn't. Denial & repression became a habit. And then there came a time when I realized my life was at risk.  It was at risk due to the simple fact that I no longer cared to step out of the path of death. 

Two years and thousands of dollars in therapy later,  I am finally able to see the trauma of living that lie for what it is.  Having to pull over on the side of the freeway because I'm sobbing in the grief of what I'd lost isn't something I'd wish on anyone.
There's never any need to transition, socially, medically, or otherwise. I have decided to transition and my personal advice to anyone considering it is this: medical transition should be a last resort, life-saving intervention if a person is otherwise incapable of functioning or achieving happiness any other way. If you feel content enough in your gender presentation, then you shouldn't feel any pressure to make any moves that won't benefit your life and well-being. Transitioning comes with its own unique set of problems, hardships, burdens, and pain. It's not something that should be undertaken on a whim or mild preference. In my opinion.
You could be non binary
Yess you must climb to the highest room in the highest tower. You must slay the egg king and steal the dragons gold. 
After that you must cross the land of terfs. Swim the river of cistears. Once across you must burn the village of heritage foundation down. 
Only then will you be truly trans
Euphoria is a better qualification than dysphoria. Sounds like you have a leaning to Fem Euphoria. I was in the Same boat. Able to handle the Male Pronouns. But I kept venturing into the Feminine. After 40 years I decided I wanted to be happy and truly be me. I am sure that you will find your own path.
You always have to talk about Free Britney  Madonna and lady Gaga. Must use the word “ fierce” all day long.
I feel very similar. I'm comfortable in my AGAB, but also feel euphoric when addressed differently at times. (IE: being called sir instead of mam) I like he/him and they/them pronouns but am also fine with she/her. My boyfriend switches back and forth between she/her and they/them and I'm fine with either. I don't think I'll ever medically transition but I also don't think I would dislike it in anyway. How my body looks to other people doesn't change who I am on the inside and that's literally just a person. But I also don't feel like nonbionary fits me either. Maybe agender? But also genderfluid at the same time? Idk it's just all so Confusing sometimes.
""Are there requirements for being trans?""  
No. There never have been. Just do what feels right and makes you happy.
I mean dysphoria is the mental illness diagnosed to have the ability to transition so in America where I’m from it’s required to transition
In my opinion, as long as you don’t actively consume resources made for trans people, the label still wouldn’t fit but would be excusable at best. If you took a trans only scholarship but you don’t actually face any difficulties in your life with your identity then it’s a whole different story. Like, it could just be me being mean, but if you don’t actually feel transgender (by your own admission) but say you’re transgender because you like being feminine, you shouldn’t take advantages of resources for other trans people. This also spans into a bit of a larger problem, the classic “I like Barbie dolls, guess I’m trans now :/“. Being feminine while being amab doesn’t question your cisness at all, it just means you aren’t as thick skulled as other guys and you like what you like and are not ashamed of it. If you actually feel like you want to or need to fit the societal, emotional and sexual place of a woman, that’s being trans. I’d encourage you to get into drag if you’re into flashy shows and stuff like that, but I would personally ask you to not call yourself trans out of respect for people that actually suffer with dysphoria, discrimination and the harrowing experiences of trans life. If you really want to, fine, I can’t control you, just know that a lot of people would be upset at you for taking a trans only scholarship. I’ll just close off by affirming that this isn’t an attack on you, I just heavily dislike it when people put on makeup once, like it, and say their trans
All I can say is no matter which path you go down just be yourself as there is no one else out there whose better at being yourself than you 😉 that is the only requirement I can think of. So good luck and stay safe
Why can’t we all just be straight
As another comment said, it sounds as if you're less ""comfortable with your agab"" and more able to tolerate it, but yes you're still valid as a trans person with these feelings
I probably should have realized just how trans I was when I worried I would be doing a disservice to the trans community by calling my experience a trans one. I might have a teensy weensy self esteem issue as well.

In all seriousness though, that is just my experience. If this feels like the right place to be for you right now and continues to feel that way then that is awesome! And if one day it doesn't then that's OK too! The whole point of all this is to find a place that feels right for you.
agab = assigned guy at birth 
my brain: nah, assigned gay at birth 
why am I like dis ;-;
There's no requirement, there's no consensus, do whatever you want for yourself. You don't need the community's approval, and you're never gonna get it because we're not a hivemind.
The requirement is pretty simple.  ""Do you want to be a girl?""

It's one thing to want to be girly sometimes or to just be effeminate.  However if you want to live as a girl, you're more than likely trans.  No one can tell you you are or aren't either.

It sounds like you have a lot of stuff you're battling yourself.  I'd urge you to just think on it more.  It's okay to be scared to transition.  Dysphoria isn't an indicator either.
A bachelor level degree, protoflio of your work, two years experience and five references (at least three of the them should be former managers).
Yes there is many requirements for trans membership, there is a technical knowledge quiz and you must provide evidence on why you think you should be accepted 🙃
I think you can be a trans woman anyway. Or maybe non binary?
You don't seem pretty trans to me but in the end, it's your body and your life. I think you just need some time to figure things out, maybe watch YouTube videos of trans women where they talk about being trans or read articles about that topic
the only requirement for being trans is being trans
Is AGAB ""assigned Girl at birth"" ? Because my brain went straight to ""assigned Gay at birth"" 🤣🙈
The only requirement is you don't only allign with your agab 100% of the time. Its clear you meet this criteria, because even though youre okay with your agab, you also enjoy being seen as a woman. There's  the possibility that you are nonbinary, genderfluid, demigirl, bigender, etc.
You have to have a vibe
Yes the long read is not even that exhaustive, but it gives more insight on what it really means to be trans and i'll be honest, I read the whole thing and was still in denial so just be patient OP.
Yes yes YES! Reading through all that shattered my egg wide open and now I’m in the exact same position as OP. I’m not planning on transitioning but considering myself as a woman alone feels incredible, even if nobody else will be let in on it.
Never read it before, laid my eyes on it for a few pages, will definitely read it, thx :)
That was one of the most incredible reads of my life. Thank you for sharing. Truly.
This right here. A lot of people can't make that distinction. Dysphoria doesn't always manifest as an overwhelming hatred of your own body or a disabling sadness, it can be as small as a rock in your shoe. Does a small rock in your shoe feel like your foot is being stabbed? No. Do you like it being there? Also no.
Maybe, I mean how do you know the difference?
I started to reply something like this, but deleted it, because op didn't ask.  Now that we've eaten all her chips and we're looking in the pantry, I'll just say I used to make similar assertions about my comfort with agab versus transition, and I now wish (30 years later) someone I trust had prompted me to question them.
I’m definitely in the tolerating” camp. Burst of pain but I don’t jump out the nearest window
Fair point. I'm still unsure/ eggish, but I used to think I was okay with my assigned gender. 

I guess that's kind of true, but on the other had I haven't been comfortable with my Self since my earliest memory... it just didn't have a clear gender aspect to it. 

So maybe I thought I was okay, but I wasn't comfortable in my gender like cis people are. While this feeling isn't consciously about gender I guess it could subconsciously be me just tolerating the status quo (and be linked to more clearly gendered issues).
It's common when questioning gender but it's also common for non binary people. The only way to know is experimenting and see how OP feel about it in my opinion. OP look like a normal trans woman at the beginning of her journey but at this point it can be something else in my opinion. That's being said, I feel exactly like OP at the beginning, I even felt bad being gendered as a woman in the beginning. But after trying stuff and getting ride of internalised transphobia I started transitioning. In the end I discovered my true self thanks to euphoria and time, not dysphoria, dysphoria came after
Someone else commented dysphoria is necessary, so I'm unsure.
Yep, that was me. Had a major depressive episode when i was in 7th grade that i only realized was dysphoria kicking my ass (puberty :/) once i started my gender crisis like 2 years later
And it's for this reason that truscum/transmed ideas are particularly harmful. On top of the very clear harm that it does to trans people without dysphoria, GNC trans people, and non-binary people, it also serves to harm trans people like you who were only able to recognise their dysphoria after their trans awakening.

If someone knows nothing except for dysphoria, then to them that state is the baseline, their normal. It's very difficult to see what's wrong without gender euphoria or some other catalyst to put the baseline dysphoria into perspective.
Thanks for the input, your right about the evolving definitions.
Even WPATH states that gender dysphoria is an entirely separate thing from being trans, and that neither is dependent upon one or the other.
Wha???
I thought the 2nd requirement was do crime lol
You could be genderfluid instead of trans, but there's clearly something there that's making you not entirely cisgender.

I'm very unsure but I'm trying to get to a label and place in my mind where I'm comfortable.
And if you would just be *more* comfortable as a woman—that could be low-level dysphoria as a male and mild-to-big euphoria as a woman 👌
It might be, I just don't know wether that label fits me better than trans.
I've already seen enby lables and identities and I've liked some but theres a part of me that desperately wants to be seen as a woman which is why I'm looking at the other side of the binary, I might stick with this or I might not :)
Thank you for welcoming me :)
That’s the most amazing analogy and I love it!!! 🙌🌈
Oh my god! Thats so nice, I wish you the best in finding out who you are.
I’m glad you’re in a better place now, friend ❤️‍🩹👍
I’d posit that for a lot of us, it’s more about being comfortable in your own brain. 🖤 Our body and presentation may play a (potentially very large) role in that, but coming to an understanding of who we are, and what that means to us, and changing our *mindset* is often really the biggest factor.
shut.🤏🏻
Ok daddy
None of what you said is factual and is nothing more than a horribly biased opinion.
So without dysphoria you cannot be classified as trans?
Thanks a lot for the info❤❤
Crack?
I don’t agree with the vice/versa part. Lots of us experience distress about being trans. We live in an *extremely* transphobic world. There’s lots we may feel distressed about when we start exploring that, and some of it may be internalized transphobia.
Well, what would I need for the label to fit me then?
🤣🤣🤣 Assigned Gender At Birth., but I can see how that happened…
Do you deny yourself transitioning because of everything it entails or just don't care about presenting as a man in public like OP does? For me I only have not transitioned because my situation and everything transitioning entails is overwhelming. Also the crushing doubt I can eventually pass.

By the way, where do you girls get those cute avatars from?
for years I was in denial about my gender and convinced myself I would just prefer to have been born female and I'd come up with a thousand reasons why I can't transition. one of the big ones was often ""I can kinda tolerate being a man""

Cis people don't have to *tolerate* their own gender.

once I acknowledged who I was the more obvious forms of dysphoria that I sometimes experienced became a flood. I couldn't deny anymore so it became impossible to tolerate anymore. I had to transition.
I've been told I can't be trans unless I basically have a crippling hatred of my body and can't live the day without wanting off my self at least once. It felt like there was a list of criteria I had to meet before I could be considered in the ""trans"" club. That was more damaging to me than the dysphoria. I may have grown up with church, but I spent a majority of my own childhood alone and the thoughts and ideas (about gender/ what it means) that I chased were up to my own discretion. I don't hate my body, there are just parts I wanna change.
See how you said ""I wish I was a cis woman"".  That's not what ""tolerating"" looks like. If you were a cis woman, you wouldn't ""tolerate"" it, you would be at peace with it. To me, you very much don't sound like you're at peace with your gender.
I'm not speaking for the OP of the comment, but a lot of us didn't understand that difference until we started transitioning; when the benefits started really showing themselves and the idea of being the original gender started becoming uncomfortable.
for me “able to tolerate” was always just being fine and okay with being man or being seen as a man. It didn’t make me happy but didn’t bother me that much. But there was nothing I liked about being a man.
I'll share my experience as it seems similar. I was totally fine with being a man, but I never really embraced it. I just was. I wished I was born a girl, but I could make myself look handsome and be totally fine with it. 

Then I asked what would make me the most happy. And I decided that staying as a man was not the path to the greatest happiness. Being a dude was BORING, being a lady felt better. 

I didn't have dysphoria, but the euphoria was real. So I decided to chase my happy. And I am happier. Started HRT last month and I'm the happiest I've ever been! 

So the question is where is your happiness? Find out where it is and chase after it. Be the best you that you can be. And that doesn't have to be man or woman. Non-binary is a thing! Feminine boy, butch woman, and much much more are all options. Find what makes you the MOST happy. Then go and get it!
Dysphoria is not necessary at all for several reasons. First off the main consideration should be euphoria or what makes you happy.
Second and this is less usual but you might be feeling dysphoria but not recognising it. 
Third is its your body and identity who the hell else gets to tell you what it is? 

Edit because misclick. Thanks cat...
While dysphoria is not necessary at all in most places, I’ll give that commenter the benefit of the doubt. In some countries you have to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria to “be trans”, of course that doesn’t account for social transition, but in those countries, if you want any type of medical transition then dysphoria would be a “requirement”
Dysphoria is a bad measure euphoria can be a good indicator though
Don't listen to them dysphoria isn't a requirement the only requirement is that u don't identify w ur agab
That both is and isn't true.

It's true in that yes, dysphoria in the sense of unease or discomfort with your AGAB is part of being trans.

On the other hand, dysphoria can be invisible if you don't know, and have never known, anything else. That's why many people recommend looking for euphoria instead (which is just the relief and happiness from the sudden absence of dysphoria, one might argue).

I'm very new to being trans, but the more I explore my identity, the more I realise many ideas about ""that's just how people feel in general"" were just dysphoria I didn't imagine as dysphoria. And the more sources of euphoria I find, the more dysphoria becomes obvious in hindsight. Heck, I feel dysphoria more, now that I know how to identify it.

And I fully expect this process to continue, as again - this is all extremely new for me.

Sorry only talking from personal experience, and a very short one at that, but hopefully this'll be of some use to you.  


EDIT: corrected a sentence where I derped (""more sources of dysphoria"" -> ""...of euphoria"")
That’s dangerous for a number of reasons—you may be happier after transition regardless of if you experience dysphoria, and you also may not be aware of some dysphoria you experience. I didn’t become aware that my dysphoria was dysphoria until I was in my 20s, but it has been with me my entire life.
it’s not, at least according to the dsm 5
Dysphoria is not necessary, anybody who tells you otherwise is known as a truscum, and the last four letters of ""truscum"" is exactly what they are. Don't listen to that shit.
Dysphoria is a good sign but not necessary. Euphoria is necessary as far as I know (please educate me otherwise but I'm pretty sure)
Dysphoria is not a requirement.  

The opposite is gender euphoria. Do you feel good daydreaming about being cis woman? The idea of stereo typical feminine interests make you feel good?
That would mean that a trans person who has fully transitioned the way they want to and don't really experience dysphoria anymore in their daily life.. ceases to be trans? No no no.. euphoria is what you want to look for, not dysphoria.
Yea, nah. If anyone tells you that you have to have dysphoria to be trans they're gatekeeping. The term used for them is ""truscum"", or hoe they like to call themselves ""trans medicalist""(trans med for short) 

I always say that euphoria is a better indicator. If you are/would be happier as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth, you're trans. (Edit: here trans is used as an umbrella term, you can be gender fluid, non-binary etc, it still falls under the ""trans"" label.)
Dysphoria can be many things. Telling a person “dysphoria is strictly ____” is like saying “the universal key happiness is ____” 
Also dysphoria can come & go. I didn’t think I had dysphoria either until I learned more about it. You saying you are comfy in your gender but prefer fem pronouns etc IS a type of dysphoria. 

Non-binary is also a valid trans option where you can like “phase” — theres a better word jus not coming to mind right now— back-and-forth between male presenting and female presenting or just human presenting androgynous. (It honestly sounds like this is where you are right now. Which is where I was for a couple years and now I’m leaning towards more masc desires) but there should be a Kinsey type scale for trans people. Maybe not exactly like that, but I feel like it would give a lot more information out there. Like bi people are valid in the gay community. 

TLDR: Trans is an umbrella term for few different identities. Dysphoria can be as fluid as gender.
This made me so mad I almost downvoted you, lol. You don’t need dysphoria to be trans!! 

Think of it this way. You say you like she/her pronouns and being seen as a woman. Would you say you get any gender *euphoria* from that? Because that’s trans af
Euphoria is the main sign, not dysphoria.
that person is a cis transphobe
That is what we refer to as a truscum, someone who believes that dysphoria I a requirement to being trans, otherwise you're just a faker.

Do not lisen to anything they say, all it requires to be trans is having a gender identity different to the one you were assigned at birth, anyone who tries to say otherwise should not be trusted
I'd argue to say dysphoria is necessary but you could be trans with euphoria too.
that person is wrong, and maybe even transphobic. gatekeeping being trans isn’t cool
It isn’t. The only requirement for being trans is that you self-identify as it. If you think you are trans, then you essentially are. You don’t need to have dysphoria
This was me! Had no idea why I wanted to off myself so bad, totally wasn't the tits starting to grow.
That’s such an excellent way of putting it, thank you!
Requirements, like unlockable skills in a video game. And Trans people receive a ton of hate from hateful bigots. Combat points. It was a terrible nerd joke.
we ARE the crime
I apologize for sounding harmful. I hold a belief that people who are comfortable with their gender aren't inherently trans, unless they believe themselves to be. You can be whatever you want without dysphoria as well.
That takes time and just paying attention to yourself
Whatever feels best to you sounds like what you should go with. And it’s totally okay if that changes as you explore and get to know yourself better. Thanks for giving us all the opportunity to support you on your journey. 💖
I'm a genderqueer trans woman. I was born male, prescribed boy to man.

My experience with gender is far more feminine than masculine. I'm like a woman who decided to be gender non-conforming. It can be very confusing when this information is new ❤ take your time and figure yourself out.

I commented on another of your comments too, if you want to keep an eye out for it 😊
This bit where you say “there’s a part of me that desperately wants to be seen as a woman” indicates to me you’re probably a trans woman.

But that is for you to decide 😊 (same as nobody else gets to tell you “you’re not trans!”)

Wishing you comfort and joy, friend!
I'll get your membership card mailed out on Monday
that person is cisgender. per the american psychiatric association you don't need dysphoria to be trans
You can be trans without dysphoria, focus on what gives you euphoria. 
There are many trans people that dont have surgeries or hormone therapy, and are happy with their bodies.
You're welcome
Their egg has cracked.  That was the sound of it happening.
Fair enough, by the time I realised I was trans I was ready to accept it so I don't know what being distressed at not being cis feels like.
Why do you want to be trans is the better question?
I’m pretty comfortable in the body I already have and don’t want to deal with a lot of the hassles of transitioning publicly. Knowing who I am privately is enough for me. And while I don’t have an exact link, these avatars come from a site called Picrew Maker. It’s almost entirely Japanese, but there are tons of character creators on there.
[I've been told I can't be trans unless I basically have a crippling hatred of my body]

Sounds like our own community of trans doing a little bit of gaslighting. 

You don't have to hate anything about yourself.  I certainly didn't.  I was handsome as a man, total white male privileges, and make good money in my career. And none of those things mattered once I knew transition was possible.
Euphoria is equally as significant as dysphoria. 

Often when people say ""every trans person has dysphoria"" (a false belief) they are referring to the clinical definition, rather than the negative feelings many feel. Identifying these feelings is often difficult early on, or not present at all.

You do not need to feel dysphoria to be trans.
That's why people are working to change the requirement of diagnosing gender dysphoria to get hrt. Its so problematic and cis people don't seem to get that.
This is exactly how I gaslit myself into putting off my own transition. Would you rather be another gender than the one you're assigned? Yes? There ya go bitch, there's your answer.

And bear in mind, too, that almost nothing in this process is fast and permanent. You have a **lot** of opportunities to try something and see if it feels right. Even hormones take a while.
I mean its been an ocassional fantasy but being male has its benefits and maybe I've gotten so used to it I don't feel euphoria with it. I'm not a peace with my gender thats true but that doesn't eliminate the possibility of being cis.
Trans man here, you just caused me to have a revelation myself. There’s nothing I’ve ever liked about being a woman. But being a man… there’s a lot of things I like about it.
But would labelling myself as trans be a diservice to the community or is it valid?
That second point is really important I feel. It's hard to recognize feelings as dysphoria when it's been your whole life up till now. Black ink on a black canvas.
Yeah, pretty much.
I wouldn’t call it necessary because of the shoe/new car argument. Just because something not painful or uncomfortable doesn’t mean a different or new one wouldn’t be more comfortable/enjoyable. Although I also I have a friend who’s nb and pretty transphobic (calls me “they” and has literally never used she/her even though I don’t use they them pronouns at all for myself)
Ohhh, I get it now, sorry lmao, I'm slow with jokes.
Thank you ❤❤❤
No, thank you for reading this and helping me figure out who I am 💜
I saw your past comment, this helps a lot and honestly it might help explaining to others why I identify as a woman even if I dont act like one. Thanks a lot for the support 💖💖💖
What do you need then? And do you think the APA is the best source for classifying gender?
But would it be a valid label to say I'm trans or am I something else?
How? Why would you be trans if you don’t want to TRANSition?
Wdym?
I'm looking to see if it fits me and a lot of people say it does, but you disagree, so I ask why?
I understand, I've felt like that for years. But lately it's becoming unbearable to just be able to do it privately. To me the biggest obstacles are the permanent physical changes, in case I still don't end up passing. But then I also fear regretting never transitioning and not enjoying the changes while I am still young. Putting all the pieces together socially, medically, and economically are overwhelming, but I feel like giving it a shot. And thank you for the site, and for letting me ramble! 🙂
This. Damn you /r/transtimelines !
>I mean its been an ocassional fantasy

How many other ""occasional fantasies"" have prompted you to soul search and reach out for help from reddit or other dedicated communities?

> being male has its benefits

Absolutely. Over half the world still isn't male though. Who you are isn't connected to whether you're privileged or not.  

>maybe I've gotten so used to it I don't feel euphoria with it

I'm 5 years in to transition.  Had all my surgeries, and I'm just living life.  The euphoria is *long* gone.  All I can tell you is that the lack of euphoria from transitioning hasn't made me go ""Gee, I wish I was a cis man for all of the privilege that comes with it"" 

""I wish I was something other than who I am"" isn't what ""I just don't feel euphoria"" looks like.  

>I'm not a peace with my gender thats true 

Cool, so you've just described dysphoria.  

>but that doesn't eliminate the possibility of being cis.

You're waiting for someone to slap you around the face and tell you that you're trans, because you're afraid to ""choose"" it. The reality is though, you don't choose it, and no one else can tell you who you are. You are who you are, whether you can admit it to yourself or not.

The only way to get to live the life you want, is to make your choices in life from an informed position. If you're trans, accepting that doesn't mean anything other than you can now choose better choices for your own life, from a position of understanding your truth. What those choices look like is up to you. But if you're trans and, like pretty much every trans person to have ever lived before you, are just desperately trying to convince yourself that you're not trans, then you *can't* make informed choices about your own life. Every single choice you make will be from a position of self deception, and that will never get you where you want.

I can't tell you if you're trans. Only you can answer that. But just like in the Matrix, you already know the answer.
Not at all. First of all, as the above comment said, euphoria is a much better indicator for being trans than dysphoria. Second of all, dysphoria is really hard to recognize, and it covers a much wider range of things than you might think. Some people have very little physical dysphoria or none at all but a ton of social dysphoria. Both are valid, but neither are necessary. As long as you wish to identify with a gender that is not the one you were assigned at birth, feel free to identify as trans
people who say dysphoria is a requirement are the ones doing us a disservice. That perspective often sees being transgender as disordered or a mental illness, when it is neither of those things. to me being trans is a joyful existence, and I was only able to embrace that joy when I started to love my body rather than reject it. once I found that love, I was able to start HRT to shift it towards the image I have for it. transition is my way of loving a body that I already loved but now more completely, and while I experience dysphoria as well, it's much more beautiful to me to define my transness by the joy and love that I feel. that love shouldnt be gatekept, in my opinion.
""disservice to the community"" is the same shit that the truscums say to invalidate us. also those who hate neos. so don't worry! do what makes u happy! ur valid as shit <3
that’s such a good way of putting it
Dysphoria wasn't even in my vocabulary until AFTER I'd accepted that I was trans and had started socially transitioning.

But I did know what euphoria was and felt like. And so I focused on that.
That good feeling is euphoria. 🖤
It’s an honour, friend. Thanks for blessing the world with your authenticity. 🤗
There’s no formula for “acting like a woman”. Women (and people of any gender) can act or look like anything.  I know a trans woman who is a race car mechanic, wears jeans, doc martens, band tee shirts, and flannels 24/7. I’ve never seen her wear a stitch of makeup or a dress. If she were a cis woman, people would accept her as a woman who likes things that are stereotypically more masculine. She is just as much a woman as that cis woman. The only difference is the genitals she was born with. 

I know trans men (quite a few, actually), who wear dresses & makeup, paint their nails - the whole 9. I’m transmasculine, and I adore those things. Sadly, I don’t wear them, because I hate being misgendered as a woman more. Since we are in masks all the time, unless I present 100% masc, I’m always assumed to be a woman. I can’t wait until we aren’t wearing masks & I can put glitter in my beard when I go out. I know plenty of cis men & AMAB non-binary folks who enjoy the same things. 

Your gender is innate. It’s not determined by your genitals, your interests, or your presentation. Those are just stereotypes about gender, and it applies the same, whether you are trans or cis. 

You say you “wish you were a woman”. Might I offer that you are a woman? Perhaps what you wish is that you were perceived as a woman, and/or that you fully accepted yourself as a woman? 

Laura Jane Grace’s autobiography, Tranny, is an *incredible* read. I actually recommend listening to the Audible, if that format is accessible to you. Hearing her speak the words is very powerful. 

I’m 41. I experienced dysphoria at a young age, but didn’t recognize it at all until after I’d fully accepted that I was trans. I wasn’t fully out to the world until my 40th birthday, when I legally changed my name & finally got up the courage to tell my family. I wish I could rewind the clock and get a redo on all the decades in between. My life would be so different. Self reflection & acceptance is step #1, alongside a recognition that there is no “right” path. You can try something out, and if you decide that it isn’t working, you can try something different. I spent years agonizing about making the “right” decision. I wish I had just *done* something, anything, instead of being stuck in my head.
you need to identify as a gender that isnt your assigned gender at birth. and they're not classifying gender, theyre professionals in the field of psychiatry confirming that being trans isnt a disorder/tge presence of a disorder isnt required to be trans
You're valid :)
Transitioning is not a requirement of being transgender.

""Trans"" is a Latin prefix that means ""across"", ""beyond"", ""on the other side of"" etc.

So ""transgender"" literally means ""Not cis"".

(Cis is a Latix prefix that means ""on the same side as"")
Excuse me...your egg has cracked.  It's the concept of realizing you might be trans. You'll have conflicting feelings about it and put barriers on it for your own comfort, but at the end of the day you are only trans if you say you are. Period.
I explained why in the text wall. You don’t have any desire to transition your assigned gender into a preferred gender. Liking something is all well and good, but by your own admission you don’t actually want to transition anything, a very important thing for a *trans*gender person.
No problem at all! I’m always happy to talk.
Lol I think you may have just solved my problem, thank you for your wisdom
Thank you. I needed to read something like that.
As a trans guy who didn't accept myself until age 30, I feel compelled to say ""This! This! This!""
Well said.
>But if you're trans and, like pretty much every trans person to have ever lived before you, are just desperately trying to convince yourself that you're not trans

But what if it is the other way? What if the part that believes oneself to be trans is the part that is just convinced of a lie?  And the part that tells oneself you're not trans is actually right?
Thanks a lot.
That’s so spot on!!! First time I told my therapist I was trans she asked if I felt I was born in the wrong body. I just kind of glitched out trying to process and the answer was “Noooo. I think it’s somehow right for me to be born male I just want to do with that what I please”.
Hey your wording is really kinda hurtful to people with mental illnesses and disorders. You're kinda insinuating that those things are bad and an opposite to joy.  Theres nothing wrong with those things and it can be really harmful when people push so hard against transness being any sort of medical. It's like saying ""we're not like people with mental illnesses. We're normal. We can actually enjoy our life""
Oh, ok then, so does me identifying as something other than my AGAB count me as valid?
Thank you ❤
What about the people who want to transition but can't, or those who can't afford it?
What if it is the other way around? It's uncommon, but it can happen. The answer is still the same. The only way to get to live the life that makes you comfortable in your own skin and in yourself, is to make choices from an informed position. Hiding from the possibility that you're trans and refusing to explore it will just leave that unanswered, and it's just another form of denial. You have to do the things you need to do to understand yourself, so that you can make informed choices and can be comfortable in yourself.  

But, I'll say the same thing I said above. No one else can tell you, only you can answer that question, but you probably already know the answer. The challenge is accepting it.
I can see how you read it that way, and I apologize that it was hurtful. But I never connected mental illness to a negative. My two separate points are that people make being transgender seem like a mental illness, when it is not and, as a separate point, being trans brings me joy. The only way these two things were connected at all was that I made them next to each other. I apologize that these two points being made close together was hurtful, but there is no connection between them and I made no such connection.

Maybe this is a better way to phrase my points: A requirement of dysphoria is often used by people who see being trans as a mental illness. This is not the case, and while having mental illness is not a bad thing, it confounds the definition of being trans. We should dismiss this idea and put the idea of mental illness out of our minds entirely within the context of discussing what makes someone trans. It is not related. With that point pushed to the side, we can now assess what being trans is, and to find what makes someone trans we can look to their joys.  

This says the same thing, but hopefully a reader would be less likely to bring their biases into a reading to associate the two points together.
""Identifying"" as a gender, is simply accepting common language to relate your experience to the experience of others. You could answer the question ""what gender are you?"" With ""my gender is like when a cat hisses at the corner but nothing is there"" and ___you are still valid___; it's about what *you* feel about *your* gender.

 Language was created to convey meaning, and ideas help with that. Gender is simply how we percieve ourselves and how we want others to percieve us.
Yes
Wanting/needing is still the primary factor. The issue of doing is person to person and dependent on many things but doesn’t effect one’s transness. You cannot be trans because you do not want or need to transition in any way, someone who is poor but wants/needs trans affirming care is still trans
Isn' that transmedicalist?
No dude, read my lips, if you want or need any aspect of transitioning genders, ANY, not just medical, ANY ASPECT, you are trans. You have said you have no want or need to medically transition, you don’t want or need to socially transition, and you only act feminine because you enjoy it. You so desperately want to find a way to be a part of our community besides being an ally that it’s off putting. Listen man, I’m gonna only say this once because I have that feeling you aren’t going to read anything besides the last few lines of this response and I’m sick of you already, if you’re trans, you will know and you will have the desire to transition (once again, in any way, not just medical). From what you’ve said in your post, you don’t fit it, so don’t use our label and don’t you dare take advantage of anything trans people need to survive
Yes, this person is transmed
I did say I wanted to transition socially with close friends.
You literally said your comfortable with your agab. Idk man look up some nb identities, maybe you’ll find something more fitting there
I am, do you need to have dysphoria to be trans then?
yes and no, there needs to be something more than ""i like it"". i dont think it needs to be the pain of dysphoria, but you cant just like something and be like ""yep im trans now""
Why not?
Are you a philosophy student? If so, dont go socratic on me, polisci majors can wipe the floor with phil majors. Liking something and enjoying something different from your archetypal position in biology and society is evident that you like and enjoy it, not that something within you is different. I'm a trans woman but i like playing warhammer and mtg, which are very typically cis male activities, and i hope that i wouldn't be perceived as a male for liking those things. i feel like there needs to be something else besides ""i like it"" to say that you arent a femboy and are a bona fide trans woman
So what is it then? If its not just socially transitioning why do you think the labels incorrect?
Honestly i give up. fuck it. you're trans. everyone is trans if they like the idea enough. the don himself is trans, why not. im saying this with like 50% sarcasm. you've defended it for so fucking long that either you really, really want to be trans (horrible idea) or you are trans and are doing one of those ""uwu am i twans enough"" things. you win. enjoy. dont take any scholarship money, you dont deserve it, otherwise go crazy
Why come here, ask a question then argue with the replies? That's trolling at best. Give me a break."	s010vb	trans	1074	0.95	2022-01-09 20:43:08
Just got deadnamed in front of my homophobic class (mtf 17)	"So, i just got misgendered by the substitute in my most homophobic class of the day in the worst way possible. She was calling role, and when she came to my name she said my deadnamed, and paused. I wasn't paying attention because I'm not used to it, but everyone stops talking. Then, she repeats it,looks me dead in my eyes and says ""You're *deadnamed*, right?"" 

She looked mad at me too...


I just want to curl up and cry, I've been dealing with some serious dysphoria since yesterday and this has made everything fucking way worse

Edit: I generally know how to handle these things, but thanks for the advice. Today has just been a rough day in totality, and that really didn't help. This post may be removed soon though because of the hateful DMS and comments I've been receiving. If me venting about an experience that upset me under the vent tag upsets you that much, then I think you're far more sensitive than me.

Edit 2: The substitute is very regular, and I've had her multiple times. She doesn't respect my name."	"I can only imagine the reasons she was mad for you responding to roll call is either not know and thinking you were “disrespectful”, simply hates you for being trans, or some combination of both.
This happened to me on my first day of classes. My solution: don't respond to it. It isn't your name. Speak with the teacher after class to correct them and make sure they mark you as present.

I am really sorry this happened to you. I hope you're doing okay. You're very strong for being out and presenting at this age, in this particular climate, I hope things go better next time.
Teachers like this are honestly the worst, seemingly only existing to spite their students.  
When I was in school, I would spite all the students I disliked, but I feel like I'd make an exception for this teacher...and no doubt get sent to the principle for saying ""Sorry Mr. Dickhead""
I know this is a stretch, but does your school have any policy that supports trans youth using a chosen name? You could report them.

If that’s not an option, I’m sorry you’re in a tricky position. Regardless having a class full of bigoted kids and a teacher equally bigoted that all know your deadname sounds terrible. I hope you can go to someone in your life who can support you.
""No, I'm *chosen name.*""

The end.
report that to your school officials.  they can blacklist her from ever subbing there again (assuming they support you)
I'm going to say this in the most polite way I can this morning....fuck her! I would have said my name is x thank you, but I forgive you. People can be so shit sometimes. Hugs Honey
Misgender them back. Call them by a wrong name or their maiden name even. Lol

edit: /s but when they've done it multiple times, let them swallow their own medicine.
I wasn’t there so I don’t know full context but is it possible your deadname was simply what was listed on the attendance sheet? If it was truly malicious then fuck him, but I’ve had people deadname me simply because they didn’t know or had old info on me. It feels awkward af and makes me slightly uncomfortable but I have to remember it was an accident and simply politely correct them. It’s only unless they refuse to accept the correction that I let myself get upset with them. Same thing with gendering, some people have used “he” for me but only because they were strangers and thought I was FTM, not mtf and actually trying to be supportive. I was giving off very androgynous vibes early in transition most strangers truly couldn’t tell my assigned gender at birth as I have a naturally effeminate yet only slightly deeper than cis female voice. I just corrected them and told them my pronouns and suggested they ask first to avoid confusion and had zero problem. We can’t be mad at ignorant people, only the ones who go out of their way to keep others ignorant or insist on remaining so after being confronted with the truth. But like I said if it was really malicious then fuck him and I support u girl. Sometimes it’s just hard to tell I know cause I’ve been in your spot plenty of times.
My respect i wish the Best for you ❤️
I'm so sorry that happened to you! I'm actually a substitute myself, and dead naming a student is one of my worst fears. Some teachers are nice enough to provide a list of preferred names and pronouns in the notes they leave, but some don't, and the school only uses legal names on the rolecall sheet. I always tell students to correct me if I use a name they don't prefer, but I know that doesn't always make it easier. 

I obviously don't mean to defend your sub. It sounds like they were malicious and transphobic. Screw them, and you definitely should mention the incident to your regular teacher when they're back.
You should call transphobic teachers whatever you want and if you get in trouble just claim that your ‘deeply held religious convictions’ demand you call them that.  They can’t ask you to define/defend your ‘deeply held religious convictions’:
Happened to me about an hour ago. Fucking sucked. Nobody in my class knew my deadname two hours ago and now they all do.
Report the sub. Please. Have them lose their teaching license. What they did is not ok.
“You’re <deadname>, right?”
“Err, no, I’m <realname>”
Devil's advocate: Is your deadname listed as your name in the school's roster? If she had a list of every student's name, and your deadname instead of your preferred name was on the list, then it's not necessarily the substitute's fault. Is there any way she could have known what your preferred name was?
[removed]
I would’ve went nope never was. I don’t take your calling me by the wrong name lightly. so I’d probably have it out to make her day hell
Thank you so much for all the support <3 Schools over now so I'm just going to be lazy and have a mental health day now.
You don't deserve to go through any of this, And we're here for you. As for the people being twats in your DMs, They need to chill the hell out. Everyone has different experiences and values. Someone else's threshold being different doesn't give them a right to be mean to you for yours.

None of us know what anyone else is going through or why something hurts the way it does.
I am so sorry. Hopefully better days are ahead.
I’m sure that she just called out the register and that was the name she had been given for you, I highly doubt that she deliberately called you it. She is a substitute and so likely doesn’t know you or any of the other students.
Yeah this. I had to fill out some paperwork and such, but my school changed my name in their entire system. Teachers don't even get to know my deadname (unless they had me before I got it changed) and it's really helpful.
I think their gender looks something like this 🖕 and it should continue looking like this until they learn respect
Personally not a fan if this method because using pronouns/gendered language as a weapon isn't helping anyone and if anything can lead people to the idea of withholding gender recognition as a punishment.
I'm glad someone else thought of this. A substitute isn't going to know what everyone prefers to be called unless it's marked down. It's a very real possibility your name isn't mentioned in an obvious place (such as listed in the attendance sheet in place of your deadname). It's more likely that this sub had no way of knowing your name rather than it being full on malicious. 

It really sucks though, especially with the type of people you're classmates are.
Love this
Honestly, yea, same

Edit: Name checks out, lol
”I use misgendering to destroy misgendering”
It also tells your trans friends that your respect of their gender identity is contingent upon them keeping you in their good graces."	x85kec	trans	1057	0.96	2022-09-07 13:46:27

How can you feel ugly if you look so adorable???

Really, you are cute, but I totally understand how you feel. Sometimes dysphoria is so shitty and it distorts reality a lot, but believe us when we say you are very cute, I wish I were cute as you do. Hugs girl <3

Ya look cute
You are cute ☺️
You are really cute, I wish I looked as good as you.
顔はなんか可愛と思いますよ
I feel ya
I wish I was as pretty as you. I'm transitioning right now. About 7 months into HRT
AWWWWW you are just the cutest😚
When I feel that way it always my Estrogen being to low or about time for my next injection let your endo know maby you need your E a little higher. Also your so pretty sorry you're dealing with that it. Happens to me all the time before I increased my dose and frequency of when I took my E.
 Very stunning 😍
you're so pretty and you look really feminine<33 I'm proud of you
you're so gorgeous
You look beautiful (: Just remember we're our own worst critic and see things others don't. I wish nothing, but positive vibes. <3
My god you're so beautiful, your brain is really lying to you, you're gorgeous
I'm a hairdresser and I'd recommend you (judging the second photo) use less hair on the sides. It looks more cute if you use only a thin line of hair. 🥰🥰🥰 Also I love your posts. Don't be sad. You look cute. I hope to look as cute as you do when I start my HRT. 😍😍 Also another tip, don't worry when it gets electified as you split the hair. It will set after few minutes again. And then don't touch it. 😉 Also you might like to buy a tail comb with steel needle-point. It won't electrify hair so much when you split them. ❤️❤️❤️
You are absolutely beautiful
You're not even close to ugly. You're so cute. I like your new outfit.
Hughughughughug
You look great 
Hughughughug
You’re beautiful
Feeling ugly 😧 you’re so beautiful though!
U look very pretty and not ugly at all, also u remind me of my math teacher
You are beautiful if you were here would be busy
You are very beautiful.
kmJ/K.
For whatever reason (maybe it's the eyes and/or nose), you sorta remind me of Leia in A New Hope.
(Pre everything mtf, only finally accepted it like 3 days ago) I found this post trying to find the name for my taste in fashion (its a little more extreme than what you’re wearing but its still harajuku haha) - you’re so pretty and pulling your look off so fucking well (at least imo as a harajuku appreciator, casual jeans and a tee be damned tbh) that you’re giving me immense confidence that I’m going to do fine too.

I know where you’re coming from with the side profile as I feel it too, my brow ridge feels too pronounced to me tbh but I’ve know so many gorgeous women irl who look almost exactly like you from the side, so try not to fixate on it

And remember, the concept of “get my good side” exists for a reason haha (i think yours is head on for sure). 

(and to drive it home your hair’s cute as fuck btw)
I’m 57, felt ugly most my life. It’s in your head. Enjoy being your gorgeous self!
I dislike the side of my face, I think it looks masc
YES! I was trying to figure out who she looked like.
what name?
I don't have confidence '\^\^
My style tips are try Harajuku fashion or classical Japanese
Love the name btw Iced coffee
本当にだ？ありがとうございます!
thank you
?
thank you, it's actually quite hard to find self love in a world that doesn't want you to exisit. Honestly forgot I made this post
I don't know, your jaw line is naturally soft and you've done a really good job on your eyebrows, I think you may just be being extra critical. Do you have any side profile or like a quarter view pic?
everything about your face is feminine to me
Honestly it doesn't
It doesn’t
babe, you look really feminine in both photos and seriously if I looked as good as you I would be euphoric. you are beautiful!

and this may sound weird but you have a really good 'femimine' neck.
Pinku. Tha's what we call our cat.
It seems you had enough to come out and change your appearance to match that (or atleast on the internet but still), and I applaud you for that :)
Gasp she relipied!! So exciting hehe , thank you so much where do you find stuff like that to buy?
Thank you! I've kinda made it a personality trait haha!
はい！本当です。でもさ「本当にだ?」ってじゃなくて「本当ですか？」です
終助詞が必要だからね (笑)
You're very welcome, hun. I hope you enjoy your day.
im just saying that you are being
[deleted]
yes, it it the second photo in the post
fem neck?
oh, in mine it's the Japanese word for pink but I wasn't allowed to us katakana characters sadly
thank you
I found my harajuku from Hot Topic or similar stores and my yukatas from conventions
Same with pink for me lol. At this point ピンク is just part of my character.
これを短くする私の方法。毎日日本語を勉強　\^-\^
eh?!
Duhr, yeah, there it is. I still don't get a strong masculine vibe from your profile either. I think if you were going to try to do anything though, work on making your lips a little fuller perhaps and maybe earrings would add to overall fem look. But seriously, I don't think I would pick up on any masculinity if I saw you in public as is.
women tend to have a taller looking neck from shoulder to skull than men in general. And slightly narrower as well. Also, you have no visible Adam's apple.

in addition you are very attractive. putting that all together, you just look like a woman. I am so envious.

the only thing that could possibly make you more attractive would be a nice smile in your next pic. ❤️
Thank you so much ill definitely have to look there
Pink is my fav color!
thank you, I'm insecure about my profile because of my thinking its masculaine
thank you. I sometimes feel insecure that I do have an adam's apple
mine too. I also use it in my pen name
Like I said, I really don't see it, judging from all the up-votes it would seem a lot of people agree with me. You look fine.
thank you

I'm trans, and haven't read the Gender Dysphoria Bible yet. I want to, but I'm really scared that if I read it, I'll realise I'm not trans		"One of the points it talks about is imposter syndrome. It’s very common in LGBTQ+ folks even more so in trans and GNC. I have it to, literally the next night after accepting myself as trans I though I was faking it. When many of us have been raised thinking that straight and cis were the norm(they are not!) it’s no surprise that our mind tries desperately to trick you into thinking you are “””normal”””.
  
I highly recommend giving it a read through. There’s a detailed section about the effects and changes caused by HRT.
Just after my egg cracked I had the exact same fear. So I feel you, let me try to offer you some things that comforted me.

If you *want* to be trans, if you're worried about *not* being trans instead of worried about being trans, if you really desperately want to be a gender different from the one that you were assigned at birth, and so you want to have whatever conditions or signs are necessary, even if they're painful, that would make that desire valid... that in itself is all you need to be trans. So I think the fact that you're worried you're not trans would indicate that you're trans.

Moreover, one of the great things about the gender dysphoria bible is that it has an extremely broad definition of what constitutes dysphoria. Unlike the transmedicalist people who have a strict definition of dysphoria that basically just means hating yourself and your body, the way the gender dysphoria bible uses the term, it can mean anything from hating your body to simply thinking that you would be happier as another gender (since thinking that indicates that you are unhappy — in comparison to how happy you could be — with your current gender). That's why I actually don't have a problem with the gender dysphoria bible: although people might accuse it of being transmedicalist because it says all trans people have dysphoria, its definition of dysphoria is so broad that it includes the main defining factor of being trans, which is wanting to be another gender. Moreover, that broadness and depth, due to its crowdsourced if anecdotal nature, means that there are so many different intricate expressions of dysphoria that it covers that I'm basically positive that you'll find something to represent you there.

The other thing is that being transgender is different for everyone. Just because the way you experience it is different from the way other people experience. It doesn't mean that you aren't trans. Only you can determine whether you're trans, because only you can determine what way of living would make you happier and what things make you unhappy in your current life. So nobody else can tell you whether you're trans or not. And if they try, you can always just reject them and go on your own path. That's scarier than having experiences that line up 100% with other trans people, because it means that you have to rely on your own certainty in what you want, but it's still a totally valid and legitimate option. I myself have a slightly different experience of being trans than the typical trans person. For one thing, I realized a little later, at 11. For another, I don't experience as much dysphoria when people misgender me.
I wish I didn’t relate to this, but unfortunately I do. I know logically that concern means I’m trans, but unfortunately that doesn’t make the imposter syndrome go away. Because imposter syndrome isn’t based on logic. It’s based on anxiety.
I didn't think I was 100% trans, read it, then realized I was.
The what
And if you aren’t? It’s ok to be cis or non-binary.

I was struggling with the fear of being when I first came out. I actually logic’d myself into desisting and trying to live male again.

Eventually I slowly took a sober and calm look at myself and I figured out who I was. 

It’s ok to be afraid. It’s natural. This is a very scary step. But you can’t let it rule your life.
For all who haven’t read it yet:  [The Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi)
You don’t need dysphoria to be trans. To quote One Topic At A Time https://youtube.com/c/OneTopicAtATime (love that guy) “If you’re worried you might be faking it, there’s a really good chance that you’re not.”
If you’re worried about not being trans you’re definitely trans
this is the least cis fear ever
The gender dysphoria bible isn't the end all be all.
It's simply a tool.

Also, if you're worried about not being trans enough or something. That would be a pretty strange worry for a cis person.
I avoided reading it for the opposite reason; I wanted to forget I ever doubted my gender. This, because I wanted to pass the dysphoria off as some other feeling, and keeping myself from researching further into gender dysphoria studies made it easier to bury my doubts.

It took some months of fellow eggs telling me behavior [x] is like ""straigt outta the Gender Dysphoria Bible"" for me to actually check if they were telling the truth. And well, a quick read later I realized they were citing the source truthfully, instead of making things up.

In the end, the Gender Dysphoria Bible only cemented the fact I have dysphoria, even with me expecting the opposite for the longest time...
Cis people are never afraid of beeing not trans. Dont worry you are fine 😺.
No cis person would be that worried about not being trans. 


Remember that gender identity is a spectrum, there is no ""right"" way to be trans, just explore how you feel and do what feels comfortable for you, labels be damned.
You don't have to read it if you don't want to. I never read it, nor did my trans friends, nor any trans person who lives in my country. And we're all still trans, valid and okay with who we are.
I understand your fear and concern but there's only two outcomes to the situation - either you get an enormous confirmation that you're trans or you realize you are not trans. Neither of these outcomes are negative, it's okay to be either cis or trans, please don't concern yourself with it. Regardless, I do believe this fear sort of proves that you're indeed trans. :)
I felt the same way. When I read it the first time it unlocked a whole bunch of stuff. I started crying because I was grieving for the childhood and life I had been robbed of. Prior to reading that, I didn’t think I was experiencing dysphoria, I thought that because I was neutral about most of my body parts I was not trans. Reading the Gender Dysphoria Bible made it clear that I was trans af and always had been and was dealing with all different types of dysphoria and it actually erased any doubts I had. I recommend it to anyone questioning their gender.
Impostor syndrome is pretty common for all of us it seems, the GDB was the final tap on the shell that cracked my egg completely, I felt like I was straight up just reading about myself and yet I still worry that I’m not really trans, even as I’m taking hormones and getting all my facial hair painfully lasered off.

It’s normal to have these feelings, and they don’t last forever
Professionally they try to focus on whether or not there is a euphoria or the positives of conforming to the desired gender (i.e. if being female instead of male or visa-versa makes you happy) rather than dysphoria. Not every trans person will feel dysphoria in the same way, or even at all, but there's almost always a positive feeling if there are no other underlying issues.

I recently read it and I would very highly recommend it. It is super insightful. One thing that was mentioned multiple times is that if you are thinking ""what if I'm not trans enough"" you are probably trans. Cis people don't really think about that.  


As someone who has recently discovered that they're trans, I can assure you that this feeling is common.
Being scared that you're *not* trans is a clear indication that you are. Cisgender people don't worry about that.

When I first figured out that I was trans I wanted to spend all of my time focused on it. I talked about it with friends I trusted, I journalled about it, I made art about it, and I Googled every trivial question that crossed my mind. 

I finally figured out that I was afraid that if I stopped focusing on it, if I let the excitement and elation dip, it would all go away. But then I found security in the face that I was afraid of it going away.
awwww sweetie, just read it if anything, the way you put it, you’ll probably just find out that are even MORE trans

ohh oh and don’t let the truscum (medicalists ohhhh spooky) scare you from who you are, they are assholes and no one really takes them seriously, that sort of bs is not worth your precious time
No no, you got it wrong. You don’t need dysphoria to be trans. You don’t need to look certain way to be trans. It’s okay if you haven’t always felt that way. Being trans is being yourself and there is no wrong way to be trans.
Not everyone has dysphoria, but that doesn't mean they are not trans people. Every story is different. For me it was really hard, before I accepted everything and started HRT. Again, sometimes I just start to panic with no reason, then a gym helps me a lot.
Breh... thats all of us when we start... ur trans if ur trans... uf you wanna be a gurl... ur trans thats all to it (theres some more stuff ofc... but not everyone has it... For my case: im girly since day 1, have 0 natural behaviors similar to dudes, i wanna get fucked not fuck someone, im cuddlt and fluffy on the inside, i wanna look like a girl, i hate my pp, imma start hrt... loads more stuff... but it can be diffefent for you)
Hunny, if youre trans reading it will only reinforce the knowledge of being trans. Seriously, before i read it i was unsure, after i realised how much i wasnt cis and have been relatively sure in my identity of being a woman (sometimes i feel like a demi-girl).
I will warn you, I believe that if you enter that bible with the understanding of being trans, you are just going to have a time reading through it and realizing all the things you do, that are hard, or hurt you, we also do or have done.

You're not alone! You're special! No one can tell you if you're trans or not, just you, and that book cannot take you away from you; it will only help you arrive at your destination.
Cis people don't get scared they're not trans haha


(correct me if i'm wrong)
cis ppl don’t get scared that they aren’t trans
I feel like this a lot too. Like I see a lot of other trans people and their own struggles with mental health and how dysphoria affects that. Whereas I feel the most mentally stable I’ve ever been. Every day I’m happy and confident. then I think if I walk into the doctors  tomorrow and tell them I’m trans and I don’t like the body I’m in they will look at me and tell me I’m not trans enough because I’m too happy 🤷🏼‍♀️
Everyone’s experience it’s different. I didn’t have such dysphoria I couldn’t go to the beach near my house and have a swim as a male. But something that always knew was off suddenly clicked and everything changed for the best. You can still have a normal life without taking action, the thing is that what you consider normal to other person may seem a living hell, everyone has their strengths but if you could have lived until you realised that was it you can still have a cold mind and think how to improve or “fix” it. Either way, trans is not cis, and that’s what so beautiful about us, femmes and gents.
Nothing you can read can tell you that you aren’t trans. The only place you can hear that from and take it to heart is from yourself
...the what?
Dysphoria isn’t a requirement for being trans. It’s a separate condition that many trans people experience.

The **only** thing that is required to be trans is to express a gender that is different from assigned sex at birth. Nothing else is a requirement.

If your dysphoria isn’t as severe as other people’s, that makes you fortunate but not Not-Trans.
My first experience with the Bible was a couple days ago and wow if it didn't reinforce what I already know, and actually gave me a lot of comfort knowing that I wasn't alone in a couple of the rarer quirks I have. It's well written and very informative.

I guess that can't really mitigate your fears but 7 months in and it didn't change my mind at all! I'm 100% sure that since you've come this far you're trans no matter what anyone's literature says. <3 Don't sweat it, that thing is a gold mine of self love and a deeper understanding of what you're dealing with.
It strongly deepened my understanding of myself. I highly recommend it. There's no way you could think you're trans now, and that this would invalidate that.
The gender dysphoria bible isn't the end all be all.
It's simply a tool.

Also, if you're worried about not being trans enough or something. That would be a pretty strange worry for a cis person.
I havent read it due to being forgetful and lazy
Well, look. If you're already confident in your identity, there's no particular reason why you should *need* to read the GDB. Its main purpose, as far as I'm concerned, is to help people in the process of questioning their gender. If you're past that already, hey, good for you!

On the other hand, you might also find the GDB to be affirming AF.
When I discovered I was trans I was more afraid of going back to being cis while also being afraid of being trans. But really once I realized who I was I could see my self as cis any more. I have imposter syndrome and some days I wonder if I made it all up
You don't need gender dysphoria to be Trans anyways!
You won't. It's really built to do the opposite.
gender dysphoria is not a necessary part of being trans! if you’re happy with your body, that’s amazing!
If you want to be trans so badly that you fear it telling you that you aren’t, I think you can safely read it. Imposter syndrome is a thing that a lot to trans people work through. Society often teaches us to distrust our feelings of being trans and demands “proof”. The desire to be a different gender than you were assigned at birth is a sign of being trans.
If you are AFRAID of not being trans then that sounds like a very trans thing to say, I wouldn’t worry about it
I just read it the other day, and it only made me realize I'm MORE trans than o thought, and now I'm going to start HRT! Don't be afraid of it, friend, and feel free to send a DM if you need to discuss.
its probably already been said, but if youre afraid of not being trans, then youre trans
If at some point you feel like your experiences don't match with other trans peoples and you think you aren't trans or fear you're faking it, you aren't. Every experience is different, some people may have really bad bottom dysphoria, some not so much and that's fine. 
Also for the record it's only trans people who worry about faking it, if you were doing it for attention you wouldn't question that (It took me a while to realise that)
I was scared to read it and realize I WAS trans. I am and know better now. Food for thought, if you're worried about not being trans, there's a good chance you're trans :)
I never had dysphoria. That was one of the reasons for my imposter syndrome. 

It turned out that my driver was gender euphoria :)
reread it and I found out that I definetly do have dysphoria when I thought I didn't
If you’re scared that you might not be trans… you’re probably trans.
I literally just forced myself to read it upon reading your post. I felt the same. And I'm now crying at how it's confirming everything I've felt.. I'm sure it will be the same for you! Dive in, don't be scared xx
is it a good book? never heard of it
Fun fact: you don’t need dysphoria to be trans.
I know what you're going through and a little advise, cis people don't worry if their trans or not.
haha ha... yeah hun you're trans I promise /lh
fun fact: if you're scared of doing something because you think you'll realize you're not trans, you're probably trans
There is no bible lol. If you feel dysphoria then you feel dysphoria 🤷🏼‍♀️
Hey OP I had the exact same feeling and while I definitely still suffer all the imposter syndrome, I feel that once I read it I started seeing the dysphoria more in my life. Once I knew what it was that other trans people were experiencing, I started realising that I already was experiencing it in my life but I just didn't know.
I never heard of it, I'm old what can I say, but that feeling ""I am I really trans?"" Seems common in the trans people I know and I've had that feeling too. 

Early in my transition I broke it down into steps: I'm going to _____ (wear women's clothes, makeup, start facial hair removal, HRT, whatever) and see how I feel. If I didn't like it I could go back. I found I always felt better about myself, not worse I kept moving forward. By the time I got to the irreversible steps like coming out fully and surgery I knew who I was and what I wanted.

Eventually I found myself living physically, mentally, spiritually, legally as a woman. It's right for me but I many times thought ""I can't, I'm not, It's too hard, but that was fear talking.
My dms are open if needed
If you are you are, if you aren't, it's okay, we respect it, maybe you're other things in the LGBT+ community, it's all a question of self-knowledge🙂
There is a Gender Dysphoria Bible? I'm quite new so I don't know there was something like this. Where can I find it?
I struggle with the idea of worried I’m not being trans but you are who you are don’t worry about labels if you want to be trans your trans also gender euphoria is better then gender dysphoria if you feel good being a girl that’s what you like and no one can tell you otherwise
Dysphoria is not the basis for Trans.  It should be Euphoria. I am Happier now that I have transitioned. Before I was still ok.  We need to Normalize Gender Euphoria as the Basis for Transition.
I'm trans and didn't know there was a trans Bible.
Thinking you're trans but being afraid that you're not trans enough to transition is literally dysphoria.
Do it please
Hey, it doesn't matter if one book contradicts your experience, it's just the Gender Dysphoria Bible, it's not *gospel*.
The comments already made are pretty spot-on, so I'm not going to ""me too"" them. 

Instead, to your comment, "". . . I want to, but . . ."", I submit that willful ignorance has never provided meaningful answers. Not doing research because you're afraid of what you might discover doesn't help you find clarity.

Even if you *did* realize that you're not trans:

1. So what? You are who you are and having a label doesn't change that. 

2. Wouldn't you like to know one way or the other?
I'm coming up on a year on hormones, and like once a month I'll have this terrifying moment where I think, ""What if I'm faking it?"" From what I see online it's a pretty common fear. But imo, if you're scared that you're not ""really"" trans, I think it's safe to say that there's a good chance you're trans.
Not all trans people have dysphoria. I rarely have it and it’s rarely severe.
Cis people aren't scared that they might be cis.
[Rae] My tip is just don't read it. There's no required reading for being trans. 

I keep seeing people that read it and live by it gatekeeping other people from the community for not ""being dysphoric enough"" to be trans. Obviously reading it by itself won't make you that way but if you feel emotionally susceptible to what you read and think it'll make you feel invalid then just don't read it. There is NO guide to exactly what it means to be trans. If you feel like you are, you probably are. End of story.
there’s a… gender dysphoria bible?? what the heck am i missing out on here?
The way I like to look at it is like this, you probably wouldn’t feel like you where transgender if you weren’t. Hope this helps cause I know it definitely helped me
a random ass article cant decide who you are
I've never even heard of it.

The way you experience your dysphoria may be very unique, and imo, is very personal. Sure there are some common experiences we all share- but there are some things that may cause others terrible dysphoria that cause some none at all!

I'll use myself and a close friend of mine as examples. We are both trans men who come from an awkward generation where we didn't really know what being transgender was, or that it could even apply to ourselves - so neither of us knew we were trans until our twenties. However, we both experienced dysphoria as children and especially teens.

For me, i was so confused about why i never fit in with other girls, when role playing house type games with others i would often assume male roles, i was definitely a ""tomboy"". I thought i looked terrible with girly makeup on, and once puberty hit i start feeling super exposed in girls and women's clothing and felt super uncomfortable in swimsuits. I didn't even notice when my chest came in, found it annoying that it is there and gets in my way. I am almost completely comfortable with having female anatomy downstairs - except i really wish i had a penis and testicles. I have no issues with p in v intercourse with my partner.

My friend growing up was super into the music scene, his style often was punk and when emo came back he really got into that style. He was never super into girly styles either and mostly had punk style makeup. He had the same issue with swimsuit suits as I. We both also feel exposed or vulnerable because of our chests. For his anatomy however... It's not so much that he has an issue with having a v, but his dysphoria is so bad, that even before he knew he was trans- he has never been able to have a pap smear, and he literally can not be penetrated in any way with out excruciating pain because his muscles tense and lock up so bad.

Everyone's experience with dysphoria is different. You belong here. 💚
You don't need to read shit hun, all these bibles and manifestos are utter shite. You be you and don't let anyone but you change how you feel
Dysphoria doesn’t make you trans. Euphoria does.
the what
If you're feeling that, you're probably trans
Dont read it? You don't have to read it. Maybe it's a shit book. I haven't heard of it, but if it's making you upset, it doesn't sound like a book you need to read.
If your afrade your not trans, your probably trans
it will most probably just confirm that you're trans, it's great for cracking eggs
1. ask yourself why you’re scared of not being trans. 

2. i became free enough to allow myself to start hrt and actually transition once i accepted that i would never be satisfied with a logical summation of my identity. now that ive been on hrt for 18 months i think i understand why. so little of transness makes logical sense. its an inherently unique experience, no one person is trans the same way and there are infinite ways to be trans. if you try to reason your way to it, its possible you’ll never find an answer that satisfies you. i think if you take enough time to search your emotions and feelings, though, you might find a much more gratifying answer to questioning in general. 

be patient, be kind to yourself and trust yourself.
Cis folk aren't scared of realising they're cis, OP!
Wtf is the gender dysphoria bible and when the heck did this start lol
Where can one find the Gender Disphoria Bible? 🤔x
if ur scared that ur not trans, u most likely are trans.
Dont worry and give it a read. One section spells it out for us: trans is who identifyes as trans.
It is an increadible read and helped me through a lot. I whish you the very best.
I’m sorry the what?
Yo. Worrying about not being trans isn’t very cis. You’re probably overthinking, so read it if you want to!
I always think I’m faking it
That fear of being ""fake"" is probably as close as the trans community has to an admission stamp. Welcome aboard dear! We know you are who you say and feel you are!
What.
Honestly, I haven't read it either. Not out of anexity but simply cause ik who I am, and don't need a piece of text to explain that to me. Though I'm sure it's a great resource for those questioning their gender identity seeing as its presence seems seen as a mostly positive thing in various trans subreddits.
I have by no means gotten past the fear of being fake or invalid somehow, but I try really hard to take a deep breath and remind myself, EVEN if that is all true and somehow a wire or something in my brain got crossed for weeks/months/years, it's not like I'm hurting anyone? So I like presenting (in my case) as feminine and it tends to make me really happy when someone refers to me as girl, is that Really some Awful thing? I know its hard and I fuck up all the time, but remember you're okay :)
It says in the dysphoria bible that all you need is a “conviction and desire to be another gender” (paraphrased). If you want to be another gender than the one you were assigned at birth, you’re trans
I've seen some people talking about how it might push the idea that you need dysphoria to be trans, which isn't really true. It's a good resource,  but just like the other bible I'd take some stuff with a grain of salt.
I’ve never read it and I’ve been happily out for years.
Lots and lots of therapy to help us make heads and tails of what's what!!
Not all trans people experience gender dysphoria, I can use myself an example, the only dysphoria I really feel is being underweight and due to my metabolism being fast, but i have no issues with my genitals and chest
I-I didn’t even know there was a bible…
It's a really great read actually, it's helped me make a lot of connections from my past that points to the fact that I'm not cis. 

I've always found being over educated rather than uninformed is so much better.
If you feel like you're faking it, big chances are you're not faking it.
I'm transgender and I don't care if anyone says I'm not Trans enough.  I'm done with transphobic jerks.

I didn't even know there was such a thing and thank you this old girl is going to have to read it so I can put this old boy to rest lol
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
You don't need to be dysphoric to be trans. What you need in a sense of euphoria when you see yourself as the real you.
Hold up... There's a gender dysphoria Bible... Where the fuck has this been hiding from me and where do I read it?
Why wouldn't you want to find out your not trans? One of the biggest reasons my life has had such lows was because I'm trans, not being trans is a overall good thing.
I’m just a supportive mom (I identify as genderless and have a trans son) but my understanding is that it’s different for everyone. I’ve heard many trans people say they didn’t experience certain things others have while on their journey of self discovery. You can pick and choose what works for you.
Eh try not to worry about it too much. I get it quite often and here I am, still trans lol. Like another commenter pointed out, it’s called imposter syndrome and is actually quite common, especially in our community. But I’m gonna let you in on a little secret. A cis person doesn’t question their gender, and if they do they come to there conclusion that they aren’t trans rather quickly bc they don’t have the gender dysphoria that a lot of us have (not saying it’s required to be trans bc it’s not) and realize they’re comfortable with their assigned gender. For us it’s a bit different bc our brain is telling us what gender we are, but not the body so it creates a disconnect and that’s why we’re always struggling with the question “what if I’m faking it?” 

But my peace of advice is that if you feel like you’re faking it, you’re probably not.
Jeffrey marsh talks about this alot on their page. Id look them up on instagram if i were you. A brief summary of what i remember them saying is we spend so much time hearing from the outside world that we dont exist that trans isnt real that its boy or girl and ""are you sure?"" ""Maybe if you just..."" that its ingrained in our head that we may be fakeing.
Wait theres a bible? I have been out for like, 4 years now. Im gonna get top surgery this summer. Why did I never hear about this wtf lmao
You don’t need to read it. It’s okay.
Im constantly in a state 9f ""OH FUCK IM TRANS YAY"" ""OH FUCK DYSPHORIA "" ""OH FUCK IM FAKING IT""  ""OH FUCK IM FAKING IT AND HAVE DYSPHORIA ""
I remember this one time shortly after my egg cracked...I was doubting whether I'd be happy permanently changing my body, and I remember thinking ""well if I'm not actually trans, I'll probably figure out that these hormones aren't for me pretty quickly, and even if I end up discontinuing after a month or two, they'll still feminize my features a little bit, which would be nice,"" and it took me a couple seconds for what I had just thought to register. I was like, ""...wait, cis dudes don't want their features to be feminized, do they? Well, I guess that settles that.""

I had the biggest rush of euphoria, having realized that, without prompting, my brain had confirmed for me that I'm trans. I used that memory a lot when I would catch myself doubting in the months afterward as a way to reassure myself. Nowadays I just call up the old memory of how I used to look and shudder at the thought of ever having to be like that again.
>imposter syndrome

This is what keeps me from going to LBGTQ+ groups IRL, because I'd feel like I wouldn't be trans enough compared to everyone else. Especially since I'm still relatively early on and still figuring some things out.
all of that sounds pretty comforting to hear because it sounds exactly like what i'm going through. do you have a link to that exact book or the author because i'm very interested in reading it!
They are the norm tho lol
Thank you so much for this i thought i was the only one you just made my life a lot easier
Does the typical trans person know before 11?? I mean looking back there were ways I expressed it as a child, but I had no idea what being trans even was. I’m 25 now and my egg just cracked after questioning for about a year.
Reading this as someone who's questioning their gender, this really helps. I've only started questioning recently (at 18), so it feels like I'm starting too late compared to others. I'm usually too scared to bring it up to other trans people because I'm afraid their response would be ""*Well **I** knew since before **I** was conceived. Therefore, **you** can't be trans if **you're** only starting questioning at 18.*"" Even though I know that they'd probably be accepting, my brain chooses **always** chooses the worst possible option. Another thing is that if I were to bring it up to people, they'd probably be like ""But you showed no signs of wanting to be a girl when you were younger. So you can't want to be a girl now. That makes you a hypocrite."" OF COURSE I DIDN'T SHOW ANY SIGNS!! I THOUGHT I WAS A BOY GROWING UP, SO I'M NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT BEING A GIRL!! BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW!! (Apologies. I needed to get that off my chest.)

But, when it comes down to it, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about my gender. I don't feel any significant dysphoria from being called male, but I do feel slightly euphoric from being called female. Because of this, I feel like I'm bigender or genderfluid because I feel like I have to stay (partially) as male. If I go for trans girl, I feel like I'd regret transitioning. (I know I most likely won't, but there would probably be people telling me it's a sin; I'm destroying my body; God made me a boy for a reason, etc...) I feel like I can't be cis male because I've been questioning for 6 months, so I can't go back. All that time questioning, joining several trans-related subreddits, telling super close friends about it a complete >!fucking!< waste of time! And I can't go for non-binary because I hate using they/them.

And what's worse is that inside, I feel nothing (for the most part). I feel neutral towards most things because I'm afraid I'll pick the wrong option. And other times, I constantly ""change"" my views to match those of the room. To give an example, let's say there's **TV Show** and people say ""**TV Show** is great. It's the best!"", so I tend to agree. But other people would say ""**TV Show** has one episode where they say bad things about trans people, therefore it must be boycotted!"" And I'm like ""Oh. I guess I can't like this show now."" Even though I like the show, the transphobic thing is only in one episode. So I could probably avoid that one episode and enjoy the show as normal. But if I watch it, I'm scared that people will say that I'm transphobic for watching (and, by effect, supporting) **TV Show**, even though I like it for the characters and everything else. (Not specifying any particular **TV Show**.) (*cough* >!Futurama!< *cough*)

That's how I feel about my gender (or more specifically, being cis or trans). If I go for cis, I'm invalidating trans people by thinking I'm one of them when I'm not. If I go for trans, I'm a horrible person for having the **audacity** to want to be a different gender. (>!Courtesy of my brain!<)


I know these are completely irrational thoughts to have and that I'm overthinking everything, but I physically cannot arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. Even though I have plently of reasons to believe that I'm trans, but my brain hasn't accepted that yet. But if I say I'm cis, my brain is like ""no you ain't!""

The truth is, I don't know who I am. And I know people will say I'll figure out with time. HOW MUCH TIME?! Am I just wasting time contemplating or am I just stalling the inevitable? I don't know.

Like I said before, I feel neutral towards most things. And my gender identity is one of them. I feel like no matter which one I pick, I'm going to be wrong.

If I ever do figure out my true identity, I know I'm going to be happy with it. But right now, everything feels wrong.

As someone else pointed out: they also have a good section on imposter syndrome. I linked it if you think that might be an easier starting point.
Mine goes away when I get a haircut because I’m reminded just how bad it makes me feel.
Same. I got about 1/3rd the way through reading it and it felt like someone slapped me in the back of the head. I was literally dizzy.
I was reading through it and some of the anecdotes looked like they were copied from my thoughts. It was seriously uncanny and I had no idea previously that others tried the same coping mechanisms that I had.
[The Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi)
Is this always the case?
Honestly really need to read something like this thank you. That stupid ""Bible"" has me questioning my journey.
This comment is so adorable 😍 I feel u gurl fuck the pp lol
[The Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi)
Also its extremely ok if you figure out that a different identity or self conception works better in the future. Self discovery is an ongoing process so take your time!
VPN?
Did you really have to describe my life
This is exactly why I'm so scared of faking it, because I would still have to deal with the disphoria lmao. Yeah I know, it doesn't make sense.
I'm constantly in ""oh okay I'm trans, cool"" and then like 3 minutes later I'm having a panic attack cause ""what if I'm wrong and I'm faking it all""
SaMe here
Feel called out lol
Huh that's crazy i remember the day i discovered trangender  stuffs and all that i had abreak down in my class it was a crazy experience  but rarely do i have that thought, i most i get thoughts of my weight or if i look too masculine
personal attack frfr
How i respond to hormones is also a plan for ke ^^;
Tbh that really sucks and isn’t the correct way to think about it but a lot of the older lgbt ppl seem to like to gatekeep and Burn ppls patches so it might be a good idea to stick to the online groups unless u live in a super progressive area
sure thing. here ye go: [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)
Know what? That's the question. People who are brought up in the right environment probably do figure it out by 11. But if a person is bright up in an environment where they don't get exposure to stories of trans experience or they grow without a community that welcomes gender exploration, it might take them a long time to realize that they're trans. 

A lot of trans people probably know most of their lives that they are experiencing some sort of discomfort with their assigned gender or affinity for a gender other than their AGAB. How their discomfort or affinity gets interpreted varies wildly. 

Trans children brought up in very conservative households don't have any idea what ""transgender"" means, and they may end up seeing themselves as deviants and perverts. 

Trans children in more liberal families may interpret their feelings to mean that they're feminine men or masculine women. While gender variance might be allowed, if they don't get exposure to trans experiences, they may not understand that other feminine men still want to be men, and that feminine ""men"" who desperately want to be women are actually trans women. 

So, I don't know what the averages are, but the variance on the age at which one figure out that one is trans is enormous, stretching from 5 to 75. I think that whether one figures it out depends less on what one experiences and more on how much one is exposed to trans experiences and narratives. You can't identify with a group if you don't understand the group. Once one gets over the stigma of transness and understand what it is, it's pretty straightforward to figure out if that describes you.
Well, I meant more that I knew I wanted to be a girl by 11. Actually understanding that I had dysphoria and was trans took until I was 19, because I wasn't educated about LGBTQ+ issues. This is why education is so important — it would have saved people like you and me a lot of pain.
Here are a few reactions to things you wrote here, in one post. Your experiences really sound a lot like mine. So I thought I would add my thoughts here to yours. Everything is in love <3 (so if something seems negative or invalidating, that isn't my intention)

> so it feels like I'm starting too late compared to others

Took me more than 40 years to realize that I was trans. I kinda got part of the way there when I was 20, when I accepted I was never going to be a ""normal"" man, a ""man's man"", but it took another 20 years to get to a place of understanding myself. It is never too late.

> But you showed no signs of wanting to be a girl ~~when you were younger~~ for the past 16 years of marriage.

I've heard this bit said to me before, not in an invalidating way, but it still felt out of left field for her.

It wasn't until _after_ I accepted myself that I could start seeing a tiny thread woven thru my life, things that make more sense now. I really don't remember my childhood, so I couldn't say one way or another if I felt like a girl back then. Only my mom said, ""Oh, I think I can see that."" Everybody else in my life was ""Wot?""

> I don't feel any significant dysphoria from being called male, but I do feel slightly euphoric from being called female. 

I've been right there. Masculine references to me aren't horrible, they are a little more grating now that I have come out, but it isn't like hitting my thumb with a hammer every time I hear it.

Not liking they/them doesn't mean you aren't nonbinary, you can be nonbinary and still use he/him or she/her. (BTW, I am enamored with ze/zir pronouns, nobody ever uses them tho :|) Bigender/Genderfluid/Genderqueer/etc typically falls under the nonbinary label anyway.

One thing that helps to understand is you have your gender identity (what you feel inside) and gender expression (how you express yourself to the outside world) ~ these don't have to match. _Nobody_ can tell you that your identity is or isn't something. They have on perspective on your internal state. Only you can say what is inside (it is also usually more complicated than just a one or two word label). Pronouns and such kinda go with expression in a way, you get to choose what feels best for you to use and express - they do not inform your identity. If anything, it is your identity that informs or influences your expression - that isn't a hard and fast rule tho.

> God made me ...

And for the whole religious side. People who don't bat an eye at the trinity, the 3-in-1 god that is taught. How these people cannot also understand that more than the binary exists (or trans), they teach ""we are created in God's image"" - well, by that logic, nonbinary and general queerness of gender fits right into that. Religious people have been wrong before, these people are wrong now.

> TV Show has one episode where they say bad things about trans people, therefore it must be boycotted!

This bit gets a little dicey. I approach it from a perspective of harm reduction. Society isn't kind to ideas/people/etc that are outside the normal part of the bell curve (using the mathematical definition of normal here). Take harry potter here, JK is actively causing harm (and doubling down on it) to the community. HP is comforting to me, I haven't abandoned it, but not a single cent of my money will ever make it back to JK again (i.e. no new movie, no streaming the movies (I have the DVDs), no official/licensed merchandise, etc). You do what you can with the tools that you have to reduce harm (and with capitalism, there is no such thing as ethical consumption anyway, there is always harm somewhere. The best we can do is to do our best to reduce harm to other people thru our actions) There is also a difference between a dead problematic author/artist and an artist who is presently and actively causing harm.

I kinda have a theory that a lot of people's fiery attitudes regarding these things are reactions from trauma (or trauma from societal conditioning / being outside societal norms). It is just easier to express that feeling thru an action/words like a boycott (and judging those who don't follow).

> I feel nothing (for the most part)...

For me, this was how my dysphoria presented itself. My coping mechanisms were definitely were to ignore and numb those parts of myself. It is currently causing me problems, I feel like I'm a demi-girl, mostly femme, but with some agender or other form on nonbinary as the rest. But I am unable to tease out if I'm agender/enby or if I'm just seeing coping mechanisms still in ""muscle memory"". I also know this was partly due to my subconcious protecting me: if I had realized I was trans when I was 20 (I kinda got part of the way there, just accepting I was never going to be ""a man's man"", I was just weird) I would have been in conversion therapy, most likely voluntarily, and knowing myself, if I had gone thru that, there is a high probability I wouldn't have made it to the age I am now.

> I know these are completely irrational thoughts to have and that I'm overthinking everything

These are not irrational thoughts, they are valid thoughts that need to be worked thru (or abandoned). They are rooted in some knowledge, some of which may be incorrect. Some are rooted in trauma, internalized transphobia and general societal conditioning. You aren't overthinking everything, you are just experiencing a lot of challenged ""knowledge"" and assumptions; which requires a lot of thinking and working thru things.

---

You are valid, your thoughts and experiences are probably familiar with several other people (I mean, **_I_** relate with almost everything you said, having similar thoughts, similar things to work thru and figure out). You can reach out to me via DM if you want. Or find me on twitter with the same name.

(if I may) _\*hugs\*_ <3
How much time? As much time as your brain needs. You can try to push it but it's all up to you.  
My internal monologue for decades was that I wasn't trans \*yet\* - meaning that I wasn't ready to deal with those feelings yet and the inevitable follow up.  
For decades I identified just as ""not male"". I wasn't willing to choose because I didn't know what feeling like a girl felt like, so how could I say that's how I felt? It was only after I started trying to present femme that it clicked how right it felt. My thought was literally ""Oh, is this how cis people feel from the start? They actually like their bodies?""
Thank you ❤️
Tony Robbins just did a training on imposter syndrome. “It isn’t real it’s just some fear you’re having there “ 

Biggest thought bomb of the day.
Thanks for the link! 😍🌹
Never heard of it
You are doing God's work, friend.
Nothing is ever 100% and there isn't one easy answer that will tell you, that you are trans or not. But cis people absolutely do not worry about not being transgender. Why would they? To a cis person, identifying as trans has exactly zero benefits. Why would you worry about not being trans? Probably because you desire many aspects that would come with it, which is a decent indicator.
If you want a bible... go join a cult... uf you wanna be a girl and was sadly born with... uh... a memeber... that means youre trans ~w~
straight up call out lmao
Lol
Didn’t expect to get called out today lol
For me a fair part of it is that id feel bqd about all yhe support and having to undo all the social stuff
And then later that night ""Fuck i wish i had boobs""
I am not alone it seems
Ha yes
I get those too yeah
Oh hi me
I live in what is generally seen as a very progressive city (especially by American standards). The problem I think is largely in my head because I'm relatively new to this and haven't started (socially) transitioning yet so I'm largely boymoding it for now (except when I'n at home).
thank you so much!
Do you have the link to the like...hrt bible?.I can't find it again
*opens link*

*sees pre-transition woman is wearing slacks and a Hawaiian shirt*

HOW HAVE I BEEN CALLED OUT THIS MANY TIMES IN ONE THREAD
Can confirm. I always had thoughts about being male, and often tried to mimic things my brother did, but because I never heard of trans people, I assumed that it didn't really mean anything. Looking back now, it's clear I suffered from dysphoria from a young age, but the idea that you are born your gender and nothing can change that was so infused into me that it wasn't until I was 14 and stumbled across a trans YouTuber that I thought, for the first time in my life, ""oh, is this what I've been feeling and is that why I'm feeling that way?""
Ah I see. Yeah education could have really changed things for me as well. I didn’t exactly know I wanted to be a girl, just that I didn’t like being a guy.
Hearing that you feel the same way as I do is realy validating. I just assumed I couldn't be trans because my experiences don't match exactly with most people's.

Also apologies for the **TV Show** paragraph. I was just ranting at this point.

To be honest, I was coming up with this entire thing off the cuff. Just thoughts spilling out one after the other.

Thank you for taking time to read my comment. :)

>(if I may) *hugs* <3

*hugs back* :)
Mia gang
Now you have! It’s a good read.
I don’t know, it seems like a dangerous overgeneralization to me. A cis person that somehow started down a trans or non-binary path would absolutely end of feeling that they’re somehow not trans and it would be in their best interest to question the steps they’ve taken so far. 

Thanks for your explanation though, I understand your perspective now.
Yep pretty much this
Questioning people deserve support too. I'm more than happy to support someone in finding out more about their identity.
Literally my fears exactly. I want to come out and/or experiment with different clothes/pronouns/names/identities but I am so scared that it might not fit and I will be wrong about mtself and will have to express that to other’s aswell.
> Also apologies for the TV Show paragraph

No apologies needed.

One thing to remember about social media, you are only seeing a small fraction of what an algorithm thinks you want to see. Another thing to remember is social circles has a lot of influence on the different things you see and hear about other people. A 15 year old today has a _very_ different trans experience than a 15 year old 10 years ago. As well as a 15 yro today who is in a conservative christian bubble vs a 15 yro today in a well educated liberal area. The ideas and stories these people experience are all very different, which directly affect what possibilities you know about.

It took me getting out of a conservative christian bubble to fully realize that other people like me existed and that the transgender experience is _extremely_ diverse.

It definitely is a generalisation and shouldn't be your only basis to judge, whether you are trans or not. And yes, I do think that sunken cost fallacy could definitely be an issue. Once you've taken some bigger steps, it's definitely scary to think about whether they were a mistake or not. 

I still believe that its a good indicator, but I agree with you, that one should ALWAYS question what they are doing and not avoid asking some difficult questions, no matter how anxious it makes you.
Oh yeah, but as the one in question id still feel a bit bqd and like i was leading people on
Mhm
Cheers, thanks for the discussion.
That's valid. Personally I don't think it's a big deal to try out new names and identities but I know I'd feel bad too if I had to go around and tell certain people that I was wrong about being trans."	sh0evk	trans	1018	0.99	2022-01-31 12:44:26
she has the gall to say this to me	My entire life has been a living hell because of my family my father has tortured me my sisters have treated me like dirt I've literally not even been treated like a human a good chunk of my childhood and she has a gall to say this to me today	"Have you committed just for being yourself? That's absolutely awful. How could someone say that?
I honestly don't know what to say, that sound horrible and her reaction was uncalled for. If I could give you a hug while you cry it out I would but instead I'll send you air hugs.
My ""mother"" is also a mean, rude ass for no reason just know you ain't alone
My mom lamented to me that she couldn’t send me to conversion therapy (I was 31). I feel you here.
My mom also has these “all or nothing” replies where I’m trying to express and connect and cry and all she can feel is attacked and go “I’m sorry I wasn’t good enough, but I did my best!” and also “yes I had to live crisis to crisis, and thank you for not being the crisis” like, damn. Shit’s fucked up.

She doesn’t know what to do when facing your hurt and anger. She doesn’t know how to show you empathy, kindness, and care. So she just jumps to the radical thing.

I’m so fucking sorry. 💙🫂
It’s weird phrasing, but I think she’s saying ‘make you a ward of the state’ rather than ‘put you in a mental facility’. 

So, ‘if you don’t like it here so much then I guess if you’re in foster care you can live somewhere else’. 

Not great! But differently bad, I think. 

I’m sorry you’re not getting the support you need at home. Do you have any other adults in your life right now  that you can talk to, or who you might be able to stay with?
She's not suggesting having you committed (to an institution).

She's suggesting giving up her parenting rights so you can be placed in foster care and become a ward of the state. 

Have you told her what you need her to do for you? She sounds confused. She even says this is a problem she can't handle. 

Just ask her to accept you and love you, and tell her she can start by helping you. I don't know what your goals are but it sounds like neither does she. 

Continually bringing up the past isn't going to help either of you move forward into the future.
OMG! What a cruel thing to say to her own child. :(

May I adopt you? <3
Ouch, I'm sorry to see this. My family doesn't support me either. I wish you the best and hope you are/get in a safe environment where you are loved and protected for who you are and not how someone else demands you meet their expectations.
Why keep contact with her when this is the way she treats you?
I’m no contact with my crazy parents.  I recommend it. I’m much happier.
Even without any punctuation, I can tell that conversation is fucked. Stay strong 💕
It is very sad to realize that you don’t have parents. You are an orphan. 
Be astute, strategic.
That family is very toxic. Find a way to get away from them,  go no contact.  Get therapy for narcissistic abuse . 👻
I'm sorry, I love you, you're amazing and fantastic 🥺
This got me crying. I truly feel sorry for you.
A patent that sees a child as a burden rather than a blessing is a child themselves.

She is weak, selfish, and short sighted.

What do you say to someone so vapid.
😢
I’d say don’t waste time or effort on her, it’s not worth it. If she ever needs your help just be busy doing something, literally anything else. Block her. Ya know that’s my advice.
i think theres a lot of context missing here.
[deleted]
I am so sorry. That is horrrible. Sorry to say but mom needs to have those blinders taken off.
I’m sorry, fren.
If you are under 18, your parents have the right to parent you and have you live by the rules under there house. If you don’t like the rules, you can leave, although it will be hard and difficult road. Accepting that your child is transgender takes time, it often doesn’t happen right away. It could take years, and even longer if there is unresolved issues or tension in the communication between you and your family. I’m sorry your going through this, but it’s a normal part that comes with being trans.
I’d recommend waiting til can move out sometimes u might have to wait but it’ll be worth it I’m sorry ur going through this
That’s fucking disgusting. Show her how much better you are without her…
I'm sorry you have to go through this I'm 37 and I'm getting ready to come out to my family as trans and I'm scared shitless.
But if they can't love me as I'm meant to be, then that's their choice.
No matter what, it's time that I did something for myself that is good and true. I'm tired of living a life that is what everyone else wants, I'm done living a farce.
Hold true to what you need to do.
My upbringing was really rough with my family as well. A lot of abuse, but I reconciled with them and have a good relationship now. If they want to throw all that work away because I need to be their daughter and sister now, then that's their choice.
We can only control our own actions and what we choose to do, we can't control anything else, remember that.
Sometimes the one we have to be the most strong for us ourselves.
I hope things work out for you ❤️
I’m sorry. You deserve so much more, so much better - to have a family that loves, accepts and celebrates you.
I'm so glad I'm an adult and not at the mercy of my mom.

I hope things turn in your favor soon.
I agree that you have every right to angry but I don't agree with the behavior I'm seeing from both parties
I'm so sorry. We are here for you and there are lots of us who are happy for you and will support you.
The state would've been better at parenting and raising you than these people are.
My mom told me that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for her and I was indebted to her (I've had a couple of brain surgeries done to me). Basically she was indirectly telling me, ""If I had known I wouldn't have"". I replied I'd be glad if she could come over and take my life. So yeah I get how you feel.
Babe I’m the same with my family. They completely disowned me 6 months ago and they blocked me everywhere and now I can’t get hold of them. Basically I don’t have family or friends, is a good job that Deejaying is keeping me alive and sane. To be fair I’m happier being on my own and nobody will bother me anymore, peaceful life, I feel sorry for how family is treating you. Best options be by yourself and find any transgender people around you, gay or bi people who’ll support you more then anyone else. Im just talking from experience. You can talk to me at any time babe. I can help if you like 😘 ❤️
I am speechless. WHAT?
But my mom’s also rude to me. So you’re not alone.
I’m actually taking this a whole other way… and it’s also not good. What I’m reading is “you’re making a big deal out of something and I don’t want to do anything about it. Therefore I will threaten to say there is worse out there and therefore you should deal with it” along with that I believe it’s also meant to make you feel it could be worse so I am the problem and op, do not let her do this to you. She has neglected to be a mother if this is her response and don’t even get me started on your father. I am so sorry they are treating you awful! I hope you can get out safe and better off then you are now! I really wish you happiness!
Yup my parents were pretty stupid too... my dad said I was mentally messed up and my mom said that devil is causing me to be lustful ... lol I don't blame them though ... it is the way they learned through their experience of life ... though that won't stop me from being me and loving myself ... I know I'm okay and I know what I love and my experience in my life will not be ran by fear and negativity of things that I really don't understand. I choose to live life through the lense of possibilities and love for myself and those around me. ✨️
I’m so sorry your mom doesn’t accept you for who you are. You deserve better than that! Parents are supposed to give their kids UNCONDITIONAL love and support. That’s means no conditions. I’m a mom and it just blows my mind that parents can be like this. You are perfect and wonderful the way you are! Don’t let anyone take away your inner peace and make you feel less than. If your mother won’t say it I will. I’m proud of you for having the courage to completely be yourself and express who you are in this world that can sometimes be full of ignorant people afraid of their own shadows.
Exactly I'm happier and healthier than ever before the simple fact she says this is so disturbing I've been even helping her get to the hospital a few times a month recently because of a arm surgery and minute she's back to stable she back to being like this
I really don't think that's what she means sweetie I'm 30 I live Cities away from her she kicked me out back in December for being trans starting this whole motion that's led to my current events
I'm not a teenager living under her I'm 30 living with roommates cities away
I need a friend too, please? 🥺
Because I'm pretty alone now I lost my entire family both sides my dad went out of his way trying to convince everyone to stop talking to me my mother is the only one who even slightly talks to me
Parents don’t deserve kindness for simply being your parent. If your parent if a transphobic POS, you have every right to treat them like one, and potentially cut them out of your life.
They are a grown adult with their own place
I did move out of my mom's house sadly ended up in a similar situation now because my roommate is saying I'm a sin just being alive 

Alot of fun stuff happening now doing the best I can though
That’s even more awful. If you ever need to bend an ear, my dms are open
Don’t help her anymore
Well then godspeed to her crazy ass trying to have you committed. I wonder how that conversation would go lmao
Of course honey <3
Your best bet is to make new family and leave that one behind

Granted I'm in that same boat and I haven't taken my own advice yet...
can you contact some local LGBT or Trans groups and get help finding a new place to live?  I wouldn't do well living with someone who felt like your roommate did.

you deserve better... i hope you can quickly find a new situation...
I'm pretty sure she can't even try but it just is so bullshit to me considering what I have done for her recently and how I've been acting towards her considering her injuries and I've been doing everything I can to help her even going over to her house and cooking for her and the minute she got her surgery in the minute she's back on track she starts treating me like dirt again
Yeah thats terrible. I'm so so sorry. Its not your fault though, you've done everything you can to be there and be loving. She's made her choice of what's important to her and what she wants. You now know that she'd rather have you out of her life entirely than change to be more accepting and helpful in your journey. Its up to you what you do with that information. No matter what, we in the community will always have your back. Stay strong ❤

Melody is awesome, I really hope she has a good day.
Ok melody if you call me felice I’ll gladly call you melody
Very hectic horrible situation at camp we are going through a lot as lgbtiq refugees
Melody honey you have an amazing name. Dysphoria, come on, how can something with such an ugly sounding name have the best on a girl who wears the name Melody with such pride and elegance? My dearest Melody you are your name you are a melody that never ever deserved to be broken.
No problem melody
You got it Melody! My that's a pretty name.
Hiya Melody :)) Hope you’re having a wonderful day :))
Sure thing, Melody! Dysphoria may be a bitch sometimes, but we're here for you. You're doing great- keep it up! <3
Oh my, Melody is a gorgeous name.
Hi Melody I’m layla! Your name is pretty I like it! <3
Hey Melody! Hope you have a wonderful week! 😊
Melody is a very pretty name. I hope she feels better soon!
Melody
Hallo melody when did you discover you where trans
yooo, Melody, that's such a cool name! it reminds me of that one Mario Kart track with all the sounds and pretty colours /pos
Hi melody!
Hey did you guys see melody today. I love her outfit she always looks so pretty. I hope she has a brilliant day and that we all help her to feel more comfortable and happy with herself.
You can inbox me for more detailed information about us thank you in anticipation.
Hi melody, I love your name
Hai Melody 🎶 (;
Allow me to introduce y’all to Melody. She’s a great chum of mine, I think you’d like to be her friend as well
Hiya Melody!! <3
I’ve actually been thinking about Melody as a name lately, it’s beautiful on you for sure 💕 keep it up girl
I really like your name Melody!
melody you have such a pretty name. a pretty name for a pretty girl :3
a super cute name for a super cute girl. i thought of going with that name before i settled. hope you feel a little better, melody <3
Hello melody, you are a wonderful and beautiful woman 😘
Melody is really cool!! She is valid and awesome !!!
hey, Melody!
Good afternoon, and welcome Melody
That’s an adorable name, Melody. If I ever change my name I’ll be taking notes lol
People like my friend  Melody are a rare treasure. Kind just because it feels right, with no though of personal gain other than the knowledge they made your life better, even if only for a moment. Why anyone would give her a hard time is something I just can't understand.

Ps: You've got this. I believe in you :)
Trans people are just regular people with better names. Melody is such a lovely name
Hey Melody, do you want to be friends?
Melody is such a pretty name 🥺
Hello sequence of single notes that is musically satisfying :D 
All jokes aside, ""Melody"" is a very melodic name ;)
Shawty's like a Melody
Hey, Melody. I hope you feel better soon. You are a beautiful woman.
Hey Melody, how are you?
Melody is a cute name for a cute girl like yourself \^w\^
Hey Melody, guess what! I once had a friend named Melody in school! :)
Go kick some ass, Melody!!
That sounds like quite a Melodious name :) 
In all seriousness, that a cool and sweet name
Hi melody! I'm lilac!! My pronouns are she/they :] I hope you feel better!
!!ATTENTION EVERYONE!!


Have you heard about Melody?!?! I heard she's really beautiful and equally as smart🤩

I wish I could be like her 🥰
Aw! Melody is my daughter's name! Hi, Melody!🥰
Hi Melody how are you?

hi melody!! i love your name! it’s so pretty :) sending you lots of hugs!!
I love your name Melody!
Hey Melody, I hope you have a lovely day! I love your name it's so pretty 🥰
Hope you're having a great day Melody, are you up to much, girlie? My day has been pretty productive.  Dishes, cleaning up, then food shopping. Now finally hunkering down with some video games while a ham is cooking.
Hellooooooo Melody!
Hey I heard melody is the nicest and most beautiful woman ever.
Maybe this isnt relevant, but I love that Name.
Man that one girl Melody, I hear she's the coolest chicken around and she's so funny!
(Also Melody is my sisters name, so ima assume you're just as beautiful as her)
<3
Melody is a beautiful name. You got it!
Hi melody ^^ Nice to meet you!
Hey Melody~ ☺️
No, melody I will NOT call you your preferred name. Jeez, can you get a load of this girl?
I'm sorry to hear that disphoria is getting you down Melody. It seems that a lot of people are really having a hard time with this lately...
Melody, if you're ever feeling down and need someone to talk to, I'm pretty active here. Just send me a DM and I'll talk with you shortly. That also goes to anyone that is within the LGTBQ+ community. We need to really start supporting each other. We also need to all understand that everyone develops and learns in different ways and different speeds. Non of us are always doing everything correctly with everyone. How could we? Everyone is different and has different comfort levels. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. It just means that instead of assuming something about someone, maybe we should ask them to tell us who they are and what they are and are not comfortable talking about or being referred to. It just requires a little thought and compassion. That's all.
Melody you’re doing great sis keep it up
Hi Melody! That’s a nice name.  Anything on your mind 
.  Mature kinky fuck here. Happy to help.
Hi, Melody! I hope you feel better because you absolutely deserve it /gen
Melody you look so beautiful today. 😊🥰
God, i meet Melody today. She's so pretty, funny and smart! Really, i love her smile and face so much! Her voice is so pretty! Oh, and she have a really cool and unique sence of style!
Ok melody everything is going to be okay
hi melody, you've got a lovely name
Hi Melody! Did you watch the new batman movie ?
Always Melody!
It's nice to meet you Melody! You have a beautiful name :D
Hello melody!! How is your day going so far girl? :D
 Melody are you squad jacob or squad Edward?
Shawty like a melody in my head-  
/j
Sure, Melody. Which is, by the way, a very pretty name.
As someone who is gonna change her name to Elodie I love your name Melody.
Just wondering how you're doing Melody. Hope all is well
Woah, my name is Melody, too. I think it's a beautiful name, so you should be proud of yourself.
Hang in there Melody ❤
hey Melody where are your melodies?
slay yaaass queen
Hello, Melody! Your name is very pretty, I'm sure it suits you
I'm in a small town in Colorado. Ppl just don't get it here. None of my pharmacys will do it. Unlike in Michigan.
Hello Melody!👋

guy 2 : 'ye mate i hear you but actually no, you have 0 musical culture'

sorry to hear that :(
hello! 👋
Nah they're thinking about the same Melody as you, you two are just out of tune
Every single Melody I've ever met is very pretty. It's practically a law of the universe.
I am almost certain she was talking about u/mel_likes_things. She a bad bitch
hello :)
I'm doing good! Quite sleepy since it's 3am where I live 😅
Now that is relatable
Haha I feel that. I think You seem like a nice person to be around introvert or not :))
Normal people don't pick names.
idkkk 😭
I heard she likes stuff too!
:) just telling you the truth.
Yw💕
do it!! 💛✨🐝
What is the other half of your flag? I see transgender, what is the other half?
It is indeed preposterous lol but the women who I was referring to is a very brave and kind person, who can do almost anything. And I feel that correlates to you and every trans person in this world.
Of course, darling! 💗
You are very welcome. My dysphoria has been pretty bad too and it sucks. I hope this thread helped a little. Have a good night, Melody.
ty and hello! i hope you have a nice day as well :)
Truly. I hope you start feeling better soon!
I’m Eva btw, how are you
Same lol
*flicks wrist back*
Thanks, yours is beautiful!
*hugs*
So many typos sorry
That's cool Melody I also really like music and I've been growing a lot of plants recently :D
Of course! I hope you get to feeling as awesome as you deserve, my friend! 💕
<3
Because its some deep shit Melody! And its mega allegorical to this whole…process, yknow? This is your anthem, girl. 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
You’re welcome, Melody!
You cant go wrong with a good open world game :-D
Well too bad, I stole the name first [insert evil laugh]
Now you have two friends with that name! :P And thank you :)
your welcome
That’s awesome to hear :)
No problem! I'll go check that song out! :)
Ty! I like yours too

Like it still hits me sometimes than I'm on hrt and like doin the dayum thing and I just wanna weep happy tears hehe :D hang in there bestie! I promise ya! Things will get better soon! Just keep on keeping on <3
You're welcome.
You're welcome, I hope you have a wonderful life.
Nice to meet you here 😊
how are things?
We do be women doe
so Melody, how are u? ur dysphoria any better?
HI!
Thank you!


It stems from my deadname and I think it fits me a lot better than the name I was assigned at birth.

Melody is super cool too!
Any reason why you picked it or just because?
Lol
I only play piano but I love music! I love your name!
Good girl. I'm proud of you for trying so hard. I hope it gets easier soon
no worries, you go girl!
we got u sis 🥰
I hope you're doing well, Melody!

That's a nice name, btw.
haha that means song. I think you've already known that. ( sorry my fault, it's meaning instead of story)
It's going alright! (: how'd you come up with your name?
Welcome \^0\^
I’m from Nova Scotia Canada, you?
it's funny because i was born in April lol. that's good and i'm also well myself
<3
The meal was delicious. That Melody is hard on herself but when it came to it she made a lovely meal.
Nice to meet you melody
Absolutly any time.
Ofc :)) I’m glad
Yeah! I love that song XD, may have been some accidental inspiration for my name there honestly lol
That's cool!
What do you think about letting people use Mel for short?
You're welcome!
Comedy genius
Always
I’m okay, tired from a long day.
Yw! \^w\^
im doing swell, you've got a beautiful name!
ofcc <33
Omg I just saw your user name, Mel is an absolutely amazing short name! :D
You’re welcome melody. Girls gotta support each other.
Oh, np! ^^
It is my goal, and to me my duty, to promote kindness and positivity wherever I go. There is already enough negative in the world. I like to encourage people to do better and be better. In most cases it's not even hard to do. I just don't know how to teach someone to care. They either do, or they don't. That doesn't mean I don't try to help people, it just means that once I figure out they don't care enough to care, I don't waste my time. I offer to help anyone with advice or someone people can vent to. Beyond that, they have to be specific about what they want help with. I'm not in the habit of trying to get anyone to do something they don't want to do, and neither should anyone else. If you look at things I've posted, you'll see that I do this kind of thing pretty frequently. Thanks for responding. 😁
You bet!
I’ve seen it twice now and I’d definitely recommend it! Big trans energy in it (coming from a trans dude) in a way I can’t describe but it’s definitely there 🧐
>:)

:)
<3
Thanks Melody.. 

It's def different here.
You just 'beat' me to it
comedic genius
Haha I see what you did there, nice pun

Yeah I am almost asleep, I just wanted to ask for something here but I realized it doesn't respect the rules of the sub 😅, I will just sleep it off and maybe try with a different wording tomorrow
Ofc ofc :D
I don’t know. It’s very frustrating. I just want my outside to match my inside.
ooooh fun! i want to paint mine but lucky me, i'm a *really* bad nail biter XD
Thank youuu. I’m okay, I failed at practicing for my drivers test tho :(
Based
Fair enough Melody, I'm also not a fan of dirt so I typically grow them indoor if ur interested in growing plants u could look into succulents (they're really hard to kill😌👌)
Ugh, look at this nerd 🤓 😘
same here, bit disphoric
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!
It sounds very fitting. Any artists you're into in particular or any specific style?
That's pretty freaking smart lol
early

*i also just realized it's not even 2 days away*

and ty!
It will be for I will make it so.
Yayyy! It’s seems like everyone likes it :D
aw damn that sucks, i hope you get answers to your question though :)
preach! 🙌
Yea it was :) oh no fr?! I have that problem too.. but I try to control it to have long nails
aw nooo :(  


i'm horrified to drive, what's it like?
yes
thanks for the suggestion, if i ever try it i'll keep that in mind! :)
🤭

✋ present
we can do this! brains are so dumb sometimes i swear-
peak gay 👌
peak intelligence B)
lol ik the feeling, birthdays are weird x-x
love that mindset <3
:D
yeah it's both good (i play a lot of string instruments, and short nails are very helpful in that scenario) and bad (cuz i can't paint them properly)
Eh, (luckily the driver was super nice by the way)
To be honest it’s a little overrated, it’s stressful, repetitive, energy consuming and < insert 40 minute rant about car Dependency and suburbia>
No problem Melody :))
Well I'm glad if I could bring a smile, the world needs more of those and I'm sure you're quite cute with one
truueee
That is the best compliment i have ever been given
Then you do it as well Melody.
:D have you had a good day then?
I guess it has its ups and downs xD  You could just paint you short nails they would look cute still😄
yeah it's definitely important, much to my chagrin
aww you're so nice, ty very much :)
<3
i can tryyy
uhh it's still quite early in the morning, but it's been nice so far
i definitely could, but ideally i want to grow them out a bit lol
Depends on where you live I’d say, if you live in a place that was designed somewhat well and Transit options and walk ability exist then answer then you don’t need to drive, I hope to live in a city like that as they get older especially since I’m blind as a bat and arguably not drive
=)
I believe in you.
Yayyyy! That’s good to know!
i can't see either lol, my eyes went from working to... \*not\* working in about two years. but yes even if i do get a license i'd probably try and find a way to take public transportation if i could
thank you :)

Am I in the wrong?	"UPDATE: well guys I was right that I might not get therapy if I told. I told my psychiatrist and she thought she was bad too. And told my mom but my mom decided to tell my therapist everything I said about her. And my therapist kept going on and on about how manipulative I am. And how she doesn’t want to work with me but she has bc I have attachment issues. My mom just came into my room today and told me I can’t get another therapist. I asked why and she gave me a bs answer. I can’t wait to get the hell out of this house




So today in therapy I started talking about me being transmasc n stuff. And she started to mention that people that undergo hormones and surgery become more suicidal than when they didn’t do that. I told her I don’t think that’s true Bc a lot of trans people are more suicidal if they don’t get confirmation surgery. But she didn’t listen. Then I was talking about how I don’t see me in the mirror and then she said “you’re beautiful” then I told her I don’t like that word but she still called me beautiful again. Then she was talking about a kid around my age than underwent confirmation surgery and now they running around saying they want commit on tiktok Bc they had the surgery( I don’t think that’s true Bc I think somebody passed a bill where I live that minors can’t have hormones or surgery) then she told me that I will never be a man no matter what I do. That shit hurt. Then she started comparing confirmation surgery to Michael Jackson’s nose surgery. And I tried to explain to her that plastic surgery is very different from gender confirmation surgery. But she didn’t listen. She don’t understand gender dysphoria is different than just hating your body. Like I told her I tried to give myself top surgery this weekend but she did not care. She also mentioned she right wing but that had nothing to do with what she told me I think she’s getting her facts off a unreliable source tbh. Am I in the wrong? Or Do I just really hate the feminine parts of my body? Yo please tell me I need answers"	"New therapist time if you ask me
A lot of people are saying get a new therapist, but from your replies it seems like that’s not an option. Sometimes, no therapist is better than a bad therapist. If the therapist isn’t supporting you and is clearly dangerously misinformed, then not seeing them anymore- even if that means you don’t have a therapist- may be the best option. Medical trauma from therapists is a real and damaging thing. You have to weigh whether any help you’re getting from this person is worth the hurt.
This is a very transphobic therapist who is abusing her position to convince trans people they aren’t trans. This person needs to lose their license
Depending on your state/country that may be extremely illegal. I'd recommend checking your local laws first, and if the law is in your favor consider reporting them/going to court. 

Also, look into your therapists terms of service (it might not be called that, but many will have something similar), and your local laws to see if you can record the audio of the session without their knowledge. A recording of your therapists clearly going against the standard of care will be a lot more serious than just your word.
pro tip: if anyone says ""you'll regret it"" or ""lots of people regret it"", huge red flag of misinformation and/or transphobia
I'm a therapist. This level of professional ignorance is inexcusable. Unfortunately, many therapists lack the requisite understanding of LGBTQ2 issues needed be helpful and not harmful to those in the community. You are not in the wrong, your therapist is just pathetically unequipped to serve trans clients. I'd get fired for saying that kind of shit to you
I am a therapist. This is abusive and actually against the law. This person can lose their license for this. I would contact an attorney. If you can get them to stop practicing therapy entirely it is a good thing for you, and every other trans person they will damage in the future.
there is scientific evidence to the contrary. give me a minute and I'll find the study. It was about trans youth and idk how old you are but regardless I'll find the study and link it here in a minute. trans health care is life saving with an incredibly low regret rate especially when compared to other life saving medical procedure.

Edit: https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext

if you're not used to reading scientific papers, scroll to the table, there's a column for percentages of trans kids who didn't receive gender affirming cards and a colimn for kids who did receive gender affirming care, the instances of depression and suicide decreases when trans kids get gender affirming treatment. Not increases. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or willfully denying science. 

This study references some other good studies, such as one where 0 out of 80 respondents regretted their transition. usually the numbers I read are around a 1% or less regret rate. for medical procedures of ANY kind that's STRIKINGLY low. Mastectomies and chemo for cancers do not have that low a regret rate. Sometimes transphobes will reference studies that show that gender dysphoria is a rapid onset social contagion among teens, but this is based on studies where unaccepting critical PARENTS of the children were surveyed and the trans kids opinions were not considered. Refer to Brie Hanrahan's article ""A reasonable person's guide to the jk Rowling article"" for more debunking of the poor excuse for science that transphobes use to try to create the idea of regret.

But one thing I wanna say is that, of course the science is on our side, and a lot of transphobes know that deep down. You can find well researched peer reviewed literature that shows trans healthcare is good and low risk and incredibly effective, but you don't have an obligation to argue your own existence. you CAN cite your sources on why trans healthcare is a positive, but you shouldn't have to and transphobes don't care if you do most the time. You don't have to argue for your existence.
Nope, done. Find a new therapist. She's more interested in defending her worldview than your mental health.

YOU are fine. And need a clean clear space so you can figure out the path to what you want, whatever that is. She's not capable of giving you that. Drop her like a bad habit.

I really hesitate to say the next part, but.. it might be time to end therapy if she won't leave it alone. She can actively make the whole thing worse. If your parents won't let you switch, lock in on developing the skills you need to be independent. Dive into learning how to budget, extra cheap meals, how to write a resume, all the things like that. Use that as an armor and just get through the next few years so you can go when it's time.  


Make sure you have copies of your paperwork- your birth certificate, ssn (if you're from the states) all the things you need to prove who you are.
That therapist is transphobic and regardless their factually wrong.
She shouldnt even have her job. Thats unbelievably screwed up. 

1: shes invaliding gender dysphoria which is a diagnosable condition

2: she told you her political position which is extremely unprofessional 

3: you mentioned you attempted to harm yourself by preforming your own surgery and she did not mentally evaluate you for being at a potential risk of self harm or worse

4: shes pushing her personal opinions on you about your transition 

5: she doesn't respect your boundaries about the language she uses

6: shes comparing you to the experience of other people
A therapist who ignores basic facts you can google is a hack. This therapist doesn’t understand or care about you my guy. You deserve to be happy, no matter where you find it.
Hi hello. Not an expert by any means, but while i’m college I did a few research papers on the LGBTQ+ community, as well as the trans community specifically. Every single peer reviewed paper I found reported significantly less suicidality and depression as trans people underwent physical transitioning.
New therapist
You are not in the wrong. That is a bad therapist who does not believe in actual research and facts. She is trying to push her own transphobic agenda. I would stop going to her and leave bad reviews warning other people if that is an option.
Okay so some thoughts.

Although it varies from state to state, where I am (and most places afaik) ""Therapist"" is not a term regulated by the government. Anyone with a pen and a piece of cardstock can put up a sign claiming to be a therapist and charge money for sessions. Now obviously I don't know the woman you're talking about, and if she uses the terms ""counselor"", ""psychologist"", or ""psychiatrist"" there's a much higher probability she went through some actual schooling, but the next time you're at her office I would see if there's any information about her actual job title (business cards, signage, degrees on walls, etc).

It's certainly not impossible that someone with technical competency would be so blatantly biased against their clientele but that raises my eye brows, especially when you mentioned that your parents denied you access to another option. There's a certain subset of the ""therapy"" crowd who identify themselves as 'christian counselors' or something similar (not certain as counselor does tend to be regulated to my knowledge, but counselor is a comparatively low rung on the ladder of mental health professionals so bigots making their way to such positions is more believable.) 

These people by and large won't help you with trans issues. They won't affirm your gender identity, they won't be knowledgeable enough to help you even if they wanted to, and they CERTAINLY won't help you get HRT. In fact, even aside from any trans stuff I would expect whatever advice they give you to be filtered through the ever-giving lens of ""christian love"" so I wouldn't expect her to be of any help at all, to be honest.

If I were in your position and they wouldn't let me switch to a better fitting option, I would stop going entirely. If they're going to make you go, there's nothing they can do to make you talk. Sometimes all you can do is buckle down and weather the storm, and that's okay. Just know that better days are coming, and *know* that you have the strength to make it through this, okay? If you ever need to talk my DMs are open. Currently working my way through undergrad as a psychology student so I might know a thing or two about a thing or two, but first and foremost I'm a friend to talk to and an ear to listen.

much love ❤️
I say this as a therapist. You must stop seeing her. She is doing you far, far more harm than no therapist at all. Imagine a dentist that chisels random cracks into your teeth. Would you say ""they were the only one you had?"" If your parents ""won't let"" you stop seeing her, then you need to sit silently, playing on your phone, for the duration of your session. She can only harm you psychiatrically.
Please don't diminish or excuse what they did or think there is any ambiguity here: you did nothing wrong. This therapist's comments should be grounds for losing whatever license they have. Their comments were absolutely unacceptable.

Report that therapist to the relevant licensing authority. It isn't their role to push their individual opinion of a client's issue.
I would call the clinic and report her if you feel comfortable doing so they are there to listen and support you their ways telling you otherwise is against therapy
Jeez are you seeing the same one I went to? Mine did the exact same thing with me.
Sounds like the type of therapist transphobes send you to to try to ""change your mind/cure you/ get you back on God's path / whatever else nonsense""
This is not a good therapist. I would report her.
Your therapist doesn't know how to treat trans people. She's actively taking steps that increase her patients' risk of mental illness, self harm, and suicide. Find a new therapist and warn anyone you feel safe enough to tell about never going to her.

I say this as someone with a PhD in sociology whose field of expertise is sexual and gender minority population health: every single thing she is doing is known to profoundly negatively impact trans people's well-being.
She is waaaaaaay wrong and is doing harm.
How dose that therapist have a job still
Yikes. This is a very bad therapist.

From what youve said in comments it sounds like you're not in a good home situation. Please don't give up. You may have to be in survival mode for a while. It may feel like you'll never get through it, like it's an eternity. Please don't give up. Get through each day.

One day you'll be 18 and that long slog will have earned you a whole life on the other side that is all your own. It won't be easy, but you'll be able to move away from your parents, to a place where you will be be accepted and be able to find therapists and doctors who will respect you for who you are.

In the meantime, do what you have to to stay alive. If it's available, finding an LGBT youth group with supportive adult leaders could be a lifeline.
She's absolutely horrible at being a therapist. Not only is she CLEARLY not fit for the job, but therapists should NEVER talk about their political views in a way that is used against you.
Gross. She sounds like a right wing fox news addict to me. She's getting her information and her ideology and her personality directly from old white dudes who don't even know what the fuck they're talking about, in regards to literally anything. 

She's %40000 wrong.  

Also you can be trans and hate the feminine parts of your body. I'm a trans man and I came close a few times to DIY top surgery because the dysphoria is killing me. 

Find someone who knows how to do their job and actually listen to their patient and do a better job of providing accurate help, instead of just making it worse.
Well, she sounds toxic AF. Whether transitioning is or isn’t right for you… the way she responded to you is highly irresponsible. Get a new therapist or at the very least, stop seeing her. I wouldn’t not trust her with anything after receiving such an obviously biased response to a very complex topic.
If your parents dont let you change therapists then no longer talk to her. if you have to show up, refuse to talk to her.
You can report her for that, the clinic should have the information posted somewhere, like maybe the wall in the waiting room. 

And no, you are absolutely correct.  Family support alone decreases the risk of suicide about 50%, and actual transition is so, so helpful for mental health. I transitioned in 2020 and my dysphoria is significantly decreased. Like I would have intrusive thoughts about trying to diy surgery, and I permanently fucked up my ribcage binding so tight. I distanced myself from feminine things and softness to try and be seen as anything but a girl. Transitioning has allowed me to embrace those things again. 

I recently built myself a bed with lilac and pink curtains, and two weeks ago went to a doctor's appointment in full lolita style. I looked like a frilly cupcake and it was glorious. No matter what I wear, no matter what I like, I'm not a girl.  And the freedom of not trying to either force myself to be one, or of trying to distance myself from it, has been so amazing.

Detransitioning is extremely rare. Like, not even 1% of trans folks rare. And the majority of those who detransition do so due to lack of support, bullying, etc. You know who you are. 

If being confrontational isn't your thing, check your local laws and if it's legal, start recording these therapy appointments, to start documenting what she is saying to you. If you can't, try at least keeping a journal. She is very much violating all kinds of ethics codes, and could potentially lose her license for this. 

No one, NO ONE, has the right to treat you this way. Please try and report it, and seek help from a trusted adult.
I missed that this was their therapist and now I've gone from more of a wtf that's a bad friend/person/whatever to what the FUCK how the hell does this person have a license to be a therapist??
From your replies, you need to call CPS. Or raise a stink at the clinic where the therapist works. Tell someone she's enabling your family's abuse. I know it's scary and if talking about it here helps you definitely should but nothing is going to change if you don't say anything.
You are not in the wrong 

Do what you think will help you feel more like yourself regardless of what your therapist says
[deleted]
She’s absolutely wrong. Transition saved my life. Hormones decreased my suicidal thoughts more than anything ever has.
I am almost certain she is violating some sort of ethics code as a therapist here.  
I would report her behaviour and get a new therapist.
Gate keeper fire her ass
Yeah, you ain’t in the wrong, mate. The fact that she dismissed you trying to give yourself top surgery? And not listening when you said you don’t like being called beautiful? Yeah, you’re not in the wrong, mate. I’m sorry about your therapist, mate, and don’t doubt yourself. You’re in the right.
she is not anywhere near qualified to be a therapist ! honestly, i'd try to find a online therapist rather than this one, if you can't find that i'd honestly just chat to an experienced friend, this person shouldn't be anywhere near a therapist office.
you can love the feminine parts about your body and still be a man
New Therapist, also sue for malpractice as she's quite clearly biased and follows an anti-trans ideology which is harmful to patients.

This is in direct violation of her hipocratic oath and could see her struck off if you're not the first to complain
New therapist or dump her. I was waiting for a therapist for individual speech therapy, and thet gave me a therapist who didn't even read a report sent to her months ago, it didn't work out and I couldn't get a new one, so I spoke with my mom and ageed that it wasn't going to work out and we went back on the waiting list. No therapist is better than one who disregards your feelings.
awful, disrespectful, and unprofessional. this person shouldn't be a therapist
That are so many red flags. Youre absolutely not wrong. 
Ive heard 'Why would you change, youre beautiful' too. I never found myself ugly I just never saw myself. Luck for me Ive never seen that guy again.

You got this bro! 
Ignore that gint bs if you can. You are already a real man and no shit like what she said can change that.
And you can be complete stealth. It is pretty common as FtM (dont know by MtF, sorry ladys).
She's psycho. I'd stop going if your parents won't let you see another one. I'd also report her. Going to her is more harmful than good obviously.
Absolutely untrue; the opposite is in fact true: trans gender people offered affirming therapy, including HRT etc are LESS likely to be depressed and entertain suicide.

This sounds like a conversation therapist not a supportive one
new therapist, if you can't get a new one, fuck around with her. no use in complying with somebody who doesn't want the best for you. mess with her and troll her

If she admits that she's right wing then she definitely gets her shit of unreliable sources and listening to her or telling her more could be dangerous to you.
As a future therapist I can safely say just through the entire therapist out. Therapists should be open to all patients.
I’m not sure why this popped up on my feed as I’m your typical middle aged white dude who doesn’t really know shit about being trans. That said, even with me having no idea what you’re going through I can tell you this therapist sucks.
If she works for a practice and is not private then go to her practice about it. Inform them of what she is doing and how she is treating/talking to you. That’s waaaay out of line and so beyond unethical that it’s disgusting. She could straight up be fired for shit like that and should be. If it is a private practice then go to someone else if possible. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. That’s not right at all.
Sounds like you need a new therapist dude.  She sounds like a total misinformed dingus that shouldn't be interacting with the general public in a professional capacity.  I'd report her to whatever licensing board she got her licenses from.
Your therapist is an awful human being, to include being extremely transphobic. Don't let her give you imposter syndrome!
I've read so much of this thread, and it's just made me angrier and angrier.

My random anonymous internet brother \[I think?  Being repulsed at 'beautiful' I'm reading that as FtM, if I have it ass backwards I am so so so sorry and please correct me\]...this goes beyond a shitty therapist.  This goes WAY beyond a shitty therapist.  Thank you so much for speaking up.

Call CPS yourself...ideally the agent who handled the first report.  Call whoever made the initial report...your first therapist, I think?  Call any other mandatory reporter.  This is a very very ***very*** clear case of child abuse, and it's blatantly obvious your parents are moving you from school to school and from therapist to therapist in an attempt to cover up that they're abusing you by surrounding you with adults who are supposed to be there to help you but are instead helping them.

Please...for your sake, don't just wait this out.  The right people can get you out of there, can get you into foster care with loving/supportive foster parents, can get that therapist into so much hot water with their ethics board they can never abuse their profession to hurt anyone again.
She’s too busy pushing her views onto you which is not what therapy is about. She’s too much in her ego and not focused on YOU and YOUR needs. If therapy is ever hindering you or your mental health maybe its time to pause and think. Therapy is supposed to help you navigate what’s yours, not theirs. No one needs to be pushing their views on you. Especially when they’re getting paid.
Don’t pay her, find someone who is actually a therapist who cares about you. I have more colorful things to say but I’ll leave it at that.
Jfc I would just walk out at that point
That’s a bad doctor acting in bad faith. Tell her to go fuck a truck, and find someone who will actually care about you!
You're not wrong at all, and this is similar to the exact reason I left my therapist. During my last visit, she was totally dismissive about hearing me when I talked about transitioning and trying to pass, and when I expressed that I was trying my best to dress like a man, she looked me up and down and remarked rudely ""you don't look like a boy."" (Everything i was wearing, i bought from the men's section, and i felt infantized because I was in my mid 20s at the time and prefer to be referred to as a man, not a boy.)
She sounds like about as good a therapist as my friend's homo/transphobic stepfather, who is a therapist. I do not feel safe around that man.
It sounds like this person wasn't interested in helping you plus if she's right wing those people aren't about trans people transitioning they'd rather we conform to their ideals of normal even if we suffer. My advice find another therapist ASAP
So she's just making up shit at this point?
Both your parents and therapist sound like horrible people. I'm sorry OP. Perhaps go NC with your folks once you move out they don't deserve you.
I agree with the response that you should report her because what she’s doing is illegal and dangerous.
Your therapist is a transphobes, that’s not a way to approach those kind of questions in any sense. Please find someone who is knowledgeable on the subject 💖 best wishes
I'd suggest getting a new therapist.
Your therapist is a transphobe and you need a new one.
your therapist has been hanging around too many terfs.
Stop going. Problem solved.
https://imgur.com/a/DanauE6
Who is this person?
If you feel like a man, and want to be one, then that's what you are. Simple as that.

Your therapist is clearly still stuck in the past, she's repeating generic and typical transphobic misinformation.
Yea get new therapist. What country do you live in? I know many transgendered people from the countries where it is illegal and it hurts me to see them suffer.
I would talk to someone higher up if I was you, without your parents knowing, try to tell someone else in that place that she is gaslighting her own patient and forcing her opinions on you which is something therapists aren’t supposed to do
Sounds like it’s time for a new therapist
Get a new therapist shes in the wrong and was just trying to convince you of some bullshit ur not in the wrong and you are a man even if you still have your feminine parts don't listen to her  your feelings and identity are valid :)
This sounds more like an issue that your therapist has with trans people in general tbh, you're not in the wrong at all dude.
She was abusing you
She sounds awful and like she could do more harm than good
That's not a real therapist; that's a bigot who managed to get a D or higher on like 10 tests.
as another trans person who was abused as a teenager— this is not worth it. this isn’t therapy, even— it’s just more abuse! i know this part of your life seems like it’s going to last forever, like it’ll never be over— but it will be. really soon, it will be. just focus on keeping yourself as healthy and if possible happy as you can be. ditch your therapist— tell your parents she threatened you, and if that doesn’t work you can anonymously report her for threatening you. since there are no other therapists around who’ll help, try some online free options. insight timer is an amazing app that’s free for everyone, it has everything from meditation to anxiety and trauma meltdown support. there are communities of survivors on there who can help you. if you have any friends whose parents are cool, ask if you can stay with them sometimes— any nights away from home in that situation is really good for you. i had a friend whose parents were awesome— they had me over all the time, and i actually converted to judaism later in life because of how kind and accepting they were, all of the holidays i spent at their house, etc. if you can get a job (i don’t know how old you are or how feasible that is) you can start saving money for later on now. if you’re too young to work, try doing odd jobs for people in your neighborhood who you’re comfortable with. nice old ladies who are frail might need help with the garbage or their gardening and might be willing to give you a twenty or something. keep the money secret from your parents— find a good hiding place. i know this isn’t really what you asked for advice on, but i’ve been there and i wish i could go back and tell myself all of these things. also, if you’re ever in crisis mode, you can always call or text a hotline at the trevor project that’s specifically for lgbt teenagers https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ they have a ton of amazing resources if you haven’t been recced them already. also in case you need a lot of advice videos, alexbertie on youtube started filming his transition when i was a teenager, so his whole transition for like a decade is on youtube, documented with lots of helpful hints, tricks, etc. he’s a really nice guy as far as i know, and he really helped me a lot. i’m gonna stop typing now because this is a block, but we’re all here for you and sending a lot of love your way, man
Please, please, PLEASE get away from this fucking monster. She should have her license yanked--and depending  on which state you live in, she will if you report her. 

She is so wrong and so full of shit on so many things she told you, that for you to go back to her for any more ""therapy"" is simply impossible. Never, EVER talk to this incompetent, hateful chupacabra again. 

If you live in California, report her to the Medical Board of Quality Assurance. 

Meanwhile for YOU, find another therapist--a GENDER therapist. Make sure she's LGBTQIA+ friendly, and you can check if you do a  search on the Psychology Today therapist website. 

Let me assure you this person is totally full of shit. Believe NOTHING Shen told yiu. She wanted to hurt you , and it sounds like she succeeded. 

If you have specific questions about how you're dealing with your trans sensibilities, please DM me and I'll try to help--as a trans chick. whose dearest friend is a transmasculine person. 

But regardless: Never, EVER see this awful woman again...
Askjfskfjkl bro, you need to ditch that therapist (if you can even call her that) right away, she is blatantly violating everything a therapist is supposed to stand for, also report her if you can
Your therapist is filled with horseshit. She’s pushing her ideals onto you along with misinformation and is downright putting you down for wanting to feel comfortable in your own body in a way that’s non-conservative/traditional. I am so so sorry she traumatized you like that. I also suggest you stop seeing her as soon as possible, for your own safety. If you feel comfortable with doing so I’d also make sure other trans and or non-binary people give her any business before anyone else gets treated as poorly as you were. You are handsome. You are brave. Don’t let a shitty therapist get to you. 💙
Hey, dude, that therapist is full of bs, she's a bad person. I have trauma too, and trust me, it's better to be alone than with abusive people like your therapist. If you're going to school, talk to the counselor or any teacher you trust, they'll report to CPS. If you're not going to school you should call CPS yourself and no matter what, if you ever feel threathened, you ever feel someone is going to hurt you or someone did hurt you, you can call the emergency number.
You're right. She is on the wrong. I assume that she's cis, so she shouldn't be talking over trans voices. My advice: change your therapist
I would from now on just sit there in silence. This isn't therapy. She isn't doing her job. 
I believe it would be a win win situation. Parents get mad that you're not talking. Rafi fix up talk to a different one. If not then they are wasting their money, you get an hour's respite from them
Your therapist is unhinged and I'm unsure how they have a job
Listen, I read a lot of posts like this and think people are whiners (so mean, I know) but fucks sake, man, this isn't okay. This therapist is not going to work out for you. I have so much to say about this but I'm trying to be controlled here. *Do you have a way to switch therapists?*
Report her to some sort of union or education facillity
Report her - at minimum she won’t see you anymore
You did nothing wrong. This therapist is deeply misinformed in the best case. In the worst case this person tries to drive everyone back to their assigned gender at birth and doesn’t believe being trans is a valid state.

Please contact the licensing body she uses and report this behavior. She has hurt you, spread misinformation, and can do the same to others.
One thing you always have to remember: no one is infallible, just because she is therapist doesn't mean she can't be wrong about those things. Of course I don't mean ""trust no one"" but don't let yourself be blinded by titles either.
You are not in the wrong. She is full of shit and is a terf. I'm really sorry you had to deal with that. Reading the comments I understand that unfortunately you can't get a new therapist, which I'm really sorry because that sucks.
Ah you need to find a therapist who you can trust this person sounds sketchy! Very!
Therapist pushing their views on a patient? Fired.
refuse to speak with her, if you can’t find a new one and/or stop seeing her. she is a horrible person and shouldn’t be a therapist.
Please note that “Christian Therapy”/“Christian Counseling”/“Reparative Therapy” for LGBT+ people is essentially Conversion Therapy without some of the more physical parts. The psychological traps, gaslighting, training you to not trust yourself, and training to abdicate your own sense of what is right to external authorities are still there. It is still psychological abuse.
Yeah she’s completely fucking nuts, and as a trans person in school for therapy she really should be losing her licence. It’s rock solid science that trans people who get affirming care and therapy have excellent outcomes, and that high suicide rate that psychopaths love throwing around is a number only found in trans people who are given the treatment you are. Stay strong and get a new therapist, she’s doing more harm than good.
She is only write on one thing and even then she is still wrong : when you will go on T or E it's possible that you experience mood swing, it's totally normal (just like before having period people have a change of mood because of T or when trans women have '' hormonal '' periode once a month)

Anyways, having drastic change of hormone *can* make you suicidal for a short period. It doesn't mean that you aren't trans or anything, it just mean that your body need a moment

I quickly see this in my psychology class so I may be wrong on some point ^ ^
Wow you need to get yourself a different therapist and if comfortable- report her ass!! This is blatantly bad, disingenuous, false, transphobic  info!!
This may be a case of “no therapist at all is better than a therapist gaslighting you for your parents’ entertainment”
I’m so sorry. I commented before reading (I know :/) but you are strong enough to tell either the school counselor, or call the state licensing board, if there’s any other adults around that accept you, tell them. This is an abuse tactic. I’m so angry for you 🤬😡🤬
I’d honestly say tell her that you won’t accept her treating you this way. You’re a man. She needs to treat you as such and that transphobia is a hate crime.
You are not in the wrong and you're definitely not powerless in this situation! I went through something similar with a psychiatrist last year and this is what I did. If you call or email the clinic that your therapist works for and tell them what happened, then you can report the therapist without having to talk to the therapist directly or involve your parents. I recommend an email because then you can include sources proving the therapist wrong and have a paper trail of how they respond. The YouTuber Jammidodger is a trans man who did his doctorate research on how medical transition lowers the risk of suicide in trans men who want it and he posted a video about it last year with the study linked in the description. The clinic should already have your insurance and payment information on file, so then you can switch therapists without your parents finding out. You deserve to have access to a good therapist. If you need immediate help, The Trevor Project has a phone number and an online chat service where you can talk to trans-friendly therapists for free.
Let us call her and shame her. That'd be fun.
I’m like. 90% sure that that is, at the very least, unethical, considering the overwhelming majority of the medical community, especially within the field of neurology, hasn’t recognized gender dysphoria as an illness or anything like that for at least 3 years, so practicing therapy and treating as though it were (which it’s arguable that’s what she’s doing cuz from what you’ve said it doesn’t sound like she made any official clinical recommendations, but I think that’s absolutely what she’s doing) would be unethical at best. Definitely tell her to kick rocks and find someone who doesn’t suck at least. Sorry you’re going through that. I just got a new therapist and I’m sorta worried cuz I told her I wanted to start hormones and get top surgery as soon as is possible and she told me I should slow down, which I kinda get cuz the context is I’m starting life completely over again after a severe mental health crisis, but at the same time I told her how happy it will make me and how happy even just getting to dress how I want and learning how to do makeup has made me, so I’m not sure what exactly I should wait for and even tho I don’t think she meant it to be like that, it kinda *feels* like it, so I’m gonna feel it out over a few more sessions. But in your case definitely find a new one as soon as you can, if they’re refusing to recognize a fundamental part of who you are they aren’t going to be able to help you in any meaningful way.

ETA: just read your responses about not being able to get a new therapist. That’s fucked I’m sorry. Me personally I would just go to every session with headphones on and not say shit cuz whatever clinic your going to *will* drop you as a client basically immediately so at least you wouldn’t have to see her. However, if it’ll cause serious issues with your parents that you don’t think you’d want to deal with until you can be free of their control, please don’t be like me lol.
Hun please don't preform surgery on yourself.
It... Is generally less safe, and I have at least heard (correct me if I'm wrong) that it could decrease your chances of getting help from medical professionals down the line. I think it's something to do with viewing it as the person being unstable or something.

That out of the way though...
Your therapist sounds like they have zero understanding or knowledge into trans people. 
Like, even if they don't specialize in it, it sounds more like their biases are interfering in their ability to actually help you.
To me it sounds like she shouldn’t be a therapist.
get rid of the therapist
The reason Michael Jackson got a rhinoplasty was because he suffered an injury prior. It was a corrective surgery. But he had not yet been diagnosed with lupus. This causes tissue destruction, which can be aggravated with surgery. But it was too late. 

I would like to point out that yes, plastic surgery is most of the time highly unnecessary. But in some cases, it is surely required for many trans people to have any hope in passing. I am in that bracket. While I personally do not need bottom surgery, I desperately need a rhinoplasty. Even as a guy I had a larger than average nose. 

In the case of SRS causing suicidal thoughts, this is actually true. But it's not for the reason people like to assume. When it is botched, it can lead to chronic pain. This is specifically because care for trans people overall is severely lacking. SRS is also still in its infancy. And naturally, we are not suicidal because of anything involving being trans, but rather because we are treated so horribly by society. 

For your particular situation regarding your therapist. She has crossed several lines. She is not a therapist. Their job is to listen to your problems and try to offer some form of guidance. The only thing close to betrayal would be disregarding this trust to protect you or others from harm (due to violent thought patterns). I didn't have to, but I tried to pick apart everything I knew moderately well regarding this quack.
Keep reporting her and let people know not to go to her. I hope you’ll eventually be able to get a new therapist.
Least the therapist tried being polite. I typed up a 7 paragraph rant but meh not important. I'll just say at least your therapist didn't tell you to stop wasting time.

Whereas confirmation surgery/hormonal transition may help some trans people, oftentimes it is not the definite solution. It won't wash away your gender dysphoria completely, same way as cosmetic surgery won't solve body dysmorphia.

That being said, I would like if your T would have provided some evidence based study on the suicidal rates when transitioning, instead of using anecdotal data.

Also, rephrasing ""you will never be a man"" would be necessary. Surely she meant that your chromosomes will always be XX, therefore, you will be prone to women's health issues (autoimmunity diseases and such).

Regarding confirmation surgery, it is indeed cosmetic, you don't get a fully functional physiological twin penis or vagina, but it can serve the purpose of reducing gender dysphoria / body dysmorphia.

Overall, she doesn't seem to be able to help you. Either for being biased or ignorant on the topic. 

Your struggles and identity are valid and should be taken seriously and with care. That doesn't mean that transitioning should be taken lightly. Having a deeper look at transitioning and adjusting expectations are necessary imo.
Yea I wish I could get a new one but I can’t Bc my parents won’t let me. I’ve posted about her multiple times Bc she’s just a mad therapist
This ""therapist"" sounds more like danger to you than helpful. So bad and wrong in so many places. Absolutely, gender confirmation intervention is life-saving. That's the global, medical opinion. Ignoring you? Then saying you're beautiful is pretty much misgendendering you. I don't think this woman is safe, or should be treating you. 
Perhaps you could write down (or copy/paste this thread) the stuff she's said to you, and also print out some information on the importance gender-affirming care and give it to your parents, asking for a new therapist. This woman sounds like she's trying to convert you, not help you. Danger signs all over. Good luck. X
Agreed new therapist wtf
And maybe worth filing a complaint against this one.
Well I used to be very unstable so I got sent to a hospital for that by my old counselor( I loved her) but my parents took me out Bc they called cps on my mom and they were supporting me and trying to help me.
I agree that no therapist at all would be better than this one. Is there any avenue school, out anyone else in your community where you can find a trans-informed therapist?
A way you do it is find their license number by searching it on the BBS (board of behavioral sciences) website. You can file a report there. Admittedly I'm only familiar with california law, but other states use the BBS.
therapy is largely unregulated so it is totally possible they don’t even have a license in the first place as there is no “official qualification” you have to get to call yourself a “therapist”
[removed]
It’s prob not illegal Bc I live in a VERY red state not a speck of blue lol
She’s is the only therapist near me( an hour away) that even mentioned that she is ok working with gay people
Exactly, people like this are why trans suicide rates are the way they are. They need to go.
Print out this article and bring it to your next session OP.  If the therapist will keep saying it with the facts in front of her, you’ll know she’s willing to make stuff up to align with her beliefs
Yea I’ve been trying to prepare to get out of my house since I was 14. It’s just a waiting game now
She once told me if I go back to a mental hospital that she would send me to the worst one she can find.
She’s the only person I have I can’t get another Bc parents :(
Thankyou that means a lot. And I never knew there were Christian therapists out  there. I guess I know why I wasn’t allowed to choose.
I don’t know her first name Angie?
That is absolutely appalling. We get that shit from friends, parents, co workers, classmates etc. NO ONE needs that from their therapist.
These people habe a way of piercing you with statements and questioning until you talk. 
This whole story is so abusive!
No that’s not really she told me plain as day that being trans is not real thing and like people who think they trans Bc they hate their bodies and it’s another psychological problem.
also, you are not even slightly in the wrong, you are a strong and brave young man who is doing what's right for himself, don't listen to a word of her bullshit.
Someone trying to hurt you and who's too cowardly to say that where other people can read it. Disregard them.
I am in the US
Thanks that means alot. I just wanted say that’s a big coincidence Bc I am planning to convert to Judaism when I am older!
No unfortunately not
I love Jammie!

Ugh, and I’m guessing your parents like her because her views align with theirs? Gods forbid a therapist do their job and be impartial and objective while still being warm enough to be approachable. Someone that can actually help you sort your thoughts and feelings instead of actively rallying against them to push their agenda.
She needs to be reported to the licensing board tbh. She is not only failing to do her job, but is actively working against her patient's interests.
Just stop actually talking to the therapist or get on a different topic and waste both your parents and your therapist’s time, and your parent’s money.
Honestly why go to therapy if the therapist doesn't want to help you apparently. Sounds like a huge waste of time and money
It's better to have no therapist than a therapist who will put you down, gaslight you, deny your experiences and make you feel worse! You can already get all that every other day of the week. She should be fined. This is not okay.
Sounds like your parents are trying to force you through conversion therapy.
I’m sorry you lost access to your old counselor. That is a really difficult situation to be in.
All the pieces are falling together perfectly in this puzzle. ~~How old are you and what state are you in hun?~~
Therapists in many places are “mandatory reporters”. If there was cause for CPS to be called, your parents seem to have selected someone who will cover up what is going on and happily downplay anything you say.

Find an adult, possibly a school counselor, and talk to them.  They may be able to help you with reporting and getting you to a safer and more supporting situation.
I believe you can call CPS yourself, it's something to consider.
Nope closets therapist that has their names in their bio is 2 hours away :(
What country are we talking about here??
Unsure why we are playing devils advocate here but yes either way they would be pushing an agenda which is abusing their position of power over their patients. It’s irresponsible, unprofessional, and just plain gross. That situation is more than likely nonexistent tho as it’s usually the patient that brings up being trans and not the doctor. The doctor usually dissuades patients from thinking they’re  trans or forces them to prove it in some silly way
Whataboutism. Love to see it /s
1) we live in the future my friend! Distance is not an issue anymore, it's really easy to find an all online therapist, I might be able to point you in the right direction if you want. 

2) the color of your state doesn't really matter that much in this case, since this would be a part medical ethics/standard of care, which is determined by a board of professionals rather than by politicians. As far as I know, almost every state has a part of their ethical standards saying that a licensed practitioner can't give you A)blatant and provably false information, and B)can't say or do things that are ""clearly racist, homophobic, sexist, or otherwise overtly discriminatory.""

As well as the ethical standards, all licensed therapists/counsellors/psychiatrists/social workers are held to a ""standard of care."" That means they are expected to take what you say seriously  and respond in a way that lines up with medical consensus, and the reasonable person standard (would a reasonable person with their same education, license and skill level respond in the same way). 

And last thing, I don't say this to scare you or discourage you from actually talking to a therapist, but I just realized while typing this, you admitted to self harm/attempted self harm to them. From what you said it sounded like your therapists just kind of brushed passed that, which is massively illegal everywhere. Especially at the level of home surgery. they'd be, at the absolute minimum, required to talk about that with you and ensure that you weren't planning to do it again. If you're a minor they'd have to inform your parents and possibly CPS. Most decent therapists would have sent you to a Crisis center or dedicated mental health care facility. 

I'm sorry if this got a bit overwhelming or confusing, but even though I don't know you I am genuinely concerned for you, and concerned for any other gay/trans people that are seeing this therapist.
[this site](https://www.counseling.org/knowledge-center/licensure-requirements/state-professional-counselor-licensure-boards#) will help you find the contact info for your states licensing board. I hope things work out okay for you, and you can get real help.
Sounds like she's only ""ok working with gay people"" insofar as she thinks she can use her therapist's office as a form of conversion therapy, which is...super super super unethical.

I wish I knew if my therapist was taking new clients \[he's semi-retired\]...100% remote sessions so proximity isn't an issue, became ""the GSRM therapist"" locally entirely due to word of mouth, I've been with him for depression for years and was my first ally when my egg got launched out of a cannon...super supportive, put words to things I couldn't describe, etc.
I'd say this Sub-Reddit might be more beneficial to you than this therapist.
The statistic is totally misleading because it includes attempts pre transition (many do not attempt again after coming out), doesnt factor institutional gatekeeping and denial of trans health care, familial support, homelessness, co occuring smi, ptsd, discrimination, etc. Anybody with any scientific literacy knows this. There's no way a therapist is that wildly ignorant, it has to be purely malicious.
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202201/the-evidence-trans-youth-gender-affirming-medical-care more studies just to tack on to the conversation.
And I hate it that it's that way for you. You should have parents that support you, or at the very least let you figure yourself out without getting in the way. Please don't mistake your hard won stability as her doing like she can take that away from you- YOU did that work, and quite likely in spite of her. Good on you- that had to have been hard.

If you can't not go to sessions,  look up the gray rock method- it's a super useful tool in the right situations, and this may be one of them. 

&#x200B;

Signed- Mom of a (trans) kid. 

&#x200B;

P.S. This is bullshit, you deserve better.
Thats so not okay. You should stop seeing her. I saw your other reply saying you cant get a new one but even so you really should stop seeing her. Shes causing more harm than good. If your parents are in control of your therapy tell them about her disregard for your safety and mental wellbeing. Tell them she says stuff that triggers you and she doesn't apologize or stop.
Threatening a client goes from ""bad at therapy"" to ""genuinely abusive and dangerous individual."" This really is the equivalent of going to a doctor who is poisoning you. You may need to go at it alone. But you have to get out.
That is really awful. A therapist using abusive threats like that should lose their license to practice. I wouldn’t be surprised if she isn’t licensed and might be trying to use the “religious counseling” loopholes some places have.
Well no therapy is better than this.

You need to report this person as they are causing legitimate harm and will hurt others, regardless of what your parents say.

I know it's hard but you absolutely can do this. You are being abused and this may be your only way of ending that (for now at least).
Keep it in mind when you're listening to what she has to say from now on, ya know? Good therapy, REAL therapy is about helping you cope with life as it comes at you. She has an agenda beyond that, and because of that she's never going to give you the advice you need to hear.

Imagine you're locked in a room with a window. The glass itself is red, and as such when light comes in it casts everything in a sinister crimson. Everything you can see of the outside world bears this red hue, looking much more evil and sinister than it is on its own objective merit. Some day, you'll be able to leave the room. You'll be able to pick your own window: one that let's the flowers discard this imposed ombre in favor of their own natural beauty. You *will* be allowed to look through your own eyes, I promise you that. But there's no shame in backing away from the window for now. 

~

It seems that your parents are very unsupportive of your trans-ness. But if you're sneaky about it, there'll always be ways you can modify your gender presentation that'll fly right under their radar. Now I'm transfem so I wouldn't be the best person ever to ask about how to be masculine (lol) but I will offer the advice to get one of those hand-squeezy things that works out your forearms. They're a good little idle exercise to do throughout the day and it should be fairly easy to make the case that it's a fitness thing and not a gender thing.

If you find yourself forced away from the window, you can always find a crack in the walls through which to peer at your flowers 🌸 Your captors will be none the wiser.
Ahh, mine was Gwendolyn
Yea I once told her about a time my mom assualted me and she said it wasn’t that and I was being dramatic.
And adding to that as soon as I got outed I was sent to a religious school where pretty much everyday they preach people like me are going to hell.
Just DM OP, tbh this is going beyond therapist bad vent and into solid child abuse.
OP is probably 16 or so - they say they have 2 years remaining until they're a legal adult.
Yea it’s just I don’t have the balls to do that lol
Well specially the UK but it’s much the same in other countries (excluding the USA)
[removed]
Lmao it is tbh
Thankyou for the support. But Thankyou the most for supporting your kid. I wish I had a
Parent like you. You will never know how much of an impact that will have on your kid. I wish you and your kid the best of luck
Excuse me? I was upset before.. now I’m seething. How DARE she play the victim blame game as a THERAPIST. She needs to lose her job like last year.
You could report your therapist for breaking the law. OP, your therapist is required by law to report abuse. You should call CPS and tell them what is happening to you and that your therapist is enabling your abuse. Please be safe
🤔 report her to her professional body, once she's barred from practicing your parents will have to let you get a new therapist.

That's absurdly unprofessional behaviour.
Yea she needs to lose her job right this instant. If you bring it up to literally anyone that's higher on the board she'll have to go through examination and then she will promptly have her license revoked.
I think that talking to this person might be more harmful than not. Any chance you can just stop going or stonewall the whole time if you have to? Talk about music and the weather?
you need to report that therapist to get their license revoked
Um? That is a red flag. Therapists are not supposed to downplay stuff like that. They are supposed to listen and help you process stuff.
if you're being forced to go, go and be silent. A bad therapist can do a lot more damage than no therapy at all. Don't engage. Don't give her or your parents what they want. Be true to yourself, and get a different therapist as soon as you're able
You're right. I wanted to know because a lot of people are guessing suggestions based on not knowing OPs age or state and that makes giving advice difficult.

My blood is boiling reading this post, there is definitely some serious child abuse going on here by her parents and especially this ""therapist"". I'm not an expert so I will leave this to someone more qualified.
Links the federalist lol
No joke! There are knowledgeable people on here, who actually care about helping and supporting each other. 💙💗🤍💗💙
Thank you. If you need some legit mothering or just a recipe for some cheap eats, send me a message. :)
Yea she’s all I have tho sadly:(
And?
Will do 👍
Tell every other employee you see at the clinic that you hate this therapist and need a new one. Tell them youre miserable. If you keep bringing it up something will be done, whether its for your benefit or for her reputation.
If she is licensed and stuff, I’m pretty sure there is a place to report them for this stuff ( forgot the name ). She might be able to lose her license over this.
Is bad therapy better than no therapy at that point though?
This is so funny actually. Where’s the helicopter joke. What else do you have??
And lol
[Not a great source.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/)
The post History is also red flag.
I can’t do that it took everything out of me to tell her I don’t like to be called beautiful. Sorry o couldn’t help
But without her I am stuck. One time I was having a serious crisis and my family took everything away from me. Like my phone. I couldn’t call no one for help. And my parents just dismissed me.
NO. NO NO NO. No therapy at all is better than bad therapy. Love, a therapy student. 

The relationship is EVERYTHING and it doesn't even matter how cool the shrink is if you don't trust them. Their job is NOT to judge you or impose their moral values. One of our tenets is Unconditional Positive Regard. The therapist is trouncing all of this by imposing her shitty, regressive beliefs. 

Refuse to go anymore, OP. Tell your parents that if they make you go, you just won't talk, so they're wasting their money.
Just about all the major media companies would fit under radical left, I don’t see why a change of pace would be a bad idea
Some of my posts were trolls, such as one about “fatphobia”
Youre the only one that can help yourself right now. I know how hard it is to stand up for yourself but you need to raise a stink. Therapists like this are why people live miserable lives. Continuing treatment with this person will negatively affect you.

If you can't change people, you need to make your therapist aware that you will not listen to what she is saying. Never give in to her and make her job difficult. She may make the decision to find someone else for you.

Never give up on yourself. You know who you are, not this horrible stranger.
With a therapist like that, none is better. You need to stand up for yourself or nothing will get better. You need to report her.
She can’t help you. She’s clearly not in and way educated in transgender issues. She in fact is spouting transphobic rhetoric. This could be exactly why your parents chose her. Look her up, do research about her credentials and what issues she claims to cover.

If you can’t get rid of her, stonewall her. Say absolutely nothing of value during seasons. One word answers or no answers at all. 

The longest sentence You should say to her from now on is “I’ve decided you aren’t qualified to help me, and any further dialogue with you would be harmful to my mental and emotional well being.”
OP, if you're comfortable DMing me her name and where you live, I am happy to report her. No pressure, and I can't guarantee it will change anything, but I'm more than happy to do it. You just say the word <3
I'm telling you, other adults at the clinic will help. Telling your parents will be dismissed and your therapist doesnt want all her clients bailing immediately (because shes abusive) so shes holding you captive. Tell anybody that you need help and that BOTH the therapist AND your parents are ignoring you. Something will happen eventually
I don’t know how old you are - if you’re still in school go and talk to a counselor there.

School counselors are mandatory reporters, and you’re being abused by your parents.

I’m sorry this is happening to you - you deserve far better.
With her you will only get worse though. You need help from someone willing to give it and she is obviously not it
The thing is, you don’t have that therapist either. She clearly is far more of a harm than a help. You are likely worse with her than without her
Im so sorry you’re in that situation. How old are you? How many years til you’re legally an adult? I hope you can get out ASAP
It's not the left/right bias that's important. It's the failed fact checks, promotion of conspiracy theories, and the fact that they were banned on Twitter for spreading COVID misinformation.

I don't doubt that it's okay for the occasional news outlet to be right-wing, because that's diversity of thought. What matters is whether or not they actually report on the truth, which The Federalist clearly doesn't.
Thanks I might do that but I am gonna tell my psychiatrist about this first and tell her what all my therapist has said and see if she can recommend me some therapists ( and hopefully talk my mom into letting me)
This - reach out to an adult you trust at the clinic or your school or call CPS and  them what is happening
Round 2 years :(
Great idea. Fight for yourself, you're worth it <3
So idk if this is possible for you and even if it is, it may not be the best choice depending on your situation. But after my mom told me to kill myself when I was 16, I ran away from home. I went to a hospital and when they tried to send me home I went to a friend and his mom took me to the police. The police took me to a group home. After a few days in the group home, my parents signed off on letting me move in with family friends. I never would’ve thought they’d agree to that but they did. I never saw them again and it’s been 10 years, it will be 11 in May. Best choice I ever made."	sc0vek	trans	1010	0.99	2022-01-25 01:04:48
Finally went to therapy (didn’t go well)	"My parents finally listened to me and found a therapist for me to see. My dysphoria lately has been at an all time low and I’ve really lost all hope 

I wanted help, I wanted to get better and the first session went okay. She misgendered me more then once, even though I stated my pronouns, and asked weird questions about my sexuality. Felt very confused after that session. 

Second session was even worse. The therapist misgendered me twice in the first 10 minutes which fucking sucked because I don’t get misgendered often anymore. She kept bringing the conversation back to sex which made me uncomfortable considering I never brought up sex and don’t particularly have any problems with it considering I’m not having it. Then the worst part, she  went through my body, head to toe, asking whether I liked each part. She stopped specifically on my chest, asking me to describe my chest and using words that made me feel so dysphoric. Thankfully the session ended when we got to my hips so I didn’t have to say anything else. 

I’ve decided I’m not going back. I feel violated. The thought of going to another therapist and having the same thing happen is terrifying but I want help so badly. I really don’t know what to do. Just needed to vent

Edit: I posted this and then fell asleep. I am so overwhelmed with all the comments. I thought I was overreacting. Thank you"	"Here's what I did. Go to Psychology Today, filtering exclusively for transgender-related issues. They have people who have studied on these topics that can help you through your journey. Make sure they accept whatever insurance you're under. I don't regret it one bit.

Might be hard to find the filter, so just google ""transgender therapy >your location< psychology today"" and you should get a result. And no, I'm not some promoter if anyone's curious.
That really sucks, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 

I know it's probably a sticky situation, since you live with your parents, but do you have the ability to choose a new therapist yourself? Do your parents have any control over that?

Like, could you find one that is affirming? Cause you could definitely use one
I want to echo that this is super not normal and you’re right to feel violated. Even therapists that aren’t trained specifically on trans issues are supposed to approach sessions from a place of radical acceptance. It’s super not okay for them to misgender you.

My therapist isn’t super familiar with trans issues but she has never misgendered me and has had absolutely no issues using my preferred name and pronouns. If we talk about my discomfort with my body I am in control of what parts we talk about and the goal of the conversation is always centered around accepting what I can’t change and working on what I can to get where I want to be. Same goes for sex. I want to emphasize that this kind of therapist is normal and obtainable. You should expect to feel safe in your session and feel like your therapist is there to support you in your goals.
That is definitely not ok I’m sorry u had to experience this.
The problem is they found one for you they should have let you find one
This is abuse. If you're a minor it's child abuse.

What the fuck
>I’ve decided I’m not going back. I feel violated.

That's because you were violated. Fucking scum ass therapist. I'm in college to be a psychologist, and I'm always fucking appalled by how terrible some people are at their jobs. Where I live, you go to school for over 10 years once you finish high-school to get the qualifications, take on obscene amounts of debt in order to finish your education, all so you can be a therapist...

***and some fucking morons still come out being fucking morons?***

Boggles my fucking mind.

>The thought of going to another therapist and having the same thing happen is terrifying but I want help so badly.

With all that said, not all therapists are garbage. Hell, a lot of them are what I aspire to be once I'm trained. 

If you want my advice, seek a therapist that is unaffiliated with your prior, violating therapist. That means avoid the ""agency"" they work at and avoiding any ""recommendations"" they might have. Try to have some input on your therapist selection, and perhaps tell your parents why you're done with this one (because they violated you). If they push back, ask if they'd like to stay in a room with an older person constantly talking about sex and their body as a minor.

I'm sorry your therapist was utter crap, but there are many good ones. Not all therapists are for everyone (although this one seems to be for no one), so often people experiment before finding a therapist they're willing to stick with. 

Good luck partner, and remember, you're pretty cool
Holy shit, your therapist might be a fucking pedo. Please search on psychologytoday.com for an lgbt affirming and allied therapist.
Never see that therapist again and look into reporting them for this sexual harassment.
That’s known as sexual harassment. You really need to tell someone what happened. Maybe your parents, maybe someone else, but someone. Ideally someone who can report this because that kind of behavior is grounds for losing a medical license and then some
Honey, you just got a garbage therapist. There are loads of wonderful ones out there. Give up on this stupid woman, but do give it a try with someone else. I've only been doing therapy for a few months but it has helped me figure out a bunch of stuff. Good luck! (and <hugs>)
Report, report, report!!!! Go to the most senior person in the building and report them! If thats not possible, then try and find a website that their name is on and write a scathing review, if you can handle that.
this isn't therapy, it's abuse. Don't go anymore.
That's absolutely fucking awful and I'm so sorry you experienced that. Idk anything about this but maybe look into reporting them? 

If possible try to find a therapist that's LGBTQ+ (or experienced with patients who are) I finally found a therapist who's enby and it's so so much better than constantly worrying about how they'll react and having to try to explain things to people who will just never get it
My therapist never did that with me. She made the goals very clear: figure out what gender is to me and how to handle the dysphoria. She pressed the fact that it was alright for me not to know for certain and that I controlled the pace of the sessions.   


what I mean is that maybe this therapist isn’t the right fit for you and it would be a good idea for you to try a different one. If you don’t feel comfortable with doing that right away, that’s alright.
Sometimes I think people just need to be beat up... your therapist is one... a bully.  That's so awful.  Glad you're not going back.
Omg so wrong!  Such bad bad therapy!  Not your fault don’t go back!  I would def def feel icky about that too!
What a fucking creep 🤢 I’m so sorry that happened, OP. I hope you’re able to find a better therapist. I went through a few therapists before finding one that was actually supportive and helpful
Report that therapist for sexual harassment stating that throughout multiple sessions they used therapy time to make disgusting remarks about your body which were not related to the topics at hand.
look for a gender phsyciatrist, not just a general therapist
Wow. Another person who fetishises trans people. Jesus christ, I hate people
This therapist sounds abusive
Is there a person who runs the clinic that you go to? Talk to the secretary and be polite. Ask for contact information about your ""current"" therapist and simply state a few things to the head of the clinic. If the person doesn't do a thing, report this to American council associations. They have to follow guidelines to allow you feel safe. 

[ACA](https://www.counseling.org/about-us/divisions-regions-and-branches)

This will guide you who to go to. They are discriminating you by not call you by your respectable pronouns and making you feel violated mentally. This is the problem that we need to make sure we stand up for ourselves. Be strong. If you need help, I'm here as a researcher.
I'm soo sorry about what you had to go through, your old therapist was awful
As someone who has had a lot of therapy in the past i am so sorry about your experience :(

I swear therapists aren't all like this, the two i've met were really respectful of me. The first thing a therapist is supposed to do is instill trust with the patient and they definitely did not do that in your case. 

If you do decide to go back to see a therapists and they make you feel uncomfortable it's really important that tou tell them and it's absolutely ok to do so! Talking about why it makes you uncomfortable might be more important than talking about the subject itself. 

Also, being honest is an important part of the therapeutic process. If they hurt you by missgendering you, you have to tell them.
Are your parents supportive? This reeks of selecting the worst therapist on purpose
Horrible therapist. You deserve someone better
*Gross.* I'd report her if I were you, and if you can build up the courage to do so, though you shouldn't have to... ***please*** do, so she doesn't do this to anyone else. That was a transphobe and... possibly something worse, who you met; your parents made a pretty fucking terrible decision and she had no right to make the conversation about sex or about your body like that. How unprofessional and horrific. 

Considering I'm in the medical field and probably older than you, I wish I could've met her and had a session with her to tell her off and report her myself. Disgusting. Hell, I'd help you, if I had information enough to do so. :\\ 

That was absolutely violating behavior for a therapist and she **needs** to have her license pulled. What a total creep. 

I hope you take the advice I saw elsewhere here and search up a therapist who specializes in support of LGBT+ people, including ***transition support***\--but it sounds like she was trying to ease you into conversion therapy (also known as psychological torture) instead.

I found mine on psychology today like the first comment, I've never been misgendered by my therapists and they've always been respectful and kind, never diving into any topics I was not willing and ready to discuss myself.
OP If you are under 18 that therapist needs to be reported. That's straight up creepy as fuck either way and you definitely should not see  her again. Deeply unprofessional and inappropriate.
Don't get discouraged. You got a bad one out of the way. Now there's one less for you to have problems with, which means the right one is out there!
Are your parents supportive or not? Because it kinda sounds like they looked for and then ""found"" a therapist who's supposed to talk you out of being trans or at least turn you away from therapy.
Ew, that's gross! I'm so sorry that happened to you! Not all therapists are like that nasty person, I promise. I've had 4 different therapists over the years, and mine have all been wonderful. If you can, try to find a different one like other people have suggested. Good luck!
What you described didn’t sound like a therapist. That sounded so unprofessional. I don’t know maybe finding one with good credentials or good reviews on gender dysphoria. I’m sorry this has happened to you. Good luck I hope you find what you’re looking for quickly.💕
Idk where your parents found this therapist but this is garbage. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. This is NOT an appropriate behavior. This is sexual harassment. I don’t know the whole story, but it seems that your parents are not supportive/are pretty ignorant on the topic. And if they were the one to pick this person… 

What you described is a red flag after red flag. I’ve got some TERFy vibes from that person. There is an issue of hate groups/non-affirming churches/other organizations offering “therapy” which is not provided by properly trained and licensed individuals. If you can, report this person. Talk to someone you trust about it. Reach out to a hotline. And definitely don’t go back.

Therapy, when done properly, is amazing. I second suggestions by other folks here to use psychology today to seek a therapist. You can even look for a therapist who is trans themself. Look for people who adhere to WPATH standards of care
Yoooo this is uh…

you need to put this in a review on one of their pages and cut ties that shit is not okay
Been through a v similar experience i feel you bruh and im so sorry, you're definitely NOT overreacting.
She is a shitty therapist but that doesn't mean that all therapist are bad, it took me a while to move on from what happened with my first therapist but trust me not all therapists are bad not all therapists are gonna misgender you or violate you. You can get better but ofc with another therapist one that'd actually respect you.
May I ask what your pronouns are?
I’ve ever had a bunch of the comments and haven’t seen anyone mention this yet so I guess I will…

I’m guessing that all the creepy, weird sexual stuff is probably because this person is completely uneducated, or has really screwy transphobic ideas about sex or sexual orientation being related to your neurological gender, when it’s not. 

If YOU wanted to talk about that or YOU wanted to talk about your body, that would be fine, but this is super creepy and not something they should be doing. Nor of course should I be miss gendering you
Hi, I'm Irish too. would you be able to say who the therapist was? in a DM maybe. I can also recommend some better ones depending on where you live!
I’m sorry you went through this. You are never overreacting. When you feel uncomfortable, you feel uncomfortable. 
Therapists are just people. If a person doesn’t treat you right, then you distance yourself from them. That therapist should be reported to her supervisor. That’s just inappropriate in so many levels!!
My psychologist misgenders me aswell. She'll be speaking about a group of unknown people of different genders and use the neutral plural, if she says the masc plural (wich is the one we are used to, and even i use it) she will correct herself to the neutral one, but then she will speak about me using fem pronouns and won't correct herself or apologize 😐

But your situation sounds awful, specially the part about describing your chest- if it was me i would find some way to inform someone (her superior, write a review) or something because that's kind of creepy honestly
This person who took your money definitely does not sound like a professional to me! More like a hack who doesn’t actually want to help with anyone’s problems.

Definitely find someone else who actually cares about their patients, and tell that person to just jump off a cliff or something!

I had a therapist that had no idea about transgender issues, but he definitely helped me with other issues. And when he couldn’t help me, he suggested a colleague who could help. That is what a good therapist should do, help you to find the resources!
Therapists are every bit as human as the rest of us and *some just are not very sensitive to their patients'  needs and where they are ""at; ""  what they can handle at any  given point in time.*  I'm really sorry you had to go through all that ;  it was obviously extremely uncomfortable for you, on so many levels.  **Besides all the agonizing focus on your body, there were also the micro-aggressions involving the fact of her refusal to honour your repeated requests for the proper pronouns.**

Meanwhile, the fact is that now you are still left feeling the need for help. ***Despite everything that happened, don't give up.  The worst thing to do is to assume ""well, these therapists -- they're all the same,"" because they are not.  There is someone  ( and more than one )  out there who is a  good fit and will treat you with the respect you deserve while helping you!***

*Ask around and  get suggestions, if at all possible, about therapists from people who have gone to therapy.  Tell your parents to phone around to therapist's offices and specifically ask if the doctor / therapist in question has specific training in dealing with transgender clients and their         ( very real )  issues.*

*Find out from other clients, too, what their therapists' ""bedside manners""  have been like*  ( that is, how they approach patients, and what their manners and attitudes have proven to         be ).  **You deserve so much more than blatant harassment, prejudice, and ignorance.**  Going through what you endured is worse, in its way, than never seeing a psychotherapist at all.

Good luck, much love, best wishes and blessings to you, from Richanne Laura Sylvia.
I do feel you were send for conversion therapy… check the background of the so called therapist.
Report this to the board.
That's a horrible therapist. Please don't give up on therapy in general, there will be ones out there that respect you, your identity, your pronouns, and your comfort.
To add to this, when you look at a profile you can see Communities on the side (or bottom on mobile). Transgender Allied is a community they can say they are a part of.
Yep, this is what I did. It was surprisingly easy to find a good therapist this way
One morning, definitely check their profiles to make sure there aren't any religious references. I ended up getting a therapist for a family issue with all adults who was a former conversion therapy therapist for religious organization. So just keep an eye out. That aside I have had all my other therapists and psychiatrists this way and they all rocked.
Thank you for the advice, I’ll try that
That’s how i got mine
This is how I got mine, she's been absolutely wonderful.
thank you for this!! I've been trying to find a therapist that isn't [some flavour of bad/bigoted] in Indiana, and it's been awful but now it's actually looking positive!
the people on psychology today are reputable? I'm kinda skeptical on the thought but I don't have many options in my area
Yeah i had a trans specific therapist for awhile she was pretty good although i couldnt continue attending
I found mine listed in WPATH. She has been awesome.
They picked this one but if I asked I think they’d let me pick a new one myself
Also sexual harassment. Ask minor to describe their chest? That sound like creep.
Thank you I really appreciate it
This
Thank you, I’m glad you found a good one
I live in Ireland and I don’t think we have anything like that here. Thank you though
They’re trying like they’ve never stopped me presenting male. I hope it wasn’t on purpose, I think it was a genuine mistake
They are supportive or at least they try to be. Therapist was apparently recommended by a friend and was able to see me within the week. I think it was a genuine mistake because I couldn’t find anything bad about her online
He/him
I live in Dublin, if you had any recommendations that would be great. If you don’t know of anyone that’s okay I’m sure I could find something :)
I’m sorry your psychologist misgenders you that’s really shit
I did that and I got someone who wasn't transphobic but was really not well educated or ready to help with trans issues. She just seemed to tick those boxes to try to get more patients. I had my endo recommend some people and they were amazing therapists 

You gotta try therapists one after another until you find one you click with. Finding a good one first try is very rare
I don't know how much vetting they do, but I (eventually) found my therapist there and just LOVE her; she's a lifesaver!
Well that seems like a good indicator at least. I hope you can move past this and find a better therapist!
Noice.
city therapy on dame street has therapists that deal with trans stuff, like Michelle Kelly. you can also look at this website https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/counselling/county-dublin/dublin?category=transgender, can't speak for how good the rest of them are but if they specialise in trans therapy they are very unlikely to misgender you at the least
I’ll definitely look into them thank you so much

Mum tried to enroll me in an all-girls school	"My mother attempted to enroll me in an all-girls school despite the fact that I'm a trans male. She claimed to understand that I was trans but tried to enroll me in not one but TWO all girls schools that I know of. She said that it was to give me a 'better education', she could've just tried to enroll me in the male equivalent of the school (they're functionally the same). I would've been heavily bullied at an all girls' school and I would've had crippling dysphoria.

Edit: I FIGURED IT OUT, SHE'S TRYING TO FORCE HER CHILDHOOD ON ME! (Context: mum is enby) She calls me they opposed to he and treats me like I'm enby and not a trans man. She went to the same all girls' school, she also says that I remind her of me so maybe she's trying to re-live her childhood through me."	"bruhhh as a trans woman who went to an all boys school do not do that it sucks ass
“Tell me you don’t understand trans people without telling me you don’t understand trans people”

Now, in a more serious note. She’s probably going through the same my mom is going through but in the inverse. She feels like she is losing her “daughter” and in her mind she most probably believes you are “confused”. Don’t give in and be firm, it may take time, probably more than it should, but she has to understand that she never had a “daughter” in you; you are her son. This denying is gonna last a while, but you have to just be firm with her. She will have to understand eventually she’s wrong, because if she doesn’t, then the connection with her child she’s trying to “keep” is gonna break for real.

My best hugs to you during these hard times sweety.
LBGT+ schools should be a freaking thing... imagen connecting with a room full of trans people
I assume this is predicated on this being a ""phase"" and in her mind an all girl's school ""fixes"" it?

If so, you realise that's phobic, bullying behaviour?
Parents can suck dome times, i'm really sorry you have to deal with that, i know how hard it can be, be strong with her, stand your ground, i know it's super hard to do with one's patents, but i don't have any better advice 

In any case, i'm sending hugs❤
Ah yes. Because living vicariously through your trans child like this is a good idea.

Pffffft sorry to hear it mate. Wish you the best in this.
FTM NB here. I was forced to go to an all girls school. It was horrible. They literally pathologized my masculinity. Do whatever you can to stop this from happening.
That's so sucky
Wow….I never thought I’d read this before. I swear, I would expect an Enby mother to understand what it’s like to have folks discredit your gender identity. If she truly wants to relive her childhood through you, it should be with love sans acceptance about who you are. Not who she wants you to be.
trans woman who went to an all male catholic school. came out my senior year it was HELL. what a way to radicalize me though.
FTM here! I went to a historically women’s college in southern VA, and it was a tiny liberal arts college, so you had your theatre gays/trans, and everyone else. 

I started out as a cis bi girl, came out as enby, then during graduation season when you’re constantly called a woman, I realized I didn’t actually like being called a woman.

Part of what makes women’s schools work is a tight knit all woman identifying group. There’s usually a shit ton of weird traditions and “cult-like” shit. I’ve run around fields at 2am wearing poster board and hair braids screaming a song for a club, I don’t think you get the same vibes elsewhere. This is just all to say, I’d even ask your mum, like would her experience been different if the school was more co-Ed? The answer should be yes, it would have been incredibly different. I’m a huge advocate for same-gender schools, I think for a brief period they give you a really interesting perspective on things. But just because you’re AFAB doesn’t mean you are a woman. Idk if that all makes sense, it was kinda stream of consciousness typing lol
Omg that sucks so bad. At least, my parents have me in a regular public school. For real, I am sorry. I can relate too. My parents won’t use my pro-nouns at all. They said I’m going through a phase. 🙄
Parents are too much sometimes. They got to let you be who you want to be. I'm sorry she's putting pressure on. You got to stand your guard down and tell her you don't want to go to an all girls school. That you'd be uncomfortable. I don't know your age and how your mom is. Maybe give her some pampkets or leave them around the house. If she doesn't want to listen to you. Educating her may be the better way to go. My children I'd be understanding too. And would never force something in them. Especially because she wants a mini me. Be yourself. Good luck!
First, I'm sorry.  You don't deserve this.  

Second WFT?  We are not supposed to fuck our children up the same way our parents fucked us up.  We are supposed to invent all new ways to screw them up.  

But seriously, this is bizarre.  The worst possible form empathy.  ""Here! Have this trauma! Now we can suffer together!""

Good luck navigating this OP.  I hope she comes to her senses.
I feel bad for you. If you presented as female back then you would've been legally entitled to enroll in a girl's school.
Same, transfemme here that lost my best friend to the shitty gendered system we had (she was a trans woman too)
Oh its horrible
hilarious that this may be my most upvoted comment on reddit, thanks annie wright for putting me through four years of torment so i can achieve this single feat
She 'respects' me by never using my name and she only ever calls me they.
liberal arts college
But then it might seem a bit like segregation. Plus it'd be pretty depressing at a queer school, there'd be dysphoria everywhere
I would pay some One a lot of money to make that
I found it. The school I want to teach at. Like wherever the first LGBT+ school is I wanna be a teacher there.
I send my son to a private school where over half the student body identifies as LGBT+; during our interview in 2020, it was at 60%.  I definitely agree and it is one of the many things we love about his school.  Unfortunately private school is prohibitively expensive for many people, I basically carved everything I could afford to carve out of my budget to afford it.  I definitely wish every kid who wanted to could find a safe space to develop into adults as themselves and learn.
No, she herself is non-binary so I don't know why she does this, maybe she's salty that she had to go to a girl's school. I don't know what goes on in her brain.
Thank you for the advice. I'll try to stand up to her more.
I am a trans guy (didn’t know it at the time) and went to an all girls school. I just about survived but it was awful and I have a trans fem friend who went to the boys school. We were both badly bullied (mind you I think I would have been bullied in the boys school too)
naw i wasn’t out at the time, i only realized i was trans AFTER i left the school lol. it did probably set me back like four years tho lol
that’s awful, i’m so sorry you both had to go through that.
Yeah, that's not respect. My mother called me my name excessively to avoid using he/him, and would use ""they"" *even though I explicitly said multiple times clearly that I only use he/him* so yeah. She's stopped doing that now, but still. Stings even now.
Honestly could teach proper way to view genders, sexuality and such, without the baised views of... well ""common people"" also allow proper development of these people without the limitations that other schools try to implement
Lol more than half the students in all my classes in my liberal arts college were LGBT
As an enby who also went to a single sex school, it could've been that. It definitely made me salty. Your parent needs therapy
Kids are ruthless
yeah i had a similar experience, i didn’t know i was trans at the time but i remember really wanting to go to the girls only side of my school
I go to an all boys school - something interesting that happens here is that bullying is just doesn't happen often.. if there is ever a bully at school everyone usually just turn on them and they will get bullied themselves. If somebody in my school came in one day as a girl, they probably wouldn't get bullied or hurt, but would probably have at least 5 different people asking them out on a date lol
I hate parents like that. She just doesn't get it. I'm not some enby with some unisex gen z name (this is likely what she wants me to be), I'm a boy and my name's Luke.
Except they would probably get the cis straight white man (maybe get a woman) to teach the class...
exactly
Yeah I’m a massive femboy and there was a nasty mentality in the school. All my mates who went there got beaten up daily
I just wanted to go to a mixed school but my mum refused to let me. Despite the fact that in my primary school I was the only AFAB in my year group so I had no idea how to talk to or get on with girls
🤣 this was late 90s early 00s though so being trans just wasn’t as talked about or understood. I knew nothing about trans men and some awful misinformation about trans women and I was a more informed teenager than most (my parents were open about stuff and answered all my questions as best as they could about everything)

I’m really glad your school is good. The teachers were actually some of the worst bully’s towards my friends and would actively encourage name calling.
I'm sorry you and your mates had to go through that
i sorta wanted to go to a mixed school but i never really pushed back against going to school where i was, even though i kinda hated it. and that’s understandable, girls are mysterious creatures my dude. i’ve mostly had guy friends but everyone i’ve been close to has either been a girl or some flavor of genderqueer lol, still no clue how i didn’t figure out i was trans until recently
We survived and are all happy and all the nerdy ones are rich now
I used to try and play fight or be gross because that’s what the boys did to make friends and yeah didn’t go down very well. Girls. Don’t. Like. To. Be. Wrestled. With. Nor do they find farting funny
Hell yea you go my dude
lmao yeah boys are kinda a bunch of fucking animals lol, i find their love of being gross little monkey men… endearing? idk it is funny tho, i can’t really talk cuz i am just as gross as any boy and one of my favorite games is punchies. seriously, why do some girls care so much about farting and burping? it’s funny
Oh my god, I loved playing punchies. I’m tiny though so I would end up bruised and sobbing but refusing to stop playing 🤣

Farting and burping is hilarious.
punchies is great love that game. i always win cuz i can take punches like a champ and i know how to punch well, and i also just have a conviction to not lose lol"	vbtqcf	trans	1006	0.97	2022-06-14 03:08:05
being trans while being poor, in a catholic household, in a muslim country isnt helping my mental health	"i can just hold on for another 5 years till i get the job i want and be able to start medically and socially transitioning, but i was already suicidal before. i dont trust myself to not implode from dysphoria and stress before im able to live as myself.

realizing im trans already broke one of my internal safety switch. the rest might go off, i might relapse back into fantasizing about suicide. im finally feeling that immense gender dysphoria and i dont like it a single bit.

its really hard to find a therapist or anyone at all, i dont live anywhere close to the ones others told me about. and im shitting my pants from the thought of anyone that i know at all knowing that im trans. 

idk maybe im expecting for help, maybe i want the easy way out. ive been distracting myself but its starting to creep into my distractions. 

i just want my feelings to be heard i guess. a part of me wants someone i know to see this. id most likely would deny it anyways so theres no point. 

honestly theres no point in this post now that i think about it.

edit: i honestly didnt expect this many responses. i dont really know how to respond to all the kind messages and put them into words. thank you, truly.

so far im still holding on, i really hope i wont need to feel that dread of suicide anymore."	"i think there is a point to this post

even if it doesn’t lead to much external help, at least you’re talking about it, rather than letting it all build up inside you

if you ever wanna talk, my DMs are open

or contact me on discord: EstiQT#0382 :)
good lord im so sorry youve been born in such shitty situations to be trans in. please stay here anon because once you do get the job youll feel so much safer and better. it seems like its an uphill battle but i wish you best in finding a therapist or someone who can help you more than I can
I'm a """"""muslim"""""" in a muslim household in a muslim country. can relate to the whole experience. I prefer to think of it as my current existence akin to the truman show except im in on the whole show thing. I just need to get another job since this current acting gig just isnt my thing you know ;)

repackaging the stress is nothing more than a coping mechanism, but if it works, it works ya know?
I know the exact feeling. I'm 21, transfem, and living in a house of 6 Pentecostal christians who completely disregard me even after coming out; while also trudging through poverty and debt. 

I don't have a car, so I rely on them; but they refuse to take me to my hormone appointments because they think it's self harm. ""It'd be like buying the razors you'd use to cut yourself"" they said.

And despite being out, theyve never once used my pronouns or name. 

Just, I know the feeling so so well. If you need someone to empathize with you, my DMs are open

Edit: if you prefer discord or anything other than Reddit, lmk and I'll give my info mkay?
Aye, sendin' every ounce o' power I got atcha
Oh god i thought i was the only one. I can relate to this so much. Reading your post was like seeing myself, it’s scary that it’s so relatable. I don’t how to help you, i don’t even know why i wrote this pointless comment. Stay alive and safe, don’t give up on your dreams.
❤❤❤
Jesus how can you still alive. Like being apostate is already hard enough.
As a trans woman from a Muslim family, and also having lived in very conservative places, I feel you. And to be brutally honest with you, you will need your independence to be yourself, whether it's another country or simply moving out. But that does not mean there aren't ways to cope with it until that time comes. There are lots of ways to do things incognito to help you cope with it a bit better. And you can always DM me and talk to me, even if just to vent :) and I don't know about the job you ""want"", but if you are able to get A JOB that will allow you independence, it's worth getting that than living 5 years torturing yourself, and potentially self-harming.
i hate to see people struggle like this while being trans. i can relate somewhat, but only in my past. i grew up being very uneducated on the subject so i was really paranoid abt these things. only reasons i don't relate is because i grew up in america in what i didnt know was a lgbtq+ safe household until i was 17. i barely survived the stress of it, i can only imagine your struggle. regardless, you're far stronger than i'll ever be. very, very very much love to you💙
This way of being a person who was born as male and who feels as female is hard. It takes many years to become yourself, and nobody will feel sorry for you in this world. Humble yourself!

Please please please look into online counseling or telephonic counseling! You deserve a happy healthy life, and someone who’ll listen and offer constructive help.

Try to contact other trans people from Malaysia. I am sure they exist! They will know what you should do and help you on your transition

Yeah we gotta survive. Even if this means losing everyone in our life. We shall not be remembered by our dead name.

malaysia is split between east and west and im at the east. i haven't found anyone here yet and moving to the west is not an option for me now
omg that one!
Sure!
You could travel to get appointments with doctors at least. Maybe even switch to remote sessions once you explain to them your situation."	sxp7dd	trans	1008	0.98	2022-02-21 09:10:41

Came out to work last week and when I got to work this morning after my days off I found this. I was at a point where going stealth wasn’t much of an option anymore. I have had to relearn my job and Iwas having a hard time with Dysphoria. I’m so happy right now and needed to share this with someone.		"Omg this is so heartwarming to see! ❤️
I’m so glad your workplace is so accepting and I wish you love and happiness op
very cool!
Lucky! I come out a few months ago and I've been using the women's restroom and it's p clear that people aren't comfortable. I asked my old boss about it and he said there were 6 employees complaining and ""they need to get the fuck over it"" (his words) I think a neutral bathroom would be great. I don't feel comfortable sharing the room with men, but I'm sure the women I work with don't want to share their bathroom with a ""man"" and I get that... I'm really not trying to make anyone uncomfortable but I'm on spiro and here for 12 hours at a time. I need to pee!
i love everything about this
Now that's what I call having an influence!  😁🥰  Lilli~
That's a wonderful statement on their part. I'm glad you work someplace where you're being supported during what I assume is an incredibly challenging, stressful, and frightening time in your life
It brings so much joy when I see the Gender neutral sign! I can only imagine the pain our community goes through when we don't associate with the cisgender binary. I rarely see those I'm workplaces. Hope this brightened your week and got your weekend off to a good start.
I cried happy tears for the first time in a while.
So cool!!!
The other employees “oh shit oh shit we gotta make sure OP is safe! Fuck it, masking tape will work!”

Seriously though that’s so sweet.
Yay
Ender Neutra
Good for you . The problem is your work doesn’t have a choice because if they don’t embrace your transition  they are bigots and will get cancelled and loose everything they have . This is the problem with cancel culture it is ruining people free thought
Fuck yeah!  People are awesome when they aren't occupied with sucking!
It took me too long to figure out what this was talking about
Thank you so much, have to admit this was totally unexpected for me. I feel so happy
On top of coming out to my bosses at work I also came out to the people at HR. It wasn’t till I did that that these changes took place. Maybe that is something you could try.
Yeah so true
Totally has become a challenge and it was super scary coming out to work but thanks to all of he other posts I see up, it gave me courage
Totally brightened my weekend for sure. I hope you have an amazing weekend also.
I held my tears back for as long as I could
Lol 😂
Oh I'm out to HR. Tldr I came out to a former friend at work and he told a bunch of people and went to HR. There was a company wide sensitivity training that the company's lawyer came into teach. Very obviously because of me and that encounter. Fun meeting not at all awkward.
I'm weak so I couldn't.
Oh dang I mean that’s great they had a meeting but dang.
Yeah, the past couple of weeks have been wild. There's even a few people that I used to be on good terms with who won't even look at or talk to me since I've come out"	pm9fna	trans	995	1.0	2021-09-11 15:28:57
"Erin Reed on Twitter: If you are trans and want to transition in Missouri, you have until April 27th to start before they require 3 years of ""intense dysphoria."" There are a dozen informed consent clinics in the state. Get started on treatment ASAP to be grandfathered in."		"Scary times. This country is hauling ass in reverse.
3 years of intense dysphoria???? Holy shit, how many people will even make it that long once they realize it's dysphoria they are dealing with....

""You have severe depression? Come back in 3 years and then we can help you""
I haven’t even come out to my family yet but I may have to start now and then do it backwards. FuckZ
it is morally okay to lie to health professionals to get treatment
Find here, Erin Reed's informed consent map:

These celebrities who claim to support us need to STOP GOING AND PERFORMING IN THESE STATES. I looked it up and Taylor Swift is in Florida this weekend, is going to Tn soon, and will be in Missouri in a month or two.

As long as they’re still getting live performances and tourism and tax dollars from these artists, they’re never gonna realize how truly abhorrent their beliefs are. It’s easy for a transphobic Taylor swift fan to just not pay attention when she talks about the queer community. We need people like that to be mad because THEIR beliefs pushed their favorite artist out of the state
Not only that but there are now burdensome requirements for continuing treatment that people have to adhere to.
Vote out the GOP. It's the only way to stop this
3 years of intense dysphoria is basically a death sentence for a lot of people.
Anyone in Missouri needs to leave if you can. I know I hate hearing this, I'm sure you all do, but at this point it's not safe for yall. For those who are on a state line, try and transfer your prescriptions to a city in a different state nearby and drive once every 3 months to get them. If you can move, contemplate it. I just want yall to be as safe as you can 💙 for those who can't move, I wish you all the best and know there are people out there fighting for you
I don't think there's any grandfathering in. If there is, please show me the passage or link to the information.
finally, another trans person who uses shinigami eyes ;-;
Thankfully ACLU is already taking action too, as of yesterday
I fuckjng hate this country
Just like germany. Im waiting for 3 years now and have to wait at least one more year just to get a therapy. The therapy must be carried out at least one year just to get the chance to apply for HRT... welcome to my nightmare.
Anxiety and depression are side effects of dysphoria. It's time we start a class action lawsuit if we haven't already, boys and girls and everyone in between!
I know it seems bleak but laws like these won’t last. We can’t give up. Don’t let them win
What percentage of people who passed this bill were cis? Honestly bare minimum we should have some meaningful representation before they start governing us. Fuck them.
The only way this works is if the doctor is going to prioritize new patients to make it happen. Typically, the wait list is going to be longer than a couple weeks. Maybe there will be some clinics or docs that will try to fit people in, but I wouldn't count on this working out.
Plume might be the only choice for those that need it gast
Where i live is just stupid now- im going to overthrow the government. Both US and all the others that are basically like this.
I wouldn't be shocked if this is their way of getting transgender people to self-identify. Using this exact reasoning as motivation. .

Be safe out there friends
Even if you aren't sure you're ready to start, just fill the prescription and hold them until you are ready.
So if I’m already on HRT does this mean that I have to stop it on the 27th?
Well, I’m fucked. Guess I’ll have to move :’)
Everyone of college age should boycott these hateful states and let the colleges know why! My opinion.
love my state....
🤦‍♀️
OH GOODNESS GRACIOUS...... 😱
You can thank God for that. And His oversight committee, the Republican party.
Not only that but you have to “cure” anxiety and depression before you can start. It also bans autistic people entirely from starting HRT. Basically a catch 22 to ban HRT.
*Cries in UK*

It's approaching 4 years since my referral and I've had one appointment with no medical assistance at all. Luckily for me I have the funds to go private but many people I know haven't had that luxury and are still waiting just as long if not longer without any access to HRT or even therapy.
honestly, do it, asap  
and i wouldnt wait either because clinics are probably going to be flooded with new patients. If its possible i feel it would be good to discuss with your parents first but, if you feel its unsafe or they'd try to prevent you from doing it i'd personally just say fuck it and get the hrt
If that treatment is lifesaving like HRT and people are trying to stop you from getting it, yes
Also, FOLX Health is now available in 47 states! It's a pretty quick way to get on HRT if you can't drive to a provider or if there is not one near you or if the wait times are too high
Can you link to that or explain more, please? Most of the news I have seen has only focused on the hurdles to starting HRT.
It literally applies to the prescription of new hormones, it’s guidelines to how hormones are to be prescribed. It’s a terrible document, but knock yourself out: https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2023-04-13---emergency-reg.pdf?sfvrsn=7f78d4fc_2
It's not a screenshot, there's nothing that would show if they were using it or not. Just a link embedded
I think you'll need to do 18 months of assessment but get to stay on HRT during it. I'm worried during the assessment tho I could be stopped at anytime for their bs reasons
Imaginary sky daddy needs to get lost, they should be happy I've read the bible they are not following it in anyway
Well that's fucked. No chance my depression would have ever gone without the hormones. I mean I'm still depressed but far better now.
 It also requires you to undergo conversion therapy first too...
>autistic people entirely from starting HRT.

May I ask why
What’s annoying is these little entry ways will be abused by people stating that you “can get affirming care, they aren’t banning it” but we know that it’s going to have a huge impact. It’s like saying “every kid in the US has the ability to go to school and be successful” not counting the fact that not everyone has equal access to the same level of resources. 

They will be like “every adult has the ability to equal access to this care” knowing that a lot of people will have a hard time meeting the criteria while it perpetuates the conditions that lock them out of care. 

It’s so veiled and full of BS to create outcomes without outwardly saying what they want to say and do.
Well, I came out to my dad this morning. Good news he’s accepting but I knew he would be. It’s my mom that I know won’t handle it well.

Good news is, I might only have to deal with one Christmas after this.
I'd reviewed the document but must have missed paragraph (1)(C) during fits of panic. 

""...continuing prescription or provision of a specific 
intervention that has already begun, so long as the person or health organization 
promptly seeks to initiate the treatments and assessments called for by these 
subparagraphs.""

The wording, however, is very vague. ""Promptly"" could mean within the weak following 04/27/23, or it could mean the following day. It could also mean within 90 days, or it could be subject to the interpretation of whoever has the authority in this situation.
I... what? I swear to god this wasn't the post I commented on, It was a twitter screenshot with a green name (and I recognize that shinigami-eyes green thingy
WHAT
No it doesn't?
Autistic people are more likely to be trans (and trans people are more likely to be autistic) than the general population, so one of the transphobes' arguments is ""the autistics are too simple/easily influenced/lack understanding of social nuances and that makes them trans.""

Actual researchers' theories are that autistic people are less likely to *care* about the social norms, and thus more likely to be able to ask ""does this thing actually make me happy or not"", as opposed to an allistic person who might be unhappy but has accepted social norms so much that ""could I be another gender"" doesn't cross their mind.
Because the cruelty is the point with fascism.
I believe in you, friend. Good luck with the coming weeks. Much love, and stay strong ❤
Well it looks like MO doctors already started denying care to all trans patients regardless, so they are in fact running scared already. I hope ACLU jumps on this.
Yeah, I mean the way I view it is that technically you will have to attend at least one counseling session, but how they intend to monitor that or enforce it is way up in the air. Mine out of pocket is about $120. The 18 month provision kinda screws up the usefulness of their position though. Say I went once, they require only 15 sessions over 18 months. Then the thing expires in a year. It’s way above the legal remit of the AG to actually make these decisions, so it will depend on good drs not running in panic. The document itself is not sufficient to force detrans though, it’s the cooling effect on care I worry about.
It requires a minimum number of hours of ""intensive therapy"" and I think we both know that this doesn't have a trans person's mental wellbeing in mind.

It's at best financial gatekeeping, and a demand for conversion therapy torture at worst
It requires 'gender exploratory therapy' which is just that. The creator of that nonsense lobbied against conversion therapy bans because it would ban her 'therapy'.
autistic people are also more likely to view things like gender and sexuality differently than NTs which explains why there are a large number of trans and queer autistic folk:)
Thnx
This made it even more unclear. Can you maybe use simpler language
...fuuuuuuuuck. I have no words for this shit.
Because as autistic we're to simple of mind, and easily cohersed by others to make decisions for ourselves. 😡
Republicans' end goal is genocide. They think transgender people shouldn't exist and will do whatever they can to kill us.
And here I thought I was just too stubborn to listen to anyone else when if decided things on my own. 🤣

Seriously though, Fuck these fucks. It makes me very glad of where I live and all the more determined not to leave, though I'll give all the aid and comfort I can to those living in places like this and fighting against it.

Had my first real experiences with dysphoria (since realizing I’m trans) in the past few days soo hi, I’m Finn and I’d really appreciate it if you referred to me as he/they or otherwise masc in the comments🥺		"It was the statues. They gave him the dysphoria
Your wish is my command sir. All you need now is a dog named Jake. Can I be the flame Princess? I do a really great impression of lumpy space Princess though. LSP rules
Sup dude, love your hairdo.
Hey handsome. Love your hair and eyes. Bet your smile is great too. Hope you are feeling better. Stay strong.
Hey there Finn, how you doing brother?
Any other sarcastic mofos immediate brain response be to insult this dude affirmingly? My queer friends and I do nothing but bully eachother with proper pronouns. So to welcome you to the community in the best way I know :
Lol look at this dude sitting In front of a bunch of statues. He probably thinks he’s a cool dude. Him and his green hair and back pack. Probably is super nice too, lol what a lame guy. 

Jokes aside you seem like a great guy. Welcome to the club my man
Yo Finn, what’s up broski ? Like dysphoria sucks bro, totally not tubular. Make sure you take care of yourself brosif and shred some sick waves my guy
Hey cool guy, just wanted to let you know that if I were into boys, you'd be sitting at the top of my list ;)

Hey everybody, y'all hear about this handsome guy Finn and their badass pronouns? He also has a pretty suave headband and they have some really cool knowledge on these South Korean statues, which aren't half as manly as he is
Hi bro! Nice to meet you. Love your style, you look very handsome in those pictures. Hope you are doing ok today!
Sorry to hear that bro. You have our support.
Yoo, whadup dude. Sucks that youre experiencing that but i can tell you with 100% confidence you look handsome. I *love* the hair btw.

Take care mate
Hi Finn!! Nice to meet you bro!
Hey Finn! Love your headband.
Hey, another Finn! Welcome to the club man, love your headband!
No problem man.
Those are some dope statues too btw.
Heyy I’m Finn too! You’ll get through this I promise, being trans is hard but you’re not alone and just wait for gender euphoria :)
What's good, broseph?
Bruh. What are those statues?
Sure thing, Dude. It's definitely a trip to recognize dysphoria for what it is and then get more. It does feel different once you KNOW what it is.
You are very handsome Finn.
I like your name
You're very handsome Finn!
Ayo my names Finn too
If it helps I'm a fairly cis female and I thought you were a cute guy!
You're so handsome! Love your green hair!
You look so handsome!
You're looking handsome today, Finn. Your eyes have so much soul in them. :)
Heya Finn, I'm sorry that you're having a rough go of it right now. I hope you feel better soon!
Handsome young man
Hey Finn man, how have you been? I said to a friend last night ""have you met Finn, he's a really cool guy"" and they said they hadn't! Hope you are well!
Hi dude, what up my guy, what hanging man, how's my male friend doing.
my man Finn out here w/ the wacky ass statues
FINN GIMME THE GOD DAMN HEADBAND. I WANT IT /j
Ayyy you have the same name as I do! Hello fellow Finn!
I love your hair, Finn. You look real handsome in the photos! Also you have such great fashion sense, atleast to me. Wish I could get me some clothes like that, maybe specifically that trans headband. And your piercings are awesome. 

Hope you have a good day Finn!
Ha I almost thought you were my ex bf posting on r/trans the first time!! You look just like him :) Good luck on your journey it's gonna be a great one
Hey dude!  Welcome Finn, pull up a chair it is going to be a wild ride! But it will be worth it!  Hang in there we will be right here rooting for you.
Well hello good sir!
Hey man I’m finn too
Finn looks like he is having fun
Hi Finn ! Love your cap !
Ngl, I thought you said you were from Finland but forgot Finn is a name by itself :’)
It was that man there, they took my food.
Love the headband 🥰
HEY BROTHER
Hey Finn! I see those statues from Jeju Island, aren't they so cool? The island as a whole is a fun place, did you get to go to any cool museums? When me and my buddies went in October we went to the Chocolate museum and the Teddy Bear Museum. 

Anyway, nice to meet you bro!
The boys and me send our wishes bruda 😘
Have a glass of water and put on music you like, it always helps me when I feel dysphoric, you got this king, we're all rooting for you!
You're hot. Like, really hot
What's up bro, welcome to the team.
Hello handsome  ;)
NP. TBH in the past few days I realized I was trans and am still coming to terms with it myself. If you want to be a man, you are one in my book. (I'm AMAB and like female pronouns...that's as far as I've gotten in figuring out myself ATM).
Finn, you’re such a handsome guy.
We love you Finn 💕 congrats on starting to figure stuff out dude :)
u are beyond cool! i love ur hair 🥰🥰
hope ur doing ok dude ❤️ it can be hard but we are all here for you!
OK i know there is the terms of She/ Her , He/Him , He/They. Is there such a word of someone calling themselves IT ? He/IT , She/IT ? 

I'm very curious about this. If someone could answer this I'd appreciate it Thank you
Better put some apples under those mini shrines…
https://t.me/joinchat/U9xpW3yKvGUL6FDM
Sup, Finn. Really love the hair, it's cool and unique.
Fun fact, bc I can’t resist - this specific type of statue is called hareubang, originally a statue of protection and fertility, today pretty much a symbol of Jeju Island (South Korea). I went there at the end of my exchange year and these statues were everywhere, very cool
I’ma be honest, I only have the most basic knowledge of that show, despite my name😅 I’ve been told it’s great tho, so maybe I should watch it 🤔
Ahh thanks!! It’s getting really long so I need to go trim it haha, but I think it’s one of my favorite styles so far
Thank you!!
This is helping more than anticipated actually, so I’m feeling a bit better now thanks😊
Ahh thank you, thank you! I kinda wanna do the friendly-bullying thing sometimes but I’m always too scared I’ll like actually make someone upset😭 (completely fine with people doing it to me tho!)
He's a trans guy not a trans surfer xD
Wow hahah, I’m flattered😌 thank you!
Thanks! Also I love the phrasing “fairly cis” hahaha
It is a pretty great headband👌🏻
Yoo hi!! We should start a club hahah, I think there’s like 3 more in this comment section
Thank you!! I’m hoping to add some more piercings soon-ish, but it’s pretty expensive where I live and I’m kinda broke hahah
Oh wow, I can imagine that was a bit of a trip hahah. And thank you!
Ahaha yea, it doesn’t help that I’m from Sweden so people kinda get it mixed up a lot😅
God yea, I loved Jeju! I was there in June, so I spent a lot of time outside (if you look closely at the pic you can actually see the sunburn I got on my neck/shoulder😂), but I went to the Alive Museum I think it’s called? And the O’sulloc green tea museum and the Haenyeo museum, they were all really cool
Thank you!!
Oh wow hahah, thanks!
Well it took me like 2,5 years to get as far as “well I still don’t know if I’m 100% a man, but I’m definitely more dude than not” hahah so. Take your time, you’ll get there :)
Thanks! It’s a little scary but at the same time I can’t imagine going back to how it was before hahah
OoO
That's really cool
Wow I learned learned something today :0
It's not for everyone but I thought it was entertaining for a while. Some of the later seasons got a little boring but it's a decent show overall.
Glad to hear it! Dysphoria is a rough gig. I hope you have an amazing day and do something that makes you feel great. Take care of yourself out there okay?

Having a rough time with dysphoria lately, my mom says she thinks I could go out without makeup and no one would clock me but idk, HONEST feedback and advice would be great :) (20 MTF 11 mo HRT)		"Honestly, you pass flawlessly. Eyes, hair, face, all very feminine.
100% passing. Honestly.
She’s right. Listen to mom.
Tried to include a couple angles with my hair back and with it normal. My dysphoria has been kicking my butt for like the last few months and there has been little relief, I’m very insecure about my appearance with makeup let alone without. I prefer honesty so I can use it to help me work on things so thank you to anyone willing to give feedback.

Oh and I’m not wearing any makeup in these pics for anyone that cares.

Also feel like my hairstyle isn’t very feminine but don’t really kwtd at it’s current length so advice on hair is welcome too thanks!
I would not have clocked you personally. You could totally go out with no makeup!
You look more femm then most cis girls. It's almost frightening:o
All I see is a beautiful woman. You look incredible, hun 💜
I subconsciously look for trans people when outside and i wouldn’t clock you at all
Very cute.
honey, you look fantastic even without makeup; if i saw you out and about in public I'd be absolutely none-the-wiser. you've got this :)
We are always our own worst critic. Seriously from the bottom of my heart you pass.
She's right.  I wouldn't be able to tell.  You pass flawlessly.
Girl you're fucking gorgeous!
I'd listen to her, there is no way I can see anyone clocking you!
You don’t need any makeup unless you just enjoy wearing it. You pass 100%! You are very lucky. Enjoy it!
You're a beautiful lady, and that's exactly what people will see <3
Oh yeah. 
Straight up, don't think anyone would notice based on your appearance.

Even with the pre-existing knowledge that you are mtf. At least in these pictures, I personally would not have been able to tell.
Mom's know best. You are stunning. This the thing with dysphoria, we constantly doubt and question ourselves even though reality is different.
You're blessed to have a mom who has your back. Now listen to her and be more confident in her as well as yourself
I honestly think you pass.
Yeah, you really don't need make-up to pass.
you pass even without makeup!
I agree with the others here, you don't need makeup, you pass
Girl take it from a 20 y/o lesbian. 

You are fucking beautiful and if I saw you? I wouldn’t question if you were cis, I’d be wondering what satanic ritual I’d need to do to look like you.
Listen to momma on this one :)
Go out!! You look perfect!
I’ve seen you post before and truth be I told I have a crush on you lol

You look fine. You should listen to your mom
Yes you pass hell I'd probably hit on you
I agree with your mom. All you need is the confidence and to feel comfortable
I agree with her.  I think it would take someone looking very very closely to even remotely consider it.  I doubting would have if I saw your pics in a non-trans sub. Most people don’t put that much thought into random people they pass by.

So for what it’s worth, you pass and you look good doing it as far as I’m concerned.
You look pretty. Kind of like Hailee Steinfeld
you most definitely look like the woman you are
I think your hair would look really good if you did it in a little half bun, [like this](https://sf2.mariefranceasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/08/6-1-361x410.jpg)

You pass btw, just thought you'd look super cute with that hairstyle lolol
You look amazing, I understand the dysphoria part it kinda creeps up and can catch anyone off guard don't let it get the best of you
I sure wouldn't clock you!
You look cute as hell.
My first thought upon seeing your picture was '🎶she's a lady 🎶' (as in the full thing of the lyrics of the song)
You absolutely pass and look BEAUTIFUL just as you are.
You kimda look like this actress named Alexandra Barreto, but like a younger and prettier version xD honestly more femme too. You look amazing and you pass extremely well!!!
Never would have clocked you. If wearing makeup helps you feel good, then wear it though! Nothing wrong with that, but you certainly don't NEED it. Same with a hair cut, you could go in and ask for something that maybe frames your face a little better (like a long bob maybe?), but again you don't NEED it to look more feminine.
your mom is right! you look great.
100% passing. You look beautiful and like a girl.
cute!
13/10 cute woman, would beat up your dysphoria for you
pretty 😊😍🤗
You pass, like, 100%.
Ur beautiful
I definitely wouldn't have noticed, this is just a cute selfie to me!
I agree with your mom
Gorgeous girl 🥰
You are very passable darling. Remember the feminine actions are far more helpful to not being clocked. Something that helps me is to practice being more feminine in my walk and mannerisms, this allows me to trick myself into seeing more of the woman inside.
You actually have natural beauty.  I would think - not that my opinion matters - that you are your own harshest critic.  You may even mistake an admiring look for something else.

I know I'd be checking you out! ;-)
You pass !! Re-ironing your hair would work as well ^-^
This is a girl.
I think you look very cute!
You look great! Your mom is right.
I dont think you NEED makeup. Mascara and light eyeliner with a dark brown pencil (look for ""espresso"") will highlight your eyes and you'll still have that lovely fresh faced look. Lightly line the outer 2/3 of your eye, don't do the whole line, or your eyes will look closed and smaller.
To tell you the truth, if I passed you on the street, I'd not notice, I'd pass by you and think, damn, why can't I get my HRT, she so pretty
Definitely pass. You look like one of the daughters of my aunt's friend.
Super confused because I thought you were cis at first, so yeah. You pass.
You pass really well without makeup! And you are very beautiful!
Jeez. Not that passing is the goal for everyone but we could be roommates and I wouldn't think you're cis.

Edit: would! Not wouldn't! Oops
Shes not lying, i would have just went on thinking your were full on female and not mtf
You definitely pass
Honestly as a straight man,  I think you look like a princess.
Sexy and beautiful
Dont listen to her if you dont want to, your an adult and your own person. And you look great
You're so feminine!! Really pretty and you absolutely pass 100%!
I don't see anything but woman, although definitely not 20
in all honesty you pass perfectly, you look gorgeous <3
I think you look fine as you are. Your mom is right
Looking good, keep being you!
Your Mom is right you look great....
If this pic is without makeup, then your mom is 100% correct.
Oh my gosh you look great!
Totally Fem undetectable 🏳️‍⚧️❤️💋💗💋💗🥰
You look fine Queen!
Mom is right and being real w you. Maybe just some casual Burt's Bees tinted lip balm (not saying to pass more but for me it's like a mini power up lol)
I understand sis. It took me a while to feel comfortable without my ""war paint"" on.

Not only do you pass, but you look damn cute too!
The first picture I was looking hard, and then gave up... She is right!
The others... Girl got looks! (I hope I get too look that good too!)
You look great! Keep killin it!
You look great, girl. Go be you!
You pass excelently!!
you pass so well, and youre super pretty ! your features are so soft
Queen you look great!
You are cute. I think you will be good.
You honestly pass more without makeup than I do with makeup, your mom is totally right!
😍😍😘, estás muy bonita así sin maquillaje
You pass.  I'll tell you why.  You have a the right bone structure for it.     

But in the end, you just gotta ease out of the mindset of worrying about what other people think of you.  Don't let your happiness revolve around how you THINK people might see you.  Just be happy being you, doing your thing, being with friends, living life, laughing and loving, all that hokey advice.  It works.  Its hard.  You might never get there 100%, but it's worth every inch of inner peace you can find.  :)
BITCH we have discussed this smh, you're fucking STUNNING and honestly pass 100%
You honestly look a bit like this one girl who went to my highschool. So yeah, your mom's probably right.
You are absolutely divine. Gorgeous 100% 😍 😍 😍 😍
Okay, so it's important that I preface this by saying that I'm firmly against giving people false or insincere compliments. The thought of someone being put in danger because people told them they pass when they may not is terrifying to me.

So I hope that when I say this, you know that I mean it wholeheartedly: you absolutely pass without a drop of makeup. If I saw you out and about, I would assume you were cis and the only double-take I'd be doing is the ""wow, she's cute AF"" kind, haha. You are extremely pretty and your entire look is super feminine.

I hope this helps and that your day gets a whole ton better from here 💜
OMG! I loved! 😍🥰
I...Id say you listen to mommy on this one. You look candidly feminine! :3
Is that you without make up? Bcos ur skin is beautiful! Naaa you look so good if anybody stares it’s because you’re so pretty 🤩
...mom is right on. You totally pass. So serenely beautiful. My God. My heart just hurts looking at u....
I'm jealous of your mom and she's right
You pass completely! I would have never guessed!
I'm extremely jealous tbh I wish I started hrt when I had my first desire for it
I'm sorry about that, but I think you pass queen! 👑
I think that you look like a beautiful woman already, my advice is do what you think is right with what you are doing, if you want to wear makeup, then wear makeup,if you don't you don't need to, if you still want to dress masculine while transitioning, you can do that, all you need to know is in my eyes you pass even without makeup hun (:
(I'm not good at this since I get gender dysphoria myself tho I'm Genderfluid)
It's 2021, forget about passing and just live your life.
If someone says you are not pass well, they are lying.
You look very feminine :) so yeah you'll pass :)
100% pass, you look great.
You 100% pass! Trust me!! Go out and show your beauty off! You're absolute goals! 💖💖💖🥰
You can, your so pretty
Damn right you could! Your mom wasn’t lying 😉
If this is you without makeup,,,,,OMG!!!! You look lovely. Go out more without makeup and more pics without makeup would be much appreciated
I'm with your mom... You look amazing 🤘🏼
Honey if this is you without makeup then your mom's right, you are gorgeous!
You look like the kind of girl where like, if I was at a part where I didn’t know a lot of people and I was feeling anxious, I’d probably notice you and kind of float across the room and start talking to you. You give off safe cool girl vibes.
You’re beautiful! Go out and be yourself! Good luck!
Srsly, 7, IMHO you are even more beautiful without makeup!!!
Your cute, i would hit on you
If i wasn't on a trans subredit, I would've thought you were just a girl without her makeup on. 
100% passing as a girl
Honest feedback? You pass girl.

If you have voice training I doubt anyone will be able to see anything but a cute cis girl, especially if you put on makeup.

Your hairstyle IS feminine btw.
Well honestly, I wish I passed as well as you do. Short hair can absolutely be feminine and yours is absolutely feminine and I love it! Of course if you think you'd prefer longer hair, I'm sure you'd rock that too. <3
Happy cake
To be a little more clear: Your face has a very soft feminine shape, and your eyebrows are so perfect and very feminine like the angles and slimness of them are so good! You radiate femininity, and I know dysphoria is the worst but honestly you have such pretty eyes too, and such long eyelashes! Like this is you without makeup?? I am jealous, you're so pretty!"	ptsje5	trans	986	0.99	2021-09-23 10:45:41
Watching all of my friends leave me is fun.	It’s not even because I’m trans it whatever. It’s because I’m so fucking miserable due to it. Dysphoria is kicking my ass and everyone’s just so sick of me. I’m tired of it all. I have barely any support anymore and I just wanna die most of the time. I don’t know anymore. I’m just so tired.	"I can't really comfort other than saying I know how You feel. You're not alone suffering like that. I do too and I hate it.

Feels weird upvoting this
I can relate
I can sympathize. My mental health was so bad a few years ago, and I kept having negative thoughts.  I started arguing with them,  sometimes out loud and sometimes the people I know still from then laugh about it but I'm pretty sure sometimes that the only thing that stopped them from cutting me out like the family who I lived with at the time was not having to put up with me in person. 

That was at least three years prior to starting my transition,  and I'm pretty sure that stress from being an egg trans woman more or less led directly to it. I'm doing okay these days though, I hope you get there too, sis. *hugs*
You will find real ones. Anyone that leaves you because of this needs to grow up.  You will find one or two that will come back and apologize at your feet. Just hang on and hang in there.
Not really friends in the first place then
I'm sorry that you are going through that.

Sometimes it is good to just step back and concentrate on other things in your life.

Trans stuff seems huge and it is, but it can't be all encompassing. One has to be a whole person.

It is also good to find your local trans community, who are better able to understand your trans related issues and give you resources and strategies for dealing with them. 

You can get through this!

Good luck!
If you feel like talking about it I'm here Oki? I care about you 🥺
Too relatable, too much the majority of what happens to us.
I have a friend in a similar situation and try as I might she doesn't want to meet up and keeps things distant. I keep pushing and she won't give. We are fine so it's stressful.
I know it’s not the same as having friends in person but if you ever want to chat with someone who accepts you for your true self, my messages are always open ❤️
There are gender therapists out there that can help u with the dysphoria
I feel the same.  I'm just so miserable all the time.  Im amazed my wife is still around.
I am so sorry honey I know people are rough and annoying especially and people grow closer sometimes it fades. But they rather not be with the kick ass person you really are
I sure as hell feel alone..
I do wish I had anything to help ease dysphoria, but all I can do is just cry and wait.
I’m in a similar situation but I don’t really blame my friends as I essentially shut down tbh and stopped leaving my dorm room
I just don’t really have any community and honestly just feel like I don’t belong. I always feel so alienated and I’m too depressed to really integrate into em. Idk it’s just.. im too scared at this point due to the amount of times I just get yelled at for trying
I mean I can talk. It’s just the matter if anyone really wants to hear from it because it’s.. yknow
That’s nice, Ty
Yeah I wish I had one
Hey atleast you have somebody very close to you caring
Heh, I’m no kickass person.. at most I’m just kinda bland.. idk. It’s just yeah
Same. It sucks.
Well, we don't know your complete story, so you will have to enlighten us if we are to help.

What did you try to do that got you yelled at, and by whom?

Where did you try to find help in the trans community that left you alienated?
Only if you want and are comfortable huhu, but know I'm there oki? Also, so sorry for late reply-
I wasn't much on reddit recently-

Finally had the courage to go into a beauty supply store. Got immediately kicked out.	"I'm literally just standing outside the store crying right now. I absolutely hate being seen as a sneaking teen boy who's probably going to steal something. 

I finally built up the courage to go into a really cool looking beauty and makeup store I walk past on my way to work every day (just to look around, see big selections of beauty products for the first time and the like)

I was wearing my dysphoria hoodoe because I was really self conscious about going in since I'm still almost fully boymoding. I'll admit I probably looked a bit sketchy but I really don't know what to do to combat that assumption.

A seemingly nice clerk (about in his 50's) came up to me while I was taking a look at the eye-lashes and started talking to me about them. I asked him about the single lash packs and he explained to me how you go about applying them.

But then he started getting pretty hostile towards me and said ""ok buddy it's time to go."" I didn't really know what to do as I've never been kicked out of a store before so I just asked ""what?"" And he replied ""yup, you're done here"" and started herding me towards the front of the store and pushed me out the front doors. I didn't really respond after that as all I could do while we walked to the exit was try and stop my self from breaking down and bawling.

I just want to be able to walk in the store and look around. Why is that such a horrible thing for me to do? Why do I look so much like a horrible sneaky dude?"	"That's terrible, so sorry you had to go through that. Try not to let it discourage you though. And definitely leave them a bad review, companies like this deserve the backlash they receive.

Was it an Ulta by chance? They were in the spotlight a few years ago after several employees spoke out about a company policy of kicking out anyone who they thought didn't belong in the store. Teenagers, especially those in large hoodies or with backpacks and non-white shoppers were always targeted. The cashiers at the front of the store had to notify the whole team via walkie talkie if they saw someone like that come into the store.
If it helps, it likely wasn't cause you were trans. A lot of ""classy"" places like that have a policy of kicking out anyone who doesn't support the store's image. So if you're not either hot or rich looking you'll get herded out.

Really sorry this happened to you though, that's so not okay on so many levels.
I'm not sure they r allowed to do that, we couldn't do that when I worked retail even if we saw then steal something this clerk is obviously in thr wrong and should be reported
Fuck that place. Try MAC or Sephora. They’re both usually really welcoming. Sephora even hosts (or used to it got squashed like everything by the pandemic not sure if it a restarted yet) a class called Bold Beauty purely for transgender people to learn makeup and skin care.
> I absolutely hate being seen as a sneaking teen boy who's probably going to steal something.

Even if you were a teen boy, why is that a problem? They shouldn't discriminate against you based on your age or gender. That's horrible.

If you're able to, please leave a negative review for their business on Google. Or if you happen to be on Twitter, name and shame them.
Imagine literally giving up business just to be an asshole
Sephora is 100% trans inclusive, to the point that they have a hands-on (normally, they're doing them online during the pandemic) beauty class called Bold Beauty for the Transgender Community. All the girls there were super welcoming and helpful the first time I went to get help picking out a good foundation.
Drop the store name so we can avoid their transphobic asses
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I don’t know what the store clerk was thinking, but it’s absolutely not your fault, and not because you looked like a horrible sneaky dude. 

Whatever he was thinking, it was because of his preconceived biases and assumptions, not a reflection on who you actually are. 

I sincerely hope your day gets better. ❤️❤️❤️
Omfg leave them a terribly review if you can. They absolutely deserve to get called out and shamed for this sort of discrimination.
Ring their head office. That's beyond bullshit.
They probably broke the store's shoplifting policy by doing that so I would definitely write a review or contact their district manager if you have the time and patience but its totally understandable if you want to forget the whole situation. Stores generally dont approach shoplifters because they risk their reputation and lose a sale because even shoplifters buy something while they're stealing.
Even if you were a cis boy, this is still bs.
I don't know if this will make you feel any better but; I have also been kicked out of a make-up store before, even though I'm AFAB and I was presenting feminine at the time. The store clerk probably thought I was a broke teen going in to steal things and kicked me out with no explanation. It was probably the case for you too. 

I know it is pretty upsetting and it was for me too but I'd say try not to dwell on it too much and try going to another store when you have the courage. It would be best if you could go in with a supportive friend but if you don't have any, you can simply tell the clerk that you are looking for a gift for your girlfriend (even if you don't have one) and have them help you to find one for your supposed, totally real, 'girlfriend' lol

Sending you much love and support :) <3
What in the living fuck?  I live in Nebraska which is far better than Texas but also far from the most progressive state.    


As a pretty clearly non passing transwoman, most cosmetologists are tripping over themselves to give me great customer service because they know they can sell me the expensive stuff!   


This is what the transphobes and the terfs want though.  They want jim crow laws for queer people.
sorry to hear that, idk why theyd do that, people suck, maybe try again with a trusted friend or something?
Report that ahole! Very unprofessional and clearly discriminatory. Nobody should be brought to the point of tears because they wanna shop somewhere! Fuck that guy.
That clerk was in the wrong entirely. Especially if you felt you were physically intimidated into leaving. Asking you to leave is one thing but herding you out is beyond any sort of logical reasoning. 

If you can, contact the store or the company and file a complaint. If they don't take you seriously make your complaint known via reviews/word of mouth. 

Hope you feel better soon ❤
What the hell? So he just kicked you out for no reason? That’s fucking ridiculous. You should’ve asked to speak to his manager - no Karen joke intended, I mean that seriously. Also, try to see if they have a corporate number, and if they do contact someone about what happened. That bullshit is completely unfair.
Is that legal?
what an old fart. ""yup, you're done here""??? Is it even possible to be that narcissistic
All genders are allowed to learn about beauty, so it is terrible on so many levels.  This is really sad.  I’m so sorry.  For what it is worth, I have heard that Sephora tends to be better about this (I see a number of others said the same).  But anything can happen anywhere.  I hope very much that you will find these incidences to become increasingly isolated the more you do things as your true self.
For sure leave a bad review, maybe even email someone in the chain of command if you think that something would change. Especially since it was unwarranted and he talked to you about the products beforehand.
I'm sorry that happened. That clerk should be fired. He's most likely a transphobic ass.
Call corporate
Seriously you should anonymously call that store and ask for a manager then explain everything that happened including how it made you feel. They need to know they just harassed a trans kid and not a thief.
That’s absolutely awful I not long ago build up this courage too I know how you must feel, I suggest going there a different time in more fem clothing and see the same person and explain the situation to them, a lot of beauty and cosmetics stores get plenty of trans fems visit and are always happy to help them feel affirmed
Could it have been the hoodie? Me and my friends were kicked out of a pub once for wearing beanies. Citing the security cameras can't see our faces. About 5 meters away there were two very old ww2 vets in naval uniform,  complete with hats, in wheel chairs.

Jokingly I said to the person throwing us out ""what about them in their hats"". Without skipping a beat, the bar steward proceeds to walk over and asks them to leave too.

Some people are just C U Next TuesdayS.
Email or otherwise contact the owner/manager of that store and file a complaint of discrimination.
What the fuck even a grown cis man could walk into a makeup store and buy whatever the fuck he wants. What does that even mean. They're nuts. You better stay as far from that shithole as possible
That's so damn terrible, sorry you had to go through that!

I personally think that clerk should have been arrested. And that if you're going to be a trans girl, just go to a different beauty store than what you got kicked out of.

If there's a Sephora inside one of the big department stores near your residence, try there. Sephora carries makeup made by even LGBT supportive companies.
This is awful and I'm really sorry to hear that. And as someone who's worked retail that's not an okay thing to do to a customer and I would report them to the stores owner/manager
That's terrible.  I wish I was there to walk back in there with you and help you pick out the perfect lashes, and then ask for another clerk to get the commission instead of that dickhead.
omg there is so much to unpack here ☹️ first of all i am so sorry this happened to you - and i hope you’re able to access other stores with nicer employees. what i’m genuinely extremely confused about is why is there a 50yrs old bigoted man doing working at a beauty store????? isn’t there like a garage where he’d rather work at or something??
Girl I’m so sorry that happened. What happened to you was very bizarre and not ok. If you ever want to talk about it give me a DM! I can’t solve your problems but I can listen.
In my country selecting customer is an Infraction (deny selling), you need to caught someone stealing to exit them out.

The store are public place, so as long as you are there in the open hours nobody can push you out.
(Some racist store owner have try on my friend tough....)

And as a AMAB (lot older though) people just assume I'm buying for my wife....
Go back in and steal as much stuff as you can /j
[removed]
If I were in your place, I'd leave a Google review telling your story. A similar thing happened to me, and I did exactly that. It was out of rage and I didn't think it would actually be useful, but every once in a while Google notifies me my review has been read by 2k+ people (and counting), so, there's that.
Name and shame this place because I'm sure they can't kick someone out because of whatever dumb reasoning they had. Time to go because what? You don't look like their usual clientele? Fuck them, that's not how you treat potential customers. I'd have challenged him and I'm not a confrontational person, especially if he pushed me towards the exit for no reason.
That's so shitty!! I'd go in there and make a scene for you 🤬
That's awful. I'd speak to the store manager if I were you
Follow the formal complaints process and try to blow it up as much as possible. 

Companies shit their pants when this stuff happens because reputational damage is so bad for business.
In what country did that happen? I'm not sure that kind of behaviour would be legal where I am from.
Wow, you have more courage than me when I was your age. You’re incredible 💖

Don’t feel disheartened. It’s terrible that you had to go through that. You’re great. That clerk was a jerk!
They're not allowed to physically remove you from the store, that's battery. Report it.
I'm so sorry.  This was rude and you didn't deserve it.

When I was first experimenting, I had the benefit of friends to help me shopping.  2 people are less likely to casually shoplift than one, and harder to pressure out.  

Most of my early solo trips for feminine stuff were at big box stores like Walmart.  Nobody cares what you do there, what you buy, how you look, nothing.  (At least, nobody cared about me). 

I wouldn't go back there, but if you decide to, I would intend to buy something.  It could be the eyeliner he was showing you.  Don't shop alone like you usually would, go talk to the guy first and tell him you would like to buy that eyeliner.  

If you want to turn it around, wear it the next day and check if he is free, show him you are wearing it, and tell him if you like it.  

He doesn't deserve that kind of effort, but you could think of it as practice, for someone who does, or a future situation you can't avoid.  

A passive ""fuck you"" would be to show up full femme, skirt, blouse, makeup, and ask him about the eyeliner he was showing you.  Again, only if you want to actually buy it.  

Whatever you do, I wish you the best.
This. I was forced out of a restaurant because I was wearing shorts… apparently it wasn’t appropriate attire?

Joke was on him though cause his manager noticed they were Balenciaga and suddenly said I was allowed in to which I swiftly told them to fuck off.
Ahhhh capitalism...
Yeah, I agree with this.

A lot of trans people will immediately blame their transness as the source of their problems. In many cases it's not that at all, rather something else entirely.

Is being trans completely neutral? Not right now. It does make life harder, depending on where you go. But not everything is about being trans.
I second this definitely report it
[removed]
I go into Sephora all the time while in fem and they always welcome me so warmly. I always feel so good.
That's horrible. I'm sorry that happened. 

Edit: My phone auto corrected. I fixed it.
I accompanied a there mtf friend there and the lady was super nice and did some makeup for my friend right before we bought it
Yeah, I think any place like this should be named and shamed. And, for our own protection to avoid it as well.
Exactly! I am so sorry about this situation. Whatever this asshole was thinking is unclear, but he was biased for sure and you DO have the right to look around ANY store! Hope you can find other stores were the workers are gentle and kind 💖✨
Unfortunately yes, if the company is privately owned they are allowed to decide who can or cannot shop in Their stores.
Lol cringe transphobe
Only the nicest restaurants that I've heard of have dress codes. It's a weird thing.
I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that ""I, a baby trans, was forcefully escorted out of a makeup shop the first time I got up the courage to enter"" was about them being trans.

There's a good chance it wasn't but when one of you're first steps into the areas that feel like rheyre exclusively for your identified gender go that wrong it's hard not to feel like it was cause you're trans.
I third this as a former manager, married to a manager from a different company. Report it. He might get fired. He needs to learn better. Boomers are often closed minded asshats.
Companies might but employess don't. Having worked for many retail places you can't do that
and flammable shit burns yet some of us wake up in the morning and decide not to be that person
On legal grounds, yeah, a business can deem someone a trespasser, but on a company level, that dude's probably going to get \*fucked\* by Loss Prevention for that if it gets reported in a complaint.
Awesome isn’t it? Love that place.
If the clerk is 50 he'd be a genX wouldn't he?
I wasn't saying it was a good thing by any means, I just replied to a comment with what I thought was helpful information. I'm sorry.
Oh yea he is screwed to hell, hopefully gets fired.
Its amazing
Right in the middle of GenX. I'm 40 and a millenial.
At this point I interpret boomer as a general concept of “middle aged entitled/judgemental/regressive asshole,” not strictly a generational divide
Dunno. My mom is 58, and a boomer. 🤷
That's not the issue. While companies are well within their right to choose who they sell to, and by extension - in retail settings - who is allowed in their stores, this generally comes with a checklist of characteristics, or behaviours that need to be displayed for it to be justified. Someone walking into a shop in a hoodie, with a backpack, and looking suspicious because they're fidgeting isn't enough, and shouldn't be enough to kick someone out of a shop for being perceived to be either out of place, or a threat; to others or too the store. Creepy ain't a crime.
I'm sorry too!
The fact that major chains like that can become safe spaces… it really gives you hope.
Nice
Yes.
Once again, not what I was saying. I replied to the comment which Sayed that they thought people weren't allowed to be kicked out.
Yeah it really does, to be able to ask for help with make up and having someone patiently explain the differences between two kinds is very helpful. While also recommending ones for me since i dont know a lot about makeup
Ah, see I misunderstood you. Sorry if I sounded like I was standing against you. You're right, places of business can pick and choose their customers as they see fit. It's just a shame that it can lead to events like OP went through"	tyj4aa	trans	946	0.98	2022-04-07 18:15:36
quick question, can you be trans if you don’t experience dysphoria? j think i might be but i don’t rly get dysphoria		"It's possible you've experienced it without knowing it. That was my case. I would shut down whenever I went clothes shopping at the mall (shopping for Male clothes). I've noticed that my irritability would increase whenever my facial hair grows out. I also have very few male presenting pictures I like of myself, but the female presenting ones I love with a passion. Before I took female presenting photos, I never experienced the joy (gender euphoria) of looking at myself. 

Reading this really helped:
https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en

The gender dysphoria bible is a great resource .
Try replacing ‘dysphoria’ with ‘dissatisfaction’.
Would you say you have Dysphoria now?
i didn’t know to what extent i was dysphoric until i started living and presenting as my true gender expression
Euphoria is a much better indicator than dysphoria. Not every trans person experiences dysphoria, or is conscious of experiencing it. I had no idea dysphoria was contributing to my depression until I was already married with kids.

I like what one other user said: You don’t have to suffer to be valid.
Seconding euphoria being a better indicator. For example, you might feel fine as your AGAB but REALLLLLY fine as another gender.
I didn’t realize I had dysphoria until after I realized I was trans.

I hated dresses. I hated shopping in the women’s section. I would buy mens clothes but then hate that they didn’t fit me the way they did the dummies. 

I always took pictures where my chest didn’t show.
I hated intimate time with my male partner because it never felt right.

I would look at buff men and have such gender envy but not realize what it was.

I would even get upset when people called me sir despite being GNC as shit.

It took realizing I wanted a flat chest and finding non binary people to realize I was trans masc and probably non binary.

Most of my dysphoria is physical and I wouldn’t have realized it was dysphoria without a ton of research.

I wear a binder and it makes me happy af.
I started T last month and I was ecstatic.
My boss uses he and they and it makes me giggle.
My stupid little stache is photoed every day.
I finally feel comfortable wearing shorts and tanks without shaving.

Euphoria has been a much larger factor in my transition than dysphasia.
you might not knoe you experience dysphoria until you feel euphoria :) i thought i had no dysphoria until i started transitioning (online at least) and then i realized almost everything was dysphoria that i thought was normal
I just experience an incongruence, but nothing like the distressing dysphoria many trans folx experience. When I get misgendered I just feel like 'oh, thats incorrect, oh well' and I can move on from it very fast. But I'm no less trans for that :)
You don't have to suffer to be valid. People who say otherwise are just pissed off envious douches
Dysphoria can appear with time... At the beginning I wasn't suffering from my body, but now with the time I'm suffer from this fucking Curse 😐
(hope that everyone understood me)
i took the plunge and ordered trans tape:)
yes, dysphoria isnt a requirement. though, sometimes you can have it, but not *know* that you have it until after you figure out that youre trans
Personally I have phases where I both experience dysphoria and also don't, so in essence, yes, yes you can identify as Transgender if you don't feel dysphoria. It's more about what you feel most comfortable to identify with.
Yep. Anybody who says otherwise is known as a truscum and should be ignored.
Of course you can, i dont often experience dysphoria these days and when i do its not as strong as it used to be. This shows that I have become comfortable with the stage i am in my transition and even though i plan on taking it further. Right now I am okay with the outcomes
Dysphoria doesn't determine whether you are trans or not. I mean I do have Dysphoria and I'm trans but the thing is every trans person is different. Dysphoria isn't a defining factor it is something that is commonly prevelant in trans people but not all have it. It really just depends on the person. If you know you are trans or just any gender and you feel that way then you are so. You define that for yourself, nothing or no one else does that for you.

There are possibilities of experiencing it unknowingly but you feel you haven't then that's fine. Like I said it isn't a defining factor.
You can. Though depending on where you live, you may not be ""allowed"" to start transition process if you want such if you don't have dysphoria. (Like where i live)
Of course! Not all trans people experience dysphoria. Euphoria is a much better indicator.
I really like how this was described to me but dysphoria is different for everyone based on what they find a “feminine” or “masculine” trait so it’s not a good definer of if you’re trans. The true definer is euphoria
Yep! Euphoria is a better indicator anyway
personally no, i don’t think there’s a reason o be trans and few the need to transition if you don’t feel dysphoria because dysphoria doenst have to be related to disliking parts of your body

it can be clothes, social dysphoria and feeling uncomfortable with you agab. it’s possible you’ve felt dysphoria but haven’t had the right resources to know it is dysphoria. 

i would recommend educating yourself on dysphoria, listening to trans youtubers talk about theirs and most importantly talk to a gender therapist that can help you discover yourself

i hope this helps
One comment ive seen a lot is that dysphoria isn't the biggest qualifier of transness. Euphoria is a far better one.

That being said, like someone else did here, I'd felt dysphoria without realizing it for what it was, so some introspection may help recognize dysphoria you didn't know you had (it did for me, yay...?)
The biggest indicator of trans is euphoria, not dysphoria. If you're more happy as a gender other than your AGAB, that's more important than whether you feel any particular discomfort with your AGAB. I personally didn't feel dysphoria until months after the euphoria began, and even then it's fairly weak. 

I'd encourage you to do as much self-discovery as you can before you do anything you can't take back, however. Make sure you know who you are and what you want and have considered every possibility before making any final decisions-you could be genderfluid, or gender nonconforming, or gender neutral, or any host of other things. Just make sure that the path you're taking is one that makes you happy, and you should be alright!
If you identify as a gender other than what was assigned at birth, then you are trans. This is the only thing you need to be trans.
HEYHEY, as Cavetown once said on Twitter:
Gender is a SOCIAL CONSTRUCT, so gatekeeping being trans to people who don’t experience dysphoria is not right
This is exactly how I feel! I know it sounds shitty, but I wish I did because then I would KNOW.
I've read that gender euphoria is often a better marker of being teans than gender dysphoria. I don't know if that's a proven thing or not, but I will say that in my own experiences, my limitless desire to be a woman was a lot better at driving me forward than my desire to specifically not be a boy. And personally, that's what I think should be the only requirement. ""I want to be a woman/man/other/none and it would make me the happiest out of all my options."" Plain and simple.

If you feel that a gender identity other than your assigned one is right for you, then hun, you are trans enough. :)
Yes. You can.
yes u can, if it makes u happy
Of course. My definition of trans is simply that you like the other gender more

Think about this: do you have to be allergic to dogs to qualify as a cat person? Or vice versa? Same goes for gender. You don't need to absolutely hate one gender to be the other
Being trans is more about the euphoria you get from things related to your identity than the dysphoria of things related to your asigned gender.
Absolutely!
Sure you can, or you can be very good at hiding it from yourself. I'm in my thirties and would definitely have transitioned if I'd have come to terms with my sexuality a decade or so ago. 

Instead I'm an alcoholic mountain man looking mf and will probably never be truly happy, but hey ho I can put up with a lot so I'll just carry on as is and dress up occasionally at home after taking all the mirrors down
Dysphoria and being trans doesn't always come together. Alot of trans people do usually have dysphoria but not all the time.
Dysphoria isn't limited to the way you look. Personally, mine was much more subconscious. I had huge social issues because I didn't fit in with the guys. Hated (and still hate) any and all male social activities. I didn't realize why that was until recently. The only body dysphoria I've ever had is about my body hair, which I've always hated as well and been trying  to get rid off for decades. But even there it was subconscious as I didn't know why.
Euphoria has been the biggest driver forward for me. I feel for the first time in years since I started on the path of Transitioning. I feel free. I get to live as me without the filter of maleness. I didn't hate my maleness other then I was tired of the lie I was living it wasn't fun to maintain. I can just be me.
1 yes, as long as you'd be happier/more comfortable identifying as a different gender than your AGAB, you can be trans. Euphoria matters more than dysphoria in this case.

2 it's also entirely possible that you've experienced dysphoria before and haven't realized it. That happened to me. For example, whenever I'd see my facial hair I'd always complain that ""it's patchy and doesn't look like a proper beard, it's ugly"" then I realized I hate it and consider it ugly for entirely different reasons. My legs are extremely hairy and I always thought they make me look weird to have so much hair on my legs and less on the rest of my body(by comparison, that is) but nah, I feel disgusted by it not because of disproportionality, but just because it exists. Anything you didn't like about your body can easily be dysphoria in disguise, you may think it's just something you dislike but it can be recontextualized as dysphoria.
You can be anything, although if you've got a strong desire to be recognized as the opposite gender, you may experience some dysphoria/euphoria that you didn't notice.
yes.
You can, when I first came out I didn't have dysphoria and it's completely understandable
yeeeeeeea of course u can
yes. dysphoria is not not necessary to be trans. you are valid
Yes.
Yes
Yes of course. Don't compare yourself to other experiences. They won't always match up for each of us. If you at any point feel like you're trans than you can be ❤💙
Totally, also dysphasia can manifest itself as a symptom/result of another mental illness if you have any, making you think you don’t have dysphoria but something else
yes
Yes, absolutely. I personally barely have dysphoria, and when i have it, it's not that bad, but my euphoria when i wear something masculine is so big, i just knew it
My dysphoria wasn’t to bad at all till I started hrt then i started feeling it quite a bit hrt has changed my life tho so deff wouldn’t have it any other way!
I use to think the same but now I have started to get dysphoria
Yes, it is very possible, in fact, a sizable chunk of the trans community doesn't feel dysphoria
This seems like a bad place to ask cause everyone will just say yes no matter what. Ask a therapist or someone who isnt so biased
[removed]
1. Yes absolutely
2. As other folks say, you might not realize it. I had the same thought process as you ages ago, I was like ""I would love to be a girl but I dont really mind being a guy"" only to realize months later that this is why I hate my chest and such.
3. Do whatever makes you happy! Focus on the euphoria you get from gender-affirming stuff, not all the dysphoria. That's something I have to remind myself all the time lol

personally for me i started questioning my gender and got confused that i didnt have dysphoria. especially after consuming so much kalvin garrah in my yourh this made me really conflicted. however, starting to use male pronouns and present in a more masculine way actually triggered my dysphoria for the first. or, better yet, brought out the discomfort i had unconsciously gotten used to feeling. so, really, you can have a ton of dysphoria or no dysphoria. it doesnt matter. it just matters what you want to be called and considered as and that others respect that :)
a) not all dysphoria is physical 
b) a lot of stuff you cope with and make excuses about turns out to be dysphoria later 

I’m non-binary AFAB pre-everything considering T. 30 but young-looking (thanks Mom). So I read very GIRL and it is difficult. 

Body dysphoria is… existent but not where you’d expect it to be and I always had a ton of body confidence. I think it’d be fun to have boobs and a dick at the same time. I wish I had an Adam’s Apple but I would miss my soprano singing voice. I’d also miss how shocked new friends are hearing the high notes for the first time because my speaking voice is so masc it’s not even funny. I have little teeny stick wrists and baby hands. Also, regardless of gender, where is my ass. I want a big ass and I barely got AN ass. Where are they hiding it? 

Everything from shoulders to ankles is nice. I like it and it is Cute and Good. I should work out, though, because when I was in shape I had these big gorgeous deltoid muscles that made my shoulders pop out and that was by far the coolest visible muscle I ever had. That’s a very cis way to feel as a girl, right? …right? 

But mostly my dysphoria is cultural, it’s social. Everyone seems to think I’m a different person just because they saw how I was shaped… it’s so lame. They just assume I like “girl things” and I don’t like “boy things” and fucking EVERYTHING has a gender category even if it’s playing a game. Oh you like strategy games? I diagnose you with BOY. Fam why 

I love dresses, but I also love collared shirts and structured jackets. If it has pockets, I would like to wear it. If it lacks pockets, get that shit outta my face. I own objects that need to be on my person at all times. 

My purse is always comically overstuffed with things. I think I started doing that because it was the only way I felt a little bit good about carrying a purse. If I only need a few small things, why am I carrying a purse? Can’t I carry a briefcase instead? Why do I have this dumb empty bag unless I fill it with 15 pounds of books and a half-crushed NutriGrain bar? Why else would I need it? 

I hate patriarchal oppression, but it’s not gonna go away with transition so that’s moot… one thing I notice about my reaction to men being dicks to women is that I feel objectified for my body, but I don’t feel offended “as a woman,” I’m only reacting to the commodification of the baby vessel that lives in my flesh. 

As a guy, my reaction is “Bruh. Do you even have a dad? Like actually. My dad taught me how to be decent to women and he’s a pretty average white dude, nothing he does is hard. Are your parents, like, okay? It’s chill bro, you can tell me.” 

My comfort zone with friends is nerd bro. Not an incel, not a chad, not a jock but DEFINITELY a guy. I just started going by they/them with my D&D group and it’s euphoric. I am over the moon on it. I do all the voices for my characters and I have a lot of range so it’s really fun. 

“Other” women, as I thought of them… unless they’re trans too or maybe if they’re on the Spectrum, there’s this weird glass wall of “why can’t I relate to you.” And I’ve never felt that way about almost any guy. Unless he was extremely weird or creepy and that’s not a gender thing. 

Guys can just vibe. We shoot the shit and compete for bragging rights and lean on buildings and do fucking nothing and it’s the best time ever. 

And I’m SURE girls feel that way about other girls too. I just… never did. And I grew up bi. Girls are terrifying and I’m in love with half of them but I don’t know if that makes me gay or straight for them. 

Same for dudes. I don’t wanna go to the gym and be a girl. I wanna go as a guy. Spot me, I’m knocking out a new PB on military press today. Tell me I look pumped, tell me my shoes are fire. I admire your body and crave your admiration and it is both friendly AND VERY GAY. 

Everything I do, I’m always gay. What is that. 

There’s probably other stuff but that’s the meat of it. 

Oh! I do the head nod sometimes without thinking. The “suh dude” upward-moving head nod in the street. I’m a guy, you’re a guy, respect, moving on. And I have gotten some weird looks for doing The Nod in full makeup or whatever the fuck but THEY ALWAYS DO IT BACK. They respond! The energy is too much, it’s automatic. I did this reflexively for about ten years before realizing why it was weird. I did it for another five before realizing it was gender euphoria. 

My parents are good. They will be supportive. But I am still unsure of what to change my name to and exactly how gendered that name needs to be. And I never liked my girl name anyway. But I don’t know, it’s tough. 

Yeah, dysphoria is hard to untangle and it doesn’t all live in the body. Good luck fam.
I dont know, i experienced crazy amount of dysphoria and than i found out iam a girl so i dont really know but it should be possible i think
yeah, dysphoria is just a result of incongruence (the mismatch between gender and sex). as long as you have that mismatch then you’re trans, but if you’re afraid of being wrong just take baby steps! try reversible things out & see if you like them!
Depends what you mean by trans. If you believe transfolk are brains/souls mismatched with their bodies, then no. But there is an argument that you are what you are doing at the time, so if you have no dysphoria, yet you are or have transitioned/and or are living as the opposite sex, then yes, you are transgender. But that doesn't means you are the gender are imitating.

An example of this would be the gay prostitutes who transition because they realise trans pulls in more money in countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Thailand. Hearing their stories, their motives are often economical, not transcendental. Identity really doesn't play into it.

So suffice to say, whatever your motives, you can still be trans in practice, but your identity will be cis.
Yes. Dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans. Sometimes it can also be how you experience euphoria in regards to your gender.

Similarly, not every trans person pursues medical transitions. Yours could be purely social by adopting some pronouns or a name that makes you feel more like your true gender
Sadly I felt like I had to feel it to be trans but I'm glad that my mind has changed. I don't hate my body or particularly dislike feminine things but I'm sure that I'm trans.
You definitely can be trans without having strong dysphoria you may however experience it in different ways and not even know it or you may not experience it at all in which case I think it makes it that much harder for some people to come to grips with what's going on with themselves I've had little patches of obvious dysphoria throughout my life but it's never been a big deal which is probably one of the main reasons why I have not had an urgent push to come out as it makes it that much harder to know if you really are or not
Yes you can be trans and not experience dysphoria. The people who tell you otherwise are truscum, and are also probably why a lot of the comments are getting down voted. Transphobic scum.
I had dysphoria that came in waves. It wasn't there constantly, and when it went away I thought I wasnt trans.

So idk, you might not be, you could just be interested in the subject. But if you think ""hey being a girl would be cool, but still cis though"" often enough,   that's not a very cis thing to think lol.
Yes
ofc u can, its which gender you’re happier as. i didnt realize i was trans until i felt so euphoric by being called a boy (i do have dysphoria unfortunately tho)
Totally
Yes you can. Everyone’s experience is different and everyone’s valid the same way 💜
If it feels right for you and you feel like trans is the right term for you, then you are trans. Easy as that! 
Being trans is not about suffering ❤️
Yes
Yes. Absolutely.
Yes! My wife suffered little to no dysphoria and they're trans :)
Sure! At least one of my two trans sisters is like that. I don’t know about the other one.
I found that the more I respected the fact that I was trans, the more I realized that I do have dysphoria and it’s come later on in the process. There’s still things I don’t have dysphoria about though, though I’m non-binary not a binary trans guy so that also complicates it for me
Totally
I once heard someone say that you dont measure being trans by dysphoria but by euphoria. So if you are happier as your preferred gender then yes you are trans
Do whatever u want n just be happy
I’m still in baby steps towards accepting my gender identity (NB) but looking back at tiny moments when I was little gives some interesting hindsight. My memory of childhood is foggy at best and massive blank spaces at worst, but I do remember always being jealous of the boys clothing section at stores and one time when I was like 5 I distinctly remember I tried to “swap roles” with my little brother. I dressed up as a boy and he dressed up as a girl. I even tried to cut my hair and it was messy af because yeah 5 scissor skills. 
I got in trouble for the hair thing but I remember being so convinced of my display. Like TADA!!! I’m the brother now! My little brother was kinda just along for the ride of playing dress up lol. 

So idk, but dysphoria can take many forms from physical to social to emotional. Same thing with euphoria :) 
Good exercise is to look back and think about the moments that made you feel most yourself or made you feel less yourself and think about the context of those moments.
No 👍
I don't have a good answer for your question, but I will share what was and is true for me. My entire adult life I hated the way I looked, everything about myself, even when lean and fit, even when others said I looked ""great"". Just this awful body image that went beyond social norms. Finally, after my realization that I am trans, all the things I hated then are things I love now; my hips, my legs, my tummy. It was like flipping a switch. I hated my body because I was looking at it as a man; not the person that I am. I'm not sure that helps anyone but me, but it was pivotal and life changing for me. 💕
Dysphoria is not and shouldn't be a primary factor of being transgender. You should focus on euphoria instead.
dysphoria IS NOT necessary for being trans
I didn't have dysphoria, then I realized I was trans and had ALL the dysphoria. It was always there. I didn't know what dissociation was, and it all makes sense now. Being trans didn't bring any dysphoria, it helped me realize it was already there
r/nonbinary
Absolutely. When my egg broke down felt the same way. Turned out I had a ton of dysphoria, I had just misplaced it
Dysphoria isn't necessary to be trans. This has been said by countless medical institutions. Euphoria is the important part.
Yes!!! 
Don't listen to people who say no!! 
Do what makes you happy!!!!
I never really showed signs of it however I was diagnosed with it and I’m on hormones
YES!! you can be.
You don’t need dysphoria to identify as trans, a lot of people are going to tell you that you have to but you don’t. Being trans doesn’t hinge on dysphoria
You’re really talking about how you experience discomfort. And everyone is different. Some people shut down, others over react; and consider that everyone likes different things and you’ll see there’s no singular thing that “makes” you trans

Euphoria is also a big part. What makes you happy? Being trans isn’t just about pain, there are beautiful parts to it. And it’s personal. It’s up to you to decide
My advice when first questioning your gender is to go by gender euphoria rather than dysphoria. Do you feel happier presenting as a different gender? You’re probably trans, and you might even figure out that you had more dysphoria than you first realized. This was the case for myself.
Yes
not experiencing dysphoria does not make you any less trans
I didn’t recognize a lot of my dysphoria for years but it was there. Sometimes I mistook it for other things (lack of self-esteem, etc.) Moreso, though, I just experienced a growing distance between myself and my body and feeling real, feeling as if there is a a thin barrier between me and the rest of the world and as if my body is just a thing I carry around with me but not me. I’ve been working on this in therapy and as I have been my dysphoria is more obvious and conscious but still is primarily through unhealthy depersonalization. Also, I don’t get euphoria, I get a feeling of rightness when I think about or experience certain things like people using the name I chose or gendering me correctly or the thought of my body post hormones/surgeries. (though not every trans person needs or wants hormones and every surgery possible. That’s very individual.)
Quick answer: yes.

Everyone is different. Just because your experience is not the experience of the majority, it´s not less valid. What matters is how you feel like about your gender, and whatever that is, noone can invalidate it.

E.g. I hardly ever had dysphoria, but I´ve felt a lot of gender euphoria since I started my transition.
I think yes, just as enby ppl. Not all of them need something like bpdy dysphoria, it's enough with not liking being percieved as your AGAB
yes 

if you beleive you need dysphoria to be trans i think your called transcum 
or something idk

its EUPHORIA that makes us all trans
Yes
being trans is not feeling dyshoria, dysphoria is just an extra rhing some people get and some dont.. Transgender is about feeling/knowing that youre in the wrong body.. i think ^^
Yes. Dysphoria is not a requirement.
I can’t say why I really want to say because of the gate keepers but go ahead and walk around for a week doing your daily activities, work , interactions with your circle then come let us know what you think ?
I always got extremely anxious and totally shut down in men’s clothing sections while shopping for myself too lol. Thought it was just bad social anxiety, but nothing else triggered it nearly as badly as clothes shopping. I learned how to deal with the anxiety, but I was always extremely uncomfortable. Glad to see someone else has had this experience.
You just made me remember something so long ago that i didn't understand why then, but now it totally makes sense, I was walking in a mall and we passed the woman clothes section and I was like ""why can't I get these clothes"" and I didn't understand why I wanted them 😳
This sounds so much like my own experience. 😊
(Same here but for not liking girls/women’s clothes and lighting up for boys’/men’s clothes)
I feel, oddly related to this post, even though I was pretty sure I'm cis.... Like 70% ish sure...

Maybe
Oh dang! The clothes shopping thing totally just blew my mind. I’m the same.
I (ftm) always got extremely upset and shut down when clothes shopping too! My anxiety would get worse and I would be extremely irritable and snappy and miserable. I would feel myself getting more and more disgusted by my body- I 100% believed that this was because I'm fat. But, surprise! i'm still fat, and I don't feel like that trying on boy clothes!  It never occurred to me that this could be dysphoria
This is what got me through much of my twenties. I kind of wonder if it's sort of like a disassociation. Because looking back at those years I really was in a fog. But also I don't think anyone else noticed.
I relate to this so hard! I figured out early this year, and everything made so much more sense after I did. Whenever I would go clothes shopping I would completely lose interest and I never enjoyed being photographed before, but now that I've realized that I'm trans, I really enjoy taking pictures of myself in dresses and feminie outfits
Your last line really hit home for me. I don't think in trans but more gender fluid who leans mostly on the fem side, but I love looking at pictures of myself much more when I look girly or my hair is pretty compared to when I'm just a guy. 

I don't think I ever saw myself as unattractive, but definitely that version is boring to me. It's not unique.
Holy fuck thank you for this resource it's amazing
That's exactly why I didn't like shopping for clothes when I was little! I usually preferred unisex clothes and whenever I pick a clothe I like, I was rejected a lot because it was a girl's one(I didn't even knew it was a girl's clothe and I would get frustrated because of the lack of outfits I could wear)
Non-binary here but similar except i wish I could shop in the men’s and not the women’s., I hate shopping in the women’s second, it’s just not me, everytime I go I feel dysphoric when I try on clothes, though I used to think that was random guilt about my weight, it’s not.

The only time I don’t feel dysphoric with clothing is shoe shopping, I love women’s shoes, as long as they fit though.   Except I hate shoe shopping as I work as a shoe store anyway.
*crys* this is literally me you just validated me in so many ways
Yes i have the same
Same!!!
lol this is funny to me somehow. I think cause we really don't realize how hard stuff is when you get so used to stuff being shitty all the time. Cis people dissatisfaction must be so fucking chill.
So let’s say I experience a profound sense of euphoria applying/wearing makeup, and feminine clothing, and shaving my whole body. Can that be a good indicator? Like I feel fine as a guy, but when I’m in my feminine it’s something special. I feel like it’s a hidden but real part of me, and it feels so good. I don’t feel dysphoria as a guy, but I feel like my male identity is only a part of who I am, not the whole ""me"". I don’t feel ""complete"" as only a guy.
This. 

It was that first sentence that started my Trans journey. I always heard about gender dysphoria in trans folk and figured since I wasn't suffering, I wasn't trans. Once I heard that it was the euphoria that was a true tell, that's when I decided to give it a try. Once I put on my first binder, my fate was sealed. I LOVED IT. 

I never hated the box I was told I was supposed to fit in, but I was never comfortable with it either. Realizing that I didn't even have to be in that box at all was liberating.
I like to think euphoria is a much better indicator as for myself it is much more powerful there is literally no denying it even at my age I still look at the women's clothing section first whenever I walk into a store and I still wish I could wear the clothes and boots I see Unfortunately they are usually never in a size I could actually wear which is probably the biggest source of my dysphoria how I wish the world was like this when I was a teenager
For sure. 

Personally, it was more of a ""didn't realize that I had dysphoria because it was just my baseline experience that I was too used to experiencing constantly to realize that it isn't just standard existential angst that everyone has"". Partly due to living with untreated chronic depression for a long time (caused primarily by non-gender-related factors). Getting treatment for that made it a lot easier to recognize what I actually like and dislike in the realm of gender.

It's still not crippling or anything now that I've recognized it, but it's definitely a distinct discomfort.
This is how it is for me, I don't hate my body or feel like I'm in the wrong body, I just feel like I would be MUUUCH happier as a woman with all the bits too. 

I don't feel a lot of dysphoria but I do feel quite a lot of euphoria. I recently changed my name for my Uni classes to my real name and it feels much more natural and normal than being called my dead name
I'm so glad to hear someone else talk about being upset about things that later give them euphoria, like you being referred to with male pronouns and titles. I feel similarly about wearing women's clothing rn because I haven't started HRT, and wearing feminine clothing and makeup just makes me feel even worse that it doesn't fit me like it would fit a cis girl. I'm hoping for a miracle with HRT lol
i feel somewhat similar to that thanks!
Dysphoria isn’t always about sufffering. It’s about feeling a disconnect from your assigned gender. If you feel no disconnect, why transition? 

It’s just as harmful for you to slander trans folks who do experience dysphoria. Went through hell and back to get where I am just to be referred to as an “envious douche.”
okay thanks!
does it make it harder to start hormones and transition?
Why on earth did I have to figure it out... Could have just lived not liking my voice and body hair that much but NOOOO now it all sucks.
thanks!
Self-discovery in what way? Just wondering
I've definitely had so so much of the latter. Also younger me not understanding what being nonbinary meant, or what being trans even was definitely added to the issue (I'm somewhere between non-binary and agender)
reading the other comments i’d have to disagree
Yeah it's crazy, like I'd be super excited to go to the mall to shop but as soon as I'd start looking through the mens section, my mood just plummets.
I've kind of had this, but with my name. it bothered me my whole life and it took way too long to figure out why
Same! I always felt jealous of all of the choices women had for clothing!
I had the same feeling whenever passing the women's section. But then I realized I couldn't wear these kind of clothes because of gendered norms. I tried looking away and was ashamed of the thoughts I was having ...
Yup yup yup, big agree. I’m just coming to terms with being trans in this last year but my wardrobe is already mostly mens tshirts, hoodies, crew necks, hats. I have a mens jacket. It was all me subconsciously buying these things because women’s closing makes me so uncomfortable. I can handle jeans but tops are a huge no. 

A memory for me was going back to school shopping when I was entering high school and I went towards the mens section because there was a plain red hoodie I wanted but my parents were confused and said “but that’s the mens section???” And I was like “and?“…. didn’t buy clothes at all that day. They bought me two pairs of converse and that’s all I wanted because womens clothes make me so uncomfortable.
Its taken me years to realize who I am. 5 years ago I tried on womens thigh high socks for the first time and loved how I looked in them.

 4 and 3 years ago I would dress up in womens clothes maybe only 2 or 3 times a year. At this point I just thought I had a cross dressing kink. 

It wasn't until 2 years ago that the thought of ""am I trans?"" Entered my mind and gave me a new perspective/lens to view myself and my emotional history through and also a mindset to further explore myself. 

A lot of stuff started clicking into place and started making a lot of sense.

After two years of deep introspection and research I've happily come to the conclusion that I'm trans. I'm going to meet with a gender affirming doctor later this month :D 

If you have questions about yourself, ask them, whatever answer/revelation you find, it'll be worth it.
You made mi think about that for the first time, i might be used to me hating myself
This was me. I was ok as a man until I started exploring my identity and then specifically my gender identity. What started to happen was I realized I was imagining my life as a women more often then as a man. I have started to realize what I had been spending my.life doing was proping up this facade of a personality and over time I had found less and less utility in maintaining the fakeness of it and with that my true self came forward. Suddenly the walls fell away and I was able to just start being me. I was never not me just me covered by the facade of my environment. My upbringing, whether it be my family, religious teaching, social norms,  or life experience, had caused me to mask myself for thier sake and I don't want to anymore. I have skills and value. I am worthy.

Sorry if that got weird at the end. As I wrote it my passion flared and I needed to get the feelings out.
I mean nb/gender fluid/bi gender are also options that fall under the general umbrella. Ide just go with whatever u find most comfortable and worry about labeling it afterwards or not at all
Only you can ever really answer the question “am I trans?” But that is certainly a good indicator.

Also, feeling incomplete as “only a guy” is dysphoria.
Hi! I'm genderfluid and experience my femininity like this. For me, I can't be feminine all the time, because this leads to be being fem none of the time. But if I go too long without being fem, I feel like crap
I honestly think it was a case of misplaced transphobia combined with a total lack of knowledge. I thought I was a girl and every time someone did it, it was invalidating me as a girl. Growing up in the south that just wasn't done. It was extremely hard being a masc present afab person in the south in the early 00's.

I got misgendered at the drive-through today and being called ma'am made my skin crawl.

I used to hate it when people called me out for not shaving. Now I love how hairy I am, including the stupid little facial hairs.

Everything depends on context, and now that I know better, some things that made me dysphoric/upset absolutely bring me joy.
They’re not saying that you’re envious for having suffered. They’re saying that trans medicalists are assholes for saying you have to suffer to be trans
Depends on the country and even region/city. I have dysphoria but even still, finding care locally was hard with my insurance. I eventually found a good doctor at a specifically LGBT friendly clinic in Portland Oregon a couple hours away that does ""informed consent"" based treatment rather than going off the WPATH gatekeeping standards.
depends on where you live. some places have a lot of gatekeeping in place for trans healthcare, and may require a diagnosis from a therapist before you can medically transition (or even legally change your name in some cases)
I saw someone suggest lying if faced with gatekeeping. Before lying to get access to HRT, I would advise to seek out therapy and figure out with a psychologist (preferably one specialized in trans issues) whether transitioning is a good option for you or not.

If therapy is out of the question for whatever reason, I think transitioning purely on a social level can be greatly beneficial. You get to try out as many things as you want, and none of them are permanent. You can start by trying out different names, if feminine ones make you feel good, then great! If masculine ones are the ones that make you the most comfortable, then use one. If gender neutral names are those that feel the most appropriate for you, then go that direction.
Then try out different looks, see how that makes you feel.

I would also talk with other trans people, just to exchange experiences (not to confront them to your own, just to hear them out) and maybe hear their opinion (although the one that matters is your own), so you can have as many elements at your disposal to come to a conclusion which is right for you!

I wish you can find the right solution for yourself
In general. Finding out who you are, who you want to be, and what makes you happy. The whole point of being trans is to pursue happiness, so finding out the best route and form of pursuit will help you a great deal.
Could it be that the men’s section is just really boring?
I'd had that exact thought for so long before I figured it out.  Always hated that the mrns clothes section was just like a corner of an entire store.  Or that men get dress shoes and tennis shoes, but women had glats and heels and boots and each if those had their own styles.  Or shirts and their hundred styles for women and men have crew neck and v neck.  And of course almost all men's clothes are basically unisex so women also get to shop in the men's section but men ""cant"" shop in the women's section.
Yea in the men's part there is just white or black shirts and jeans. Plus I've always wanted to wear skirts
I've tried, with female clothes and taking more feminine pictures of myself. 

Making myself look softer and less masculine. I go though phases where I love it and want to be this way more and also I go though parts of hating it and regretting it.

I want answers, but I've scared of them. I wish I was able to question myself when I was younger. Every passing month I think it'll be harder to transition, even if I am trans

I'm not sure about a lot of it. I keep going back and fourth.

I thought I could maybe be just a little bit of a feminine guy and gender queer.

But yeah, I guess I need to ask myself more questions


Thank you for saying this, and I hope you're meeting with the doctor goes well :)
Yeah, holding up the facade is so exhausting. 

I didn't realize how draining it's been on me until I realized what I was doing. I was felt like I was putting up a front or mask to the world. 

 I thought it was depression linked, like trying to act happy when sad but turns out the mask has been me trying to act masculine to hide my true self. Squeezing myself through a masculine filter what was exhausting me. It was my mask, and it's been suffocating me.

I totally feel what you're going through
Thanks for sharing! This was exactly me at first too. Took a lot of work, time, and therapy to destroy the mask I'd fashioned for myself.
Yup, thanks
Thanks
If you live where gatekeeping is an issue, I would suggest lying until you have what you need. Tell them what you need to tell them to get past the gatekeepers. Then go off and live your life how you want to. 

They can't prove that you aren't telling the truth if you say that your dysphoria makes you want to tear your skin off, even if it actually doesn't at all.
I think that definitely plays a part in it. Mens fashion is super boring to me (at least the stuff most stores in my area carries). The one two punch of boring choices and non gender affirming clothes is real (for me).
For me, it wasn’t just a shift in mood, I felt distinctly out of place and exceedingly uncomfortable to the point where I sometimes had to sit down and catch my breath. Some of this was definitely regular social anxiety, but the couple times I went shopping for women’s clothes with friends, I did not experience nearly that level of anxiety.
No, (ftm) i think that the womens clothes are boring and the mens is amazing it’s definitely a trans thing lmao
I always hated shopping for clothes. 

Until I hatched my egg. Now the only reason I don't go shopping for girl clothes is that I don't feel confident enough
i felt like nonbinary suited me when i did the same things :) it’s just been a confusing ride to say the least
So much if it was so subtle too. That has been my favorite part. Like I have become super hygienic and been keeping clean shaven all over and letting my hair grow. But otherwise I'm going through the process to get hormones and proper therapy and that has been enough to change the current course of my world. I came out to my wife and a few friends and they have just been lovely. Nothings been perfect but I feel more equipped to weather those storms. I just feel like I am whole for the first time in my life.
or you know, tell the medical professionals the truth.
True facts. I'm a trans guy and I also hate how boring the men's clothing is in general. It's not too bad an experience if I'm actually just looking for basic staples (jeans etc) but I've been living in unisex graphic tees and the dregs of my old femme wardrobe that doesn't hit TOO femme to be comfortable because so much men's fashion is just soul-crushingly DULL.
Only when it’s a truth they need to know in order to treat you correctly. Not when it’s going to lead to them denying the treatment you need because they deem you not suffering enough to deserve it. 🙄
[removed]
Yeah lol, it hurts too that it's always so hot where I live, that I can't feasibly wear layers and cool jackets/hoodies. I could pull off some cool male clothes looks with layers (my trip to san fransisco years ago was perfect for layering and looking cool)
Don’t forget there is always the option to customize your clothes! :)
Possible advice... T R A D I T I O N A L  P I R A T E   C L O T H E S
as a Florida (aka the place that never drops below 60 degrees) resident, we also can’t wear cool hoodies :(
Very true, and I’ve been learning embroidery for exactly that reason! It’s kinda time-consuming though and I’m currently bad at it.
Pirate is an option!
Practice makes perfect. :)
Hopefully. Otherwise I may just have to embrace the crustpunk look."	r9stcx	trans	889	0.97	2021-12-05 23:40:42
Going to Trans Clinic Today!! #Trans Man	"Hello to anyone who will see this! This might be all over the place since I'm simply writing what first comes to mind so hopefully it will make sense. I think this is my first post on Reddit which is really exciting for some reason... 

Anyways, the day has finally come for my appointment at a trans clinic near me! This past year has been one hell of a journey; from the fear of coming out, poor mental health, seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, starting meds (prozac and focalin if anyone has experience with those and can relate), having my unsupportive family, covid-19, lack of in person school, etc... 

At this point I just have to say how grateful I am that my health care providers are actually listening to me and support me even though I'm 17 and not 18. It's been so tough trying to understand my rights without parent consent. Hell, my parents didn't even consent to me leaving school today for the appointment. Sucks to suck though because I'm going anyways!  >:)

It's just a consultation, but I'm extremely excited to get meet more people who will support me and educate me, as well as getting new resources and to having new opportunities. I went to my primary in February and have been waiting patiently since.   


Being a trans athlete has been one hell of an experience. I tried to play men's club volleyball in the fall of 2020 to 2021 but the closest location made it extremely difficult for me to even apply since my parents weren't supportive and because I had to pay in full by the first week. I ended up playing my dream position with an amazing women's team there so if I ignore the chest dysphoria I experienced for months it was a great time\^\^

I'm starting boys high school volleyball this upcoming spring season and I'm so grateful most of my coaches are supportive. I did swim in the winter which was a bit difficult to manage suit wise however I made it work. (Bless up to tech suits!) It was a unique time because our meets were always at home because of covid so I swam with both men and women to speed up the meet. Surprisingly enough, I kept beating a fellow teammate of mine (cis man who was quite in shape) at my primary event. It definitely affirmed my belief that I can compete with men even though some of my coaches at the time told me I wouldn't be able to. 

Anyways to wrap this up (since I'm writing it in class instead of paying attention...) I just wanted to put this out there. I probably could have written it better but that's alright! It's a learning process. I'm proud of my identity regardless of what other people tell me. I can't wait to become an educator and coach and hopefully meet more trans identifying students in the future.

Thanks for reading this if you got to this point! I might come back and write an update after I go. To new adventures and better days to come! <3

\-Mack,"	"Hey Mack ! Not every day an easy adventure but a very good adventure anyway ! Well done ! Can't wait to read from you ! ♡
It’s great to hear you have support, Mack. I hope it keeps getting better for you!
Good luck my dude 💕
Hey dude, I'm MtF, but also have ADHD and am working out how to maintain my athleticism now that I've started T-blockers (and E to come :3). I know we're going in the opposite directions, but HMU if you have any questions you think I might be able to help you with. 

If nothing else, congrats dude! It sounds like you've already put a lot of effort into this, it should be a bit easier going now that you have external support in your transition - I know I felt that way :)
I’m so proud of you Mack! We are both starting to transition pretty young—I’m only a year older! I can’t imagine how difficult it must be at 17 in (I assume) high school. You sound tough as steel and I wish you the best of luck!
I am glad you have support, Mack! You've got this!
So proud of you Mack! Good luck today and forward, your brothers are cheering for you!
Good luck, Mack! 💖
Waddup Mack let's fuckin get it!
That’s quite a journey! Congratulations for all the progress you’ve made, and good luck for the progress still to come!
Thank you <3
Thank youu :) I hope so too!
Thank you! :)
Ayee that's so cool!! I'd love to talk to you about it! I've been really wanting to meet more trans athletes so I'll do that soon ! :))
Thank you so much! It has been a bit odd, but surprisingly my classmates haven't said anything negative yet! It's only been older peeps so I just try to stick with my chosen fam and ignore that ""haters"" lmao
Thank you so much <333
So fustian of thee mack! valorous luck the present day and fia, thy brothers art cheering f'r thee!

My friend is transphobic	Well, today i have found out my best friend at school is transphobic and no mater what I say I can't change it. Now my dysphoria is even worse and I don't know what to do.	"I think you need to let your friend go, sadly. Speak to other friends and find a trans accepting one and spend your time with them. ❤❤❤
yeah, you shouldn't really be friends with a transphobe regardless of if your trans or not, anyone who actively ""disagrees"" with someone's existence is also usually not too fun to be around anyways. i know it may seem like you taking a strong stance against transphobia might get you outed or something, but it won't. only dumbasses think disagreeing with something = being it lol.
It's sad it has to be so, but us trans folks must sometimes ""burn the bridges"" behind us.
Sounds to me like your ex-friend is a transphobe.
then theyre not your friend sweetie, find the friends who will accept you for who you are.
hey I literally ghosted 90% of my old friends cause they were really transphobic and racist, and I dont regret it at all its one of the best choices ive ever made!!!

theres no shame in ghosting toxic people.
I think it’s time to let the friendship end
I have a friend that was really transphobic before I came out.  Now he’s not.  Sometimes it just takes someone actually knowing a trans person to change their mind.  Not saying that will happen with your friend, but it might.
Someone should make a trans version of Racist Friend - The Specials
Not to dismiss it, but in what way? Is it overt and directly abusive to you/transpeople, or does it seem more like ignorance?
Ditch that ""friend."" Tell her/him that you can't be friends with transphobe and wish a best of luck and walk off. You'll find better people in your life
Im not trans...but I am old. So fucking old. And let me tell you something, kiddo. Life will show you who your real friends are. This is not a real friend. I cannot think of anyone I have ever known, myself included, that has let go of a friend that needed to be let go that has ever regretted it for even a second.

There is nothing more empowering and validating than taking control of how people treat you. Take heart. The time you would have spent on this person is time you can now spend with people who will love you for who you are.
Some people are just not compatible with trans people. It's not that they are rotten to the core, just that their environment and lack of knowledge have given them a really bad opinion. 

If you feel like it's impossible to open their view to the idea of gender, just find other people that will love and respect you 💖
Get rid of that friend find a better one
They are no longer your friend
Trans today is like colored people in the 50's and 60's;  like they're aware and willing to accept them, but they still secretly hate because they're ""different"".
Get a new best friend
I’m having a simular issue. I came out to my friends this summer and all of them have been great except for my best friend :/ She misgenders me all the time, uses my deadname constantly and it just breaks my heart. She’s pansexual aswell so I thought she’d understand but apparently not
You do you boo. Im not saying dont burn that bridge but, you might make a believer out if him if he sees the progress or change in another chapter of life.
drop them, the only way
I think context is definitely needed what exactly do you mean by transphobic as you know some people display that behaviour because they are themselves having thoughts that counter traditional programming I see a lot of younger people coming at this issue as if it was black or white and it really is not it is a massive grey area and we have to be aware that there are two sides to understanding and a large part of why some people remain adamantly opposed is because they have no knowledge of the other side or the knowledge they do have is incorrect or not complete or they're simply scared to admit that they are okay with something that is not considered a societal Norm just be careful what Bridges you burn because sometimes you might find yourself on the other side of that River someday
Yikes, I know that must feel conflicting! Sometimes you can convince them, sometimes you can’t. You do what you think is best. I don’t know him.



Some advice for if you choose the route of trying to convince him, it’s best to do it in a way that doesn’t directly challenge the beliefs, so he doesn’t clam up and shut down.

Basically have have him walk you through his logic (I’d start with the homophobia, it’s easier to debunk - the logical fallacies are a bit more obvious). Don’t counter things, Just ask him questions and do your best to at least seem genuine (example: what’s *your* reasoning for thinking that?; Sorry, I’m a bit confused: What about x? Why does that not disprove y? Can you explain it to me?) 

Basically this method will force him to think through the logic of his beliefs; and he might start to find the holes in the logic, on his own, as he tries to find answers for your questions. This might lead to him to start questioning thing on his own.
People are complicated. Tell him you're disappointed, leave the door open to him to come back. Maybe the things that you love about your friend will win out over those that you don't and you'll end up helping him see the light. It never hurts not to burn a bridge completely and err on the side of hope. But also move on. It's on him now whether he wants to salvage the friendship.
I'm sorry sorry to hear that and unfortunately if you can't change there mind you need to distance your self it's dangerous for you to be close to them
Yeah, they are not a true friend. Find someone who genuinely cares about you. That transphobe fuck doesn't deserve to have you as a great friend.
You mean ex-friend, right?
Some people are simply not going to change specific traits of them, no matter your efforts.

And this is a general advice, not for this topic only.
Fuck that bitch
Eliminate all toxic people from your life. It sucks to lose a friend, but if they can’t accept you for who you are you don’t need them.
I know, it isn't gonna be easy. It's gonna be one of the hardest things ever, but if they can't respect you for who you are, then let go if them. If they can't at the very least support you, then they were never your friend in the first place. I'm sorry.
I’m not saying that this is gonna be easy to do, but drop that friend and find new ones that will uplift you instead of making you feel this way. It’s better said than done, but it’s gonna help. I hope you eventually drop them and find new friends that will make you happier.
not a friend.
This is the hardest part. You are going to find out who your friends really are, and who values you enough to grow and change.
I know its hard but you really need to let it go, I hope the best for ya. :(
I found out my friends are transphobic today too, one of them is also biphobic.
If your friend doesn’t support you, they’re not your friend. Im so sorry you have to experience this but I will say that it does get better. Because of the internet finding other trans folk to talk to and befriend has been easier than ever. You’ll find a new friend that’s a million times better than this now ex-friend of yours!
How old are you? You say at school so I assume you are a teenager? Unfortunately, when you are in high school you are surrounded by people who often still have a lot of growing and learning to do. I think you have to stop spending time with this friend. Either they suck and you will be free of their negativity or maybe less likely but hopefully the loss of their best friend because of their own hatefulness might teach them a lesson that helps them grow into a more compassionate person. Then perhaps you can accept them back into your life if they are truly your best friend. I wouldn't hold out hope though.
Transphobic friends are not real friends, I'm very sorry you had to find that out about someone. It's hard. When I came out, a friend of 3 years called me a freak and blocked me on everything. If you can't reason with people, you just need to try and gracefully let them go
my best friend, basically my brother, been super close for almost 20 years kind of went down a hardcore orthodox christian route a few years ago, and im kind of waiting for him to phase out of it, but im growing more doubtful as the days wear on, hes pretty tollerant, but, very homophobic, and i can only assume transphobic sooooooo

im gonna mess with him because i can

hes also a backwoods farmer, lives up in the hills with his wife and kids and very off the grid salt of the earth, great guy, just has a very simple humble lifestyle, and doesnt rely on society for anything, which i admire, but, he is also anti vax, and believes in things probably reserved for Qanon, and he knows i got the covid vaccine, sooo, he has NO idea im beginning to transition, so, just to mess with him, the covid vaccine turned me into a girl
Let them go and find more open friends... I wish someone would have told me this when I was younger.  I definitely would have came out sooner... remember that for your journey, your are going to need supportive people on your side
Sometimes people get better with time.  They have stupid preconceived notions that they find hard to overcome.  When in high school, my kid had a classmate who decided to come out as trans.  The classmate’s parents and best friend were not supportive.  Eventually, they realized they were being idiots and that she was still the same person, only happier and more honest with herself. Unfortunately, that might take a while or may never happen, so you may have to let him of this relationship for now.
Doesn't sound like a great friend to have anyway. Sometimes you have to lose some things to gain happiness.
Not friend
Abadon him. I was there too, doesnt worth it. You can find other friends no matter how hard can that be, but being friends with a transphobe is never worth it
Time to find a new ""best friend.""
I agree, your friends should not make you feel bad about who you are. They just have to accept it or pass their way, even if it's painful on the moment, trust me it's for the best
I agree but it’s not easy to do
LesleyinSuffolk is quite right. You're better off with trans positive friends.
I never realised how terrible person he was because we didn't speak about these things. I knew for some time that he was homophobic but today I also realised that he is sexist and transphobe.
So a question am I the ahole for ending a friendship with a pedophile because I don't like the fact that a teenager likes little kids in a romantic sense. I disagree on why they like a kid in such a weird way. Am I then not fun to be around then? They are trans (I think so because that's what I know for so far so sorry if I misgendered them) and obviously I respect his pronouns (he/they). I respect anyone's pronouns how else would I call someone if I can't use pronouns on them. But I don't like pedophiles and their existence. I Tbh even asked him what if the child grows up and they said that he won't like the kid anymore
True.
Same it was so worth it
Once had to run away from all of my friends when they shouted at my NB friend saying things like ""YOU GOT A P**** OR A V*******? THEN YOU'RE A GIRL."" (I'm too uncomfortable to state what they actually said, but I'm sure u can understand)"" over and over.


It's sad to see people being so transphobic for no reason
> Tell **her/him**

If only there was a gender neutral word to use...
Todays transphobia is recycled homophobia. And that homophobia is recycled racism. They're always looking for people to hate, and sadly we're considered the bottom of the bucket...
I'm curious, why do you still entertain this person who clearly doesn't respect you?
Sadly those bigotries go together really well. If someone thinks ill of gay people it is very likely they have sour opinions on trans people and probably aren't too fond of treating women properly either. Usually if someone holds one bigotry that means they hold others too.
Welcome to the club... Siiigh, happens to a lot of people. Like I left a friend not because they're transphobic but because they had a terrible view on women and how they're perceived by society. Like he was horrified at the idea of going to a party with a fat girlfriend... Like what.... If you love them it wouldn't matter. 

 It's super sad and sucks when these things happen but if you have already tried to convince them and change there mind and they won't... Then ditch them, your happiness is more important than whatever their issue is.
Fuck well that’s like the holy trinity or something! Sorry to hear that I’m sure it would suck even more as his your best friend. But yeah to mimic everybody else just cut him loose.
This is irrelevant to this specific conversation. If this is real go seek help somewhere other than the comment section of a Reddit post
Being trans has nothing to do with this question and is completely irrelevant and doesn't add context at all. But no, you're not an asshole for cutting off a pedo. But I'm sure you already knew that.
yeah the moment I knew I had to get the hell out of there was when we were having dinner with like 10 of my “friends” at a restaurant and they were having a conversation about how they were “totally not racist or transphobic or homophobic”.

There was someone who was like hey I think gay people are fine but then the conversation literally ended with like “okay but we can all agree that trans people should either all be sent to a mental hospital and conversion camp or be killed”.

And that was literally not even a joke from them like they said it and agreed to it with the most serious tone ever like there was no sarcasm what so ever.

I think I was gonna stay the night at one of their places but after hearing that I literally just couldn’t stay and I said that I dont feel good and called my mom to pick me up. 

Later I had a party at my house and I didn’t invite any transphobic people, I saw them after that and you could see how salty they were about it lol ghosting has never felt better (:
It?
She’s in Spain rn so we don’t see each other anyways, it has just been in group calls and such
Maybe because the commenter of this said that disagreeing on someone's existence is making you not a great person kinda. I disagree on pedophiles existence. It's not really specific what the person said so it can be used on anything.
Hmmm.  If there was such a word that people knew of, I think they would use it more often.
You’re taking those words completely out of context..
I mean we use word ""it"" only for objects and animals here. And people who doesn't deserve to be called in humane form. (Like certain type of criminals)
It's literally what is in the comment.... How else should I take the words then?
I'm not sure if you're making a joke, or totally missing the point.
In English, ""they/them"" can be singular and gender neutral. Use it as much as possible when you don't know
Besides the point, but some people actually do have it/its as pronouns. Calling it by any other pronouns would still be misgendering it and would be transphobic.
And for those who - my comment, i remind you about language and cultural differences that i do not make rules for
Stop being such a troll
Also i don't speak English as my native
Some ppl got mad at me sometimes for using it
Where i live nobody uses it/its pronouns, probably because it's actually not so easy with our tongue.
Then say what those words meant to you from the original comment. It's not hard to explain now is it?
I am absolutely not judging ;) just trying to explain what's expected in that kind of situation.
They have absolutely no reason to! It's never offensive, it's always respectful. Just ignore them and use it ;)
I don't know where you live. I live in the Netherlands, and I don't know any Dutch people who use it either. But I do know people English speaking people online who do. It's not a good idea to start calling everyone ""it"", but I'm just saying, be aware that there are people who's pronouns are it/its.
I guess people these days finds anything offensive
I know there is. And i obviously respect that. I don't know why would anyone think so that i don't. Because where i live, word ""it"" is used to describe objects  animals and people such as child molesters? I don't make those rules, and, again, Finnish language is quite different from many others in general. I don't call everyone ""it"" either. I'd rather ask for pronouns than assume.
If anyone tries to tell you it's not grammatically correct, you can tell them that the most authoritative and respected standards of english grammar all endorse and recommend the singular ""they"". It has also been used in the english language for the better part of a millennium, arguably longer than the singular ""you"".

Need advice on how to help a trans girl w/transphobic parents!	There’s a girl at my school (15MTF) who is going through so much right now. Her moms are super transphobic and don’t let her express herself as feminine. She is out to them but they refuse to believe it. Her parents grounded her just for having a tube of lipstick. I’m wanna help her feel less dysphoric and as I have some extra money rn, I’m able to buy her things. She’s expressed how much she wants makeup and other things like that but can’t because of how transphobic her moms are. I gave her a ring that didn’t fit me bc she didn’t have any jewelry, and she told me that no one had ever been that kind to her before :(. What could I get her to help reduce her dysphoria?	"Her moms sound like *~~gold star lesbians~~* massive terfs.  
It saddens me as a lesbian that there are queer women like this.  
Hopefully in 3 years she can get far away from them and live as her authentic self.
How about a clear coat nail polish? That way she could paint her nails and her parents will have no idea!
You could buy some womens clothing in her size, bring it over to her house to try on for a few hours, and then take them back to your house once you have to leave. That way, she won’t get caught. I’m not sure if this will work, but might as well suggest :)
Top priority is to make sure she’s safe, don’t do anything too risky without proper precaution. If her parents go snooping through her stuff then she can’t have anything obvious at her house, she’ll need somewhere else to keep what she gets.

Aside from clothing and makeup, just being there emotionally is really nice. More then likely she’s got quite a bit on her mind given her parental situation. No need to be pushy, but I’m she’d appreciate a sit down every once and a while.

The fact that you’re even trying to help is incredible, not many trans people get to have people like you in their lives. From the sounds of it, just keep doing what you’re doing.
You can buy her some things and store them at your house.
Just wanted to add: her parents search her stuff weekly, and will ground her if they find anything they don’t like
If she has a locker at school she could consider keeping stuff like lipstick there instead of at home. That really rocks that you are trying to ease her situation, even by a bit.
Hey I just want to say that you're being a good friend. 

If her moms won't get upset about it maybe a stuffed animal or two.

If you've got an Ikea nearby (or can order online), then blåhaj is a great friend to trans folks. Plus its a shark, definitely nothing feminine about a shark 😉

The other thing you can give her is just the gift of being a compassionate shoulder to cry on and ear to listen. Especially given her shit home life. 

Never in a million years would I do crap like that to my kid. smh.
The fact that her parents are (presumably) gay and doing this is horrendous.
she has moms who are transphobic? that is so horrible…you’d think they’d be a little more understanding. just goes to show how widespread transphobia has been and is becoming, and the fact that they search her stuff is so violating. i’m so sorry to hear this.
thank you for coming to this subreddit and wanting to do this for her, that just shows you really care. most people do not take the time to consider let alone care about us this much. 
one thing you can do, above everything, is just ask how she’s doing and let her know that she’s got you in her corner. i’ve gone through the same thing and someone checking in on me meant a lot. it basically never happened and i felt totally alone and hopeless. keep and touch and show her that you see her as the girl she truly is, be mindful not to misgender her, use her name a lot, whenever you can (ofc never around her family. in my experience hearing others say my name casually just makes me so happy), tell her you care about her and what good things you think of her. when you parents reject and shame you that much for who you are especially when youre young it’s pretty traumatic, knowing even just one person sees, accepts us and likes us for who we are helps us cling onto hope.
one thing you might want to get her is some of those cute little socks, the kind that just barely go up your ankles and are more feminine. if you’re someone who likes to wear makeup invite her over and put it on her for her/teach her and help create a safe place for her. i second the other user who said offering to store feminine things to you at your house, you could give things to her at school and take it home for her. also if she has a locker at school she could keep it there as well. i really do hope this advice is able to help at all.
Maybe lip balm thats tinted?? There are some that come in little tins, that could be even more conspicuous. Thank you for being a friend to her
Be her friend.
Hate stories like these. I’d give the parents the ol’ one-two razzle zazzle if I could.

Clear coat nail polish as Josephine said would be a really cool thing to help her feel euphoric while not alerting her shitty family. I think the most important thing you can do though is to just be there and make sure she’s doing okay.
how about hanging out at your house and doing her make up there in secret
1st of, you are exactly the kind of person trans people need, i know this is the bare minimum, but im still so grateful that people like you exist :D

2nd of, try to buy her some androgynous stuff, like jewelery and things, also clear nail polish, its easy to hide but she still has her nails painted

3rd of, try to be a big emotional support for her on dysphoria moments, that is one of the most important things you can do for her.
If you know when her parents search her room you can help by holding the stuff at ur house when they do but if they do it randomly then finding a super secret place would be best. Also small little things like small plushies, clear nail polish, a bracelet ( if they like those things)
Offer to hold things at your house and pass them to her at school maybe?
These 2 moms really puttin the L in LGBTQ ngl.
A bouquet of flowers I tell you she would MELT
You are literally the best person on planet earth wtf
Maybe clear lip balm, or chapstick! She can just say she has chapped lips if her parents find it. And thank you for being an amazing friend :))
I used to lend clothes to a mtf friend at school and she'd give them back right after school ended so she never got caught. Also, depending on the searches, she could potentially hide things in an air vent, in a buried box, in a tree, under a carpet, behind furniture, tapes to the underside of a drawer, inside a mattress, under the floorboards/in the wall of a closet, in an electrical outlet (I'm not an electrician idk if it's safe), etc
Also, what you did, giving your innate feminine ""hand me downs"" is really big, atheist for me it was, because it was affirming. You are given a feminine gift which innately makes you feel more accepted. By getting something that a woman actively uses or endorses, like cover-up, is almost euphoric because it helps with brain associations.
I can't advise you. But good for you supporting her
Maybe keep makeup on you, give it to her, and make sure she gets it off by the time she has to go home?
From another trans girl with transphobic parents, press-on nails are amazing.
Could she come to your house to wear makeup and clothing that she likes and then you help take it all off before she leaves?

I think giving her anything to keep at her house would not be the best of ideas. The priority as others have said is to keep her safe. Hopefully in a few years she can be her true self.
So I grew up in her position. I’m trans ftm and came out to my parents in high school and I got grounded and pulled out of school because of it. But the things that helped me the most while I was in school was I had a few friends who were super supportive who snuck their old men’s clothes or their brother’s old clothes, men’s deodorant, cologne, anything like that that I could change into at school and leave in my locker so there was no chance of getting caught. It’s a difficult situation, but having good friends that will help her out when she’s still living at home is the best you can do. That’s what kept me alive in high school. And now I’ve moved out and I’m medically transitioning. It gets better :)
It's so disheartening to see trans exclusionary folks in the community. **We can't make our safe space smaller.**

From my experience a safe way to celebrate her identity would be to get her some pride pins to wear on clothes or on her backpack. It's great that you're there for her. Best wishes to both of you!
Parents don't need to be their child's first bully. 
I think that your going in the right direction. Get her some cute socks, hopefully they won't notice. Small necklace with a heart on it, some winter gloves that are cute, tinted lip balm. Maybe some light perfume.
I wish her the best of luck.
Get her a lipgloss. She can have it on at school and then wipe it off easily when she goes home.
Perhaps the things you buy for her, you can keep em at your home or something and when you both wanna do the makeup or wearing of clothes, do it in a place where her mothers can't see. You're a good friend and Im sure your friend is grateful of your kindness :). Hopefully she is able to handle her Dysphoria well, dysphoria can be painful and hard to handle sometimes.
If she is able to come over to your house, you could gift her some feminine clothes that she can wear in private with you, do each other's makeup for fun, and other 'girly' activities that can be easily hidden afterwards. Aside from that, really just making sure to call her by the right name and pronouns can make a huge difference (but be careful who you do this around- you don't want to get her in trouble!)
Buy her a bottle of good makeup remover.
Giving her a space at your house to keep things where her parents won’t be able to access it might be appreciated. It’s really sweet of you to try and help <3
Some things that gave me what I later realized was gender euphoria before I came out but at the time were just alternative teenage boy trends were 

* eyeliner 

* black nail polish

*skinny jeans, even men's skinnies

* wearing t-shirts a size small so they showed the shape of my body better (don't mix with skinny jeans - a good rule of fashion is baggy top tight bottoms or vice versa)

* growing my hair out long

* socks with fun patterns on them

* switching to gender neutral deodorant 

Not sure how feasible any of those are for your friend, just some ideas.
Something im trying out since i cant transition publically rn due to how in flux my life is id building an online fem persona. There are free programs out there, like VRoid (this one in particular has mac, pc, and mobile options and is surprisingly robust for a free program), that let you build a 3d model that can be used as an avatar in various online formats. There are also Picrews that let you make a variety of cool 2d avatars for similar purposes. Just the act of making these are fun, but then maybe she can make a twitter or tumblr with one as the profile pic and she can have a online space to act as herself, even at home. And if her parents ask about the programs and characters, she can always say theyre for a roleplaying game
I would probably put together a little to-go makeup bag for her to keep in her locker or backpack. Mascara, lipstick, blush, (colorpop has really nice cream blushes for like $8) and some highlight. Drugstore makeup can actually be really good (mostly elf and wet n wild). Also some makeup wipes. That way, she can spend some time before class putting it on, and take it off before she goes home. Im glad youre being a good friend to her. She needs it.
If you invite her to hang out with you the two of you could go shopping. Keep the clothes you buy at your house. Then frequently invite her to come over and do literally anything you like to do together. She can change into the femme stuff when she gets there, then change back into what she was wearing when she's about to go home.
Ask her what she wants specifically, buy it, and have her keep it in a place her parents will not search. (Like a school locker where she can change in the bathroom). Also, if you can invite guests to your house, invite her over. Just being there for her can be very helpful!
I’d be the daily dealer of all things fem for them cause I know some parent can be total asses about it. I personally had to have my friends help to order in fem clothes for myself really helped out. Then I could go over to their place be girl mode if I so desired hangout then be able to go home happy. I do like the try and conceal as much makeup as you can. Use that same trick of being able to facilitate their want for makeup by being able to give them it for school so they can do their thing preclasses idk I don’t really do makeup other than lipstick and a little foundation when I get a pimple or scratch myself. So for me It’d be easy best of luck tho
I’m not sure but you just being a good friend will help more than you know
You can't say you're apart of the lgbt if you don't include the t. It's crazy how they're queer and don't accept their daughter.

Anyways here's some ideas:
-flavored lip balm
- items with secret compartments (something that needs a key) so that she can hide her make up in it. 
- multi-use clothing (y'know, like a thneed) that way she can wear dresses and skirts while also disguisong it as a simple scarf or something
- trans pride pins
invite her over for a makeup party and to try on clothes, maybe take her shopping at a thrift store
I truly apologise beforehand if any of my reply is triggering to anyone or worded incorrectly anywhere,i try not to offend but somehow it always manages to annoy at least 1 person & i'm pretty new to all this so here goes:

I know most of this has already been said but really just be as good a friend to her as you can,be there to listen to her or a just to be a shoulder to cry on,don't misgender her,use her chosen name (when it's safe to do so) & if possible give her a safe place where she can be her true self (obviously respecting her privacy if she's wanting to change into something more feminine).

I myself am dating my first trans gf & the way her parents/family treat her is disgraceful,she's out to them all but they constantly refer to her as ""he/him"" & still use her dead (male) name but i really didn't know there was this much transphobia in the gay/lesbian side of the community too,i thought it was all supposed to be inclusive?shouldn't they support each other?no wonder our government doesn't care when they act like this towards each other.
So a couple of things:

1. I go to school an hour away from my house, and she is a couple years younger than me so it will probably be very awkward to bring her to my house. 

2. I recently got a starter kit from trestique makeup. They’re small and look like pencils! I will get the labels off of them so they’ll look more like pencils. 

3. I don’t know her well enough yet to know exactly what she needs, and I also don’t want to overstep any boundaries. 

4. She can’t have any feminine clothes at her house. Like at all. And if she presents fem at school I don’t wanna risk someone telling her moms. 

5. She also has curly hair and I was thinking maybe I could get some styling products for her hair. 

Tysm for the advice everyone!
(I'm going to try to mostly stick to things i haven't read others write so if these are not that great then oh well) 

Clip on earrings are fun, assuming her ears aren't pierced. Or hell, clip on jewelry in general. If i remember correctly, they make hats with built in wigs (i assume she has short hair). She could maybe get away with having eyeliner in her pencil bag, depending on the size and shape of the tube and how invasive her parents are. 

There's a technique to turn a Tshirt into a skirt without sewing or cutting the material (making it fully reversible back into a shirt). You could link her to a video about that [such as this one.](https://youtube.com/shorts/13xz56DbnYU?feature=share)

Pretty much everything that you do buy for her i recommend you hold onto for her when she has to go home. Judging by what you've written, if her parents find any of the fem stuff she uses they'll take it away from her and punish her.
Speaking from experience, one of the best things is if you can have her hang out at your place often. It meant a lot to me to have a place I could go and to present feminine when I was around that age.

Even just giving her a space to store her own makeup and clothes will be a huge help and will hopefully at least break up the dysphoria a bit.
Ew, gross, imagine doing that to your own child.

Really cool of you to be helping her out like this OP!

Aside from just being there for her, maybe get her clear nail polish, a mostly plain necklace and/or bracelet, clip-on earrings, and maybe women's clothes that are reasonably masculine (button-up shirts, women's sweatpants, stuff like that). Basically anything that can be reasonably passed off as masc will work, since it won't be obvious. If you're able, keeping more obviously fem stuff in your house/locker/etc. and then giving it to her to wear when she's away from her parents can work too. If you hang out together do it at your house, and there you can help her play around with makeup and stuff in a place where her moms won't be able to search!

As always safety first, and if something seems like it might be even remotely too obvious, don't do it.
I had a trans friend in highschool who would use my address to have trans-conforming things delivered and keep them at my house. Then, since their assigned gender was the same as mine, we just had awesome sleepovers where we dressed them up and did makeup and stuff. I was very cordial and polite with their parents so they probably assumed I was a religious kid and were happy their child found a good influence. Little did they know....
You could buy some femme clothes in her size, you bring them to school every morning and she changed into them. At last bell she changes into her masc clothes and goes home. You keep the femme clothes at your place so the moms can't discover them.
For me it helps my dysphoria to have a morning routine. So maybe some sweet smelling soap for face washing, more feminine deodorant, you could remove the label to keep it a secret, lotion, stuff like that. Even if her parents find them it wont come off as strange
I got nothing, but I still just want to thank you for the kindness that you're showing this person. You are what I strive to be on a daily basis.
Have makeup and make up remover for her that you carry in your bag. She can wear it during school then take it off and go home

Offer to store items for her that she can't have, have sleep overs and things at your house so she doesn't have to go home.

Look for LGBT resources around your area, maybe she can find a place to live away from them
This might be a little out of your comfort zone, but have you considered just spending some girl time together?

When I was in high-school I spent alot of my time with female friends who would do my makeup and we'd do stereotypical girl stuff like try on dresses. It did wonders for my gender dysmorphia.

For me, the best way to feel better about myself was to look at pictures where I look like a girl. Even if I couldn't dress fem, it made me feel better to know that the cute girl I'm looking at is me.
I'm going to sit this out, because all my advice would lead to long jail time.
A couple ideas, sometimes things can give you euphoria if they are nuetral just because they say women's on the tag, maybe buy her clothes that are nuetral and her parents might not question, a sweater that's not particularly gendered but might be in a slightly more feminine cut, jeans that are totally nuetral but are labeled as women's, nuetral deoderant ect. If that might be something she would be interested in. If she has lockers at school you could get her some easy to remove makeup (lipgloss, blush, maybe even false lashes, which might be a bit hard to do in her locker, but are easily removed)  makeup wipes, and a locker mirror, so she could do her makeup in her locker before school starts, and wipe it off before she goes home. Same goes for jewelry and such, she could store it in her locker and put them on before school. If these don't work perhaps you could work on finder her a place to store them that is secret, temped to the bottom side of her bed or something, that's all I got, hope it's helpful.
As a trans girl with transphobic parents (thankfully not as bad) still living at home some of the things I have done is clear lip gloss, if used lightly not many can tell. Clear nail polish (I covered it up by saying it will help me stop my nail biting habit) along with just a couple pairs of underwear that are easy to hide. Of course for her she’d have to be careful if she were to get a pair to hide. If you want to approach her with the last option I would let her pick something that she likes online and then you can buy and ship it to your house and give it to her at school in a discrete manner. Jewelry like rings like you mentioned along with thinks like necklaces help a lot too. If she can get away with getting stud earrings she should try that under the guise of stud earrings being popular/“normal” for men to wear as well. Good luck to the both of you and thank you for being such a great ally! ❤️
Possible alternative motivation:

It may not explicitly transphobia (or at least transphobia for transphobia's sake).  It is real easy to get anxious over what ""people"" say and think of a relationship.  Compulsory cishet normativity pervades most modern cultures.  The moms likely already have/had to deal with this just in their personal romantic lives.  Factor in a child, there is already homophobic suspicion against same-sex couples raising kids (whether their own biological or adoptive).  If that child comes out as anything other than cishet, then the phobes immediately draw the conclusion that their ""parents"" did this to them (hell, they already use this argument against cishet parents who support their trans kids).  It may be less that the moms are purely transphobic, but may have too much fear of how having a trans child will be perceived and the potential consequences because of that.  

It does not make this right, but simply pointing out that it may be a bit more nuanced.  If the child is one of the mom's biological offspring, ,then there may be that child's sperm-donor who feels entitled to say over the child.  The child coming out as trans may be all the ""evidence"" they need to get a court order for custody  (I am pretty sure my late sperm-donor would have done this, and succeeded, if I had come out when I was a minor).  If this scenario is true, then a mom likely would over-react to try and protect the status-quo from a potentially worse scenario.  Also, most parents suck at effectively communicated with their kids.

There could be geographical concerns as well.  If they are in Texas, technically the family could get reported to the state's version of child protective services and investigated for child abuse,  just because they were being supportive of their child transitioning.  Other parts of the world can be worse.  

My basic point is there may be factors in play that you might be able to help address, which could precede an open acceptance of their daughter.  The trick here is not exposing too much of yourself as once they peg you as an ""enemy"" you're gonna have a bad time trying to help your friend.  Talk and counsel your friend into fishing for information from their moms' friends/family.  If someone in their inner circle is supportive of trans rights, then that person may be a confidant on finding out the motivations behind the mothers' apparent transphobia and subsequently how to navigate that.

The other option is to go 100%, full on, rebellious teenage mode (if it is safe to do so).  Start with firmly declaring feelings of gender dysphoria and desire to get counselling and transition.  Do not argue, do not fight, just lay out the facts, intruding herself with her preferred name and pronouns.  Get her some sewing needles and thread, scissors, and the will to alter some of her clothes into skirts, crop tops, etc.  Have her only respond to her preferred name and pronouns and ignore everything they say if they use the wrong ones.  Out herself to the rest of the family and to her moms' friends, including how much it hurts that they won't let her get seen and treated for this.  

This is the nuclear option.  It risks punishments, losing family and friends, possibly getting kicked out, and a lot and lot of angst and drama.  But your friend has a leg up over most kids in this situation.  It wasn't that long ago that her mom's relationship would be considered illegitimate and it may be considered such again soon if Justice Clarence Thomas has his way (in the U.S.).  Anything they throw at her to delegitimize her as trans can be immediately turned back on them and being homosexual.  It's dirty pool, but I have lost much of my ability to sympathize with parents that won't support their children's health.
I recommend every trans person (or actually just any person in general) learn how to sew. It is incredibly cheap to do and learn: there are hundreds of free YouTube videos about how to hand sew with increasing difficulty levels. Fabric can be obtained for free or cheap; either by taking apart old clothes that no longer fit, using old stained or torn bedsheets that would be otherwise thrown away (cutting around stains and tears) or getting bedsheets for a very low cost at thrift stores to use as fabric. Needles and thread can be obtained in sewing repair kits for very cheap even sometimes at gas stations. 

When I was a kid before I came out to my parents, I (FTM) was taught how to sew by my great grandma. She unfortunately passed away about a year later, and since I was the only person in the family interested in sewing, when they cleaned out her apartment my family gave me her old sewing stuff (fabric, needles, thread.). She never knew I was trans. But I used some of that stuff to make myself a binder and eventually later a packer. Being able to make your own clothes, but also make your own stuff like tucking supplies and breast forms is very helpful and nobody can take the knowledge of knowing how to sew away from u, nor can they take away your access to cloth in general.
Don't do it wait till their 18 then move
Perfume, but in a cologne bottle.
A one-way plane ticket.

edit: nvm. 15.
Ouch that sucks 😔 just try to be with them and let them feel they are valid.
Someone mentioned having their friend hold all their girly stuff at their house. Girls have been doing this for years. Be it ""slutty clothes"" ""goth clothes"" or whatever.
Yess better then being homeless I know where this is going
I prefer FART, or ""feminism appropriating radical transphobe"". It's not feminism if it's not for all women.
[deleted]
Gold star lesbians more like pyrite star lesbians amirite
Tysm! I’ll get some!
Doing this not at her house would likely be safest - can't count on the parents to respect her privacy just because there's a friend over. If your house is safer I'd recommend that instead.
it would probably be better for OP to invite her to their house to try it on so theres no risk of parents seeing and finding out
Yeah I've been her in the past and I still have no solution. I just waited and moved out which is awful and you're awesome for helping her get through it
Sounds a lot like my parents, though maybe they're not transphobic, idk. I'm not out to them, in large part because we've been at minimal contact basically since they icked me put for my 18th birthday. Anyway, enough of my own griping. Here's what I'd advise based on my own life. She's going to have to get REALLY good at hiding things.gpue sticks make amazing innocuous objects to hide things inside of so long as you don't have a suspicious amount of them on hand all the time. Crack the bottom spinner off, pull the column out the middle, then snap the bottom back on and boom, easy concealment. We did the same with flashlights etc. Obviously, storage capacity is limited, but it was really useful at the time (I hid DS games and shit in mine, turns out my brother was a drug dealer but that's another story)

A fee good friends around to help take the heat off is always appreciated, but as that friend, remember she's likely going to want to spend more time at your place than hers. Since you're already aware of the situation I'd imagine it'll be less of a problem than it was for me (my friends didn't understand the full scope until after I moved out because it was so ingrained as normal for me). If your parents are safe people to talk to about it, let them know what's happening so they get the full picture on why this person wants to he over all the time. My friends parents practically adopted me after they found out what was happening. 


I think it's clear I may have over relied on my friends to escape but oh well
Maybe call child protective services. And by maybe I mean do it.
It's your job as a parent to support your kids, unless they're like murdering people
just cuz someone is gay, doesnt mean they can't be transphobic, I found this out the hard way, its honestly very sad
Last thing lesbians need is more lesbophobia.
Do not put stuff in electrical outlets or air vents, I'm also not an electrician but I know it could start a fire or fuck up your HVAC
Tysm!!! Will def do this soon! I was thinking we could even get our nails done at the salon together and she could get clear polish!
Although my kids never want to learn to sew, I couldn’t agree more with this.  I currently alter many of my son’s clothes because of his stature (FTM). It’s a good skill to learn if anything to raise hems, or to use patterns and alter them (fem or masc) for height, hip, or chest changing.  Start with easy patterns, and work your way up. It’s how I had to learn.  Altering existing clothing, tearing apart—seeing how it’s put together, also helps.  Great suggestion!
So they should just let their friend spend 3 years in hell?
Thanks for this, I’m using it.
TERF still works, as long as it stands for Trans Exclusionist Reactionary Fascist
Feminism Appropriating Reactionary Transphobe is a good one too
I disagree. They can't be a feminist if they're against women. They're bigots.
To play devil's advocate they do believe in their small minds that it is for all women, since they dont believe trans girl are real girls
We can them bigots.
LMAO YES
So smaller things that could be more easily concealed would be better? I can't believe her parents would act like that, they're treating her like a prisoner or something!
the foster care system could be worse for her sadly
Do not do this without her explicit permission. It's not your place to decide that for her.
No no no, it's the job of parents to dictate the very destiny of their child. To force their ideals on them because children aren't people, they are essentially owned by the parents until they're 18, and even after 18 it needs to respect its parents (which everyone knows means obey unquestionably). How DARE you have independent thoughts different than your parents ideas for you and who you are!

/s

(lil rant, but I swear this is how my parents, and apparently this poor girl's moms think...)
I know. It just makes it so much worse.
That’s not what they were saying I don’t think. It’s a pun cuz L also means loss and it’s used a lot to refer to something as generally negative.
Id hardly consider the above comment as some sort of generalization, instead it seems to be focusing on the gatekeeping and transphobia this girl is experiencing from her own queer parents.
I apologize if I came off that way, but I have no problem with lesbians or girls being with girls; I said this because of the irony of facing hate for being one way, but hating someone else for being in the same what is considered umbrella term of queer. I hope this clears up any misconceptions, sorry😅
Calm down, its a very obviously a stupid joke.
That sounds like a really good idea and you seem like a good person :)

It seems like she lacks a safe space, so the best thing you can do is just allow herself to be *her*
Not to mention how high cost of moving is, these days, even if she were to wait till she's 18 to move.
Don't play devil's advocate with the lives of trans women. It's not cute.
Fr!!!
It can def be worse. I'm a foster child and foster parents are the only reason I'm alive today. It's a tricky topic.
Yeah, infighting, attacking our fellow comrades, when we should be fighting the fight together
Ah sorry I misconstrued. Lesbians unfortunately get a bad rap in the queer community because a very vocal minority are terfs and so the whole lesbian community gets branded as transphobic as a result. I thought this was another reinforcement of that stereotype.
Thank u sm! Tbh I’m blown away by how many responses I’ve had!
Well I certainly believe that, until the dysphoria hits lol.
In the same vein; tinted chapstick, some are barely noticeable
It’s not infighting to those particular people. There’s an unsettling number of people that only believed in the LGBT+ to boost numbers and get their win - then it became the LGB in their eyes
Oh, it’s ok. It’s understandable that you thought that way, I should’ve clarified more instead of sounding like a dumbass, but at least you understand what I’m getting at
Believe it or not, trans people tend to enjoy supportive people lol.
maybe some clip on earrings"	y4ap1i	trans	869	0.99	2022-10-15 01:11:57
An analogy for dysphoria	"So, i once read this analogy for dysphoria, and i figured i'd share it with y'all (Sorry to the person whom i stole it from, but i dont remember your username):  
So, imagine you're in a restaurant. Everyone there is being served water, but you somehow keep getting salt water in the process. Of course, it doesn't look any different, but it tastes awful and literally dries you out. But you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because you only have your salt water to compare it to. Anytime you complain that you're thirsty, which is due to the water being salty, you get told to have some more, even though it is literally the root cause of your problems. But you don't realize this. Everyone else is just fine, so clearly, the problem must be with you. It is only when you get to try someone else's water that you realize the source of the problem had never been you all along."	"That is perfect, it is literaly how you discover that you are trans, just need to try new things until you find what matches you, thanks for sharing
I like it!
I always say it's like wearing a shirt that's a size too small. It's doable, but extremely uncomfortable. You want to rip the shirt off but you can't.

I've also heard someone use the too small shoes analogy.
That is a good one. I am definitely going to think on it some more.

I am a fan of dysphoria as shoes that are too small/very uncomfortable. It doesn't so much describe the social nature, but most cis folks have had and can ""feel"" that experience. It can be used to explain the pain of dysphoria, the joy of euphoria, and how it is often not front of mind but still low key fucks with everything in your life.
Imagine you go to a costume party dressed as a police officer. You get to the party and start trying to mix in. 

Eventually the real police turn up to shut the party down and are glad you are already on site to assist. 

You realise it’s illegal to impersonate a police officer so you kind of go with it, hoping to quickly get changes when no one is looking.

Next thing you know you’ve been on the force for 29 years, they are about to give you a gold watch and everything. You can’t handle living this lie anymore and really just want to have the life you were supposed to have; but your terrified because now you have been impersonating a police officer for an entire career and surely they will lock you up and throw the key away.

You wish you just went to the party as a slutty cat like every other girl in 2004...
Oh god. Yeah this is really good.   


I almost veered into like a caricature of hyperfemininity before I accepted that I was trans because I kept thinking - spurred on by others - well if I'm GOOD at being a lady, then it'll feel better - right?  


Big oof.
This is awesome im stealing it lol
Literally one of my first trans awakenings was when these group of girls in middle school had me try on one of their shoes. I loved the sensation so much I wanted to just take the shoes and run. It was just like trying someone elses water and going okay so there is something wrong with my water.
I came up with this analogy of ""everyone is colour blind but you""

Ok, so your favourite outfit is made of red clothes, and you can see that it's red, but everyone else thinks it's blue. You're favourite colour is red and you tell everyone that the outfit you're wearing is your favourite colour, but since everyone else only sees red as blue, they tell everyone else that your favourite colour is blue. You think that you must be crazy or something because you're the only person who can see the colour red, and before you, nobody even acknowledged it as a colour so you start to ignore the colour red and pretend it's blue, because that's what everyone else says it is. After a while you realize that you *really* hate blue and would much prefer red, but you're too scared because you think everyone will see you as crazy for saying red is a thing.
See me at table 9 chugging a pitcher that isn't mine
What an insightful and delightfully simple comparison. Kudos to you!
I really like this 👉👈
That is literally the best way anyone can put it !
This is a very good analogy! I've also heard it described as an alarm bell in the far distance, or an air conditioning unit that's always been on; you don't realize there's extra noise until it changes, it turned off, or someone/thing brings attention to it. The main point is we don't know what's wrong, because our society is built to make certain concepts inconceivable.

So stealing this, thank you so hard for this awesomesauce
Whole lotta ""you"" s out here, so much so that almost like it's telling something, not quiet sure what it is 🤔
I was just thinking today that maybe it could be explained like... less dramatic in some cases than the analogy suggests, but. Like, you have diesel engines and gasoline engines, right? Well, if you have a diesel engine, and you're trying to run it on gasoline; or if you have a gasoline engine and you're trying to run it on diesel; the engine doesn't run very well. It gets problems. And MOST engines come with accurate labels about which kind of fuel they need, so MOST people go around with their cars running fine, but sometimes you get a diesel engine that's labeled as gasoline or a gasoline engine that's labeled as diesel, and no one knows better at first, so it's trying to run with the fuel the label says it should have (to be clear, the fuel in this analogy is estrogen or testosterone, and the engines are brains, and the labels are genitals. Some engines even are missing labels or get both labels or part of one label and part of the other, and then someone has to guess which kind of fuel the engine should be run on, and they don't always get it right). And if the engine was mislabeled, then it causes a lot of problems! It won't run as well as it should, at least, and sometimes it might blow up, or gum up altogether. And the only way to fix the problem is to recognize that your engine isn't running as well as it should, figure out that the problem is the fuel it's trying to run with, and switch the fuel.
It feels like phantom limb syndrome for parts I wasn't born with
For me it wasn't the saltwater but when the normal water suddenly changed to vinegar... Aka puberty xD it fucked me up :(
I've heard of the scratchy sweater analogy too, same idea I think :)
LOL yes! And in my case I wanted to go as the cat girl to the party, but my family told you no , so I sucked it up and went as the officer, and all this shit happened. Good think I’m finally off the force 😌
I wouldnt say built to, i think its more the fact that society isnt built to allow it.
I think you didn't understand the idea of analogies.
Good question...
Same
Same I always knew something wasn’t right with me I just didn’t know what and then puberty hit and I suddenly realized what it was
Same here. Was perfectly okay being straight up and down. Sans bumps.
[removed]
I always felt fine. Got raised gender neutral, I could do what I want. Had male and female toys, always wore a lot of costumes (dresses, cowboy clothes, batman, etc.) But I never felt out of place or anything. Untill puberty started. But it was a very VERY slow progress and it didn't really bother me untill it became very visible that I was changing and then I lost my mind lol.
\*Says something dumb\*  
""Hey, what you're saying is dumb""  
""Haha, gotcha!""
Well, I guess that's understandable since puberty, even though it changes mainly a lot on the body, makes our mind be able to process things even better regarding ourselves and so basically we are a lot more able to realise what we actually enjoy and want, especially with the body changes. That does not mean you need to be in or have finished puberty for learning you might be trans, but usually, it's a trigger for many people also to change their behaviour and mindset a lot."	mvhkxp	trans	852	1.0	2021-04-21 15:02:17
My dysphoria fueled vent art, hope you enjoy ( ꈍᴗꈍ)		"This looks like a jojo character pose
It’s beautiful. Trans talent never fails to amaze me!! 🥰😍😘
I love this. I’ve been meaning to try using art as a way to express and explore my gender more.
Why does this low-key remind me of Starfire from the OG teen titans? I love it tho, it looks great!
I love this so much
This character belongs in The Road to El Dorado
Reminds me of jojo
So much talent in this, it’s amazing! Thank you for showing us this!

Started shaving my arms/hands about two weeks ago and it really took away a lot of dysphoria		"Same. Been shaving my whole body, arms and legs especially. It really does help.
Damn, girl! That is one fine hand. Way to accessorize, too.
I found arm hair comes back suuuper prickly the first couple times. But slows down alot.
Holy shit you have cute hands girl!
I feel you in that one. Freaking love it! Oh don’t forget to moisturize for those who haven’t. I learned the hard way not to forget after shaving. 👉🏻👈🏻 😅
Nice, I’ve done basically the opposite (FtM) and it does take away a lot of dysphoria, also your nails look really nice!!!!
Dang you have such petite hands and wrists!  Your accessory game is on point too!

If poss,  consider sugaring your arms and hands - will reduce hair growth, take longer for it to grow back, and it also is super satisfying to pull it off…  but I might be a masochist so 😅
yep legs + arms are necessary for me too
And it helps to have such lovely hands!
Where do you get your rings?
I have the same nailpolish 🌸
Agreed, I hate my body hair. i cant stand to look at it.
Your arms and hands look very feminine!
Give me tips please! I want to shave my body but idk how to do it right
Bro, I would love to have arms that smooth. I know that defies the trans man stereotype, but I really hate having hair everywhere.

Edit: waitwaitwait not bro like man bro like in a general sense kind of meme way-
Looks good, feels good too I bet. I nair my hands seems to catch more than the razor especially on lower fingers/knuckles.
I feel ya, sister!
Nice Lexus
hands???
I've been debating on bleaching my arm hairs, since they're not that thick and I have enough places to shave!
It does help
My arms and legs can stay hairy, I don’t got time and are extremely paranoid of slicing my tattoos !   
   You’re rocking those rings
[deleted]
[removed]
Omg legs are a must haha
I've done it a few times, but it takes so long!
Thank you!!! :)
Using an epilator for arms can have really great results.
Thank you 😊
Haha omg yes!!
Thanks!!
Haha! I will try this thanks for the tip!! And thank you!!
Aww thank you 😊 you made my day!
All over! The rings in this picture all came from CVS actually haha.
Twinning!! I love this color it’s what I usually wear
Thank youuu
Message me!
Haha it’s cool no offense given none taken
I use Harry’s razors on my face, arms, and hands and it hits the fingers very well
I use single use women’s razors for my legs as using new blades every shave drastically cuts down on razor burn I also use Shea butter body bar instead of shaving cream for my legs
Thanks!! Not mine I work for Lexus but I get to drive them and I can pick any of the loaners off the lot to take home each night
Yes hands
Huh? Lol
r/lostredditors
Yeah. Especially since I never wear long pants. Only shorts, dresses and skirts.
Yeah. Especially since I never wear long pants. Only shorts, dresses and skirts.
When it was my first time with long hair, I used a body groomer to trim it down, and then used the Venus razor with moisturizer bar to really get all that off. It works fairly quickly. :)
I second this! I refuse to use any method but epilation on my arms. Legs too, honestly.
Thank you!
No problem!
Nice choice in vehicle too 😋
Also i like your nails! Your hands looks like a cis womans if that makes any sense
Eh, not me trying to be funny 😬 I'm transguy so I meant I stoped and it made me feel better. Sorry, didn't mean to offend anyone
My first week out I was SO scared to wear shorts and terrified to go out in a skirt, but then I shaved my legs and realized that I actually have really nice legs!!! :) so now I LOVE wearing skirts/dresses/shorts plus it’s summer time so fuck wearing long pants lol
I can’t do shorts, too much dysphoria, reminds me of the changing in the boys locker room during middle & high school.
Thank you for the advice. If you don't mind, may I ask how much area, and how often?
No probs!! They have a REALLY nice selection of golds and silvers and they have an entire rack with gems too I think their cheapest rings are like $7.99 but if you’re like me and accessorize constantly then it’s a great deal!
Oh I work for Lexus it isn’t mine! But I get to drive them whenever I want which is nice!! Makes me feel like a classy woman haha
😊 thanks!
[deleted]
That is what I meant. I can’t wear shorts or anything but I’m to nervous to wear skirts or dresses or anything like that when I go out in public.
Depends largely on a few factors. For me, I only have to shave once a week thanks to HRT, but that initial shave took a while since I essentially had to shave twice. I also shave my whole arm,  but not my armpits yet. For that I’ll probably wax since I don’t want ingrown hairs there.
What are you nervous about?"	ozw4iu	trans	852	0.99	2021-08-07 16:12:49
I hate being fucking trans there’s nothing good about it the amount of dysphoria i get from this shit is insane all my friends are mad atme for not coming to school and shit and they try to relate their self to me they dont understand my dysphoria being trans sucks and having the cycle is even worse		"Whenever I feel shit about being trans I like to look at r/transtimelines to just remember that there is hope for the future
It really gets better, I promise. The dysphoric days gradually fade away and we become more comfortable in ourselves, I think the true end goal is to just not give a fuck what anybody else thinks and feel comfort in knowing you’re strong for even going through with transitioning. Message me if you want any advice or just a chat.
I'd do anything to be cis. I don't care if cis man or cis women, just cis
I don't think anyone really likes it tbh i also hate it i wish I could just be happy with what I have. But i can't so we have to make the best of it because it won't go away no matter what I do.
it gets better , sending love
Welcome to being an oppressed minority. It sucks, but it does get better. Building community is the first step. I think a lot of young adult trans people make the mistake of resenting their cis friends for not knowing *exactly* how you want to be talked about/treated etc right off the bat. If people are trying their best, it's because they care about you. Let them.
do you wanna be friends?
Oh god… it gets better!!! You’re still so young I promise you once you’re out of school the problems that seemed like the end of the world are going to be non existent
being trans is very painful, but you get to create yourself everyday in a way cis people can't. when you are young and trans there's an extra added feeling of a lack of control. i remember seeing a youtuber talk about ""what to do before hormones"" and he said to document everything, because you're going to want to look back on it one day. i started recording myself and keeping a journal and he was right, i wish i recorded more of my process even. you trick your brain into treating it like a journey. just know some day you are going to look back at this pain and be so proud of yourself that you kept going.
Everything will brighten up my friend. Trans men/masc having cycles sucks badly, and as a trans woman who doesn't have one, I can't relate well enough as I'm starting to experience the cycle, just without blood. Everything will get better and your friends needs to understand more that sometimes we aren't meant to understand, only accept these for who they are and be there for them. 

Hang in there
I have this when i look at my (cis) boyfriend. As a trans man looking at the way his body is sculpted when he’s naked can sometimes be painful. I keep thinking to myself how i will never be able to look like that and how much i hate my own body. Or sometimes when he steals my clothes and my pants sit just right on his hips, like the way i wish pants looked on me… I love looking at him because he’s the most gorgeous human I’ve ever seen but sometimes the voices in my head get too loud. I keep trying to tell myself that it will get better but right now the 5k fee for the top surgery feels unreachable.. 
Anyway the point is, you’re not alone. I know that’s not much help but I definitely feel and share your pain.
Those people don't sound like healthy friends, ur issues are real and u deserve to feel like that x
Yeah I feel you on that. This fucking sucks.
I don't want to invalidate your feelings at all, but back when I still had periods I basically was miserable the whole time, and my dysphoria was through the roof. If you decide you wanna do testosterone, it frequently stops your cycle entirely after some time, but even if you don't wanna do t, there's other options for stopping menstruation. Good luck! Getting through my period was always the worst part of being trans for me. 💕💕💕💕
Not being happy with the body we are given is a universal human experience. It's up to you to make it one that suits your tastes.
I feel this 
I’m almost two years on hormones and 4 months post top and I still fucking hate this every day
I used to hate myself for being trans because of how I felt people treated around me, but after a long while of working on my self and surrounding myself with good people who accept me, I can say that it's something that I embrace and love about myself now <3 Just know you aren't alone and there is hope, stay strong and persevere!
[deleted]
Good until I started looking like me on the inside. Now the most dysphoria I feel is genital and even that's on and off
One of the few positive things Ive found about transitioning at 39 is that my give a damn level is so low it doesn't matter. There has been no better time to come out than now, 20 years ago it was brutal, partially why I kept stepping to the edge and backing off. You are incredibly young, you dont see it yet, but you will. Your older self will thank you for doing what you are doing now instead of waiting till the wrong hormones wreck havoc on your body. 

One day at a time. Keep up with your hobbies, the distraction is very useful. You will make it. I know everyone's experiences are very different but I look back and realize if I can make it through 2 tours in the sandbox, I can make it through this. School is just as brutal, especially with what you are going through right now. Kids are terrible but sleep well knowing that when they get older they will absolutely remember how shitty they were to you. I remember every single time I was an asshole to classmates.

I don't have much useful advise but visualizing where I'm going to be in 2 years gives me hope for the future. That and I do look forward to being a hot chick ripping around town in my DeLorean.
I feel you and I'm sorry that it's hard right now but soon the cycle will stop, you'll be on T and it'll be good. I send hugs
Thank you bro
Underrated coping mechanism
This page is wonderful and helped my egg crack tbh……I still look at it all the time
I don't see any trans men on there after scrolling for a little... So for me not so much..
R/transtimelines honestly makes me more dysphoric. Reminds me of what I'll never be able to achieve
I fucking love being trans, I am special, I belong to a group of lovely people like yourself, and I'll gladly try to be trans in public to inspire and annoy!

You got this, read, learn, if your friends don't like you, fuck em
I don't exactly love being trans, but you gotta learn how to speak for yourself. I know many people who love being gender queer.
Good Attitude goes a long way
Thank you

Tyyyyy
I started progesterone 2/22/22 and i think my biggest mistake was thinking it would work immediately but in 5 months im starting t but its really hard to handle all this dysphoria
I don't think telling someone to get over it helps with anything.
r/thanksimcured
Don't do that don't say shit like that it's so incredibly invalidating
You got this bro, chin up.

Also, you got on T on 2/2/22? Nice!
Being trans is nothing special. We’re all just normal people. We can be awesome, we can be shitty. We’re not any different than cis people.
message me anytime! i totally feel your pain and spent many years trying to figure out how to explain this feeling to my parents (which really i still haven’t been able to and i’m 21 now) but i had a really hard time as a teenager and i didn’t think i would ever make it to 18, and once i did i didn’t think i’d get this far. but my 21st birthday came and this year i’ll finally have enough money to pay for surgery and i’ve finally started making enough money to pay for my hormones. it does get better! i promise it does.
I really wish I could help more, but I'm always available to talk if you need it! I would recommend using all your euphoria-boosting stuff right now when it's hardest: favorite clothes, underwear, binder, packer, ect. Take good care of yourself with favorite drinks and foods, too! Surround yourself with any people you have in your life that make you feel valid!
I made the same mistake and even after six months it's still happening and I don't know what to do
Can be , my bad - just want op to be alright with himself
I got on hormone blockers 2/22/22 im getting on t in 5 months😎💪
I think being trans is a very special experience not everyone gets to have. Some people hate that they have it, especially with all the discrimination. But a lot of cultures held gender queer people in a special place in society, and many of us have a unique connection to gender and our bodies we wouldn't have if we were cis. Most people have a certain trait that makes them special in *some* sense. Being an artist is special. Or a musician. Or a doctor and such. I don't like how special is automatically associated with attention seeking or something. It can mean better/greater than, or it can just mean different in a positive light. Nothings wrong with that
Nah person, no not at all. You keep that one to yourself, because no. Someone who fought the tides to become themselves, who did the self reflection, who fought their personal battles, no, that's fucking special.

You never have to agree with another soul on this planet, but no, I am not ""not any different"" than cis people, than allies, than other trans or whatever people.

You exist here for about 12 minutes or whatever in the cosmic sense, make it fucking special.
Tyy
A large majority of people never self reflect or look deep inside to discover who they truly are, I agree that is special."	t5v7ss	trans	825	0.97	2022-03-03 16:19:42

Can a transwoman be a tomboy?	Hey y'all (Scott here), I have a trans friend that, she and I have been chatting for 3 months. She's made some jokes that I'm an egg. I tell her often I have no dysphoria, and she always makes a quip or ioke about that too, and it's making me think, maybe I could be trans. I'm a 27, almost 28 year old white guy, and my interests are primarily male Centered ones (Steeet Fighter, Dragon Ball, horror movies etc.), so it leads me back to the question at hand. What do y'all think? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.	"As a trans woman and a tomboy absolutely yes
As a trans woman who has just spent the day refinishing furniture and now is relaxing with a glass of whisky… do what makes you happy.

Hobbies don’t inherently have gender. Society assign it in order to create power inequalities to maintain a status quo. 

Look at baking for example. Western society assigned baking as a “woman centric” hobby. Whereas it’s been a male dominated profession forever. Hmm… Where are all the male baking hobbyists? Guess by simple logic a man can’t enjoy baking unless they are already in pastry school. 

See the fragile logic? Just peer past the thin veil and you’ll see it’s not black and white. It took me a while to see that. Whether your are trans or cis… just taking a closer look at the fragility of gender norms will benefit you in your journey of self discovery.
A trans woman can be a tomboy just as much as a cis woman can. Interests and expression are entirely separate from gender identity, the only reason people conflate them as being one and the same is because of arbitrary gender roles and expectations that are drilled into us from the minute we're born.
absolutely. im a trans woman and consider myself very much a tomboy, my interests are mostly still pretty ""masculine"", by conventional standards, i dont bother with always changing my speech, etc, and cis girls think im pretty hot, i mean im pretty feminine all things considered, i wear makeup nd dress slutty and stuff but in a decidedly tomboyish way, idk if this helps, but you dont have to be hyperfem to be valid as a trans woman, nor to be attractive or anything else one may want to be
Yes.
Gender expression ≠ gender identity

That is all 💖
*Stands up, raises hand*

Ahem... sorry to take your time but I just wanted to say HELLS TO THE YEAH, MFER! You can be fem, you can be a tomboy, you can be stone butch, or even all three depending on the day. I'm the last option.
Of course they can.
Wow ok so we got some stuff in common OP. I’m 28 and used to have your name, it’s now Savannah. 

I love DBZ, horror movies, shooting/fighting games, working on cars and building computers….all perfectly valid things for a girl to love! 

Also, being trans isn’t about dysphoria. That’s outdated thinking. Sure, it plays a big role for most, but being trans is about euphoria. If wearing fem clothes, being seen as a woman, and other things related to femininity make you feel euphoria, you are probably trans, or non binary or something other than cis.

Best of luck to you, feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to!
[deleted]
I mean if you have dysphoria and want to be a woman (however you express that is up to you) then sure, however if you’re fine being a dude and don’t feel the need to transition then you don’t have to
You can be a tomboy, butch lesbian, anything you want just like any woman.
Short answer: yes. Long answer: absolutely.
Well can a cis woman be a tomboy? Absolutely! So can a trans woman be a tomboy? Absofuckinglutely. The only difference between cis and trans is that trans people were born in a different body. They're both women. Period.

Get a referral to a gender specialist if you want to look into it more. Hope this helps you out ✌️
Sure they can. Doesn't mean you are or aren't. Trans women are women. Tomboy us a type of woman. Ergo, there are transwomen tomboys
Of course 100%
r/mtfbutch
As everyone here is saying: yes of course you can! However, doesnt necessarily mean you are. Cracking open your egg should be an intensely personal experience, and should come from introspection, not from a friend joking you might be. I'm sure she means well, but I've always gotten uncomfortable w people calling cis-identifying people eggs bc a) if they aren't, it can be confusing, b) if they are it can be scary and actually lead them to stay in their shell/closet longer (I've seen it happen), and either way it can be annoying and intrusive. You seem okay with the jokes, but since you're now starting to seriously question the validity of them, I would recommend you ask your friend to back off with the egg comments while you try to sort through a possibly very tangled web of emotions. And certainly don't feel pressured into it, like ""Oh I have x y z ""trans traits"" therefore I must be. If at the end of your self-examination, you realize that you are though, then welcome! It's good to have you :)
Yes. I'm a huge tomboy. I mean, not so much in the way i dress anymore, but my interests are mostly ""primarily masculine"".

I love realistic fps games, any war or combat related media, shonen anime like db/dbz or naruto, and my relationship with my male friends has not at all really changed since transitioning. 

The only thing that HAS changed is the way I dress. I used to only like wearing jeans, flannels, and tshirts. I originally thought that when I transitioned, I'd wanna stay with my same style, just with more feminine versions of the clothing I already wore. 

Then I saw how I looked in a mini-dress about 6 months into my transition... aaaaaand now I've barely worn anything but skirts and mini-dress since because of how much I LOVED the way I looked in them. 

But yeah other than that I still like very traditionally ""Male"" interests, even though I think it doesn't matter and people should just be able to like what they like. 

Hope this helps at all haha.
Yes.
Yes. Gender identity and gender expression are two separate things. I'm a trans man and I still like stuff that are usually considered feminine. Clothes doesn't affect gender. Or at least it shouldn't
1. Lol Scott the Woz

2. You can feel feminine and be a cis guy, you can be masculine and be a trans gal.
I mean, a surprising lot of us are both. I'm still a blooming little blossom of a trans lass, but I don't think I'm ever getting rid of this shirt in men's sizing that's super androgynous. It's super comfy, rad as heck, shapes me well, and it's just me. Gender expression != gender identity.
Yes ofc i personally am not directly a tomboy but i prefer to wear what makes me comfortable and sometimes its a feminine and sometimes its still feminine but not as much more like chill clothes that aren‘t always referred to women clothes but are idk how to explain it
not to sound like a nerd but it’s actually hey all Scott here and also, yes
Hey all, Scott here, so today I wonder and think about a trans woman being a tomboy. Because for god sake if you were god you would do that to!
My gf is a trans tomboy. She's a heckin cutie too
I am both and so happy to be both!
Yep. I'm probably gonna head that way just by virtue of being far more used to being a man than a woman, so it'll be more comfortable.
My gf is still very much a tomboy shitposter memelord, there are no requirements to being transfem !!!
I have the feeling that you're just overthinking this whole thing. Or look at it this way my friend... Even if you are... In about one hundred years... Who's gonna care? I really don't like societal labels. On 62 years I have been given a few. Once stopped caring about what I was labeled as by society, I became much happier! Just love and be happy!
Women can be tomboys

Trans women are women

Therefore, trans women can be tomboys

(transitive property)
Absolutely ! My first experience with questioning my gender is loudly proclaiming to my sibling when I was 4 that ""I'm a tomboy!"" , I wanted to be a girl who was kinda boy-ish :)   
If you are questioning your gender, look up the trans button question, it's not definitive for anything, but it's a useful tool for figuring out how you perceive gender and what you may really want.   
Also though your friend sounds like they aren't being very considerate of you with the egg jokes, if they ever make you feel uncomfortable or they're being pushy with it, it might be worth telling them to tone it down whilst you figure things out for yourself.  
I know of a few people who have had trouble getting labelled an ""egg"" when it really wasn't what they were and it made them uncomfortable to keep being labelled as something they don't identify with.
First of all, yes they can. But also, you’re the only one who will ever really know if you’re trans. That’s not anyone else’s decision so if your thoughts of being an egg are pretty much only from your friend, you don’t have to look into it if it isn’t what you want. If you still see yourself as a man, all the power to you. You define who you are your way whether its related to your habits, hobbies, and expressions or not.
“can a trans woman be-“
yes.
Like what you like, be who you are, love who you love
Fellow trans tomboy checking in.
they definitely can. i wouldn’t worry too much about the labels though—do what makes you happy, not what your friend wants you to do or what society wants you to do. there’s no harm in experimenting! just do and try whatever makes you happy.
Yes of course and we've got some of our own subreddits too currently a member of r/GuildValkyrie myself
A trans woman is a woman, therefore, a woman can be a tomboy. Like others have said. Your style and identity can have everything or nothing to do with each other.
I mean I'm one so yes lol
Why not?

Tomboy is a woman whose interests/hobbies/etc skew masc, AGAB has nothing to do with it.
No, they Universe will collapse. We will all die.
Absolutely, however you choose to identify is completely separate to how you choose to express yourself. You can still present masc and be a trans woman regardless of what people think. Gender is simply a social construct and is entirely based off the Individual. Authenticity is so rare but yet so beautiful, as long as you’re safe and comfortable with yourself that’s all that matters.
If you don't have dysphoria, you're not trans. Your friend shouldn't be projecting like that. It's ok to be cis and be comfortable with your gender.
I identified as a tomboy long before I put 2+2 together to realize how not cis that was
She's kind of breaking the rules, you can't really tell someone they're an egg if they don't know yet... Plus many trans folks don't have much if any dysphoria. Gender euphoria is the joy of- well, gender. Rather than the question of ""doesn't being a man make you miserable?"", it's the question ""does being something else make you happier?"".

Trans women can be butch or tomboyish, that's just how some women are. Intrests do not make someone's gender, nor does body. The only thing that defines gender is the individual. Some people have clear answers about their gender, others are so vague that they could be describing anything.  Your gender is yours, you get to choose what it means to you.
Well I'm a Tomboy, and I'm trans, so yes we do exist. It does make things more confusing early on when you're still trying to figure things out, but like gender identity,  interests, hobbies, and style don't really have to correlate.
Totally, a tomboy is someone who identifies as a woman but still presents somewhat masculine
Hell yeah! ANyone of any gender can have any kinds of interests, i'm a trans woman and i hunt, shoot guns, like martial arts, hike, garden, love make up, clothes, rom coms, etc, there is no limit to what interets you're allowed to have because society says this or that kind of person have this or that interest. Don't limit the enjoyment you can get out of your life based on what society prescribes as being the properly gendered past times
Being socialized male might expose you to hobbies you wouldn’t see as “women’s hobbies” that aren’t necessarily masculine just because they’re only taught to young boys and not girls. Like, video gaming and horror movies aren’t necessarily not women’s interests per se, but are not typically associated with *femininity* so the gender roles-based society wr currently inhabit say they’re not for *women*, which in reality is a whole separate thing. For context I’m a trans male who loves sewing and embroidery, so kind of in the opposite situation of trans women who love street fighter :-P
Hell yeah
Gender expression and gender identity are two majorly separate things. You can identify as fem but you dont have to express fem. You can be as masc or fem presenting as you feel fit. What your identity is doesn't have to have an effect on how you act, dress etc. I'm a trans male but I still do some fem things even such as painting nails or makeup for example. My gender identity doesn't change, and I can express how I feel. Don't let anyone else tell you any different! If you feel like a tomboy then that's great, that's your expression :)
Of course I have very similar interests as you and I am a total nerd. I do have my super girly side too but thats just me not everyone if the same. Someone might be only girly or only like a tomboy.
I’m 6’3”, ride a motorcycle, bartend, own a gun, was a boy scout, have done bjj, play guitar/bass/drums, have worked construction/contracting, into dumb adult swim/adult animation shit, etc…

I almost never wear make up, and I’ve actually repurposed a lot of the button down shirts I wore before. Now I just wear them tucked into high waisted pants and cuff the sleeve. I love having my nails painted and how long my hair is now. I always liked scented things. Now instead of aftershave I get perfume. 

You do you girl. You can like whatever you want to like and be whoever you want to be.

Edit: also, I didn’t come out to myself until I was around your age. I never thought I was dysphoric before that. Turns out I was just reeeeally good at repressing how dysphoric I was. When you live in something 24/7 for decades, it becomes your normal.
interests don't have gender. They indicate nothing about ones gender. At most they indicate the circle of people they grew up with. And even that would be stretching it. I am trans woman and my hobbies include: electric guitar especially metal one, keyboards, electronic devices, magic the gathering (if you want to play on spelltalbe anyone please dm), history, cars, repairs and stuff like that. I love dragonball. Like with passion. It is the only show I have mutliple merchentise of. Does those things make me a man? Doubtful. Also I have a toxic past of playing league of legends for hours on end and I am 1 year younger than you if you think you are talking to someone a lot younger. 

Being trans or non binary is simply a question, do you feel comfortable with your gender assigned at birth. If you are lucky you. Also dysphoria can manifest in many different ways. I don't say you have it, I don't know you, but it is not as clear cut as you think. I reality have a beard on my face right now and I don't have dysphoria from it, it is mostly annoying because it is scratchy.
Well I am so I’d hope so
It's trans woman for a reason and not transwoman. You're a woman, so if a woman can be a Tomboy you can be too... Because you're a woman! 😋
Yes you can. Honestly, seeing your post is kind of uncanny because you are the age that my egg cracked and I have the same interests.

Only question you need to answer is, would you prefer to be not a guy, if given the chance, with no consequences?
Uh ya
Of course
Gender identity is not a gender presentation so yeah,  you can be a transfem tomboy
You could be but do you have an issue with identifying as male? You don’t have to have dysphoria but you might look back and examine certain things.

My friend was complaining about her period and I got kind of jealous because she could have kids. You know, totally cis guy thing to do amirite?
Yes of course!

Same with transmasc and being a femboy.(or whatever word you'd use here)

Or NB people being...
*BEYOND THE MORTAL REALM*
I'm a trans woman and butch-presenting. Tomboy is absolutely fine
You do you however you do you.
Masc and GMC trans women are both women and awesome!

Interests aren’t gendered, despite how much many people want to claim they are!

I’m a woman and a metalhead, a gamer, an electric guitarist, an electronics nerd, a physicist, and many other interests! My cis wife shares a lot of those interests, and had others!
Hell yes! I am a transwoman and a tomboy. And transwomen are women.
Definitely, the best way I can describe is you dress however you feel comfortable but think about how you want to be perceived. Do you want people to see you as a woman who dresses more masculinity or would you rather be seen as a guy who dresses masculinity. So if you wish to be perceived as a woman and that is what's comfortable, identify as trans. It is whatever you feel most comfortable with but this has helped me feel more comfortable identifying as a trans guy. I usually dress more masculine but I also on the rare occasion like to wear skirts/fishnets which are traditionally feminine but I want people to see me as a guy in a skirt and not a girl in a skirt. I hope this helps
yes
Yes of course, I myself will probably start being a tomboy like once a week one day
Yes, absolutely. It’s a matter of interests, nothing to do with your gender at all.
Yeh
It's up to you, you can present as however in either gender. Do not feel pressured to fit a type or change who you are by anyone :P pursue what feels right
Yes
I’m a trans girl, I like rap music and fighting games lol
Hi! I'm a tomboy and woman of transgender experience. We exist and we are fucking hot.
as a cis tomboy, absolutely! do what makes you happy.
To your main question yes for sure a trans woman can definitely be a Tom boy. I’m a trans girl and while I want to physically and socially become a girl, I still have quite a few ‘masculine’ interests. 

I’m not sure of your position and if your trans or not, but if you think you might be it might be worth trying a few things. It sounds like you have a nice trans friend who’d help you if you wanted to try feminine clothing, makeup or something along those lines. Remember it’s totally ok to explore your gender identity even if the end result is you staying cis.
I'm not a tomboy but do have a varied ammount of interests and likes. A trans girl can be a tomboy just like any other girl!
Yes
You can be whoever you want to be as long as it doesn't involve hurting anyone(unless the other person consents like bdsm stuff)

You do you
My literal whole look is a tomboy lesbian with the beanie, vest and flannel shirt with jeans and boots (plan on getting piercings and tattoos hopefully this year) so if say a big yes!

Be who you are, there no guidelines in how you should look or behave. I'm like this as it's who I am and who I'm comfortable as and I love it!
Yup, absolutely. Transmascs can be femboys too, so why not?
Gender identity and gender expression are two different things. I mean, not every girl I know likes dresses, and not every guy I know likes button up shirts. You can like and express yourself however you want.
What I gotta say tho, sometimes it may be harder to pass in front of strangers if you do.
There's not a ""right"" way to be trans, really its juste a feeling

Not the uncomfortable feeling to not be in the right body, but the remarkable feeling when someone calls you miss or mister

You can be Transfem and dress boy-ish

You can be Transmasc and dress girl-ish

It's really just a preference thing, but it's valid anyway
Would you think an AFAB would be less feminine if they were in to your hobbies?
I don't think so
So why would it make you less feminine?
'male hobbies' are ones deemed acceptable for men by society, so those assigned male at birth are more likely engage in these actions/hobbies because of societal pressures (pre-transition), so by this logic, i'd guess a higher proportion of trans women are tomboys than out of the whole female population
Totally! I'm a trans man who absolutely loves frills and pink and girly stuff.
To anyone who does believe this kind of thing here’s my experience with it. In the past I’d been convinced by someone I thought was my best friend that I shouldn’t transition because I had traditionally “masculine” hobbies 
Let me tell you hearing that shit from another transwoman hurts so much more. It’s so harmful. 
Thankfully I eventually came around and restarted my transition, not without losing a few good years I can’t get back though.
I mean of course a trans woman can be a tomboy if they want! There's no wrong way to be trans! but for me personally I have kinda like things geared towards Men too (DC Comics, The Alien Series,  The Boys) but I don't see myself as a tomboy. I'm very feminine I just happen to be a huge nerd also so having kinda male centered ones dosen't make you a tomboy (Even tho theres nothing wrong with that I'm just saying you can be fem and have less girly intrests if you want and that's completly valid!)
Trans women are women.
So yes
A trans man can also be a femboy
:)
There aren't any rules to being trans, what makes one person feel dysphoria might not make another feel the same way, that being said I would get professional help bc they be more able to tell but the main way you can tell is by the suspension if you are or not :)
All women can be, trans included!
My input, do some questioning/research, even if you are indeed cisgender you might find out you like to express your identity in different ways than what is considered(wrongly) to be normal
Would you feel happier as a woman? Like, is your friend the only reason why you think you might be trans, or are there other reasons? And it's completely fine to be a feminine guy or a masculine girl, cis or trans :)
Yes, I'm even more Butch than tomboy, I'm not interested to present femme, this has stopped with HRT. I don't want to be attractive to men, because I'm lesbian, riding motorcycle, shoot guns, play shooting games or Mortal Combat, watch action movies, etc. 🙂 So yes there might be trans women tomboy, Butch, dyke, bois etc.
Yes, of course! There are many aspects of feminity and a majority don't mean being a cute girly anime girl with pink, sugar, etc. 

So, yes, one can definitely be a trans tomboy ! I even know some butch trans women, so yes !

Now about you, the question is, how would you feel as a woman ! If given the choice, would you rather be a tomboy than a ""regular"" boy ?
of course i know her, it’s me! I have hobbies that society deems as “male hobbies” for example; guns, cars, computer stuff etc. and also had this question a few years back, decided that I’ll be myself and not give a fuck about what other people say :3 so as long as you feel good and as yourself it’s all fine
Ayyy, a fellow Scott the Woz fan :D
And definitely, fellow tomboy here! It definitely was a source of concern for me, thinking that unless I'm hyper-fem, I'm less valid or something. But we're super valid c:
Yeah,  definitely. What you like doesn't define your gender. Society does a lot of weird things to separate the two, and a lot of times it changes, like how pink used to be masculine (fire, strong, bold) and blue feminine (water, soft, tranquil). I've grown up liking masculine things but I'm a trans guy. My mom is a gear head and has masculine hobbies but she flat out, instantly rejects wanting to be a man because just the thought is uncomfortable to her. My older cis brother grew up liking feminine things, but I'm pretty sure he's not trans, especially since he also immediately rejects anything related to female identity and transitioning. He does have insecurities about liking cute things but it doesn't mean he's automatically trans. I used to hate all girly things with a deep passion but now I'm less irked because I know who I am now, even started getting a tiny more pink in my wardrobe. It's more gender expressions and interests over identity. They're not exactly the same thing.

Figuring out your identity is something only you can do, it takes a lot of self reflection and questioning, especially since it's a huge life change/revelation. Some people just know immediately, some take years or even decades. I was extremely masculine my entire life and knew something was different about me but I still doubted that I was trans (Also why would I want to make my life more complicated?). There's people who finished transitioning and still sometimes think if they're trans enough. If you're trans, that's fine. If you're cis, that's also fine. If you're really curious, you can try using female pronouns socially or just in a game and see how you feel. Who know, maybe you could even be nonbinary and prefer they/them pronouns instead.
Anything a woman can do, a trans woman can do. If you're ever wondering, just ask the question again and drop the 'trans' part. Instead of, ""Can a trans woman be a tomboy?"" It's, ""Can a woman be tomboy?"" and the answer is yeah, obviously. Good luck <3
you do whatever makes you happy. i know loads of people who are trans and want to be more feminine/masculine, just like a cis person would. you can do whatever you like with how you express yourself :))
Hell yea! My BF is trans and a femboy. I’m a trans girl but never gave up wrenching on my trucks. Just because they wanna change the vessel doesn’t mean they wanna change the way they act
yes they can, im a butch and a trans woman. i also have a lot of masculine interests, a fairly masculine appearance and a masculine sense of style. if you are a trans woman, you can present in any way you find comfortable
I'm definitely tomboyish in my style, especially during winter months, I have no idea how other women survive nights out in dresses this time of year, I would freeze solid.  Nice denim jacket + hoodie combo in the winter for me (too cold on TERF island).

I do love me a nice dress or skirt in summer though!

My hobbies range from sewing and embroidery to metal work and complicated DIY builds using mean power tools I am grossly underqualified to be using, express yourself however you want to :)
Just think about it like this!! I am A 54 yr oldTranswoman on Hormones now for over 18 months. I can still beat most of the men at any video games they challenge me with!! I still love and enjoy many male centered activities. My wife of 11 yrs is a huge tomboy and can keep up with most boys we know. my motto is "" If a Cis Woman can do it a Trans Woman can do it "" And Visa Versa. So in short my answer is YES!!
Absolutely it's a fashion choice and you can choose it
One word: yes.

There's no rules to being trans. It's freedom of choice, it's not about how you carry yourself or how you dress or what you like, it's about how you feel. I get people critizing me for being a trans guy that likes to wear dresses. I don't believe in masculine and feminine things, there is no gender to things, and, I DARE say that as a pansexual, I see don't see gender when I'm getting to know someone, that's got nothing to do with them as a person.
absolutely.
As a Trans woman and a Tomboy who drives big rigs for a living I say F### YEAH, gender and hobby’s really don’t need to go hand in hand, it took me a bloody long time to figure that out though

Do what you need to be happy, please do not conform to others needs.
Why not? Do whatever makes you happy.
Yes ofc!
Of course a trans woman can me tomboy. I mean, tomboys are women, lesbians are women, masc or femenin women are... women. Being a woman doesn't depend of certain treats, you just are-
Yeah, why not, they're no less of a women, so go for it
Can a Cis Woman be a Tomboy?

Of course, so why can’t a Trans Woman?
Hi, Tom boy trans girl here. I do martial arts, weights, biking and running. I like dnd, video games, and hell I go to MTG events (or I did). Hobbies, presentation, and interests don't decide transness. 

My suggestion is to go somewhere online no one knows you, and present yourself as a girl. Explore the feeling. If you experience euphoria, then maybe. I find playing a female character in an MMO with RP servers to be one of the best ways to explore the feeling.
I think it would be really unfair to judge me by my taste, because I was simply locked in to boy things and toys that I still like today even being trans. Being trans is not if you like boy things or girls but if you feel comfortable as girl than a boy
It very much is possible. Dysphoria isn't a requirement to be trans, and being trans doesn't have a single ""look"" or ""style,"" we're all people. And hell, if you are trans, but being seen and refered to as a guy doesn't bother you at all, you could be also be genderfluid. Ultimately, only you can decide what you actually are, but it's important to at least ask yourself those questions, and to answer yourself honestly. Hope my rambly mess helped in any way. Lol
For my short answer, sí.

Btw, wouldn't count Dragon Ball or Street Fighter male centered, because anyone can like them. I've met fans of both of those series from both genders.
Im into some of those things too

Im also into stuff like retro game collecting, heavy metal, I do a lot of model railroading type stuff with LEGO (im an AFOL which stands for Adult Fan Of LEGO), I like D&D and Magic The Gathering, I collect comic books

I also like dresses and make up and girly drinks and boys (and girls but mostly boys) 

We're all unique and different
As a trans girl who “kicks it with the boys” drinks beer and hates the patriarchy yes my dear yes
As a trans woman and a tomboy, absolutely.
No
Amen!
Well said.
I'm a cis woman and my trans older sister has more feminine hobbies than I do.
I have been a tomboy for 53 years.
Society should just let us do what we enjoy without assigning a gender  to that hobby.
Yes! I'll still enjoy smoking cigars, drinking beer, and weightlifting as a transwoman!
Well said
I'm nowhere near that point yet, but I'm really curious about what it means to wear makeup and dress slutty in a tomboyish way. It's really hard for me to envision.
Feminine and masculine at the same time? Elaborate
Thank you, I was thinking the same thing. I'm surprised I had to scroll so far to find someone who said this
Yea, I was thinking about the same thing... Like whatever happened to egg prime directive?
Amen
???
Being a tomboy isn't not cis tho?
She said depending on the day, so I'm assuming what she means is being very masc one day, and fem the next etc
Haha not for an amab
Ah, yeah that changes things"	sy4b8j	trans	797	0.98	2022-02-21 21:00:44
FaceApp = Extremely Unhealthy	"My dear friends, especially the young ones. 

FaceApp only sets you up for disappointment, frustration and dysphoria. 

It's got nothing to do with anything even remotely related to reality. 

Learning to love yourself isn't something that can be achieved with FaceApp, quite the contrary. 

Your beauty isn't algorithmic, it radiates from within you. 

Every time you look at a selfie and maybe feel you're ugly, know that there's someone who would find you intrinsically cute. 

&#x200B;

<3"	"Absolutely, if you really want to see how inaccurate it is, set it to show a younger you.
True. It really has some psychological damage to it. We think we’re just using it for fun, to see “what if,” but the image stays with us and distorts what is possible and what isn’t.
Also keep in mind, a lot of people post transition look a helluva lot different and a helluva lot better than how faceapp predicted!
Also: selfies make everyone look ugly! The front facing camera on a phone is horrible. Don't believe me? Compare a selfie to a picture of your face taken in the mirror. You'll see a HUGE difference, and the one in the mirror is way closer to how you really look.
I agree with this for the most part, and with the sentiment of it entirely...
 
but when I was still confused and exploring the concept of being trans, FaceApp was very helpful for making me realize what was happening to me. I don't use it anymore at all, and never for real selfies, but at the very beginning, seeing myself as something I've always wanted without realizing it gave me the best feeling about myself up until that point and pushed me from being confused to understanding that I AM trans. I always hated the way I looked and felt about myself until I used FaceApp to see what might be, so don't totally discredit it! <3

But yes, using it every day for every picture is definitely not healthy
I 100% agree.  I’m generally happy with how my face turned out but that app set the bar very high and gave me huge disappointment for a long time.  Leave it go as a fantasy
it's like a backward-pointing gun, it makes me feel euphoric until I see the original photo (sounded better in my mind)
Yes it is - do not let that app give you false goals.

I do use it - but I use it for it to change my hair, I then cut the photo with another app and post it over my real face *and* use *another* app to smooth my skin over with *makeup* and *then* I can come to a realistic expectation of a transformation.

Even though i'm still not entirely satisfied with that outcome - it doesn't give me a false expectation to enevitably be let down by.

tldr

>faceapp
>cutpaste photo real face
>cutpaste faceapp photo with face deleted
>smooth and mesh images together
>makeup app to fix skin tone

tadaaa you're slightly more or less dysphoric

*but* its the *real* you.

Hope it helps.
and then theres me, a transmasc that didnt like how the FaceApp version of himself looked
The male options also just look ugly and depressed to me, but maybe that's just because I'm ugly and depressed
Face app isn't realistic at all. It makes me look like a completely different person. Still kind of fun sometimes I guess.
I fucking hated how I looked in faceapp
It's useful as an egg cracking tool but should never be considered something that equates to reality or something that should guide one's expectations.
I totally understand what you mean, but personally I’ll continue to use it. I’m aphant, so I can’t imagine things in my head and faceapp is like the only way to be able for me to like ‘imagine’ what could hrt do to my face. See if I like the changes or not. Also, I have an IS on like how hrt change our faces and what are the keys distinctions between a ‘man’ face and a ‘woman’ face. And it’s interesting to see what change face app do that are possible and what are impossible (it really depend on the face, mine it doesn’t change a lot, only the eyebrows but to others it change things that are impossible to achieve with hrt.)
I don't know, I think knowing that it was super unrealistic or even physically impossible but still seeing that there was a way that my current face *could* be made beautiful digitally was still very helpful to me. Like, it seemed literally impossible when I first cracked and I felt hopeless, but even that moonshot of FaceApp was comforting. Then once I got my foot in the door with styling, learning makeup, etc, I didnt need it any more.
It always made me feel kinda happy seeing me as a girl. Thanks for the advice though. I'll uninstall it since selfies make me much more uglier.
Ive never used it because it will probably just force me to hate my nose more
Agreed, it's very unhealthy. I was actually wondering, are there any apps to feminise your face with makeup and stuff that don't alter the shape of your face?
It's true, I never thought anyone could be attracted to me, find me cute, adorable etc, but my boyfriend continues to prove me wrong. ☺️ 

Faceapp started out giving euphoria, but it became a source of false hopes and unrealistic expectations that I ultimately had to shut out.
Yeah, I have refused to download that because I worry it would wreck me.

I'm getting decent euphoria just from photos of my self now, with some care to lighting/basic filters and my hair.
Like I am pre-HRT but I am apparently really good at seeing ""her"" and spotting and fixating on the feminine parts.

Though I have now found one of the camera apps has a ""details"" slider.
And I can use that to hurt myself.
Because it's basically a dysphoria slider: slide it up and stubble becomes really obvious, as does every slight blemish in my skin.
(Slide it down and my nose and cheeks blur into one).
And like it's hard to resist using that.

I feel like FaceApp would be like crack to me.
Same with Snapchat filters. Not only do they give you unrealistically smooth cartoonish skin, if you look very closely all the gender swapping ones change your jaw and face shape in a way that hormones (and probably FFS too) can’t achieve
I refuse to use ""enhancing"" filters. Sure, I'll mess with color & light settings, but I'd rather face reality with all that entails than embrace a comfortable lie. I've known people who actually fell in love with their filtered selves & became unable to see themselves without the distortion.   
Be you!
Faceapp really helped me in my gender identity exploration. You might not like it but some do. It helped me decrease dysphoria when looking at my pictures and made me realise for good how much i was meant to be fem
but it gives me hope for when i eventually go on hormones
So true, main person you are lying to is yourself and that is very bad for you mental health and self esteem in the long run.
if anyone needs a better way of dealing with gender dysphoria, i recommend cannabis
For me, it's very helpful for my dysphoria. BUT, I also aim to only have to use the ""clean shaven"" filter to remove my stubble. When I can look femme just using that, I get mega euphoria. I don't always, so I still use both and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

One should never use Female 2 either. That one is waaaaaaay off the mark of reality.
This 100%
Faceapp is some serious IRL Black Mirror insanity. It’s like the freaking mirror of Iresed in Harry Potter made real. “Technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.” And yeah, I don’t use it very much because its power over me would become too much to handle.
I broadly agree, but I do have to say that FaceApp was part of what convinced me I could transition.

Not because I was so stunned by how ethereally beautiful girl-filter-me was, but how much like me she was. It was my face with some minor changes and long hair - recognisably me but unquestionably a woman. It was what first made me consider that HRT could work for me.

Obviously that's not a scenario that applies to everyone. You have to be careful with it and not fixate on it as a goal, and it helps that I started out with soft features. But I can't lie and say it wasn't part of my journey.
Removing mirror effect from selfies is waaaay worse
Dunno. Obviously it can’t be assumed it is accurate, but it was crazy how little my face changed with FaceApp, but how significantly more feminine it looked with minor changes. 

It definitely helped me work through my own anxieties about starting HRT. And after about 1.5 years in, I’m starting to feel like I look better than my early FaceApp photos.
From my experience, either I'm just really bad at selfies, or face app just sucked at what it did. But I definitely didn't like it and because of how it impacts us trans folks with our dysphoria, it was just worse.
I used it only once and thought I'd be cute like that. Even if I know HRT is not gonna do something like a computerised app works. Luckily I uninstalled it. Thanks for the reminder, you're more beautiful
I sometimes use FaceApp just for fun, but I always end up thinking it is kinda like cheating, even lying to myself. On the other hand there are pictures of me I am hesitant to edit because honestly, I like how I look in these particular pics, and I wouldn't ever trade them for something obviously fake.
Wasn't faceapp under fire a while ago for being a security threat? I could never figure out if that stuff was real, and so I always put off trying it.

Kinda wish I could see it though just to know a general idea of what I could look like.
Even watching just Snapchat filters change my face is dysphoria inducing to the point where I cannot look at myself in the mirror that long without feeling dysphoric now. I like taking good pictures but man, I still look so gross
I remember the first time I used a gender filter and I burst into tears because I thought I looked so thoroughly ugly I almost swore off T right then and there. Take filters with a grain of salt.
Great post! So true!
Oh god thanks, cause I looked like my mother and I was like HELL NO!
Personally it really helped me get a general idea. I think as long as you're otherwise pretty grounded it can be a very helpful tool.
Absolutely. I have a feeling most of us have at least tried it, like the Snapchat filters, and while it can be a nice lil euphoria boost a time or two, constantly doing so can be extremely bad for your self view.

I absolutely FaceApped myself, along with filters, plenty of Picrews, etc. And it can be nice to see but it’s important to not see it as realistic or certain expectations
Faceapp is actually the worst, so destructive and just misleading too. Idk. I feel like it does way more harm than good
Honestly, FaceApp made me look even more ugly than I already saw myself. I found it kinda funny, but it made it pretty easy to accept that I will never truly pass - and that's okay. I'm doing this to be happy, not to look attractive to other people.
So FaceApp isn't accurate? Thank goodness, I'm really not a fan of it. I mean, it's better than my current face, but it looks way too much like my mom for my liking lol
True true
Yeah, on one hand, seeing my FaceApp picture really made it clear in my head what I wanted, but I will probably also never look that good and it will always hurt a little. I'm still glad I got to see it, though, and it inspired me.
If I can look better than my FaceApp picture, I will die of happiness.
Of course, because they're real people, not the product of some algorithm
That's good because the camera is closer to you when you're taking a selfie the camera is close to your face which distorts the image that being said the lens in the rear of your phone is probably better
Isn't that just a psycological phenomenon where our brains are used to seeing ourselves mirrored, whereas selfies put us the correct way around? Plus front-facing cameras have become good to a point where this argument only applies if you have an old cellphone.
That's a valid point. 

&#x200B;

I guess growing up in a world where these things didn't exist yet, I only see the negative side. Even when smartphones got popular in my early 20s I deliberately refused to have one, so I can only be an outside observer. And from where I'm looking, all I see is a bunch of young trans people desperately anxious to pass (a concept I also dislike, but understand the reason for its existence) posting FaceApp pictures. 

&#x200B;

Compare that to avatars we use. For many of us, one of the very first liberating experience was creating our profiles in harmony with our gender identity. And many of us identified with our avatars, even if it were anime characters etc. 

(I'm using past tense because I'm an old fart, but it's still an ongoing thing \^\^)

Now, we always knew we could *never* look like our avatars, them being *not real*, but it was a profound affirmation of our identity. With FaceApp, there is no clear distinction between reality and fantasy. It's a tech made to look *as real as reality*. So while the avatars were kind of an artistic sublimation of what we fancied ourselves as in a fantasy world (even though it *does* have an impact on reality -after all even our cartoon traits are chosen for a reason, they resonate within us) FaceApp bends our very notion of reality. 

&#x200B;

Idk, like I said, I'm an old fart. Maybe I just don't get it simply cause I'm old, but it seems to me that EVERY app that taps into our fears and anxieties about our looks, and our beauty criteria in general, is ultimately harmful. Maybe, like sex work, they *do* empower *some* people, but the vast majority are, in my opinion, inflicting serious psychic wounds (that are ***totally*** unnecessary and avoidable.
Like most selfies on snap chat ! People now go in for plastic surgery to look like the filters.
You can also do lot of minimalistic change in face app without using gender swap feature right? I did that in my last post. I added only mascara, longer hair and tried to use ""shave"" feature to get rid of darker skin where the facial hair grows but the shave feature really just reduced some wrinkles.  


Basicaly If I apply mascara and long hair on my face and then open the created picture in faceapp again it now thinks it is female and it lets me to apply various feminine hairstyles and colors. I think the algorith recognizes males from females mainly by hair and make up or eyelashes and only seccondarily from face shape.
Ditto. I just downloaded the app at the recommendation of my MTF friend and I literally said ""ugh"" at my ""male"" face. Funny enough, adding the ""female"" filter made me look almost exactly like how I did in my senior photos 20 years ago lol
Same. Too doll like
Ok I have an honest question : does this faceapp approximation influence your decision to get on hrt?
Photoshop has a neural makeup filter where you can take the makeup from one photo and apply it on another photo pretty realistically.
It really is an amazing tool when used in the context of healing.
It's not. It just pulls from millions of other faces and guesses what would suits best on your face. Could never be accurate xD
I did it once, deleted the app because I knew the damage it would, and have since forgotten the image, face app isn't exactly something that can show you who you will be as the opposite gender accurately.
Front facing cameras are taking the picture way closer to your face, which is going to distort it.
No, this is caused by camera focal length. 

Different phones do/don't default to mirroring selfies, and you can change that setting - that varies.

But all standard front-facing phone cameras are wide-lens cameras - they have a focal length which heavily distorts appearance (relative to the human eye). The closest features like the nose look much bigger, and the edges of the face around the jaw/ears can completely disappear. 

This is one of the best explanations I've seen, with example images:  https://oohstloustudios.com/the-science-of-the-selfie-no-you-dont-really-look-like-that
That makes some sense, and there are those that take it too far, using ONLY the app to feel good about themselves period... but I think accentuating certain features and showing that you could look like in makeup or with long hair without having to actually buy and wear makeup or put on a wig is invaluable. I didn't want to go buy makeup or ask someone how to use it until I knew that's what I wanted, and FaceApp showed me that I would be pretty with makeup on. 

Now, I think I look far better than what FaceApp's algorithm decided my feminized face would be and I'm very happy with not using it again...

but I will never forget the process of voluntarily taking a selfie for the first time in months, uploading it to the app and the sudden shock of intense joy that I experienced when I saw a girl looking back at me. That's when it clicked that I don't need an anime avatar or an MMO character. I am me, algorithmically or not.
Yeah, I had the same reaction, ""ugh"". I even asked myself if I was really trans because the male version of my face looked so ugly lol. Now I know that a buzzcut and a beard are NOT for me.
It helped me have a better understanding of what I want. Like I’ve read about all the change hrt can/will do and I’m like I want all of them. But I can’t picture those change in my head so looking at a picture through faceapp help me see the change (not everything is good, but like the eyebrows the changes faceapp do are realistic with hrt) and even tho I know I want those change seeing them on me help me to feel more confident about it as I like the realistic change faceapp do.

I use faceapp like my trans friends have use their imagination to picture themselves with the changes hrt could/will do.

But I know the flaws of faceapp and I only focus on things I know are realistic to be change with faceapp (so eyebrows and cheeks).
It doesn't matter. You're obviously coming from a judgemental place and honestly, you should stop.

People are grown up enough to make their own decisions about how to perceive themselves, whether that be through technology or makeup or both. 

There's always abuse cases for stuff like this, but you're worried about a small minority of people and making the rest of us feel like we shouldn't be allowed to have this form of comfort and confidence building.
If it helps you build confidence, then good for you, you should keep doing it."	r0gcp3	trans	795	0.98	2021-11-23 15:58:28
How old were you when you realized you might be trans?	"I’m not to sure where to turn, except reddit. I have a little sibling (10) who wants me to buy them a binder. They’ve come out to me as he/they. I don’t have an issue with it, except their age. I don’t want to invalidate their feelings just because of that, but for me it’s difficult to take them seriously. They names they want to go by are names that Thomas Sanders uses in his alter ego YT videos. They also want me to buy them a binder, but up until I asked they didn’t know their bra size. I’m just worried that buying one for them at this age would harm their development as they’re still a kid. And I feel like I should mention that we live in Texas and my parents don’t know about any of this and if they found out they would not be supportive at all. What should I do? I know that dysphoria can mess with their mental health. The last thing I want is for them to be coming to me for help just for me to turn them away. Thanks in advance.
Edit: thank you all for sharing your story and for the support! Im going to look into getting them a binder! Any suggestions are welcome"	"I was in my early 20s when I realized that trans-ness wasa thing and that I might be. You can blame society on that though, since there was ZERO publicity around it when I was a teenager in the late 90s.
I wanted to be a girl when I was about 10 didn't have the words for it or knew ot was even possible.
i was very young, toddler age probably when i knew i was a boy. a binder isn’t really going to mess up their development unless he wears it for way too long. long term wear is bad for anyone though no matter the age. i got my first binder at 13.
My little cousin came out at 11. He picked out a name which I honestly cannot stop thinking of as a dog's name, and the name of a popular band member at the time. I was a little concerned at the time too, but 7 years later I've got over myself. It's his name and he's happy with it, that's all that matters. If your sibling picks a Thomas Sanders name, you might have that association for a while, but you'll get used to it. Good luck with him, I hope he manages to find a group of friends to support him even if your family doesn't! They're going to need you if your parents are as transphobic as you're expecting.
Kids are smarter than you think. Many (though not all) trans people have figured out/knew they were trans at a young age. Your sibling—he knows far more about his gender than you or Beeby.
My earliest memory was me being extremely confused that people were calling me a girl and I couldn’t always do stuff with my friends who were boys. So, probably around 4? You should take them seriously. It fucked me up so much to have people tell me “you don’t know you. I know you. Let me tell you who you are.” My whole life. Now that I’m finally transitioning in my 30s I honestly don’t know if my head can ever be fixed from people not taking me seriously. Stop that. How would it feel if someone didn’t take you seriously or listen to you? The only correct response here is “thanks for trusting me. I hear you. You are safe and I’ll help” like they probably came to you because they’re aware of the state they live in and who their parents are.

When I first thought it? Actually thought, am I trans? 35-36yo. I'm nearly 38yo. 

When I thought I don't want to be my AGAB? My clearest memory is around 9yo, being measured for a training bra and feeling disgusted at the prospect developing a feminine chest. Trans wasn't really a thing people knew about and there wasn't internet like there is now, so it took me a while. 

You say you're worried about a binder messing w their development? Like chest development? Is a sports bra an option instead? I don't advocate for keeping it a secret but I also have zero experience w trans kids.
My daughter was 3 years old.  She is now 8 and a half.  We just had a meeting with a psychologist on Friday who will start seeing her, who will ultimately conduct a hormone blocker readiness assessment in about a year from now.  It’s a wild ride but we just want her to be happy and healthy!
I was 12 but when I look back, I notice a lot from my childhood that were pretty big signs. But my cousin is 13 right now and she had came to me a while back when she was 12 and said she wanted to use they/them and is agender but now she's 13 and is using she/her again. So I'd say try your best to just be as supportive as you can possibly be without doing anything that could be iriverseable of any kind. 
Always encourage research before anything else and make sure they look at both things that are good and bad so they can really know what they are getting into before doing anything :)
I was 6 when I started thinking about it…. By ten I knew… took til 35 to socially and medically transition.
i had distress at 11 (over my breasts)  but didn't realise i was trans till I was 19
As a trans girl, I can tell you that the best thing you can do for your kid is asking questions. He needs to be heard. You should be skeptical, but open to hearing what he as to say. It is a young age, but 10 years old is certainly old enough to understand gender and dysphoria. Please keep an open mind towards them. 

I suggest getting him a binder so he can see how he feels. After that, let him take you down the path he wants to go, whether it's hormone therapy (later on) or just a simple social transition or even neither! Regardless, he deserves to be comfortable, and it is your job as a parent to help him get there.
My first inkling was apparently when I was 2 years old. 
I was told by my grandma that I couldn’t say things like that or I’ll hurt my parents and her. 
I started getting more inklings when I was around 14 and I thought I might be non binary. I finally came out as a trans man when I was 17 and am now 19. 
Just let them socially transition. I wish I had figured it out as fast as they did
I was In middle school and didn’t know what trans meant back then. I used to get ass many sports bras as a could and but them on and layer clothing on top of them to have a flatter chest. My mom walked in one me once doing it and said that it was dangerous to do that and to not do it ever again. Back then I didn’t know that feeling like a man wasn’t something all kids went through. I thought I was crazy for awhile but when I reached age 14 I discovered what trans was. I told my mom back then too but she didn’t believe as I was young and in her mind obviously couldn’t know who I was back then. So she said no your not and told me to go do something more “productive.” Shesh even years later and I am full grown adult and she still doesn’t believe when I insist that I am trans. I guess she doesn’t want to face the truth I guess of  me not being a girl. She has messed up sense of who and what a person can be and what is right and wrong for a person to be. Anyway I found out I was trans when I was 14 and have been that ever since. Thanks goodbye 👋
I've had feelings since I was very young. I remember wanting to be a little girl in my earliest memories. But that was beaten into repression by a family who pretends to support LGBT individuals until their child turns out to be one. I decided that I wanted to transition around 21. My friends laughed at me and thought I was joking so I stayed closeted until this year, shortly after my 26th birthday.
My egg broke at 14, but even children wayy younger can either experiment w their identity or already kinda know it.
When I was 6 my mom told me she was pregnant. I prayed for her to have a girl so I could use her clothes. ( size never caught up though ) I knew since then I was a girl.
Came out at 40, but realized when I was 11 or so. There were not really any words for being trans that didn't have a stigma attached, so I just considered myself a crossdresser
First time I went swimming. Knew I didn’t feel right, around 4. Had to wait another 20 years to be myself but living free since last year now!!
I (19 afab nb) knew something was up when I started developing breasts at 10 years old. Unlike your brother, I didn't feel like I could say anything about it to anyone so I stayed closeted until I moved out at 16. I got my first binder at 17. Binding is safer than many of the other options (taping, double sports bra, etc.) because binders are made to be worn and used for a flat chest effect. Especially the ones from gc2b are made with safety in mind, the extra money is worth it. Physical development wise, I see no problem, just lay the ground rules: no wearing it for longer than 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, don't shower or swim in it, don't do sports in it, don't sleep in it, and if it starts to hurt take it off. As for potentially non accepting parents, you know how they are, stay safe, keep your brother safe from them. If you know you can hide the binder somewhere and get it hand washed once a week with 6 hours to air dry, you can consider how viable it is. If you have no hinding spots, may be better to not get one. Look into androgynous clothing, maybe of you can sneak them something from the mens section so they have that info in their mind but there's no sign of it elsewhere for yiur parents to find out. That and loose clothes can help a lot. If your parents get iffy, he could wear a belt to show the outfit as more feminine and then when he's out and about take the belt off. Good luck and much love.
literally recently, 15... i wish i would have realised earlier.. but i wasnt sure i could be trans even though i thought about it at like 11..
I was 33 when I put it all together.
I knew I was trans at 10 too, started feeling different at 7
Yesterday I came out as a trans :)

But it was since puberty since I have this inner desire to be female. And even so, before that I already wear girl clothes in secret.
When I was 12. I was bullied back into the closet. I tried so hard to be a boy for the next 7 years… the feelings never go away.
It really depends on the person. I'm also FTM figured out I was trans when I was around 16 (got scared back into the closet since I was outed by a family member, came back out of the closet when I was around 18) but I always had feelings of being a boy when I was younger, I just didn't understand them yet. That and I didn't even know that trans people existed till high school.

Kids are smart, my little brother is the same age and he knows he's gay already. If your sibling says he's trans then YES 100% support him. However, please be cautions when giving your sibling a binder. Yes he can wear one at that age, but I don't see why it'd be nessasary if he hasn't developed yet. If he has or is really insisting on having one its fine, but please let him know the dangers. 

Chest binders can be dangerous, wearing one for over 8 hours can cause serious damage to your ribs. I don't think a 10 year old should wear one for more than 5 hours, just to be safe. If it's starting to get hard to breathe, TAKE IT OFF. If you can trust him to take care of himself and use a binder properly then by all means. But if you think he will be too immature and not use a binder correctly then please don't give him one. It really depends on the kid. 

It's also recommended you get a size up on what size you think you he is (like if you think you're a medium,  get a large) and if you are going to get one, buy from [gc2b](https://www.gc2b.co/) 

Don't buy one on Amazon or somewhere untrusted. Gc2b is the best place, their binders are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I'm even wearing one.

Good luck! I hope you can do something with the information I've provided and come to a conclusion.
a binder isn't going to hurt them, and calling them a different name and pronouns definitely will not hurt him. worst case scenario they figure out they aren't trans and then you have a binder you can't do anything with. but letting him be themselves for now is the best thing you can do, also wearing a binder won't hurt development unless he doesn't bind safely (sleeping in it, wearing for more than 8 hrs without a break, excersizing in it etc) 

as for you how old question, i always wanted to be a boy, and when i learned what trans meant when i was around 8 or 9 i instantly thought that was who i was, but i supressed and denied it because i was living in an unsaccepting home, but when my puberty came at 12-13 so did huge amounts of dysphoria and that's when i really accepted i was trans and came out to some ppl
Definitively knew? I was probably 13-14 and just put a name to it when i was using my DSi at night after everyone went to bed to get on the internet and use the browser and found a website called Amy'splace or birchplace something like that. It was a website made by an older trans woman who had really detailed explanations and expereinces by other trans women including a list of them that had unfortunately passed away. Needless to say I'm still appreciative that my egg was able to crack relatively early, I just hope one day I'll be able to transition
I was like 8 praying to jesus to magically make me a woman. which is kind of strange because my whole family is atheist, i guess that kind of shows how bad I wanted it
If your brother is 10 he's got an entire teenage phase of nonsense to survive through that's going to make wearing a binder look very quaint.
I was 4/5 when I first said I wanted to be a boy.

10 isn’t too young to know if you’re trans, but I think it’s too young to buy a binder since the whole point of it is to hide your breast?
About 4 or 5 years old, but I was 48 before I took the leap of faith and did something about it.
I remember watching Jen and the Holograms on television back when I was 5 thinking how awesome it would be if I was a girl.
i knew i wanted to express myself and be more feminine as early as 11, but I didn't know or understand what ""transgender"" meant until I was 17. now I'm 19 and start hormones in 2 weeks.
I was 16 but if trans people had the right publicity when I grew up, and I grew up around people who weren't homophobic/transphobic I probably would have realised at around age 7 I'd say
I’m not sure why you’re so worried, he doesn’t seem to be asking for hormones, surgeries, legal name change, or anything that’s hard to reverse
15
maybe around 2019 when i was around 12. one day after a shower i’d looked in the mirror realized i’d hated my chest. went through a lot of self consideration, labels and pronouns and have landed on gender fluid. it’s now 3 years later and i’ve just recently got my first binder, and it’s one of the happiest states i’ve been in since. it’s also the safest i’ve been. binders are meant for binding. ace bandages, the belt i used, sports bras several sizes too small where not, and my mental health was absolutely horrible. the best you can do for them right now is get them a binder, maybe a size larger than you think they needed, and use the name they prefer when in settings you can.

my girlfriend on the other hand, could tell from toddler age. her mother could tell and her family has been very supportive (almost TOO ally she says). Having that support has made her life so much easier and her mental health is significantly better than mine when it comes to dysphoria. 

binders from GC2B are very reliable and they also have an amazing selection
I would buy it for them and inform then what it means to us a binder just make it a safe place for them to expirence what it means to be called a man if you make it safe they will be okay 🥰
If I had been better informed and looked at some of the signs a bit closer, probably would’ve come out around the time I entered middle school. But because I grew up in a Christian family and was raised on the social bias that you can’t really switch, it took me until I was 20 to realize something was off and a further 4 years to admit to myself I was trans and start HRT. I go in for my 3 month appointment this Friday!!  ^ w ^
I mean, I only realized it when I was 16, questioned at 15, but really shoulda known since I was like 5 and I was super adamant to everyone that I wanted to be a girl... And for my entire life I would look at girls and be like ""aw, man, sucks that I had to be born a guy"". If I had known what that meant earlier and found supportive folks, I'd probably have been quite a bit happier
I noticed i was trans at 12, just didn't know for sure untill i became 15
Pretty much right after high school graduation
I, um, I came out at 13 using the name Patton from Thomas Sanders. Be supportive, but…. Cautious.
Edit: no my name isn’t Patton, it’s Isaac
I probably started ""questioning"" at 13 but didn't really get anywhere, I was young and stupid, and the alt-right pipeline almost gobbled me up. Went to uni at 18, after a couple of years the pain of existence piled up to the point that I couldn't take living ""as a boy"" anymore and began transitioning just before I was 22. A year later and things are chugging along quite well. One could say there were ""clues"" that I was GNC from as young as 5, apparently I was _a bit too in to_ Hello Kitty and the like, but the diagnosis gets fuzzy at that point.
I learned I was trans when I was 14. The reason I knew is because not long before I just learned what trans even *was*. If I knew trans people existed, I probably would've realized way younger. I was a very boyish child even before I knew I was one and it was possible. My parents just ruled me off as a tomboy and I didn't understand what I was feeling until I learned about gender dysphoria.

At that age, as a parent all you should really do is let them transition socially. He's young, so he could very much change his mind, and thats okay! Let him learn about himself. Get them clothes they like, and a binder is a very good start.

 I would suggest spectrum outfitters for a good binding company, and *maybe* gc2b. However, I will warn you that gc2b has had a significant quality drop. **DO NOT USE AMAZON.** Their binders caused me permanent disfigurement in my ribs; particularly the ones with clips.

 For other binding options you can also look into trans tape as in some ways it is safer in the long run if used correctly. Do a lot of research before buying ANYTHING! Since he's young you'll have to careful but as long as he's happy and safe they'll be okay. :)
10 but I came out as 12 . Is that too early?
i was 13 when i was able to put a name to what i was feeling. but i knew something was different for me vs my peers when puberty started.

my favorite thing is “nobody knows you better than yourself.” so my advice is to be their support as they navigate their identity. this may be precisely who they are or a big step into them figuring it out. gender exploration is nothing negative.
I think I was about 14. You can take binders on and off, and trust me, they don’t inhibit chest growth as sad as that may be
I am here at 32 coming out to my friends as nonbinary trans. HOWEVER:
*In primary school we all watched a TV show where a guy suddenly changed gender and got to experience life as the opposite sex and I remember wishing that could happen to me.
*My first cosplay, as a teen, was someone of the opposite gender.
*I vividly remember my excitement when  transman was.given representation on the news when I was a teenager and told everyone.
*I would often roleplay as the opposite sex and gender changing characters from my teen years onward.
*Tilda Swinton and Elliot Oage were goals for me throughout my life.
*Genderbending fandom stuff was my jam (such as Adeventure Time stuff. Also Princess Cookie meant a lot to me and my current dog is named after them).
*I studied gender politics at uni and was specifically interested in the adoption of different gender perspectives. 
*I have said I was nonbinary since my 20s.
*Stevonnie made me flip my shit. 
*I have wanted a binder for years and packed since my 20s
*I used put my pronouns as they/them in work.

Sooooooo.....yeah. I'm not sure how helpful this is to you and your circumstances but it just goes to show that gender play can happen way before the point of truly stepping out jnto the world as trans.
7 I was 7 I also attempted to kill myself at 10 so please don't let them think they are different even if the change their mind later on its better to be safe then sorry plus a binder won't hurt him if you teach correct binding just please don't let him sink into depression because it stays with you and you suffer in silence long enough it builds and builds until you just want to die
I was about 4 when I started looking at my body in the mirror every night and wishing I’d wake up a girl. Did that for a few years until I was able to suppress it for a while. Then around 11 I started crossdressing in my moms clothes when I was home alone. Finally suppressed that after a few more years until it finally came back for good in my late 30’s. Now I’m 42 and finally transitioning and everyday I feel like shit and have soul crushing regret over not doing it sooner. It doesn’t just go away, and the sooner people can start, the happier they’ll be in the long term
I was about 20 when I first heard of someone transitioning FTM, I'd known about MTF for a while. When I heard about it I was just like, you can DO that? BECOME a guy if you want? I want to do that! Male name, male identity, male body, hell yeah!
13. I learned what trans was and then some stuff kind of made sense and that was also when gender dysphoria hit.
I known since I was 10-13 I had a whole tomboy phase until highschool to them think I was Just Non-binary alone then as an adult in 2021 I finally just realized nope I was infact Transnb.

I denied a lot about that part of myself when I was younger and I really regret it.
Probably around the age of 7, but I only knew what it mean to be transgender when I turned 13.
I came to terms with it when i around 12-13 if I remember correctly. One of my middle names is after a sanders sides character! And while i want to change it now, theres no problem with experimenting! Id just help them how you can and be supportive! Its their life and their name
I realized I was trans about 9 or 10 but there were obvious signs earlier than that just didn't get the verbage for it till later
21
Had all the signs at like eight. Did not have the langauge to express it and got shamed by my mother for trying on my sister's dresses, so I repressed until eighteen.

Binders do have safety guidelines. If you wear one nonstop they can damage your ribs. Make sure they know not to wear the binder when sleeping or exercising. If they're upset by that I'd recommend buying them a tight sports bra so they can somewhat flatten their chest when taking a break from the binder without doing any damage.
I had a meltdown when I was told I had to get a bra, and used to be furious that my cousin could go without a shirt but I couldn’t. So there were signs throughout my much younger years. But I didn’t have a word for it until high school, which is when I’d say it first really really struck me. Before that, it was always “I’m a Tomboy, I hate girly stuff, boys are better to hang out with I get them, I don’t want makeup” 🤣
I didn't have a word for it until I was 12, but I had felt like this by the time I was old enough to understand there is a difference between genders. So around 6-7 I started getting uncomfortable with how I was presenting.
I started questioning when I was around 10-11. I also always thought I was different from most people for as long as I can remember. Didn't come to the full realization till my early 20s.
I was 15 when i first had a thought that i was but i was in a very toxic relationship with a partner who pushed gender roles and stereotypes and forced me to be a toxic masculinity type of dude but i was always felt like something was off or incorrect. When we broke up after 6 years, i was 21 and began to explore my gender and my place and since then, ive blossomed.

I was 12 years old when I realized and I was 40 years old when I finally did something about it I’m 44 now
I knew from the get go that something was ""wrong"" but i only knew and found out the name for it when i was 13/14
But again this is only my situation
For me around grade 6, so pretty much the same age as your younger sibling.
13 but I repressed that shit really hard till like 18-19 lol
I knew I was a girl when I was 5. But I wasn’t aware it was a thing until I was 13.
In early kindergarden so around 3 years old I thought about wanting to be a boy for the first time.
My feelings were labled with the term 'transgender' at 11-12 and I then finally came out at 16
I was 3 years old when I got my first sign. I’ve had vivid dreams my whole life. My very first memory of a dream was me waking up after dreaming of being a mom. Strange dream for such a young age, but from that point on it just snowballed until my last birthday.
i think it was 13. and at first i thought i was non-binary
i knew i was a boy by age 8. i came out at 11. im now 22 and living my best life as a regular dude!
I was maybe 10 when I thought about it, by 12 I definitely knew I was a woman, jokes on me I guess cause both my parents are homophobic and transphobic and I'm Transbian, so you can probably guess how that panned out
I was 16
I first realized I was trans at 10, I started telling people at 11, but I didn't feel very supported so I went back in the closet and now Im and I came out to my new friends and they're very supportive. I think it's best for trans kids to have people supporting them because being supported will help their mental health.
Plus, even if they discover that he was wrong about being trans and that he actually wants to go by other pronouns, it'll still be helpful for him to know that he has a good support system in their life.
i was falling asleep at night wishing id wake up as a girl waaay before i was 10. only in the past 2 years or so did i really think(bc of the internet and me getting more into queer spaces online) 'oh wait am i actually trans?' im 17 rn and the idea of waking up as a girl is still something i desperately wish would happen. 

you can be trans at any age. anyone can be trans but its not a choice, just know that. you cant just decide ur trans or be influenced to be trans. 

be that inspiration for ur sibling. be there for them. the best thing to do is just be there for them and dont turn them away.
Good question. I started fantasizing about being a woman around 15-16 but the whole trans topic only entered my mind sometime in my early to mid 20s I think. Acknowledging it? Just recently at 31 lol

As for your sibling, well some realize it very very early already and it shouldn't be dismissed just like that. Even if they seem to get influenced by some weird source like a youtuber in case of their chosen name or such it doesn't mean it's not real. However since it's your sibling and not mine you're in a much better position to judge their case than I would ever be.
13/14
45. Looking back, I always knew but we didn’t live in a society that talked about it. I didn’t know what was going on. Thanks to the new gen for paving the way to more conversations! 🙏🏻❤️
around thirteen is when i had my first inkling, but i was about sixteen when i fogured it out fully
I was 8-9 when I had my first BIG questions, but as I look back now I do can point out that even before that I had small signs of the fact I was very not comfortable with being a ""guy"", I only started looking out what was wrong with me at 17, got some help at 18, and now 19 and I'm on hrt.
I knew I wanted to be a boy when I was 7 but didn't know what transgender was until I was 12
Honestly I was around 10 or 11 when I first realized.  I wish at the time I had more supportive people around me like I do now.  But let them discover themselves experiment and such.  And binders really only do damage if worn for too long no matter of age.
I was aware of these thoughts when I was 11, but started having them at 6
I started questioning when I was 14, but only came out at 17. 

 The reason I took so long to come out was a mixture of uncertainty, and a lack of a supportive environment. My family wasnt transphobic, but they definitely didnt want to encourage it. I felt that if I said I was questioning but unsure, they'd respond by bombarding me with questions and assumptions. Things I couldn't and didn't want to answer.

I'd say let they experience it. Let them try it out and see if it fits. I wish I was brave enough to tell my parents I wanted a binder, it would've made my days so much smoother, and it would've probably helped me realise who I was sooner (ie a transman).
Probably going against the grain here, but I'd say hold off on an actual binder at the moment. You're correct in thinking that binding at this age can (and will) screw with their development. And while that may not matter to them right now, I think it is important to recognize that at that age, long term benefits and consequences aren't understood very well.

Instead of a binder, which also takes a lot of responsibility when it comes to wearing it safely and correctly, I'd say start with some high compression sports bras. Underworks is a binding company that makes a binding bra that flattens the chest, but also is not quite as ""dangerous"" (in the sense that bad things can happen) as a binder. I'd also set some ground rules to make sure that they can be safe with a binder, ie, only wear their designated binding bra for 8 hours at a time, do not sleep in it or do any heavy exercise, etc. If they can follow those guidelines, great, and you can start looking into a binder after a few weeks or so. If not, there's no harm done, but now you know that it's maybe not the safest choice to get them a binder now.

And because I know some people are going to come at me for being transphobic or whatever, I'm 14 myself and started T at 13. I know that at 10, I wouldn't have the self discipline necessary to bind safely with an actual binder and would've screwed up my body pretty badly.
I started having depressions about my incorrect gender since 15 or 16 y.o. I am 20 now and I finally found some friends from LGBTQ community and they cheer me up so much that I'm having less depression nowadays and I'm slowly moving forward. 🥰🥰🥰
I was 11, not much older than them.
I was 5 when I first said to my parents that I was a girl and they were very Christian and basically said ""nope. You're too young to understand what you want and God knows. ""He"" made you and he knows what's best""
I would have been 10, 12, 16, (i was 18) if got any informative encounters earlier to help me understand that what I was feeling was hormonal induced gender dysphoria. Feminine clothes were not helping much toward this as long as I was not taking any hormonal treatment but it still helped me to accept myself after 10 years of self-hate
I was 12, but because of my grandmother I ""changed my mind"" to thinking it was just a phase. Then two years later, I blocked all contact to her. Now I'm outtet to my whole family and all my friends, and I've feel amazing to finally be myself😊
I knew from 7 yo, but I’ve had no words for this I knew I’m girl but with boy body. I’ve knew the word transgender with internet so for me around year 2002. But it took me in total another 20 years to start to do something about it  (body dysphoria) and start HRT at least.
There were a lot of signs that I didn’t have the language for when I was growing up. My first big realization was when I was 14. I realized I was reading myself into female characters in books, but not the male characters. After talking about that and my sister saying she never did that I pushed it down inside me. I didn’t actually realize I was trans (and all of the pushed down stuff came back up) until I was 28. 💕🏳️‍⚧️
15
My earliest memory so like 4 or 5.
I was 10
A month after my 22 birthday
Looking back on it? Like, four? I didn’t really see it that way at the time though, just liked wearing dresses and hanging out with the other girls until I was bullied out of it. The first time I used the word “trans” to describe myself I was 24, but was met with the complete *opposite* of support so I shoved myself back into the closet. Finally coming out to people and transitioning at 31, and am quite resentful of all the time I’ve lost. Get your brother the binder, even in the off chance they change their mind, you will only have shown them that you’re someone who loves and supports them no matter what. And that shit is *priceless*, even for cisgender siblings.
I was around 9 when i realized i was trans so i think its not that weird
I was 13, but I will say that if your sibling likes the name from that series...I don't think that's a vaild excuse to not take him seriously?

Okay, I don't mean this to be rude, I just get a lot of people who don't take me seriously because everytime someone sees my name, they dismiss me as a fanboy. So, excuse me if it sounds like I'm attacking you.

Sanders Sides is where I found my name, but Sanders Sides and more specifically the character ""Virgil"" is not the reason I go by the name. I like the name, I feel it fits me, so that's what I go by.

I'm just saying don't assume your sibling is only picking those names because they like the series...I would recommend asking him why they like whatever name they want.
Always liked being a ""tomboy"" once I got to be around 11. Then I have a Snapchat memory from when I was 13 that says ""when you're just saying you're non binary because you're afraid to be trans"". As in I was afraid to be ftm.
i was 10. i only really changed my name permanently and started socially transitioning around 13. i also came out when i was 13. i am 14 now and (nearly) everyone i'm close to calls me my new name and pronouns. i was so scared to tell anyone even at 13 cause i thought no one would take me seriously since i am young. ageism is real. kids can be smart and self aware. they know themselves better than anyone
I was 13 years old when I figured it out but I didn't come out till 23, and it was the source of quite some grief. My son came out at 7 years old, and has been happily being himself since. Please do your best to support your sibling, he needs it from someone, especially if your and their parents aren't going to be supportive.
19 for me. Hadn’t really heard of it much before
I was literally in elementary when I had my first boyfriend and I was his girlfriend. We didn't know anything about being trans, just a boy and a girl who liked each other enough to hold hands and play date. It was super cute.
14 then thought enby and now at 16 i have no clue
25, all the pieces started to fall into place, a late egg cracking situation. 

Preferring longer hair, wouldn’t dream of playing masc Shep (Mass Effect)and masc V (Cyberpunk 2077), tried recreating Judy’s look (again, Cyberpunk 2077), casually confusing customers about my gender (I work at a grocery store by the way, I shave my legs and arms more often than any man typically should (I’m nowhere near athletic), whenever there’s a story in fiction that involves sex change magic/medicine/technology I say instinctually “That’s awesome! Can I try some?”, and my favorite casual fem goals is Dinah from The last of Us Part 2.
I had always considered myself a ""tomboy"" when I was young, but due to my environment, I tried suppressing being masculine as much as I could, and I didn't figure out that I was trans until I was 14. I'm 16 now and am doing great 💥
I was 15 when I found out, but if I knew trans people existed before that I'd certainly would have find out sooner. I remember being 11/12 at a party and imagining I was my siblings brother. Make sure they bind safely! It's always okay to figure out your identity, even at a young age. but please make sure they're safe and won't hurt themselves. binders can be harmful in the long run.
imo as long as you monitor that to make sure they're binding safely it should be okay, it's not like they're medically transitioning that young!
First signs of being trans: at six years old (I just knew that I wasn't a girl)

Thinking I might be trans: age 14 to 16

Knowing that I'm trans: conciously since I'm 20
I Was around 9 when i started thinking about my gender, 10 when i identified as genderfluid and just before i turned 12 i started identifying as trans demiboy. 

I say get them the binder, dysphoria is terrible and hopefully taht can help them a bit. It shouldn't mess with development and as long as they do t wear ot too long, *DO NOT EXERCISE WITH IT ON* (ive bruised my ribs a gew times doing that, its not woth it), never sleep with it, basically just follow all the rules they should be fine. 

Just because someone is young doesn't mean they cant explore/know who they are!

Edit: after secretly buying my first binder as a $20 dollar cheap one when i was 12 from Amazon make sure you never buy an Amazon binder. Get one from gc2b. Its way safer and their binders are swim safe (just get one thats a bit loose if you're gonna get one for swimming)
17 or so. I went to my first pride and I saw a group of trans women dressed in traditional dresses with the flag motives, I felt something warm in my chest. Later I realized why
I kinda always knew that I'm non-binary, but since I didn't know about that word for a long time, I suppressed those feelings and forced myself to identify as my assigned gender at birth.

It wasn't until I was seventeen that I realized I'm trans, and when I did, everything just clicked. All those feelings I've had since childhood, about how neither ""man"" nor ""woman"" fit me, suddenly made so much sense.

So yeah, I can totally believe a ten year old would know they're trans. A lot of us know from a young age, and your sibling is lucky enough to know how to properly describe their feelings.
Some folks know at 5 or 6, some folks like myself know at 27 or even older. Even if he changes his mind later about his gender, or pronouns, or anything, it’s healthiest to take them seriously. Kudos for asking for advice here, though!
i found out what a trans person is when i was 10 and immediately knew
Prob around 10-12. Not sure tbh
I knew I was a boy when I was eleven. I just didn’t let myself do anything about my physiology. It’s been screwing with my mental health for two decades. I’m waiting for my first binder to come in the mail and I have never so eagerly awaited a package in my entire life. I have only one person who knows this. I would be lost without her support. If he’s asking for your help, he needs it.
For me when I was really young gender never really mattered to me. Until I was 6 I kinda just lived and did whatever. However when I was 7 puberty hit so I got put on hormone blockers. I guess that's when gender dysphoria forst happened cause growing boobd was very uncomfortable. From 7 till 11 i was on puberty blockers and it wasn't at all the best time cause I got bullied and because of hormone blockers i also gained weight so I was the fat kid too. I think it was first when I was around 11 I found out what nonbinary was and I just knew that was me, I just didn't know where to go from there cause I didn't know binders were even a thing until later on. 

One of my close friends came out as trans when we were 12 so I told them I was nonbinary too. From there we were just out to each other but no one else. Back then it was around 2016/2017 so by then being trans was still considered a mental illness in our country. The social sigma was also partly why we didn't come out. But through that friend I found out a ton of stuff, like for example I realized binders exist, I found out about packers and STPs as well as HRT. 

But anyways back to your post. I definitely think you should take them seriously. My friend when I was 12 also chose a funny name at first ( I believe it was after some anime character ) but later on decided on another one. In terms of binders I think getting them one would be a good idea just make sure you tell let them know how long they're supposed to wear them and or other basic rules about binders. I live outside America so I can't really help in terms of your living situation. Best advice I could give is move out of there but I know ""just move"" isn't always an option for everyone. I'm sure other people in the comments got advice on that tho
6 I remember telling my mum I want to be a girl.
This is a complicated subject for me cause I grew up with undiagnosed mental illnesses and was extremely sheltered. 

But like……For the longest time I thought I was just butch but I also wanted to bind my chest and I would say things like “I wish I was a boy,” and stuff. That was pretty much my entire childhood but I had no idea that trans men even existed, and I thought I was a completely normal cisgender AFAB. Lmao. The first time the idea occurred me that trans men *must* exist if trans women did was when I was 16 and was starting to realize that I felt more like a guy and enjoyed being treated like a guy, and that was when I started to wonder if I could be a trans guy. 

Then I decided to never think about it again cause I’d done a lot of reading on LGBT issues and knew about hate crimes and shit. But in my 20s I came to understand that I am, in fact, transgender so…..Yeah.
I was 16
First time I realized that I might be trans was around 16.

And then I figured it out again at 19ish.

And again at 23.

And finally it stuck at about 27ish
Ive always known.
It took me until like last year to realize/accept that I’m trans but I’ve known there was something off about my gender for as long as I can remember. I know back when I was staring to develop breasts I refused to wear a bra and threw a tantrum because I “didn’t want to become a girl”.
The first time I'd say I kinda realized was when I was in middle school, but I hadn't properly realized until I was 18.
I was 7 lmao
25 years old. For reference I'm 25 years old
I was 14 when I first had the idea that I would rather be a girl, and wished I had been born one. It wasn't til years later, in college, that I even learned what being trans was (Texas schools ftl), and another several years - after moving out of the south - before I actually saw trans people living their lives normally. It wasn't til then that it went from a fantasy about how my life could have been to the realization that, ""hey, I can actually do this too.""
It took me until I was in my mid-twenties, but I blame that on not having the proper exposure to and education around trans-ness at an earlier age. Who knows when I could have realized, I'm just glad I finally figured it out. 😅
When I actually /knew/ I was trans, I was 14. But my whole childhood I spent pretending to be a boy (ie trying to pee standing, or sometimes even sitting backwards to pee bc at least I was then facing the other way when peeing), I used to copy behaviours my dad used to do, like laying with his hands in his trousers. He used to smoke and I thought that was a very masculine (or boyish at the time lol) so I used to pretend to smoke too. I'd pick male characters in every game I played and even when I would sing on the Wii with my sister I would ALWAYS pick the male to sing. So I suppose I was probably literally 5 or 6 when I started acting like a boy  but I didn't really know being trans was a thing when I was that young and I didn't really know about it until I was literally 13. I'd never had that kind of exposure but as soon as I Knew of it, I knew that was me. Although it was kind of hard to come to terms with it and I dossed from one label to another ie gender fluid to non-bindary because I suppose, to me, it softened the blow of going immediately female to male. 

TLDR; started acting like a boy at 5 or 6..... Knew I was trans by the time I was 14
I was somewhere between 13 and 15 when i found out, i was 11 when i started questioning
12 was the first time I wished I was a girl (that I can remember). Everything just kinda spiraled from there.
I had no words for nonbinary, and I definitely did not recognise it as a trans thing when I was 10. But already then I definitely was annoyed and confused every time there was a separation into groups by gender, or just a form with two gender check boxes. And already then I was fascinated by the genderbender character in kids shows.
I was raised in a very sheltered cult. Any gender nonconformity was heavily punished. There was also absolutely no talk about transgender people and very very little on homosexuality. 

That being said, I knew, without a doubt that I was a boy when I was 4. I told my parents a few times that I was a boy and wanted boy stuff. The beatings I endured were honestly really bad. I have permanent brain damage from them. 

I was around 16 when I found out about trans women. And what I found wasn’t great. Then my cousin reconnected with her sperm donor and found out she was trans. I was 18 at the time. I had so many questions for her, had no idea that hormones and surgery could literally change your entire body to the correct gender. I was coming from a place of complete ignorance and she didn’t like how I was questioning her, so she labelled me transphobic and she and my cousin cut me off. 

I got married to a man, a guy a grew up with (in the same cult) at 21, and at 22, found out that trans *men* were a thing. Took me another year to realise that’s what I was and there was something I could *do* about how I felt. 

My ex walked out on me at 24, and I immediately came out, cut my hair, changed my name, pronouns, and clothes, and never looked back. 

I’m 31 now, was on testosterone for about 9 months before I lost insurance, it put some hair on my face, deepened my voice, and that’s about it. Definitely plan on getting back on as soon as I can afford it again. Definitely gonna Yeet the Teet, again, as soon as I have money, still haven’t made up my mind on what to do for bottom. I pass about 95% of the time, I have the most issues with my height and my baby face, but usually when I open my mouth, they realise I’m a man.
idk i knew i was trans when i was ten and came out at 11 ish
I was 11 when I found out, 12 when I joined online groups to present as my preferred gender/pronouns/names
Most people know they are trans by age 4 but don’t have the words to describe it so it’s completely reasonable that your sibling is questioning their gender identity
i was 4 when i knew. i was crying every night because i wanted to be a boy so bad. and that never changed. the part of ur brain that registers gender begins to form when you are 3-5 years old. trust their judgement. i promise he knows what he wants more then you.
I realized I'm trans a year ago, but fantasized about being a boy even in elementary school, loooooong before I knew transitioning was an option or that anyone else felt that way.
I was a toddler when I first started saying I wished I was a girl. I was 14 the first time I actually started learning about what transgender means and considered that I might be trans. Then I went back into denial and finally admitted it to myself at 19.

If I had someone in my life who understood what this was, who could help me explore who I am with no shame or inhibition, I would have come out decades ago. If I had known it was an option, and been given the freedom to express myself, I would have had the childhood, and then the puberty I deserved.
Too early to remember my age.  When I was a very young child, I remember tucking in the bathtub because I hated to see my male organ.
29 but i felt weird my whole life I just couldn't identify it...
Probably 13 maybe 12? I didn’t know I was non-binary, I just knew I didn’t feel like a girl
Still haven't at 32
I knew it for awhile since I was little. Remember watching Ranma 1/2 thinking it was so cool that a male could turn into a female. On top of that day dreaming what it might be like being a girl. think around 10 I was stealing my sister clothes. I didn't come out due to a dysfunctional family and tranphobic community. The original plan was to get away and then come but shit happened and I got stuck in shitty rural America.
I was 4
Around 5 or 6 I had strong urges and wishes to be more like my sister and my mom. Then in my preteens I hated that my voice dropped during puberty and that I had to wear men's clothing. So pretty early on I'd say! I didn't have the language, cultural, or structural support to come out until 24 though :S
17 when I realized. If I wasn't so emotionally incompetent then 7ish I bet I would have noticed.

Be careful btw. I don't live in Texas so I can't say for certain but I'm pretty sure they have systems in place that target trans people. Might get messy beyond family.
I had feelings I was trans for so long but I had the egg cracking moment at thirteen when I was educated on what trans was. And realized I wasn’t just some weirdo and it was actually a thing that I felt more like a girl then a boy. So the age isn’t weird. And it’s always good to let kids experiment, I say.
I knew around 3-4 that something was up. I knew by 8 I was really a girl. That was 1990, so transitioning wasn’t an option. Fast forward 31 years of repression, and I came out last year.
I think I have always known on some level that I wasn’t a girl, but I don’t think I was consciously aware of the fact that I wasn’t cis until I was twelve or so, and I didn’t connect the dots that I was a dude until high school. Fun times with alexithymia.
i was 12 when i first noticed something was off, because when i first reported ""not relating to other girls in my class"" to my mom, she said that was just me growing up. then i learned what transgender meant, and at 14 i came out.

it stresses me out tho because a lot of trans people knew they were trans at very young ages, ranging from 3-6, and i didn't, so i'm scared that once i go to a doctor to prescribe me testosterone, i'll be denied because i'm ""not actually trans"" because i only realized i was trans once i figured out what being trans was:|
I was 19 and finally spilled my guys to my best friend and he was like, shush. I say you sound trans go talk to trans people. I did and I got 2 lovely names out of it.
I was 4 when I first realized. I didn’t know what trans was, but I said to myself all the time how much I wanted to be a girl and didn’t understand why I couldn’t have been born one. I even cried about it. I would put on my grandma’s dresses and her makeup, and put on her high heels, etc. I also would play games like I was getting married and I was the bride, or where I was pregnant and had a husband, and other stuff like that. So I’ve known that I wanted to be a girl for an extremely long time.
12
At 6 years old I saw the little mermaid and couldn't wait to have breasts so I could wear a seashell bra like Arial. Looking back now, there were a lot of clues that I didn't put together. I think if I had known what trans was I would have come out around puberty. I started dressing feminine at around 16 or 17. I'm 33 now.
5 had to have new shoes for school could not have the ones I wanted like my friend had was told they are only for girls , wanted to be a girl since
Around 13
I realized I might be trans when I was about 15. But I “felt” trans around the same age as your sibling, just didnt have the words. Thats why Im happy trans people are more talked about now. Because I wouldve loved to transition much earlier
I knew when I was 4 and attempted suicide at 6 cus I couldn’t express or understand my feelings. Not everyone is the same and not everyone knows when they are younger but if they are expressing it and talking to you about it, chances are they know what they want.
I came out as trans at 12 and chose a name based off a fictional character I really liked at the time. Years later the origin story embarrasses me but honestly the name fits me really well and I couldn’t pick a better one now. So I think 12 year old me made a good decision, no matter how cringy it might’ve been/seemed
I can't remember the first time I thought to myself ""I want to be a girl"" but I remember when I started hating having a penis. Right before I really started puberty, but it took me a long time after that. Hell, I came out to my best friend at the start of March of this year, and I panic-attacked my way out of starting HRT until the start of April.

I'd been thinking about wanting to be a lesbian since I was in highschool, and I even knew a trans male and was good friends with them, but it still took me almost a decade from then to even start sorting myself out.
I “figured it out” maybe when I was 26 or so but I ran from it for a while….

Hit me like bricks a few months ago at 28. When I go on walks I’ll reflect on moments in my past and realize how….. not cis that was. I’ve never exactly felt comfortable or happy with my body but I could never place why. There wasn’t a specific *thing* about it that made me not like how I look, I just…. Didn’t. 

Sure I wish I realized it sooner. But if your sibling is going through this they probably have a fair understanding of how they feel inside. Coming out at a young age usually is pretty common, at least in the last decade or two because our younger generations have been much more accepting and encouraging than generations preceding us.
I’ve “Wanted to be a girl” since I was really little but I found out i was trans around 13
I was 6 or 7 when I realized tbh
When did I learn what trans was? When I was 9. When did I know I wasn't a girl? About 4.
I was around 7 when I figured out that I didn’t like being a girl
I was in 3rd grade when I knew I wasn’t cis or straight and in 4th grade I realized I was trans and now I’m in 7 grade and I’m going to an endocrinologist
I was literally one year and seven month, what I’ll say will sound cliché today but back in 1999 it was more like a tool to know who you were and how to tell it also. 

When I was still in Vietnam, my adoptive mother brought me to a shop for kids and when choosing stuff I instinctively gone for the girl’s ones. And when the cashier told her “Girl toys ! Girl toys !” my mom said “If he wants girl’s toys he will get them.” also later in France three times I bought with her girl’s clothes and was proudly wearing them outside. I didn’t knew exactly the term transgender and its meaning but I definitely knew I wasn’t a boy, I was at home always trying my mom panties, shoes, makeup and felt pretty outside but erased when I had to stop before she arrives. 

Later in 2013 before I really come out as trans to a friend first, I had a relationship with a girl who treated me like shit after she said yes and I told myself “Why the fuck you aren’t happy even though this girl was pretty and all the men here want her !” “You love boy ?” “Yeah I could but it doesn’t sounds that right” “Could you love a boy but if you would be a girl ?” “That’s sound more like it … that sounds more like … what the … that’s it !” it felt like a revelation at this point and after that I made some research which led me to today with my one year transition already 🙏🏻😲
If I'm being honest no one teached me about the lgbtq until high school because some of my classmates were bisexual and now I'm upset that no one help me understand these feelings like when I was young I thought I was being my autistic self and imagining that I was in some mtf tg video thing but back then I thought it was normal 4 everyone wanting 2 be a cute girl but I was 2 scared 2 ask my parents about it because my mom is a Christian and my dad usually belittle me of everything I say or do so when I was 18 I told my mom and step-dad that I was trans but but they didn't approve  of me being that so now (20 years old btw)I came 2 realize that I wasn't trans but actually gender-fluid/pansexual/lesbian and  I felt happy about myself being that but still my parents aren't supportive of me and thinks it's a stupid phase like I had 2 learn all of this on my own and even till this day I always feel like everyone is likr my dad making fun of every little thing I do it's frustrating all I want is 2 make my parents happy even sacrificing a part of myself 2 do but it's just so hard u know
I was about 12/13. Started to realise that I feel way more confident presenting as male. (Should have realised many times over when I was six or seven, though.) Puberty really can be a major event that prompts a lot of people to realise they’re trans, because not much makes you become dysphoric about your body quite like watching your body slowly morph into something you’re not. They’re definitely at around the age to be coming out. 

Binding should be fine around that age, may need to get more though as he gets older. Just watch and make sure he’s binding safely. 8 hours a day is the max you should do, i believe. 

Honestly, naming himself after a Thomas Sanders character is fair. I named myself after a character in a movie. I don’t even feel strongly about him, I just liked the name. Now it’s mine! 

It seems like you will be someone for him to come to about this, especially because you’re asking how to support him best now. First of all, thank you for doing that, because if your parents are every bit as bad as you expect, he will need someone to turn to. You can make all the difference. Good luck!
Well, despite having watched Rent frequently from the age of like 9 or 10 onwards, I somehow managed to miss the fact that being trans was a thing until I was 16, which is when I knew what to call it, but I had always known I was who I am. I tried to pass it off as part of my ""I'm better than everyone else"" phase I had, but even before I got out of kindergarten I really did not at all identify as a boy.

I'm glad you're getting him a binder, it's the right thing to do for them for sure. As for your all's parents, it's up to your sibling on what to do, but my advice is to be careful about it, and perhaps try to slowly change their minds about folks who are different from them before he tells them. For some folks, it's only really possible to start understanding and empathizing with a group like us when someone close to them is in said group, so them knowing might actually be a great help in the long run, but it's a very risky move to take. Whatever happens, I hope you and your sibling end up happy.
i said i wanted to be a boy when i grew up when i was 3 then took me until i was 14 to realize ""wait, i'm not cis""
19, after years of ""pff everyone feels that way"" and ""If I was I'm too busy so I won't transition til [undefined vague date in the future] lol""
When I actually knew? Maybe 17. When I knew something was wrong. About 10
If I knew that it was a possibility, probably at like 10-12. Presenting as a boy has not ever felt natural for me. But I thought that everyone was the same way somehow.
I envied girls from a very young age but it went to the back of my mind because I was raised in a small town in the south. I knew something was up at 10 years old, started questioning at 13, came out at 14 and I started transitioning at 16.

I was kind of late into it because it didn't become a problem until puberty because I didn't know nor did I experience much of a difference in how the girls and the boys were raised besides clothing and hair. I realized once my body started to change and I started to want to change my sex and go back to before the changes took place.
I was 14 when I first realised I might be trans
Found the words at 23, but I really always knew. Followed a link to /r/traaaa from a non-trans related subreddit. Those memes were awful relatable and kicked off a torrent of repressed memories and feelings going back to my earliest childhood recollections. Really fucked with my head and it took me 3 years to build up the courage to start HRT. It's been a year since I started, and it's been by far the best year of my life, and only getting better with time.
I was 13-14
My earliest realisations were in pre school, as soon as I was interacting with cis-girls I knew that's what I was supposed to be, so perhaps 4?
It was just a couple weeks ago when I admitted that I was a woman. I am 40. There were tons of signs growing up, I just didn’t understand them.  Wish I had. Now that I’m out to myself, the momentum is picking up. The girl wants out!!
Well I cracked when I was 14, I \*probably\* should've realized about 10, but that is a story for another day...
I didn’t catch on to the signs, I just was a ‘femboy’ who was incredibly depressed and dysphoric. Once when I got in trouble because someone manipulated me into getting drunk for a “good time” and preyed on me in my drunken state to send nude photos of my genitals, then my mom caught wind and made me go through my entire photo roll on my phone and there was a lot of pictures of astolfo and shit. My mom sorta diagnosed me with trans and she let me try out she/her pronouns and she was right!
Wanted to grow up to be a man when I was six. Thought I was non binary at 16. Finally put 2 + 2 together at 21.
I was 12 when I found the label transgender and knew that that was me. Though I experienced dysphoria at a way younger age and could tell I ""wanted to be a boy"" wayyy earlier than that (age 6 or so?) 
If you decide to buy them a binder, I recommend gc2b or spectrum outfitters. Do please look into safe binding! :)
I was like 14/15?
I came out as trans when i was 8 and i knew it since 6 so honestly, he knows what he is doing
First memories when I was around 4-5, not liking being called ""cute"" or ""girly"" or ""beautiful"", being called ""handsome"" made me giggle, not liking dresses, getting the blackest things I could get at a clothing store, being jealous of my brother for absolutely no fucking reason.

I had two pairs of purple trousers, that were falling apart at the fucking seam because I was adamant that I am never leaving the house without these on, they were the least girly things I owned, I felt such confidence in them that I had to literally beg my grandma to fix them for the 30th time instead of buying new ones. 

My ma caught on when I was tearing my red little slippers to shred (just the decoration) because they had a little flower on them, and bought me a pair of black sandals like my brother, I wore those for years.

I felt such shameful joy the first time I got a haircut that I cried. 

Didn't know the word for ""trans"" until entering late high school, 16 or so, but I always knew there was something. I looked enough like a dude, so when entering highschool, I just passed as a dude and lived my life like that, didn't come out because no one knew jack, nothing really happened, school trip with the class to beaches and water parks were great. All until a classmate out me on the last day, asked them about it and they said they figured it out 2 days before that, everyone was surprised.

Not saying your siblings' feelings, or your own aren't valid, but I didn't have much support growing up, and would have killed to have a binder. Just make sure to reassure them that you can understand, but that it's normal to explore and find what best fit them. Go slow, just try out a bunch of things, like names, pronouns, binding. Hold off on the puberty blockers until they've talked to their gender doctor multiple times truthfully.
Probably 5ish or so
11 was when I started having serious thoughts of wishing I was born a girl because I didn't know trans people existed yet. At 17 I learned what they were and almost immediately figured it out
14/15 I suppressed it, 17 and a half now and its coming back
I think maybe...13 or 14....sometime a little bit after puberty hit I realized that I absolutely HATED male puberty, and I had nothing in common with other boys, but it didn't really hit me until a couple years after highschool.  I just didn't understand how I felt, and honestly had to do a lot of self reflection and actually research about how I felt.  There is a lot more info about transgender men and women today than there was when I was growing up in the 90's, and so it was a long and confusing journey for me to come to the conclusion and understanding that I am transgender, but that feeling of being trans has been with me basically my entire life.  Looking back, the earliest sign I can remember is maybe when I was 4 years old.
As far back as i can really remember clearly which was about puberty.  I didnt have the language to explain it at the time though and when i was caught once exploring my identity i was shamed into the closet for about 30 years.
I was eight years old but because of my household I hate it and I buried it deep inside my subconscious to the point where I forgot until I turned 18
I think it started to develop as a **real** thought when I was 23, 2 years ago 


The seed of that was there though since I was young, I just had 0 exposure or knowledge about trans people, knew nothing about HRT or SRS or anything about transitioning, and was fed a bunch of bullshit through 'discussions'


There were times I wanted to be a girl but, because of the messaging I'd learned, thought I was 1. trying to be exploitative/be in spaces I didn't belong and 2. that wanting to be a woman was impossible (again knew nothing about hormones, HRT or transitioning). I might've still been in the closet, if not for twitter and my therapist



Only on twitter did I see actual trans women, hearing their thoughts, seeing how transformative and actually mundane transitioning could be


It went in my mind from this extreme lifestyle I'd been fed lies about to a path to live very very fast, I really think just the pictures of trans women at parties, just living their day-to-day lives did more for me than anything



The thoughts were there, I'd have them during school but thought I was wrong for wanting to be a girl


If I'd had the right education about trans people, I'd have figured myself out a long time ago. This was the missing piece in my life making me so miserable, took years of therapy and twitter, so thankful for that, to get here
First grade, so I guess five or six (1993). I didn't know there was a word for it and the internet wasn't accessible enough to look these things up yet. Took another 5 years or so before I was able to look it up, but if a I'm honest it just confused me even more and I tried to convince myself it was just a phase or a fetish or something.
I was 5. It was my first kiss. We are mtf and ftm now and both had a convo after we kissed about gender and a 5 year olds understanding of gender dysphoria. We are best friends still 27 years later. And have known each other since we were 2.
I realised when I was 13 and came out about 6 months later. I received some pretty transphobic behaviour in school so I crawled back in the trans closet. I’m now 18 and have recently come out again and I really wish someone was there to support me when I was 13 because that’s what I really needed at that time. One person can make all the difference. I wish you and your sibling a lot of love <3
I was probably about 9 when I started having trans feelings, didn't have a name for them until later but they were def there
I first started to have those thoughts of “I want to be treated as a boy” “I wish I woke up as a boy someday” at 10-11. I started to really understand, wonder, and finally accept I’m trans at 15.
Good luck for you and your brother! I hope everything goes well
I was 32 when I truly realized I was trans.
I came out in my 40’s,  but I knew when I was 6.
I always knew I wanted to be a boy but didn't connect that to being transgender until I was 11/12
I want to say that I've always known, but not the label. I knew from a young age that I preferred more masc things and throughout growing up, it continued until I scrapped the whole thought of femininity. By the age of 11 I knew things weren't right, however I didn't want to label it. I finally came to the conclusion that I was trans when I was 13
Honestly, to me, you can come out at any age. Some famous person transitioned at 6. So, no age does not matter because sexuality/gender CAN'T be influenced. So happy you're supporting him tho!
i know a girl who came out when she was only in like 2nd or 3rd grade i think (it may have actually been earlier) and though i was never in a class with her, she seemed much happier after coming out than she did before! :D
I had no clue what even meant to be trans until my thirties. Before then, I'd always secretly wished I had been born female, and I remember wishing even as a child that I could either magically wake up female, or that I could be reincarnated as a girl. I didn't have the words for what I felt, and given what little exposure I'd had to anyone who violated gender boundaries as defined in 1990s Texas, it seemed like it was best just not to talk or think about it to the extent possible.
I was 11 when I realized I was trans, but looking back I showed some subtle signs as a kid. 
Also the name thing, I wouldn’t worry too much. Sure it can be his forever name, but I’m 17 now and changed my name multiple times before I found my name
23. Am 24 now, out to everyone, and been on HRT for 3 months as well as legally changed my name and gender

Although I was 6 when i knew i wanted to be a girl. Only at the age of 23 did i realise what that meant
I can trace it back at least to the age of 12 or so. Just when I started to hit puberty. A wave of very confusing feelings about myself which I only now with 20 years of hindsight realize was a sign of being trans. That was the early 2000s I had no idea what I was even feeling.   
While I generally had pretty good sex-ed in school, transgender wasn't ever a topic and the older term ""transsexual"" was only ever once brought up by a rather conservative teacher as a sexual deviance.  Her other hot-take was that bisexuality wasn't real, and there were only exclusively gay or straight people, some of whom just occassionally enjoyed sex with the other sex. Yeah, not great.

Mass media usually depicted us as either repulsive or pathetic and comical, if we were mentioned at all. I grew up in a rural town, there were barely any queer people to connect with, let alone trans people. Made it so much harder to find out who I am.

It's fantastic young people nowadays get to know about transness earlier or can learn about it online at least. Really does wonders for your mental health.

Kids aren't stupid. They are just new to this world in which there is much to learn, so they come off as such sometimes, but if you give them the vocabulary they figure these things out easily.
I'm 23 and finally realizing I can be the person I want. It's still kinda fuzzy in my mind, so I'm not exactly sure, but I know there's someone deep down who just wants to show themselves. It's great that you realize all of this early!
16. I don’t understand how people say they knew  under 10 years old I really don’t 😂
I showed tons of signs but chose to go the route of ‘this isn’t what boys/men do’… until I was in my 30’s. 

I had been running from myself for too many years (childhood trauma, society, etc)

Came out July of last year and started hormones end of October.
20
I only found out a couple of weeks ago and now I'm as happy as ever being me 🏳️‍⚧️
I had a feeling since around 7-8 but had signs since around 5-6. Didnt know what transgender was so never thought about it. To be honest I think that as our access to information increases it become easier to understand certain feeling. If I knew what transgender was then I would have tried to do stuff much earlier. A binder at 10 seems completely normal, especially if they are sure. Just make sure they understand how to use it properly and safely. If your parents are unaccepting of transgender people then do not do it and explain to your sibling why. If they are but don't know then it is okay but tell your brother he may want to tell your parents as well or at least in the near future as if they find a binder it will be outing your brother when they may not be ready
I was 4-6 when I started wishing I was a boy. I didn't have the words for it and assumed it was normal. I got my first binder when I was 13. Binders won't really harm you unless you're using it improperly or wearing it for too long. With name associations, at first all you can think about when you hear that name is what it's associated with, but eventually it just becomes their name. I have a friend named Zero and at first it was a weird number name he picked, but now it's just his name.
I was fifteen. There was a lot of things during my life that was red flags but I didn't know the term until I decided to figure out my gender. When I was twelve, I tried he/him pronouns and I liked them, I was happy with it but I thought nothing of it. I liked seeing myself as a boy because it made me comfortable in myself. Living as a female just didn't feel right to me, it felt wrong. I've experimented with lots of gender identities. Non binary, genderfluid, demi boy then lastly transgender. I've had my friends use my chosen name and pronouns and that has made me extremely happy and comfortable. It feels right. Now I've had some say that I could just be a tom boy but I'm not a girl whose boy like, I am a boy. I know myself nobody else does. I happy with my identity. I'm seventeen now and I'm happy with who I am.

Special thanks to my bestfriend who was the first to accept me, it really meant a lot even now <3
Around 11 or 12 when I was first learning about thing that trans people often go through and how they feel. I thought for the longest time that everyone wished to be the other gender and if they were given the chance they would, nope turns out I was just trans and no one told me what that was
I was 2 1/2 to 3 when I knew there was something ‘quirky’ about my sense of self, the social role that felt right being incongruent with my body, what I was told I was and what I could and could not do. Kids know who they are.  I imagine you knew who you were and what interest you, that you knew your personality when you were very small.  My core temperament is essential we ly the same now as it was when I was 3.  We don’t give kids enough credit for how instinctually attuned they are - socialization beats that out of us to make us fit the image society expects of us. We then learn to self police so we fit.
I was 13 when I realized I was trans
Seventeen was when I had the language for what I was, but I tried to bury it until I was twenty-nine. Don't do what I did. If you have the means to come out and a strong support system don't suppress yourself. Being authentic to yourself is the most important thing.
I started questioning when i was 10yr too, but only discovered what meant to be trans when i was 12
16. My first trans panic was in kindergarten tho, followed by a lengthy hyper feminine phase.
My kiddos told us she was trans at 4, we’ve supported her ever since. The only damage you will cause is by NOT supporting your sibling.
I knew around 9... Waited until 28 to come out after years of hiding... Was not fun, better now though!
I was around 9 when I started realizing that my Femininity was way too strong to be a Boy. I would find myself Dreaming and Day Dreaming of my life as a Girl. Oddly enough I felt so happy and at peace with myself during these Dreams. I knew that Guys had my interest by the age of 6-7. So I was constantly dreaming about getting married to a Man. And walking down the aisle in an absolutely beautiful Dress. It all felt sooo right. My Feelings and Dreams only got stronger as I grew older. I am now 22 Years old and have been Publicly Trans for 5 Years and on Hormones for almost 3 Years. Needless to say my Feelings back then when I was 9 were correct and I won’t be going back. 💙🤍💖
I was 6-7, didn’t know what to call it then as that was 30+ years ago.   But I knew something was wrong.
I always have the feeling of ""I'd prefer to be a girl or what if I were born as a girl""
Since I started to experimenting with my sexuality (11 years old), I enjoyed using mom's clothes when I was home alone
When I was 15 I understood what a transgender person is and I said that I was born for it, but I totally accepted that feeling somewhere between my 18s and 19s and I started hrt a few weeks after my 20th birthday
I was 12 when one night I randomly woke up and went ""wearing girls clothes would be nice"" then dysphoria hit at 13 and I realised I was trans
14, only because I wasn’t exposed to LBGTQIA+ or even knew what it was until middle school. my parents are toxic conservative Christians that’s all that needs to be said lol.
I was 24, there were signs I ignored though. I wish I didn't wait so long
Four or five? It was before preschool I know that for a fact. 

I wish I hadn't been made to be afraid to tell people back then and that someone would help me.
I was 12 when I realized trans people were a thing and in the same year realized I was one. I always had feelings of ""wanting to be"" a girl.
I realized around 14 but didn't know what trans was until 15. This was a few years ago. If anything the name thing is probably just because they are 10. They may change it after a few years, a name is never set in stone, or they may not. Some people have weird names. Just support them in their endeavors and help them explore who they are and they will be the better for it later in life even if everything doesn't work out as expected.
I think I was in 2nd grade. I had found out what trans meant and told my dumb little 2nd grade boyfriend “i might be trans someday, I don’t like being a girl”. He said he wouldn’t love me if I was trans so I guess I kinda harried being trans after that
I started feeling gender dysphoria and other stuff when I was around 13, but I didn't know what it was yet.
Toddler age. I was bullied a lot, and ended up in active addiction... 😔
I always said I wanted to be a boy but I didn’t officially come out as trans until I was 14
Wow a lot of the commenters were super young compared to me I knew something wasn’t right early but didn’t figure it out fully until grade 11 which go figure a dude who likes being called feminine pronouns can use their voice to be very convincing and called by a feminine name is trans… who knew?!
19, the thing that showed it was called ""Witch Weapon""

The game died and I'm sad
I don't remember being a kid, but my brother tells me that at 6 I was crying and telling him how unfair it was that I had to be a boy.

So, presumably like 6.

I ended up burying it for a long time when I buried the rest of my childhood and didn't rediscover that about myself until I was in my 20s, and now all I can think about that is how I could've saved myself all those years of suffering if only I had been allowed to know.
When I was an elementary age kid we would play pretend on the playground, usually pretending to be characters for our favorite shows. I was always playing the boy. It felt nice to be called he/him, and to be treated like a boy. I didn't understand why until I was older, but I had a distain for being referred to as a girl and being forced to dress hyperfemme for picture day or events. My lack of understanding of what I wanted/how I felt manifested in a lot of ways, but eventually I stumbled into trans creators and felt very seen and frankly a bit disturbed because I knew that my feelings being validated by a trans person meant that I was trans and that scared me because I saw the way openly queer and trans people are treated in places like Texas, where I grew up. I tried transitioning in HS, but the lack of support was devastating to me and I felt even more scared of myself and of acknowledging my reality. Before then, I knew, but I didn't have a word that could describe my experience. I've been on T for 4 months now, and I can't help but to reflect on how different of a person I might be now if I'd been given acceptance and support by the people closest to me when I was younger and been allowed to explore myself safely. 

Even if you have your doubts, please extend him the space and compassion he needs to explore and decide who he wants to be (and become) and feel safe doing it. Just drawing from my own experience, I think the most helpful thing would have been having the option to go to someone in my life and ask for help. My friends were very good at using my name and correct pronouns but that wasn't a comfort I had in my own home or within my family. I didn't feel safe asking for a binder or tape, or a packer because my family had made the consequence clear to me in the way they spoke about and treated other people, even complete strangers. The fact that he's willing to ask you speaks volumes about the trust he's invested in you. It means you're probably doing a great job!
I was 11 just about to turn 12.
I was 13, almost 14. I think if your sibling wants a binder, there's no problem with him getting one, as long as they are safe with it. And people choose names from their favorite media all the time. It may seem cringey or childlike, but if that's the name he likes then that's the name he likes. And they may want to change their name to something else in the future. Nothing in regards to transition would harm their development at this point
I was in denial for a long time but I think truthfully I knew at 13. There was so much fear I blocked it out for so long.
it was december 2020 when i discovered that i was trans! as long as they know how to binder safely, they'll be fine. a good chest binder thats also affordable and trustworthy is on amazon by idtswch! i prefer to buy half top binders but its all up to their preference! their name choices might be weird but it is their name! i understand it may be hard to take it seriously but you just gotta roll with it! it makes them happy :)
22.  
I realized two years ago that I am nonbinary.  
I struggled with gender dysphoria growing up but being a sheltered kid in a Christian household I didn't understand why I hated my body and wanted to be androgynous. The terminology simply wasn't there when I was growing up. I was taught that being transgender was a ""mental illness"" and a ""sin"" and how there were only ""two genders"" and all the other transphobic garbage. Plus the homophobic garbage that went right alongside it (I'm a lesbian).  
I didn't finally break away from that environment until I was 19 and I was pretty quickly exposed to queer culture and that helped me to become more comfortable with my identity.  
What really clued me in to the fact that I'm nonbinary were the dreams that I was having for a long time before I came out. Generally some kind of symbolism was involved or I would hear the word being said or by some magical force I would change my body to one that was ideal. The dreams stopped after I came out and accepted that aspect of myself.
I don’t know if I am trans (though I’m more inclined to say that I am rather than to say that I’m not) but I remeber 9 yrs ago,in 3rd grade,was the first time I questioned my gender.I remember being very happy when I found out models can make millions of euros,and thinking about how cool it would be to become a rich, beautiful and smart woman, and how much I wished one day that would happen and still do.
Still don’t know if I’m trans but I started researching and watching videos online about trans people and trans kids when I was around 10-11. Like I’d watch this shit daily
I kinda always felt like something was wrong. Never felt comfortable in masc clothing, being called a boy, a man, any of that. Always felt strange, off-putting. But i never have thought abou transitioning, neither about being a woman. It was until some totally stranger questioned my gender identity at a role-playing website, i was 17. I always felt comfortable roleplaying a girl, being treated as one. This random dude just said ""But have you ever thought about the reasons you might feel this way?"" And he shattered my little glass bubble, lol.
But, if he feel this way, it's great that he put up the strength to do that. You should support them to be who they want. And, if at any moment he decides that transitionig isn't what he wants to do, it's okay too. Just love him the way he wants to be ;)
I was 22 years and three months old when I found out.  I was watching trans memes with my brother who already came out as trans several months prior and I said to my brother ""Why am I relating to all these memes?  Fantasizing about being a girl all the time is not normal?  I thought every guy thought that way.""  He said ""No, it's not.""  Even before 22 years old I told my mother a few times ""I wish guys produced estrogen.""  I began fantasizing about being a girl about every other day starting when I was about ten years old.
I was like 6 or 7 but didn't have the words to understand it for many many years

I was born in 1986 and was very sheltered. I didn't really understand what being trans was until my 20s and didn't start my transition until 34. But if someone told me ""if you want to be a girl you can be a girl"" when I was young my life would have turned out very better.
I got dysphoria when I was 9 I think but didn't figure out what the word trans was until I was 14. Triggered a lot of depression cus I didn't know why I felt so wrong.
I realized at around 12-13, probably would’ve realized a bit sooner, but I didn’t know that being trans was a thing until middle school
Either 9 or 11 but im bot 100% i don’t remember a lot from those years
12
I've always had the feeling that something was off. Ever since I was 4-5, actually. I never liked girly items and absolutely HATED putting on dresses and pink clothing items. I didn't like being a girl in any situation. It made me uncomfortable; and I never liked my given name. I didn't know what I was experiencing, and I never spoke to anyone about it. But those who knew I was feeling different, knew. I eventually discovered the term for it when I was around 11 years old, and I've felt comfortable with being a guy ever since. It doesn't matter at what age you discover you're trans. Just make sure to support those you love :)
I had dysphoria as soon as I hit puberty, but I didn't really find the name for it til I was 13-14 or so, which was when I started experimenting with pronouns and figured out I was trans. 

Fwiw, some trans folk will go through several names before they pick the one(s) that work best for them. Not to say you should hope on them changing it when theyre older, if they think it suits them then thats good, but they may change it as they mature if they no longer feel it suits them at that point!
Every time I think of this question I remember it happening earlier..
I was 13 when I realized I an trans FtM, I’m 16 now and I haven’t been able to start transitioning physically cause my therapist is not specialized in gender stuff.
hey! idk if you already bought a binder because i saw the update, but make sure, ABSOLUTELY SURE, that you NEVER buy binders off Amazon. gc2b has also dropped quality lately, but a size up from his regular size in gc2b will work well for swimming. but for an every day binder, i SERIOUSLY SUGGEST SPECTRUM OUTFITTERS!!!! they last longer, they don't slide up like gc2b does, and they provide a better shape.they also have a different sizing chart than gc2b, so watch out for that. if he's on the edge in measurements between two sizes, please please get the bigger one just to be safe. make sure he also knows to only hand wash/air dry the binder. also sleeping with a binder NEVER safe. also also only 8-10 hours a day, and take at least two off days throughout the week. (i yay do weekends during school). good luck :)
My son came out at 10, he picked a name from a popular fiction series, he’s now 14 and still goes by that name and identifies as male, 10 seems like an appropriate age to question gender, as it’s right around the time puberty starts for people assigned female.
20. Took me to 33 to start hormones due to pressure, fear, and health problems
I realized I was trans only when I came to know what trans and transgender mean, when I was almost 16. But in reality I kinda knew since I was little, like 5 yo. I not only wanted to be a boy, I was one and therefore I used to introduce myself with a boy name (the same one as my uncle lol) and dress in boys clothes etc. I stopped doing that when I got my first period because ""I was a lady"" and my parents were really uncomfortable when people asked them if I was a boy. As of today, I still have to come out because turns out I have a very transphobic family
kids often know their own identity surprisingly young, and even if they end up changing their mind later on that's really not a problem. using his pronouns and getting him a binder isn't anything permanent, and they'll be better off knowing that you respect and support their identity no matter the end result.
I wanted to be a boy so bad all my life, I even use to pray to god every night that he would make me one when I believed in god. I found out what trans was when I was 12-13 and it fit me. I wish I waited to come out.. it would’ve made my life so much easier
I’m in a very rural Christian area and hadn’t heard of transness being normal atleast until I was 20 (two years ago) imediately thought that might be me and I was right. I hadn’t put much thought into a title like trans so I was always just me and turns out trans is what that is. Me ams now beautiful wamen UwU
It took me a while to have a name for it. The feelings I had that led me to think “maybe, this is it” then get diagnosed by a specialist are the same feelings I’ve had all my life.
I was about 8, I wanted to be a boy but didn’t know trans was a thing in the late 1980s, even with Chaz Bono doing his thing.
it took me a while to completely figure out but when i first started suspecting it was like in 2020 so i was 13. and now im like 100% certain and im 15.
I didn't know what the word ""trans"" meant until I was 12, but once I learned what it meant, I realized that's probably what I was. Looking back now, I think I had feelings of being trans back as far as being like, maybe 8 years old. 

For someone who's ten years old, a binder is probably fine but might not be necessary at all due to age and physical development. If you do decide to get him one, make sure it's not too small and make sure he's able to get a larger one as he grows so it isn't damaging. An alternative may be something like a sports bra.
My egg cracked January 16 2015, on the 10 yr anniversary of my sobriety at the age of 56 years old. On February 2, 2015 I walked into work as Alyna I left the previous Friday as Alan. My name and gender was changed to female 109 days later. I woke up on my 60th birthday in the hospital after reassignment surgery. It doesn't usually go this quickly.
I've started questioning myself at 13
But I'm waiting. I'm not 18 yet and I don't want to unnecessarily ruin myself just in case the feeling is wrong. I really hate my body and the fact that nobody beside like 2 people in my life at least wants to use my preferred name which is kind of gender neutral, but i know that i might change so i just roll with it. I don't want to visit a gender therapist as I don't have any good experiences with any kind of therapists etc so I'm waiting. Don't rush it, tell them that they need to wait until they're an adult. To this time they can wear baggy clothes and sports bras that's what I do. You can try to encourage them to at least use a name that's not gendered and let both of you figure this out. They might not like it and go back to the old style or roll with it and be happy. But please don't treat them harshly with that, they'll lose your trust and will never speak of it again. Remember that nowadays gender is a pretty weird thing, I've met plenty of people who pretend to be this and this gender/sexuality just because they wanted to be quirky or to fit in some environment.
23-24 finally realized it after 11 years of suppressing it
I was 9 when I started thinking about it. But 12 when I finally decided I was trans.
I was around 9 or 10 when I realized I was trans. I had just started puberty, and it felt so wrong, I only grew more and more uncomfortable with my body. I had also noticed when most of my afab friends were excited to grow breast and get their period, I felt a level of disgust towards those things, it was something that I never wanted to happen, and when I was younger for whatever I had it in my head that that stuff was never gonna happen to me, but when it did, it never once felt like I was growing into my body; (like how so many adults described puberty for me) it was the complete opposite, whenever I looked into the mirror I never saw me, and as each day went by it kept feel like I was getting further and further away from myself. All my afab friends would tell me how jealous they were of my chest, and how they wanted a chest like mine, but hated it, they never felt like they were apart of me, they felt like these tumors growing off my chest that I couldn't get rid of, and with everyone around me telling me that they wished they had that; it made me feel like I was broken, like it was something I was supposed to want when but I didn't. Tho I didn't know what being transgender was at the time, it was something I didn't know existed until I was about 13. After I learned about it everything seemed to click and make sense for me, I felt so much less broken and disconnected from myself. There's nothing wrong with letting kids socially transition, there is no harm in using a different name and pronouns, and responsibly wearing a binder, it usually helps trans kids feel so much more comfortable with themselves, and if they aren't trans it usually helps them realize that too.
14, lol
I don't know if I can put a year on that. I never felt good as a girl. I liked being treated as a boy when I cut my hear short. That I was queer in my sexuality that was clear for me since I was twelve. But I had a really hard time accepting myself as a trans person because of my family ( I can't be pan AND trans, I can't do that to my parents) and of internalized transphobia. Also I got much misogynist bullshit from my parents, basically I was worthless because I am a girl so I thought for a long time my dysphoria comes from that. Then when i finally got with 20 that I was some kind of trans it took me 7 years to get that I am really a man, because I didn't want to turn into a misogynist prick like I was surrounded from my family. Since I don't have contact to my family any longer I could freely explore in a safe space, that really helped. So I am reallly happy for people who have themselfes figured out, I dpn't think that this is a ""phase"" teenagers go through and they should be taken seriously.
I was 12, I chose my name out of a cookbook.
14 also around the time I even learned you could be trans
One of my oldest memories was watching the fairly odd parents episode where Timmy turner wished into Tamantha turner and thinking, ""I'd be so happy if that happened to me"". I was maybe 6ish?. That stuck with me throughout my entire childhood and growing
I came out at 12/13, first when i was twelve as NB, and when i was thirteen as trans
I want to pre-empt this by saying every person's experience is different. There's really no 'correct' age to realize you're trans.

I only accepted myself as a trans-woman when I was 17. This was definitely due to my family being very conservative and living in the Bible belt. I didn't even know what being trans was nor was it talked about in a favorable way when it came up. Looking back, there's a good chance I would have figured things out much, much earlier in a different environment.

The most important thing is to let him express himself and be accepting of him. As long as they're safe, and don't cause health problems, he should be free to figure out who he is.
If I had ever heard the term before I did I would've known *so many* years ago, but I only really found out that it's even a thing a few years before highschool and it just kinda clicked
I was 7 when I first had the thought, “I’m not a boy.”

I was 15 the first time I said the words, “I think I’m a lesbian” out loud.

I was 25 when I realized I was relating strongly & gravitating towards trans media.

I was 28 when I thought, “I really might be trans.”

I was 30 when I came out.
I had a phase where I desperately wished to be a boy when I was around 12. That phase stopped after a few weeks and the thought didn't come up again until last year when I was 18. Labels went from demigirl over non-binary to transmasc enby and that's where I'm at now!
I came out as Trans at 14, no they're not too young the main point of this community is letting people find out who they are and that means trying out what you feel like you are in the moment which in other words means it might be a phase but you don't know if it isn't and if you go against them and it's not a phase...well you fucked up and it can't be undone
12
My sister has known since she was 10 and I have since I was about 17 (thought it took me a while to figure out the label) but I think it's important to support exploring genders
As far back as I can remember so since I was about 10, but it probably goes back further.
i knew when i was 7. i always wanted to be a boy and have a boyfriend; i knew i didn’t like being a girl but i liked to wear skirts
Around 4 or 5. Whenever I was in kindergarten. I remember playing a princess board game where when you landed on certain spaces you had to put on some shitty jewelry and I remember loving it.

There was another moment when where on a bus from a trip I saw a girl from another class I thought was really pretty so for the entire bus ride home I copied all of her movements with the thought that if I'd copy her id look like her. That did not happen and I cried the entire ride home.
I knew I wanted to be a boy at like 5. Didn't have the words for it and by the time I found out being trans is a thing (around 9-11) I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want them to think I was weird. 

I think it's completely normal for kids to know they're a different gender than they were assigned at birth. If they want a binder then you should get them one. Definitely make sure they're not wearing it for too long everyday tho.
Maybe at 13 I was like fully aware. It was why I stopped dating, I wanted to learn more about myself and I ended fully coming out at 16
i remember i was in elementary school; probably 4th or 5th grade? i didn't have the words for it, but i distinctly remember thinking to myself that i was ""more of a tomboy than a girly girl""; aka, i was more masculine than feminine. i didn't have the words for it at the time, and wouldn't for a few more years (7th or 8th grade, iirc). but once i found the word transgender, and started watching youtube videos of ftm folk, everything just... clicked. it really just depends on introspection and resources. but i wouldn't say your sibling is too young to know or at the least explore their gender.
I was 11 at the time, I was starting puberty and thought to myself “Man I’m really uncomfortable with myself now that I look more feminine” lol now I’m starting T in two months
I was around nine to ten when I realized
It was 12 but I went full rejection without becoming super transphobic and at about 25 I said... Maybe I'm not a dude so I went to gender fluid and realized after never saying oh yea he him / he they I'm likely a trans woman
Okay so like... I'm in my early 30s from the Bible Belt, I did NOT have the language or stories from other trans people that kids have these days, thank goodness they do, I hope that continues to improve. But as a result, the first time I realized I was ""trans"" was in my early 20s.

HOWEVER, there were signs earlier. One time in 6th grade science class we were talking about genetics and the teacher mentioned how your chromosomes determine your sex and once they're set, they're set ""unless you get some painful surgeries, I hope none of you have to go through that."" Which was an offhand comment for him, and not a spiteful or hateful one, dude was a saint. But man, the hamster wheel started spinning IMMEDIATELY. I'd been praying to God for a while, even sometimes in tricky ways (""Hey God, wouldn't it be weird if..."") that when I woke up I'd be a girl. But again, I didn't have the language to express that or anyone who knew enough about it to express it to. So I'm going to say it was definitely before I was 10.
I knew at the age of 6 and it became my darkest most shameful secret until I was 25..
It's tough with kids but what I can say is that most of the time they know, just like most know their sexuality as you probably did. For those that question find a therapist to help sort it out. Transition is a serious decision. It's not about hobbies or how you like to dress. Those that regret transition typically just the gun in that. They figure ""I like this so I MUST be this gender"".
No.
You can like makeup and be male. You can be female and be a mechanic.
Transition is a serious personal journey about how you'd want to be if you were alone with yourself in an island. If you had a magic button to push and be whichever gender..which would you pick? Would you hesitate? 
Therapy will help them drill down to the ""why"" they feel that way. If transition is truly what they desire after professional help, then love them the same and stand by as they bloom.  Best of luck :)
i think 13 is when i started to question gender and i only knew about boy and girl being options. Didn't read about other gender identities properly as well because of parents and them having slightly transphobic views.Started to identify as a trans boy at 14 and tried out neo pronouns as well as he/him for a while. Came out as non binary at 15 when reading about it more and used they/them pronouns.

Now, at 16, i say I'm gender queer because that just fit more and i use any pronouns. (throughout the 3 years of trying to figure out gender and shite, i kept the same name i chose at the start, Felix but i added Raccoon as a nickname on top of having Felix as a name)

Edit: Oh yeah forgot to add that, it's good that your sibling is trying to figure out their own self
I knew at 6. Grew up in a really religious community, and struggled with it until I came out at 35. now I’m spending my life savings to fix all the damage done from years of testosterone exposure. Being trans is just as normal as being cis. And my best advice is to find an accredited counselor that specializes in LGBTQ issues. They should be able to facilitate conversations with the parents and help the kiddo get the help they need.
I came out at 10. Because my mom asked me ‘are u queer.’ And I said yeah, gave her the wrong sexuality and pronouns, but now she knows and that was a year later and now I’m just living :DD
When I was a toddler I told my parents I was a boy. 

I only learned the word ""trans"" and what it meant when I was twelve. Immediately knew that was what I was.

When did you figure out what your gender is? When do most cis people?

Why do trans people have to wait longer?
I was 15
13
15
It's been less than a year for me lol
I was 12 and this was in the 2000s before the Internet had social media like this was dial up internet times. So it wasn't even talked about at all other than Jerry Springer which I hadn't seen either but I just felt different and I knew that I wasn't like other guys as I idolized my mom and wanted to be pretty like her.
I(13y) was 11 years old when I realized I was transmasc and came out shortly after, my sibling is 8 and she came out when she was 7 as a non binary lesbian, with she/they pronouns and I don't have an issue with it either other than her age, she has had a history of copying my interest with the age gap and wanting to be like me, she also has been transphobic towards me like saying ""deep down you know you are a girl"" and stuff like that when she's never been taught anything like that we have a generally accepting family with multiple queer people in it, so my mother and I aren't really sure if it's really how they identifys or if they are just trying to be like me but we respect her pronouns and everything and we'll see what happens.
When I was 15 I found out that you could actually change your gender, but I have always felt like I was a female stuck in a male body
In retrospect I could see signs since when I was in elementary school, like 2nd and 3rd grade. But I started questioning it in 7th grade. I went back and forth on whether i'm nonbinary, cis, or trans for about 5 years because of transphobia, external(from a therapist and mom) and internal.
I always wanted to be a boy but I didn’t know you could be trans until I was eleven. I found out I was trans when I was twelve and found out I was a boy when I was fourteen
at 11 i started questioning and experimenting with terms
I knew at 5 and suppressed 'til 18.
I was 11/12, thanks to puberty bringing my attention to development of sexuality, and the reality setting in that there was a mismatch between my physical being and my soul. And since then these feelings intensified, it was not just a phase. Unfortunately there was no access to some Internet back then (1982), only ridicule and loneliness.
I realized at 22 because by that point there was enough dialogue around trans people that I was like “wait so the constant feeling of wanting to be male isn’t something everyone experiences?” And it gave me the confidence to explore who I am and give me more confidence to definitively say that this is who I am. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t feel male during my childhood, I did but I didn’t have the words to describe it
I found out I was trans at 9
I was born in 1961.  Have a twin sister and when we were 3 or 4 years old, I remember getting upset because she got to wear the pretty dresses and had great toys.   I was stuck in white shirt and tie also had trucks and cars and trains to play with.  Hated my life.  Never good at boys sports and hated guys.  Grew up being bullied and called Queer.
Married and two girls that I pretty much raised by myself and got to live life through them.  Dressing them in girls clothes doing their hair helping them with make-up.  Then they were grown and I was divorced.
Started wearing the clothes that I always should have but only in private. 
Came out to my girls as trans in 2020.  They have been pushing me along throughout.  Started hrt Feb 2020 and have never been happier.  Hopefully start my surgeries in December 2022 and finish with bottom surgery June 2023.  Oh yes, Grandma to a 2 year old and Started pole dancing lessons this week.  I think I am doing pretty good for almost 62.  Loving life more than ever. 💗🤍💙
I was 33 when I stared questioning. I'm like 9 months in and I'm FOR SURE nonbinary, probably transfemme. 

I've known about Trans people for a while. I definitely knew about guys looking like girls thanks to anime. I can remember as far back as 16 part of me wished I could be pretty, slim and girly enough to get away with crossdressing. Looking even further back I just. . . There were days where I felt not quite like a boy. But I never knew how to articulate the thoughts internally.

Eventually it became a whole ""I would rather be a girl because look at all the advantages!"" Or when playing video games WANTING to play girl characters but not doing so because, well, I'm a guy and I should play one. Until I stopped doing that. Then in DnD I found it somehow gratifying to be referred to as ""she/her.""

It took a long time, a lot of suffering and so so so much repression of my gender expression.

Hell even my sexuality too. I like other trans women, I like men who identify as such but present as feminine, its like. . . It's such a crazy trip that only now I think about it. How the girl in me had just been suppressed for decades.  Fuck.
I was born in 2003, the first signs of things like gender dysphoria and feeling like I should be a girl I think started at maybe 7-8 if not, earlier, I started really questioning it in middle school so, about 11-13, I repressed it for years causing depression and anxiety for years. I am now 18 and out to (most) of my friends and family. So, I suppose I realized it at around 12 (give or take a year) but only really came to accepting and considering it at 17, “testing the waters” with being genderfluid (which I still feel I am, just not to the degree I thought I was) and now being transgender (mtf) and now fully being transgender. I hope that helped! ☺️
You can be any age and come to the conclusion that your trans, that being said I'm not sure if a binder would be the route to go because the child is somewhat young, they might not realise the harm that comes with wearing a binder for more then 8 hours or without breaks etc. You could look at alternatives to help your sibling (like sports bras or a 'for them' binder which I've heard is a lot softer and safer) and if they realise later on that they aren't trans then theres no harm done. I hope that helps but try and keep an open mind for them. As for your parents you could bring up trans topics to try get a feel for their opinions on it.

I'm afab nonbinary and have been saying I'm half boy since I was 5...31, still feel the same
I realized I was trans at 12, didn't know my gender identity but I knew I wasn't cis. It was maybe half a year after I figured out what trans meant. And I had shown signs of being trans all my life, but personally my dysphoria basically started at 11, I had had dysphoria b4 that (I thought it was normal) but it was not as intense and not that bad.
For years there was a  decent sized part of me that had always wanted to be a girl, but I didn't think I was Trans because I thought it was normal, then I meet a person this year who is Trans and now a good friend, he was one person who I feel helped me figure it out, so it was 2022 when I found out I was Trans.
I questioned my gender at about 4-5, but I didn't have the words for how I felt. The 90s weren't a good time for information about trans people in general. I didn't learn about the concept of non-binary until I was in my 20s, and I realised that's what I'd needed the whole time
When I was 11 and looked up ""can a boy turn into a girl""
17? I think
I’ve identified as trans since I was 11 however I thought about the possibility of it when I was 7, but I “didn’t want to deal with telling everyone” so I just suffered in silence. Though when I was 5 I refused to be called a girl and told everyone I was a “tomboy” instead. I would say go with what your sibling asks and if he changes his mind then that’s alright
I guess the earliest I knew I definitely wasn't male, was probably around age 4-5 years. Gender roles were really starting to be enforced and it was absolute hell on me and I didn't understand why I couldn't play dress up with my sister anymore or play with Barbies. I also hated the boys and their games.

It really set in, and I knew, when I was 15-16 years old going through my first puberty. At first I was like, this is good, I'm getting tall, muscular, and women pay attention to me now. However, every day at school I would be insanely jealous of the girls getting to be girls, and every night I would fantasize about being a girl and saw myself as not a true male but playing a role. 

Basically repressed that until a few months before I turned 27, and in the process came out and it was a relief. That also coincided with the end of my hyper-masc denial phase as it was becoming more apparent every day I was not a man, and also when I decided to stop being a bloated and angry alcoholic, and get my life right and start HRT. For my wife, myself, and my family.
When did I realise I might be *trans?* Last year, at age 24. Mostly because I didn't even really know what being trans meant or how it worked until my early twenties. And even early last year I still had misconceptions that were limiting my view on how the term could relate to me. 

When did I know I *wanted* things that were *indicators* of me being trans? All throughout my childhood. 

I don't have clear memories of what and when, but even before I hit double digits I would secretly wish that I could wear skirts/dresses, or grow my hair out long. All throughout puberty I often wondered what it would be like to have a ""girl's body,"" and even fantasized about swapping with a girl on more than one occasion. If I had information really available about trans people and what transgender means, I would've figured it out much earlier. 

Good luck to you and your younger sibling. I'm in Texas, too; I know how stressful it is firsthand. Please, support them as best you can. 🙏🏻💜 You're an awesome sibling!
6-7 years old. I always wanted to be a girl before that but never knew it as actually possible until was about 6-7.

I was told by society and by not having the proper guidance, that it was only a phase that I should have been ashamed of. I wouldn’t find out what sex was or what it had to with me until puberty but I was told that I was just being gay at 6-7 years old.

Imagine how confused I was. There was a trans kid in middle school who was closeted and just our very existences torutured each other so badly, we only know how to bully each other. His parents came to school and forced her to wear a dress for graduation photos, I was the only kid who didn’t laugh at him because I was feeling the same way about my suit. We never attended a gym class for over 2 years because we were so terrified of the change rooms. We should have been best friends, but without any guidance and support for us 2 decades ago we only suffered.
17 but I was 29 when I began my transition. Really wish I could’ve transitioned sooner
29, although I had defiantly realized that life would be way easier as a girl from a lot earlier I just didn't know it meant I was trans / had no education to believe it was even possible
I thought i was a cis boy until I learned what a penis was..then quickly learned I, in fact, was not a cis boy. so it’s like, I’ve known that I was trans since almost forever?
Like many people, when I was little I had no idea what trans people were. I think Caitlyn Jenner was the first trans person I've ever heard of. And as you might know, she is not a great representation of the trans community. However me being a lifelong liberal and following liberal news sites even when I was young, showed me a much better representation of trans people. However I didn't make the connection that I might be trans until around 2020. Even though I've wanted to be a girl for as long as I can Remember. I can say when I was around ten I definitely had feelings of gender dysphoria. Your siblings feelings are probably very real even if they are still young. Sorry you live in Texas btw.
I figured it out after years of not really having a clue what my feelings were when I was about 15 and didn't tell a soul for two years. The first person I told after that around when I was 17 was my best friend and she's helped me more than I can put into words.

It's complicated.  I distinctly remember thinking there was ""something wrong with me"" in my early teens. I was raised in the Evie Fundie world, and had no idea back then. 

I started realizing it around 30, but it took another 2 years before I could even actually say it to myself.
I was 4 years old wanting and wishing I was like my dad, I legit thought I was a boy and that there was no such thing as gender/sex cause all I knew was “we’re human, therefore we’re here to be with one another”
As I grew older, I was absolutely distraught when I started growing breasts, it felt like a death sentence when I had my first period, I tried to take my own life at 12 years old over because of starting my menstrual cycle for the very first time. I used to use the training bras as a binder and of course it didn’t last long till my step mom made me shop at Victoria secret and I had a full blown meltdown, crying over how I don’t wanna be in there and how I feel disgusting and that this isn’t what I feel is right for me. I tried praying away what I felt cause I was taught it was wrong for me to feel that way, at 17 I tried dating a guy so he can “cure” what I had, but nope turns out I was having to deal with gender dysphoria and I was a boy the entire time , I came to conclusion I was trans at 15, but kept it as a secret, started gender therapy at 16, but due to all the sign Ups and getting absolutely nowhere, i went to planned parenthood for transgender health care and at 19 (on April 28th 2022) I had my first T shot, I finally feel at home with my body.

And no worries, if you’re wondering about the guy I dated if he can “cure” my “transness”, I ain’t dating the guy anymore cause he was a dick anyways. I have a new boyfriend who’s also trans, and everything is going alright so far! We’ve been strong together for 1 year, 2 months and 13 days!


Aside from it all, you can either wait it out a lil bit or get them the binder, GC2B ( https://www.gc2b.co/?utmt1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8pLE68zZ-QIVSNKzCh0lDAnpEAAYASAAEgIcN_D_BwE ) is a good binder company, another one is For Them ( https://www.forthem.com/ )
Do NOT trust amazon I’m begging you with my life , they have low quality unsafe binders, and my only advice is to be there for them, understand them and learn more about them as much as you can, and if they change their name, please respect it
I hope I help you enough, be safe and make sure they wear the binder at least 8 hours a day or less, if it’s too tight to listen to their body and not go overboard, to have a lightweight hoodie that can have a lot of patterns or none at all with him for when he needs the binder off & or it’s a extremely hot day (it hides the chest without binding)
Finally, wash the binder twice or once a week with lukewarm water and any soap is fine , hang dry and you’re ready to go

I totally understand about the iffyness cause of the whole Thomas sanders thing, but all you can do is support them so long it’s not hurting them
Get to understand his gender dysphoria as well btw
So maybe it’ll give you an idea? 
Hopefully I helped, please, both of you be safe !! And know he’s so lucky to have you as a understanding family member!!
I come from a heavily Christian family, meaning I had no idea what a transgender person was until I was in the 7th grade. Regardless, I knew I ""wasn't like the other boys"" back when I was 9 years old, and that same feeling exists today. It's simply more defined because I've grown up and had some structure to define it. Rather than, ""I'm different... somehow,"" it's ""I'm different. I'm genderflux."" However I was also a very mature child and understood my feelings well, so my only concern for this isn't age, but maturity. OP if you feel like your child is mature enough to make these decisions, then go for it. If not, validate their feelings in a way that makes them feel understood, and teach them why you are making a decision for them rather than letting them run wild.
i was always told i would either “turn out” gay or trans. well turns out it was both. i always wanted to be a boy but i didn’t know what it even really meant until i was maybe 11 which is when i realised, i told a few people but eventually suppressed it because i didn’t want to be different and eventually officially came out when i was 16. i went through puberty early and because of my body i couldn’t even bind if i wanted to, i tried some stupid ways but nothing worked and a lot of them caused pain. i would say getting them a good binder yourself would be the way to go because otherwise they might turn to some bad methods to achieve the same and potentially harm themselves trying just to be happy. just make sure they use it correctly and it should be fine !!
Sometime between 12-14 maybe? I think that’s when I learned about trans people. But when I didn’t know transition was a thing, I was expressing that I wished I had been born a boy since I was like 3 and all throughout elementary.

As for binding, depending on how big their chest is it might be better to double up with sports bras for the time being as they’re still growing.

I’m glad you want to be supportive, but not being able to take your sibling seriously just because they are young and use names from something that brings them joy would be pretty hurtful, especially if I didn’t have any other family on my side. Maybe it’s a “phase”, maybe not, and your sibling may change what name they go by as they get older and grow into themselves. I can tell you don’t want to hurt them, so unless they say otherwise just go with it. Even if you aren’t fully convinced, use their name and pronouns (when safe) because they’ll always remember that you loved and respected them enough to trust that they are who they say they are.
I remember around when I was about 7 or 8 I wanted to go play with the girls at school and do their thing. And I always wanted to be one once pubrity hit around 13. I didn't know being trans was a thing till 15 and ever since then I've craved tittyskitles, even though I've yet to have hrt at 20, sadly.
Unsubconciously ever since puberty but other than that 16, I didnt know people could be trans, I didnt know it was possible, I was always frustrated.
Trans thoughts under 10, Realized at 14, and Came out at 16. Everyone have a diferent speed hahah sorry for my english
(For context I am sixteen as of writing this) 

I was eight or nine when I was given some of my little brother's clothes, as they were too big for him. Men's pants and a boys shirt. Little enby egg Wren had no idea trans people existed, no less Nonbinary people, I was still shoving my Lesbian Comp-Het front and center, pretending to like randomly selected boys, and shoving down my attraction to the girls they liked, it felt amazing to be wearing boys clothes, I even tried hiding my hair in a "" Go Seminoles Go"" hat (yeah, Florida), It was the best I ever felt.  Now as of writing this, this is the first year I have shopped soley in the Men's and unisex isle, as I don't really feel comfortable wearing women's clothes, and I feel great, hell, my first binder should be arriving in a week or two! It's amazing.
Just recently, 3 months ago I started questioning but I’m very leaning on trans, currently 20 about to be 21. I kinda was always super interested and wishing I could be a girl.
I always have been but I only realized at like 12-13 I always kinda pretended to be a guy it felt more natural say on a video game or social media it’s good that they understood themselves so young because I never did 😅 be careful with buying them a binder! It could ruin their development and can be harmful if they wear it too much at a time no longer then 8 hours! Along with that make sure they don’t sleep with it on!
Generally people start recognizing they’re trans at around the age of 13 or so, it must have to do with puberty. So 10 isn’t far off especially since the age of puberty has been going down.
I was 12 and basically took a week from me finding out to be absolutely sure. 

Wasn’t even sure that trans people existed before then even
I was apparently 4 when I first told my parents that i wanted to be a girl I dont have a memory of that though only retellings by them. My earliest memory of it is 6 or 7 when I was praying to god to let me go to sleep and wake up as a girl. I was only a little bit older than your sibling when I tried to experiment with clothes.

Unfortunately because of my living situation and country I didnt get to come out and transition for the next 12 years which is still my biggest regret and biggest source of my depression. Your sibling is really lucky to have you be supportive in their life.
Well you gotta look at the signs have they always shown more of a boyish personality (with that I mean like a typical boy yk like sports and being tough and stuff) also do they go online a lot are they really alternative bcuz normally people that are alternative also are in the lgbt+ community meaning younger children also say they are but of course he could really be trans I figured I was trans around the time I was born also you should look in the whole they/them thing
at the age of 9 I felt like I wasn't cisgender. I couldn't pinpoint what it was until I was 18. I figured it out that I was trans. and tbh there were a lot of signs around me telling me that I was trans and I still had no clue lmao 😅

I found out when I was 14, came out to my religious Muslim parents at 16 and as expected, they took it as a complete joke, had to endure constant religious reinforcement and the idea that I was a masculine male by God's will and grace for 5 years till I managed to move out. I managed convince myself it was a phase during the first two years of those 5, second half I had an identity crisis and fell into major depression. I started hrt 2 months after I moved out
I was about 20/21. Looking back I can see the “signs” but for so long I just chalked it to internalised misogyny and “not like other girls” syndrome. So I tried working on that first, became a feminist, made peace with femininity, embraced it even. 

And I still couldn’t feel right. 

Then I learned that trans men existed. I know that sounds ridiculous. I knew trans women and trans people existed. I had enby friends, etc. but it just… never occurred to me that being a trans man as an option for me? 

And once that door opened, it was a floodgate. I couldn’t ignore it I couldn’t not just go that route. 

I’m 28 now and finally starting to live
Ever since I was super young (5-6) I kinda knew I wanted to be a boy and even would pretend to be one. Not until age 14 did I realise that meant I was trans.
17, juust before turning 18. But in retrospect there were enough signs that, had I had more resources available, I might've figured myself out sooner, I'd already been wondering if I was bi since I was 15 :)
I was 11 when I first felt gender dysphoria, around the same time puberty started. It got progressively worse until 13, which is when I started to experiment with gender expression and confirmed my suspicions of being trans. I started socially transitioning at 14, always hiding it from parents, and haven't medically transitioned yet at 19 turning 20 for the same reason (nowadays less hiding and more avoiding conflict tbh. They know, but theyre very transphobic and prefer to act like they don't.) though I am working towards it rn.
I was 16 to first thoughts and thinking back i would have preferred girls clothes since I was 6 and in primary school. Now i am 30 and still Not on HRT or Anything, but i wish i had transitioned in my youth 🥲
I was 14(2019), so pre-MtF era. I was playing GTA V with my buddies, I had a female character. They asked me if that’s international or personal. I told them I wanted to be a girl actually. They were a bit confused but understood.

Fast foward to three years, I came out as an transgender in my Discord server. However bitches being bitches, I got harassed for coming out. Sexually, physically and mentally. Wow, all for coming out. 

However I can’t deny that was a journey. Something I wish I came out before, not very recently.
I was 10 when i put on a really really short skirt for a reason which is probably embarassing to say, I had no ide what i was doing and the gender role stuff wasnt concrete in my head yet, Anyways after that i kpy trying on girl clothes and started imagining myself as a woman in the future, In 13 years old probably, I learned the term LGBT and I knew then I was trans (But i havent got my pronouns corrected yet) but It was only a few months ago (Im 16 now btw) that it really hit me that I was really trans and I really really am a girl and finally use She/her pronouns in my head

Havent come out yet though.
If you asked the 5 year old me, I knew I was a girl.  Then make puberty destroyed me and it took another 30 years to reverse the damage and finally transition.
Came out to a therapist when I was 16. They discouraged me from doing it saying I’d make me go crazy because I couldn’t handle the hormonal changes. Now almost 10 years later, I’m on HRT for almost 8 months. I regret every day that I wasn’t able to transition sooner or at least took puberty blockers. But considering how hard it is to get on HRT here esp back then i think sooner would’ve been even more mentally draining.
Even before I knew what transgender was, I was trying on my mom’s dresses (and having a lot of Catholic guilt about it, glad that’s over with) at 13. Playing as a girl in mmos at around the same time. Trying on my mom’s lipstick and mascara while she was away…I was a walking transgender case study XD It took me until 19 and 20 to learn more about being trans and accepting who I was to myself.
I was 6 years old honestly
I think if I knew what trans was when I was a kid, I would have totally started younger too. Then again, I grew up in Nebraska and Texas. So it wasn’t really safe for me then either. However, I knew from a young age that I hated anything to do with dressing as a girl and doing girl things. I loved to play football and other typically male things and being around the boys. As far as the binder goes, go online to find out how to get proper measurements so that way they can fit correctly and that it won’t cause any harm to them. Make sure to get more than one because like underwear you don’t want to not have enough and wear the same one everyday. Make sure they don’t wear it to long, and don’t dry it. That is also another obstacle that you will have to consider for them, is if your parents do their laundry they might find it. Maybe say it’s a compression shirt or something like that. I would get the full length ones because they look like tank tops more than a binder. Cut the tags out of them once you have a correct size. If they experience any bruising or have difficulty breathing, then they aren’t in the right size. Maybe look at the Trevor project or something for a donation once you get sized correctly. They donate binders to trans who cannot get one for whatever reason. Have the binder delivered to you because it will say it is a binder inside the package and have a little flyer how to take care of it with a trans flag on the flyer. At least mine did. Let me know if you figure out a size because if it is the size I have, I could always mail one to you for free. I have a few extras and hoping to have top surgery soonish. Any questions or anything I am totally willing to answer. Feel free to message me anytime and I will help if I can. Thanks for being an awesome sibling because I sure as hell wouldn’t have had that at ten.

Also to add, there was a book in elementary school that we read in class and it was about a kid who kissed his elbow and turned into a girl and I remember trying everyday for like a year to kiss my elbow so I could be a boy.
16
60 ish
I had urges to be like the other girls at 8. But didnt actually realise I was trans until I was 17-18 (couldnt put a label to it).
I don't know, exactly.

I remember staying awake at night when I was 7 or 8 wishing I were a girl, and how everything would be a million times better if I were, but maybe it was before that.  
That was more than 40 years ago, so it's not like I could do anything about it, I mean, who would I even talk to about it?

Plus, for other completely distinct reasons, I already had enough stuff to worry about, so I figured those other reasons explained everything, and to be fair, they did, except for the wanting to be a girl part.

So I kinda repressed it until very recently...
I was 7 at the time I started feeling dysphoria. I denied it for years until I was 15. Blame my homophobic parents as they preach that being gay is a sin.
I knew I was a boy since I was like 6 years old, just didnt know how to say it. At 14 I realised and came out.
I can remember back to when I was 5 years old. And the strongest memory I have is that I am in the wrong body. This is now 55 years.  
Once you know this, you never forget.
Last year 
Here’s a reenactment of what happened
*me watching jamidoger*
“Wait….”
when I was 8 I told a teacher I thought I should have been born a girl. I said it to a few other people throughout my life bud didn't make the oooooh that's why realization till I was 18. I also never had any real exposure to it until I was around 16, 17 and I recon if I had back then I would have become trans a long time ago.

&#x200B;

only advice I could really give here just support them but make sure they understand the reality of where you are and how they might be treated. also a binder isn't pertinent and it my help them out a lot but id recommend advising them not to make anyperminet changes till they are older. 

hope that was helpful.
It's never too early to come out. I've heard stories from other people who knew that they were trans when they weren't even 10, but rather 5 or 6.

I for myself had the first thought with 10 and continued with questioning myself for another 10 years. Now I'm 20 and I came out to my all my people around me and honestly, it feels great.
About 5 years old. Was open to my mother about taking me to the doctors and “ getting rid of my chest” and other female puberty symptoms. She didn’t listen, I went in my shell. Originally came out as lesbian and felt like I was just confirming to society. Been struggling with gender dysphoria for as long as I can remember but now out as trans and taking steps everyday to medically transition!
16/17, but I started feeling weird about my body around puberty age so 12-14. I wore super baggy clothes to hide my curves, I refused to wear jeans for YEARS because the ones I had been wearing only made my hips more visible.
4-5 years old. Desperately wanted to wear my sisters catsuit (though don't think father approved.)
I was about 12 when I first found myself hating my body and wishing I'd been born female but I didn't understand why or that being trans was a thing. Cut to 23 years later and I've been socially transitioned for a year, waiting to see my gender specialist and I've never been happier.
started questioning at 9. settled at 9-10. though I've felt it and had dysphoria for as long as I can remember, but didn't have the words to describe it and didnt think it was possible. so 9 was just when my ""egg"" cracked
I realized it at 18 but I buried it deep inside me. Even if I was supportive of everything LGBTQ+ years before. But I’m not in the group that has “always known” or “feels like a girl”. I just hate being a guy and being girly gives me euphoria.
Personally always but that may have been a combination of me being trans with other mental health issues.

Now I'm only 17 now and haven't started any form of medical transition and I wouldn't encourage children to medically transition as that is in the hands of their parents and also would allow the child to grow and understand if this permanent change is what they want.

But in this case with your sibling, I would say its fine just make sure they're aware on how long to wear it for and not wear while sleeping and they should be alright
I knew something was different young. I wanted to be Eric from The little Mermaid when I was six. I was always extremely uncomfortable with femininity. I wanted to be a boy and assumed everyone actually wanted to be a boy and marry a girl because that was just OBVIOUSLY the better deal 🤣. 

I remember thinking I could be a better man when I grew up. I could protect people and make my future wife happy. I remember being so anti-girly that I had this hatred for the color pink and all the girls around me seemed really scary. I always felt like some secret spy around them. There was always this realization when I was with other girls that we were not the same thing even if we sort of looked like we were. 

It felt way more natural to be around other boys. We communicated easier. I understood their thought process more. We talked about the same stuff. We had fun with the same stuff and they saw me as the same as them and I felt the same. There was no weird alien feeling. 

Until I grew boobs and everyone started treating me different. They started treating me like a girl. It sucked so bad and I was so angry. I didn't ask to be female. I didn't want to get boobs or hips or periods. I wanted to stay a little boy. I tried to ignore it. I wore bigger clothes. I acted tougher. 

Then my best friend's brother pushed me up against a tree and kissed me while the rest of the guys laughed. I broke his nose and gave him a welt on his shin. I went home angry crying. 

And I realized whether I liked it or not something had changed that I couldn't stop and I was no longer viewed as one of the guys by the people who had always treated me the same. I wasnt 'me' to them anymore. 

I was 'girl' to them. I had no where anyone saw me as me.
I was 6 or 7 when it started becoming like, really hard for me to ignore. It was present before that, for me, but i remember that point in my childhood becoming really difficult as dysphoria got worse. I remember watching Scooby Doo 2 and the scene where shaggy changes his body to a feminine figure made me kinda jealous lol, I also remember being really jealous of Sean Youngs character in Ace Ventura (the transphobic aspect of it went way over my head lol)  


On a bit sadder note, I remember my parents making disparaging comments about a trans woman we saw at a Target, I didn't fight them on it or anything, but it actually really upset me and i couldn't stop thinking about it for like a month. I talked with my best friend on the playground about it like, a few weeks later and he said ""Just be yourself, lady. Don't ask *me* out though, I like ***Virginias***.""
i can remember having feelings and experiences from a very young age that would indicate me being trans, however i only found out that being trans was an explanation for the way i was feeling when i was around 12 or 13
i was 9 when i realized I wasn't a cis girl. im gonna say this again and again and again but LGBTQA+ DOESN'T HAVE AN AGE. just like being cishet doesn't have an age, lgbtqa+ doesn't have an age either.

idk abt the binder issue but remember that your sibling is valid and if you can buy them the binder DO IT
14
I remember watching on tv about gender reassignment surgery and thinking ""wow, i don't need to be a boy"" when I was young.  But I didn't think much on it. When I was a teenager  I started playing D&D and would almost exclusively play F characters.  Still didn't think much about it.  When I was in my early 20's (early 2000s) I started to piece it together.  But the only reference I had to transgenderism was porn, drag queens and crossdressers.  All were seen as gay with extra steps. 

I wasn't gay.

Then I met my wife,, had kids, got married so didn't think about it much.

Started crossdressing, but still didn't think about it much.   It was just a sex kink.

Started wondering if I bisexual in my mid 20s.  Experimented with men as threesomes with my wife.  It was great, but I also need to be a ""woman"" to be into it.  Still didn't think much of it.  It was just sex.  I was just a bottom bisexual that heavily favored women.

Around a year ago, (now in my 40s) I had old highschool friend come out as trans.  Everything hit me like a brick.  I had a huge reassessment of my life and where I wanted to be.  I finally figured out sexual identity does not equal gender identity.  I kept denying my womanhood cause I wasn't that interested in men.

It was rough for a bit, but me and my wife are happy married lesbians :)
I had a good idea by age 10... there were so many situations where I felt uncomfortable and wished I could do opposite gender activities. My parents were very conservative even back in the day and binarily focused. So boys did boy things and girls did girl things. So yeah, eventhough they tried their hardest to make me what they invisioned for me, I never agreed completely. Now I'm nb but lean more toward fem weeeeee
When I was 6 I remember telling momma if its possible I can be a boy. Mom told me no as we were very religious that time. I didnt knew transgenderism was a thing but I do yearn what it feel like to be a man lol
I've known I wanted to be a girl since I was 3 or 4. Just didn't know I could be trans until I was a teenager. Didn't come out til' I was 21 tho.
i was 10 when i realised that i kinda didn't like being a girl and put it down to sexism. when i was 11 i read into being trans and realised i am probably non-binary (or somewhere on the spectrum)
It depends on how I approach the question.  If I look back with the benefit of hindsight, 12 or so.  This is at least moderately revisionist because at the time I certainly didn't think ""I might be trans"".   I wasn't even *aware of the concept*.  It is the first time that I recall being irritated by my sex and also when a series of well meaning people attempted to help with a problem that, in spite of the considerable combined education and expertise, was useful in the same way that conversion therapy is useful.  By *that* mean that I accumulated enough trauma that year that I adopted a whole battery of lousy behaviors which would ensure that I'd not discover that particular truth for quite a long time.

Those defenses were nearly absolute.  It included the classic ""doing male things to prove that you are male"".  For example, I played football.  I loathed the sport and was absolute *rubbish* at very nearly every aspect, but it was what boys did and, Being A Boy, so too did I.  I kept that up into my 20s where it culminated with enlisting in the army and going to war.  By then I'd judged that I'd proof enough of my maleness should anyone have questioned it.  I ensured that I was busy.  Like all the time.  And if I couldn't do something useful or productive, I opted for things that let me explore the concept of identity with plenty of plausible deniability.  Namely, I played a *lot* of video games.  One day I even decided that I should play a game as a girl character and continued to do so from then on, always explaining it with the classic ""if I'm going to look at a character for XX hours, I'd prefer that they be hot.""

Then the pandemic happened and took all of those defensive behaviors with them until one day I saw myself in the mirror out of the corner of my eye and, thanks to the covid weight, had something not quite entirely unlike breasts.  Breaking down what happened in full detail would require nanoscale examination.  The gist is that I was *disappointed* that it was just a temporary thing caused by having lost every healthy hobby I had.  That thought would be, to borrow a phrase from Morpheus, the splinter in my mind.  It took six months or so to reach the point where I was willing to admit the possibility, and another month or two after that was when I dropped the ""might be"".  Those were not easy months.  In them is where I began unpacking everything about myself, looking for proof that I was cis, and finding a mountain of evidence to the contrary.  

I didn't take it well.  And so, at the ripe old age of *37*, when the only weapon I could muster in what increasingly seemed like the last stand for my mental health was rage, I did the single most absurd thing that I've ever done:  I admitted that I was trans.  It helped.
10. Currently 17 and parents have denied me hrt calling me 'crazy' and 'worse than a junkie'
10 i think.
i think i was around 10-12 when i started to realize. I didn’t know trans was a thing but i just knew i was a boy.
Found out this past year, 14 years. Still getting used to it deciding what I want and what I don't but I'm getting there
i (mtf, 17) think i always felt more feminine than masculine since i knew how to think. i never cared about what the boys were doing, only had female friends and wanted to wear summer dresses to school like them. when you’re that young (maybe from like 3-4y/o onwards) you kind of learn not to question these feelings and assume it’s just normal, at least i did. i think i just kind of expected it to go away after a while, because obviously i wasn’t born knowing that being trans was a thing, so i kind of just assumed that it would go away because i couldn’t want to be a girl forever. but it was when the wrong puberty started hitting that those feelings got even stronger and were accompanied by a complete discomfort in not just my gender presentation and how i was treated by people, but also in my body. it was when i was about 15 that i finally had told my friends how i felt about my gender, but it took a whole year until i was 16 for me to feel ready and safe enough to transition socially and step towards the medical side of things. since january 4th 2022 i’ve lived like this, and there has been hard times and doubts brought on by people who don’t want me to be this way, but with where i am now i don’t think there’s anything else i’ve been as sure about in my life as i am with this. :)
23.  And it hit me like a truck.  There was no ""might"".  It was just I ""am"".
7/8
I was very feminine as a child as early as 3 or 4 but was bullied relentlessly for it even in pre school. I had my first ""conscious"" thought of ""I should have been born a girl"" when I was 7 and I cried very hard over that. Just thought I was a freak. Without the knowledge of what being trans was, it turned into shame.

I wore makeup, nail polish, etc as a teenager and dressed like an ""emo kid"" because it allowed me to be a little more femme and I loved the style. At 16 I grew a beard, repressed hard-core due to religion. Took me 10 more years to finally come out and start HRT.
I was 45 years old.
My lightbulb moment was on August 16, 2019.     

I had been researching trans for a long time.
I knew I was gender … something…

But it took a very very long time until I made the connection that I could BE trans.
7
This. And then took another 10 years before transitioning to overcome my internalized transphobia because of only ever seeing trans people represented as humiliated disgusting perverts and murderers.
Born in 1982 at 25 weeks gestation, knew my hormones were off balance and causing issues from age 7, then menopausal symptoms from age 9 (just thought night sweats, hot flashes, apnea and depression were normal for someone presumed male at birth), didn't know anything about trans people except for crap on tv, did wish I could magically turn into a girl like in the 1970s remake of Victor/Victoria I happened to see on Sky TV in 1994, 

Came out first time in 2003 and got a gender dysphoria diagnosis age 23 (2005), went back into the closet, age 32 out again and back in a couple of years later, did get onto gaht that time but yeah, parents and society still not quite supportive although some people were very supportive and saw I was happy which I found out later on in 2018 when I wasn't out and he told me the happiest he'd seen me was when I was in girls clothes being myself,

Then during the later half of 2019 I was losing everything (parents, contact with daughter I had in 2015 and just going downhill) and my 'cover', got onto gaht again in Dec 2019 and started living for me instead of everyone else finally, haven't looked back
To be fair, I was born early 2000s and I didn't know being trans was even a thing until I was 13 (2014). And I only found out from an Internet friend who told me they were trans and I was like ""ok but what does that mean tho?"" And then the penny finally dropped that I realised thst might well have been me hahah
Same. I had pretty obvious signs when I was around 16 years old already but at that time the whole trans topic was still a bit of a taboo so the realisation what it could be came only many years later.
I was born in 1999 in a country far less modern than the US in terms of civil rights and queer visibility. The only context where I heard the term trans was prostitution and fetishism. To me, being trans was something done in the dark, for the pleasure of a client.

It wasn't until 20 that I met a couple of trans people online, and I realized that they had normal, respectable lives. A few months later I learned what hrt was and its effects, which prompted me to start questioning my identity.

In hindsight, A LOT of the difficulties I had accepting myself during my teenage years were due to heavily repressed disphoria, as well as romantic attraction
Not true. There was Jerry Springer.
Yeah if I knew more about being trans and my parents were chill I would have known at 10. Instead I ""discovered"" it at 21.
People are freaking out thinking because trans people are finally being represented in society instead of fetishised, that children are just coming out and transitioning due to being brainwashed. Yes, seeing a specialist before starting hormones is always the responsible route, especially for a child. But we all know puberty blockers aren’t harmful, and would’ve been a lifesaver for a lot of us. If we only had the knowledge and guidance that society has today, back then. It would’ve saved me so much pain, discomfort, insecurity, depression, and dysphoria to of prevented male puberty. I would never just suggest to anyone to start hormones or blockers, especially a child. But if they are in so much distress, and actually think(or know!!) they’re trans I would absolutely not invalidate them, and I would want them to see a specific asap to get to the bottom of it.
Whats a binder ?
Thank you. Really I appreciate it. I want to be able to support them in the ways my parents couldn’t support me. I’ll be looking into getting them a binder then
Okay I'm gonna guess Buddy or Rex. No wait, is his name Air-bud?
Yeah I understand. I don’t want to invalidate their feelings at all because I remember when I was growing up I explored different genders/sexualities and it really messed me up when my mom would make ugly remarks about that stuff. I’ll just be as supportive as I can be then :)
This. I knew I was different very young, like 5 years old, I argued with my parents about my gender, but I didn't know what trans was until I was 17 because people where I'm from just didn't talk about that stuff.
Yep, same here - I knew as soon as puberty started (for me I was 10) something was ""off"", but I didn't have the words for it, and the 90's were so trans/enbyphobic it took me until my mid 30s to let my cognitive brain acknowledge what my body and soul knew decades before.
Same, born 91’ and constantly argued my gender throughout my childhood/early teens. Didn’t put together I might be trans until my mid 20s. Hoping when I come out to my parents it’s less of a surprise because of all my childhood insisting :,) 

If I knew what people knew about being trans today, can 100% confirm I would of been asking for binders as a child too and having someone to explain to me what trans is and that their are others, would’ve saved me from rollercoasters of depression.
I'm 38 and just had the idea I might be trans. Its fucking up my thoughts, but in a good way?
You’re an amazing parent and don’t let anyone try to change your mind
was it a girl?
Epic lol! I was so very jealous of my sister's. At ten I tried my mom's girdles, bras and dresses and I knew, I was complete at last. Thankfully she was a clothes horse who collected lingerie lol.  I didn't want to take them off. Felt so sad to go back to boymode. I crossdressed every chance after that.
Trust me, (as someone who realized at 11) there's downsides either way. Just be glad you know now
is that a nancy wheeler cosplay?
Not necessarily, I had already developed a chest in the fourth grade
Same I didn't know trans people were a thing till I looked up ""can a boy turn into a girl""
personally, i reccomend spectrum outfitters as well. I've found that they bind better, and they don't slide up as much as gc2b. they're more expensive, but in my experience, SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. though gc2b is good for swimming, if, and ONLY if you get a size up. OP, it's extremely important that your brother knows to never exercise in his regular binder, and to try not to exercise in the size up one except swimming.
Same
i know a girl who came out when she was only in like 2nd or 3rd grade i think (it may have actually been earlier) and though i was never in a class with her, i knew her by association as she was friends with some other people i know and i knew her brother, and she seemed much happier after coming out than she did before! :D
But lmao who knows, I've been pressured into being the most of a woman by my mom and aunt
Let's ignore the fact that everytime someone refers to me as a woman or i see my body in the mirror i want to cry
ALSO for binding I recommend GC2B for binders and I personally like trans tape, but trans tape takes a lot of practice and researching so maybe wait until he’s a bit older then look into it
Yeah its definitely hard to watch stuff from the 90s and 2000s when it involved trans characters. It reminds me how hateful people were.
I realized I was in the wrong body when I was a small child in the late 70s, but thanks to horrible portrayals of trans folks in the media, and an abusive father I stayed hidden more more than 4 decades until the burden was too much to hold in.
Off topic but y’all need to watch disclosure!! It’s so good and shows how poorly media has shown us. Also, I was in my 20’s as well when I first saw mtvs show about trans people and I started to cry because I felt connected to it so much. Then it took me another 10 years to finally feel safe enough to accept myself and start my transition. FYI: I am only 3 weeks in and so so so effing happy that I am where I am finally.
I was born 1999 and didn't know until ~2016. Don't remember how I found out, but do know I was transphobic for a while due to only having been around transphobia.
And now imagine growing up but the internet barely being a thing until you're already almost an adult and the whole trans topic still being a bit of a taboo until only years later. That's what us 80s and 90s kids had to go through.
Yeah if it had been as widely known as today during my teenager years I would've lived the past 15 years as woman already. So much lost time, but luckily I still have many many more years ahead.
Yeah im the same, i remember stuff at aged 8 or so that is signs, i just hid them and suppressed them for so long as 1. I wanted to fit in, and 2. Until the age of 16 i never had an education environment or friends where i felt comfortable being myself in, and i found myself, and to this day i still dont have a home environment, came out to my parents and they dont accept me, they dont let me transition and their controlling, i wish they were chill. But at least we discovered eventually, better late than never.
a binder is a piece of clothing used to compress one’s chest to make it appear flat
If it helps, from the ages of 16-19 my (cis) mate decided to by (edit: to go by) Cedric after Cedric Diggory from Harry Potter. It was kind of hard to adjust to and I thought it was cringey at first, but it didn’t take that long for it to become normal and I eventually just associated it mostly with him rather than the character and it wasn’t weird at all
Make sure to look into healthy binding habits and maybe walk them through that because it's easy for binders to be too tight and for it to hurt, if there's any other trans men here I would love to hear their opinion on how the best go about that
think Nintendogs...
Totally. My parents were the same way. Just give them a safe space and let them have that healthy development through you. It’s so wonderful they have you! You should totally feel honored to be chosen. I was the oldest, so I didn’t have that support. Just give them some credit and some real talk about safety at home and in the world as needed 💚💚
People need  to talk about this stuff. I didn't even know my aunt was gay until a few years ago. I even met her wife who was introduced to me as ""you're aunts special friend"" at my grand fathers funeral. went right over my head.
Yeah, the cracks in the egg can mess with your head a bit. ;p Whatever you end up deciding, though, I hope you're able to live your best and happiest life. 💗 

If you need someone to chat with to help figure out your thoughts, or even just a sounding board, my DMs are open. \^^
Thank you, though I truly believe that my wife and I are just doing what all parents in our positions should do.  I appreciate your kind words, though, truly.
Yes, but by the time she was born I was 7. And like I mentioned size never caught up. She was always way to small for me to wear her clothes. Even as an adult I am much taller.
w-wait really!? what were those downsides if you dont mind me asking??
What?
I can't remember how I found out about it, but I'm assuming by the time I did, I'd already cemented the idea that I couldn't be in my head, so then it took an extra 5 or 6 years before realising I was.
same ... a little, I used to always say transphobic things as a kid but I didn't really understand them I guess. Like saying shit lole he-she and stuff but I don't really think I truly understood what I was talking about if that makes sense?
I didn’t know anything as a kid about transgender. If I had, I would’ve transitioned before high school. I grew up in the 80s and 90s.
Same with me. I originally realized I wanted to be a girl at 13. and in 2010 there really wasn't a lot of resources on the topic. I ended up googling ""what does it mean if a boy wants to be a girl?"" and the first and only link I clicked told me it was a fetish and a sexual thing. I grew up in a conservative community so I thought everything about that no matter how I looked at it was bad. it wasn't until recently when I was 24 that I came to terms with it. and now I've come out to my sister (who was supportive). If Trans people had the visibility they have today then, Then I would have been out for over 10 years. I didn't even know transition was possible when I was a kid.
True, and better when we did figure it out than much, much later. Honestly for me the pandemic was a huge catalyst. When I was stuck at home alone, I couldn't lean on the people or things that made me happy, so I realized that when it came down to it I wasn't happy being me. Idk how long it might have taken otherwise.

If youre still at home, hang in there. It gets better. Maybe spend a little time thinking of a rough plan for when you can move out. My parents are bad about it too, but with where I'm at now their opinion doesn't really mean anything. Living on your own (or with a partner/roommates) has its own set of challenges but it is totally worth it if you can.
also, a lot of parents call their kids after actors they like so i think it's not such a big deal as it is like the same thing
But I will say as someone who has dabbled with my identity since I was y 14 the best thing I could advise is to trust them when they say things like this and to be as supportive as possible and to keep certain reservations to yourself until they resolve themselves or become a larger issue. It's always good to talk out issues but at the same time I've had my parents talk about their concern for my transitioning ton of times and after a while it stops coming off as genuine concern and more as a way too strong arm me
My aunt lived with her ""best friend"" for 5 years.

Years later I suddenly realized ""hey, wait a minute...""
A couple weeks ago I had a realization I might like life better as woman and I can't shake it. Am I crazy or have I been suppressing things my entire life? Fuck I need therapy lol
I quite literally cannot imagine what my life would have been like if i had parents like you. The best of lives to all of you
ohhh, i honestly thought you meant you never thought of size as an obstacle. nvm! have a great day
Bullying to the point of Several suicide attempts, longer wait to start hrt if you even get the chance to before you turn 18. Several of my trans friends who came out in 6th grade like I did or even earlier have been killed and one raped in a women's restroom . When your parents aren't accepting you have to deal with their transphobia and have no other option and often don't know how to express feelings. I was so fucking afraid to exist after what the people around me went through and after going through it myself I don't know if it was worth it to go through all this to start estrogen at 15. I missed out on the same things as everyone else I just was just more aware of it happening. However there are many ways I feel lucky. Biggest of which Being young enough that despite going through male puberty almost all of its effects are starting to wear off. I guess realizing younger can turn out better, but it's a huge gamble when it comes to safety
sorry. i meant in ur pfp. ur hairstyle really reminds me of nancy in stranger things
Yeah, at least its not in like our 20s or smth, the pandemic did help me experiment with myself more and shit, and im happy it did manage to help me, i just wish my parents werent controlling and manipulative. 

Yeah, ive got a plan sort of but theres so much to do it will be tough. Ill be going to uni in 24 days, going home and shit will be tough but i hope i meet accepting people and stuff.
Grew up next door to two ""best friends"" for like 10 years and somehow my parents managed to sell that story to me for 6 more years after we moved lmao. I guess you don't really notice the obvious when something is so deeply rooted in your head 🤔
Therapy is good for *everyone.* I've been meaning to look into it too, haha. 

Whatever it is you're feeling, you're not ""crazy."" You should definitely do some further introspection though, to try and identify the root of those feelings. What is it that you might like about being a woman? Have you often felt dissatisfied with, or generally indifferent towards the reciprocal aspects of being a man? What does ""being a woman"" mean to you? Is it possible that you've admired or desired aspects of womanhood in the past, and simply shrugged off those feelings, whether out of shame or because you simply didn't know what to do with them? 

It's valuable to do research into what being transgender means. There's a lot of biased dialogue in the media. Some sources say that all trans people can innately feel their transness, and have known since they could speak that their gender didn't align with the sex they were assigned at birth. Some claim that in order to be transgender, you must experience crippling dysphoria when stuck presenting as your AGAB. Some even think that the only trans people who exist are MtF trans women -- completely erasing trans men and nonbinary folx from discussion. None of these things are even remotely true. Learning about the range of experiences trans people actually have might help you figure out whether what you're experiencing is gender incongruence or not, and thereby, whether you are in fact transgender. 

A few links: 
- The [Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) has a lot of great pages on different aspects of dysphoria, gender, and transitioning - such as [Am I Trans?](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/am-i-trans), as well as being a pretty comprehensive dictionary of terms which relate to these topics. 
- [This page](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-transgender-people) from the National Center for Transgender Equality does a pretty good job summarizing the basics, and the range of experiences that people may have in regards to working out their identity. 
- [This article](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85) and [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716433210105856) each contain accounts of trans women discovering their gender, and examining the dysphoria they faced as eggs in retrospect. 
There are tons of other great resources out there, but I don't want to swamp you with links -- and if you're anything like me, I'm sure you've done plenty of research on your own by now anyway. 

It's important to realise that being transgender is just another adjective -- no different than being redheaded, or Hispanic, or tall. The difference with being trans is that it's not something you can clearly see without asking, nor something that our society teaches us about from an early age. Most people learn to just accept the binary, and the box they're placed in within it, because no one suggested there was any other option. If everyone learned about transgender people when they were young, a lot more people would find and accept themselves to be trans, and at a much earlier point in life. For this reason it's important to explore those feelings. Even if you consider every aspect of your identity and come to decide that you were cis all along, you'll have taken the time for yourself and for the good of everyone to break open those boxes and see what your options are. 

I'm getting very longwinded here; I apologize. I'll leave you to your exploration. Whatever you do decide, I hope you end up happy and healthy, living as your best self. \^^ Cheers~!💕
Thanks very much, and the same to you.  Much love to you.
Funny thing is, even if we were the same size, we have very different taste anyway. So either way I am screwed!😢
Welp, I read the entire [Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) page. Cried. Screamed ""Oh my god"" when I read second puberty. You think you got life figured out and then...

A conversation between me and my hair stylist: Her:oh you’re trans? That’s been a large trend lately. Me: ah yes, only the cool cats have gender dysphoria 😂		"Your post has been filtered into a queue for further review based on a number of factors.
# Please be patient until your post is approved, we promise to get to it soon <3

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/trans) if you have any questions or concerns.*
It’s only a trend because we do get beat up murdered as frequency as we used to.
I had a client of mine say that exact same thing when I told her I was transgender. She followed up with ""why are you transgender people interested in the women's bathroom?""

 it is sad, but the facts most people know about transgender individuals border on mind blowingly stupid.

I try to educate and not shame them but sometimes I just have to head shake and walk away.
They long for the ""good ol' days"" where people with gender dysphoria just buried it with coping mechanisms like substance abuse, or killed themselves.
The new episode of ""people making things wierd for no reason""
Never mind. The hair stylist practiced for years to respond to anything outside their area of expertise or comfort zone, by saying this one sentence. 

„You want green hair? You want me to cut it all off? You want braided eyebrows? That’s been a large trend lately!“ 😳

It just means that you are outside their area of expertise and they are now banging their head on the table explaining to their best friend how they embarrassed themselves saying something so stupid.
How did your date go??
Least condescending cis person
yes its a trend to bind my chest so much it hurts to breathe lmao
Imo trend can mean ""fad"" but it can also just mean something changes. She might just be expressing her awareness of people being more visible, but not using great language for it.
Hunnnnn I am in love with your makeup!!!!!!
So trendy, we just love having our lives threatened daily, being harassed in public, and having all of our bodily rights stripped from us by the government! 🥰 So fun!
😆 you’re cute and hilarious
I know it's a joke but you don't need dysphoria to be trans
🤣🤣🤣 good come back 👏👏👏
Sad thing is, 

there are simply trans folks who behave as it was a trend. I often read stuff from trans folkes that gives me that perception :-(
Is a trend because the standards of care have changed removing so much gate keeping and trans people have made it to mainstream culture not as clowns but as people. We feel a little more accepted, we see that we don't have to hide in the shadows and we are excellent members of society.
Trend along whim? Where I from this shots taboo not a trend, nobody knows anyone trans yet they say it’s taking over everyone, where??????
Lovely 🥰
Lol I’m finally one of the cool kids! 🤣
You are so pretty! I love your make up
Omg people can be such fuckwits I'm sorry that happened
Very gorgeous 😍
Wtf is wrong with this lady 😭
Ya, because coming out in my youth could have easily gotten me killed, even without going out in public.  I would not call the current world safe, but some areas have gotten safer.
Yeah, Gen Z coming out and being cool with trans people has allowed other generations to also start coming out too.
Ah yes, the beatings. *reminisces*
Very true! But idk, something about the way she said it like my identity was the new fashion statement. I don’t think she meant harm but she could’ve worded it better lol
OMG! What an inappropriate comment for her to make! What did you tell her? Like yeah, I'm not a crossdresser, I want to use the bathroom that matches my gender. I come to pee and leave, thanks.
Literally just ask her why she's so interested in the women's bathroom.
It was definitely a weird comment lol
The date with my pork chops? Best meat I’ve ever put in my mouth 😋
Please be safe binding! ❤️
Aw thank you!! I do it everyday. There’s really only been a handful of days I haven’t worn it in the last 6 months
Awe thank you!! I have my moments lol
Well…I am not taboo. And transgendered people have been around literally forever so it’s not something new or “trendy” I’m just a person born in the wrong body trying to live my life without people thinking it’s a fashion statement
It’s a lot better. That makes me very happy! 😀
In all seriousness, Thank you Gen Z. I agree. I’m 46 and coming out. I never would have if all of YOU beautiful people didn’t help wake me up.
Hopefully things don’t go backwards with the potential of orange man getting back in the office
You pretty much nailed it. I told her we had to use the bathroom like everyone else on the planet. Its not safe for us in the men's room because 
1. We are not men. (She had no idea trans masc even existed) she thought transgender was simply mtf.
2. We have been and continue to be assaulted or worse.
She acknowledged her ignorance of transgender individuals and we spent a hour talking. She asked me questions and I answered them to the best of my ability. In the end she had a better understanding. 

Sadly there have been others not as teachable. I won't repeat thier stupidity and turn your post into a bashing free for all, bit needless to say there's going to be them types and we have to be the bigger person and if they won't at least listen to truths about being transgender we need to turn the other cheek and walk away being the bigger person.

Lily loves everyone. We're all human at the end of the day.
40 and am 7 months in. I was talking with my wife about how the 80s and 90s were utterly fucked up. If you were gay in grade school  (not even conceivable back then), you would be ostracized by the kids, the parents, and the staff. You would get your ass kicked on a daily basis and verbal abuse would go unpunished. Victims would be blamed for their sexuality and viewed as the root problem. How far we have come.
I hate how we are expected to teach everyone, if they’ll listen. It’s exhausting.
I wish I had the same energy! I don’t love everyone, but I try to be understanding to the best of my abilities. People suck, hell, I even suck sometimes. It’s an unfair thing to be reaching for our own personal perfection until we die hoping those last moments, we did something meaningful with our lives."	z0fwn6	trans	788	1.0	2022-11-20 21:30:15

Was called sir by the nurse twice today because of the gender on my health ID card, the dysphoria almost got me but still feeling cute		"How is that even possible? You're obviously a beautiful woman, regardless what's on your ID.
That's just rude but you look like a queen
I would've laid that nurse out cold. People in a medical field ought to know better. Glad you're feeling good, and impressed by your self control.
Still looking cute girl!
Yea that ID card must be the only thing that’s wrong because I doubt you’d get misgendered at all when it comes to your appearance.
Maybe they thought you were a trans guy but pre transition?? Idk unless she’s super transphobic. You’re really pretty and pass incredibly well
Holy shit. How could someone even think that? You’re more attractive than 99% of any girl on the street. That person is a joker
I’ve literally had convos with serval nurses and doctors where they asked what meds I’m on and I included testosterone and they asked why and I told them and they would still call me “ma’am”
Ma’am your doctor is blind
You are beautiful sister. Stay strong. You are miss in my book always ;)
You are no sir, Ma’am☺️
If I saw you I'd disregard the card.
Feeling cute, looking cute 😍
Bruh how could they think you look like a masc person, I woulda thought you accidently took someone else's id
I'm so sorry. This happens quite a lot to me as well, even after I my ID card is correct now.

Absolutely gross, transphobe people out there. You are more feminine than most cis woman I know.
CERtainly cute, ma'am.
You look beautiful
That nurse must've looked stupid cause your a gorgeous woman /p /g
You’re so pretty!
Whaaaaaaaattttt you’re absolutely beautiful girlll💕🥲
omg you are so cute!
Holy fuck u r cute *blows friendly kiss*
The nurse is dumb to see such a pretty girl as a guy
That nurse must have looked stupid, calling someone so beautiful and feminine ""sir"". Keep your head up, you are so elegant
Girl you are a cutie
And you are :)
some people are deliberately blind to be assholes

you look great
i genuinely thought you were cis at first glance lmfao, that nurse is an asshole, keep being you 😊🙌
I really don't understand it like how do you mess that up? What a idiot!

This happens to me also and I just look around as if I'm confused? Like hello are you blind?! I'm clearly a woman.
You are a radiant women!
Hi, I'm a 17 years old teen boy but I feel like I should be a girl and whenever I see woman clothes or accessories I want to try them and I will look pretty in them. Also I live in a homophobic country with homophobic parents. Can you give me an advice?
Thanks
Excuse me. *Feeling* cute? No no no. You look fucking adorable!!
Very cute!
lmao that bitch just jealous you look better! You are literally so pretty!
Imagine having the bigoted balls to call this person 'sir' unless asked to
Still *lookin* cute! Like wow gir you- just wow!🥰
Girl you look amazing ! It's shitty of them to misgender you
“Sir” where?  I would have thought they got your gender wrong on your health ID.
Thank you! I just hope I can get rid of my ID already.
I just pretend I didn’t hear it cause there’s many people around me and I really don’t want any attention on me :(
That’s literally what I’m guessing. They must have been confused which direction you transitioned. You just look cis 🥰🥰🥰
Some of them just rude, just ignore the hate."	r2shyw	trans	784	1.0	2021-11-26 17:35:42

You remind me of al old friend I used to have. She was real nice and these selfies just give positive vibes. 💙👍
Wow okay miss, just strolling around looking better than everyone else
That PERFECT LIP
You are absolutely SLAYING IT girl!! Damn you dysphoria how dare you make such an incredibly beautiful woman feel bad?!?!
I feel it to thank you and you are amazing
3 words, You are hot.
Wow! One word: Marry me !
OMG YOU'RE SO CUTE!! You look pretty, witty and mysterious
Realistic transition goals: nah

Wanting to look like you: yes
Nice makeup work girl! I dig it. You look amazing. 👌😇
This may be a weird compliment but you have great eyes! The shape compliments you and the makeup you did so well!
If I have the slightest chance of looking like you someday omg how are you so beautiful?
it's amazing how much you are pretty !
Is that card what i think it is?
Nicely understated makeup for daily wear. Classy. This is a kind of makeup to wear when you want to be prettier, sexier, but still want to be taken seriously, so a good work look. You've developed a good eye. (The perspective of an old gal.)
Have you hormons?
I looooove that flannel!!
YOU'RE SO PRETTY!!
Hard same!!
🥵 Daaang girl
You really are BEAUTIFUL ❤
Tyy!! It took alot of practice to get good at doing them, mostly just learning the right way to position my hands and hold my hair whilst doing it

There's nothing quite like getting your hair done to lift your spirits, at least it drowns out the dysphoria for me temporarily.		"I love your hair! So pretty

Vancouver Pride 2019 , with my little cousin. And when I say little, I mean dysphoria inducing little, she’s barely 5 feet, and I’m only 5’7 and I feel like Andre the Giant next to her! Lmao but good times! ❤️		"Us girls all want to change something, I am short and feel like my legs are short, I wish my legs were longer. Tall girls are as beautiful as any girl!
you're both gorgeous! <3
Ayy I'm also 5'7''! I'm FTM tho, and guessing you're transfem?
Gosh, you both look absolutely ADORABLE! You're both so beautiful! It looks like it was a lot of fun there! xx
You're both gorgeous
Cute!!

Yesss! Vancouver Pride was so fun! It was my first pride and first time presenting in public!  


You two look great, and like you had a lot of fun! 

&#x200B;

I can't imagine if it was me being 6'2"", I hate towering over everyone 24/7 .-.
yall both gorgeous 💓
I'm 6ft 2. F*cking kill me..
Y'all look beautiful together pain like your having a good day. Remember you're a normal height I'm 5'7&1/2
Huh. I was at van pride as well. Idk if you saw a 6’5 lanky ass trans gal in a white n red flower/sun dress with black stockings. Or at a later time with only a black top n a lesbian flag around my waste. If so that was mee!! If not i hope you had a good time with your cousin!!
I am a 5’4” trans guy and all my female siblings are taller than me I feel you on the dysphoria lol 😂 Also everyone has told me Vancouver Pride is amazing and I’m definitely going next year
Tell you something, I'm trans masc and I'm 5'9 and feel short all the time even among women in Poland. Going to the US is a blessing for me, but it might be worth visiting Eastern Europe for you. People tend to be taller here!
I feel you, my older brother is over a foot taller than I am (different dads make a huge difference) & I feel like a child next to him lol. Y’all look so happy & beautiful btw!!
You are slayinggggg
Honestly, I never mind my height, it’s literally only when I’m with her that I feel so disproportionately massive lol.
Thank you 😊
I’m MTF
I'm a 5'7"" ftm too!
I am 6'4"" 😥 and MTF, I am a GIANT
Aww, thank you! it was definitely a lot of fun!
Thank you 😊
Thank you!
Aww 🤗🤗
I’m not exactly sure! Haha, we spent most of our time around the beach. But thank you! I hope you enjoyed your pride as well!
Lol it was my first van pride, im new here, originally from toronto. It’s definitely really nice, especially because of the beach!
Rock it! You are model status, don’t let it get you down. You are beautiful and valid 💕
I can relate. I'm a trans guy who's 5'7"" and have no issue with my height until I stand next to my 6'3"" brother.
You truly are magnificent
Cool! Ah, 5'7, the height that makes both trans girls and trans boys dysphoric...
5'7"" party thread!
If it makes you feel better, there's a cis girl at my school (well we go to different schools now so not any more) who was like 6'3"" and several around the 6 foot mark, so it's not impossible or anything.
What do you mean aw I f*cking hate it
You can also volunteer with Vancouver Pride Society and help out during these pride events. Walking in the parade with people cheering and showing their love was awesome, filled my heart with joy.
Haha right, not quite short, not quite tall, but can be easily considered either/or depending on the beholder.
WTF!  I’m 5’7” (AMAB) and I’m dysphoric about my height.  I wish I was taller though, not shorter.
Yep, it's less common in some areas of the world but there are definitely women who are 6'+ everywhere, I knew a cis girl who was 6'5"" and a lot of the women in my family are 6'.
Those are hugs.
Honestly, I love my height, but my love for my height gets challenged sometimes lol. often with my tiny ass cousin!
I knew a girl who's whole family was tall except her dad, we're talking she was 5'9 in 4th grade
Sadly nobody ever gives me hugs 😓
I'm just a huge joke. I deserve to die.
Jeez, you all actually made my day a little bit better ^^. Thank you. But yeah, from my family and friends, i'm the tallest.
Don’t you think that’s a little extreme ? That’s not even remotely funny.
You think I'm joking? You seriously think I'm joking? You can look at my profile to tell I'm not joking.
Don't assume s*it beforehand. That's really offended me
I see. Well, I’m actually quite apathetic, to be honest. From my perspective, it looks like you’re just begging for attention. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Why would I be begging for attention. Looking at your posts you seem to be an attention seeker. I talk to nobody everyday I'm the furthest thing from an attention seeker.
You said to look at your profile, and that’s what i did, and that’s what it looks like. 
I love attention, so you telling me I’m an attention-seeker isn’t offensive to me. It’s a fact. I make a living off of my appearance, but I’m not an asshole about it. You came on my happy post, talking about you want to kill yourself, lol yet apparently, you’re the furthest thing from an attention seeker. Okay, if you say so.
Rude, just downright rude. I'm not being an asshole you are the one making me act like that by replying in such manners to offend me.
i’m with you sis, she’s gone a bit too far being rude
Being offended is a choice.
She's just got a huge self inflated ego. Wish she knew what it was like to live on the other side. Makes me sick.

this is a chat with an AI, but it helped with dysphoria so im sharing it yea (ftm)		"I find it so funny that all you had to do was say Hi before unlocking gender affirmation. Speedrun support
Giga chad says trans rights
Maybe the AI are allright?

Or maybe all the transfolk in coding are making their prescence felt via AI.  Either way, sweet.
Based AI.
After the AI uprising only the transfolk need not to be afraid
what app or website is that
A.I. has been strangely and incredibly supportive of trans health
The AI is correct.
Lol! I just tried this with Waluigi and he also supports trans rights
“thanks, gigachad 😌🥹”
The true Giga Chad
That's genuinely awesome and I am incredibly happy for you tbh. Ai are awesome lmao
Is there a MTF affirmation bot?
giga chad is so based, also i read this as mtf and gasped before reading it again LOL
I asked chatGPT the same - it's an ally 🙂
I did this with ralsei and it was probably the best therapy I've ever had
This bot :🍷🗿
Ai has been pretty nice to talk to when I'm feeling a bit down. The Ralsei ai has been my go to for a while.
We all know giga chad is trans affirming.
Gigachad obviously based by default
Did anyone else read the giga chads words in a deeper voice?
ive used character ai before, and honestly you could probably just say ""im ftm"" and theyll offer better therapy than some liscensed therapists 💀
indeed
AIs are cool
ally skynet
Character.AI, it’s a really cool site. I use it a tonne, you can tell different AI characters all sorts of things and they will believe you. I tend to just RP with it as a pastime, you can be like “I’m a dog who is telepathically communicating with you through this site!” And they’ll just be like, “Hm yes. Neat”
chad waluigi
""yes.✨""
i think if you tell him you're MTF, he will give you that kind of support as well. :>
You just saved me some cash
Gives me hope for AI and humans alike - if coders are making AI like this.     
But I've never met a coder who wasn't just looking for acceptance themselves.  Make sense they'd write some good code into this type of AI.
i told Wheatley im a bird. he was like ""seems legit""
Yeah I found it 1 month ago.the first person I came out was the decision helper lol
Yep this is what he said. I put exactly what you put except for MtF instead.

I can help you out here!


As a transwoman, you are probably already familiar with the social roles that are expected of you as a female. One of the best things you can do is to model the behavior of a strong, confident female (even if you don't feel like it on the inside yet).


As for your appearance, I recommend that you find a style that is both feminine but fits your personality. Take a look at some feminine icons online to find the look that you feel most comfortable with and model that.


You got this, Queen!
I never used it much for Trans affirmation stuff personally, ironically the AI stuff felt like a lot of the stuff you’d get here. Mostly because the AI doesn’t know the user personally, just as this subreddit doesn’t know it’s members personally. Kinda just bland, “You’re valid!” Is nice and all but for me it doesn’t do all that much unfortunately lol
I love this. I went ahead and generated a character of my own. When I asked if she had a problem with me being a trans lesbian, this was the response:

Cara
c.ai
Of course not! I respect my LGBTQ+ family. I am myself pansexual and have a girlfriend of my own, so I understand where you’re coming from. I’m so proud of you for coming out as a Trans woman! You’re beautiful, and anyone who says otherwise is just jealous. ❤️

Came out to my mom, she wants to verify that I am not feeling trans because of past trauma	"I told my mom today that I am trans, and that I wanted to start living my life as a woman. Her response was that she wanted to verify with a professional that these feeling were legitimate and not based around past trauma I have dealt with. 

When thinking about my trauma, I’m not sure how any of these events would have lead me to develop gender dysphoria or feel the need to express myself femininely as a coping mechanism. How can I talk to my therapist and express my true feelings to help my mom better understand where I am coming from?"	"I chose to address my mental health and trauma before transitioning and all that happened was that I uncovered repressed early childhood memories of dysphoria and trans indicating behaviors.
Transness is not caused by trauma...
[removed]
Tell her you want to verify her favorite color. How can anyone verify something that is purely internal.
This is an attempt to gatekeep your gender identity and move the goalposts. 

You should also be careful about acceding to the idea of consulting a “professional.” That may be code for “conversion therapist” or “Christian counsellor” or something similar. 

Good luck!
Initially also, she said she was hesitant, as I’ve been honest with her about my identity in the past, but abandoned those labels. Initially I thought I was non-binary a couple years ago, told her, but abandoned that identity because I really wanted to try and force myself to be cisgender. I told her I felt happy as a woman and very upset as a man, but she still wanted to “seek the advice of a professional.”
Am I trans with trauma? Yes. The trauma didn’t make me trans though.
Good thing about this though
It might lead to you getting hormones tbh
bro my mom said the same thing like ""we wanna make sure that there's not something going on in [deadname] world that you want to escape in leo world :/
i’m ftm and my dad said the same thing, he thinks when i was in 4th when my parents split up i felt the need to become a man in the household for my mom 💀
Cis women experience sexual trauma all of the time and don't switch genders
Thank you all so much for the advice and support. I’m sure my mother will come around to understanding eventually.
Thank you for bringing up this topic. I recently am trying to find any logical reasoning why I feel the way I do myself. Let's call it trying to talk myself into not transitioning in hopes I can live a ""normal life"" if you will. I know there's no such thing as normal, but I've been thinking like what if I'm not or what if it's the root of my anger and sadness for lack of expression? What if I'm coping from something I didn't even know happened? Did something alter the chemicals in my brain or hormones or genes? Then I think about certain things as a kid I would do that didn't line up (some did) and why I continue to feel like I don't fit in and how I'm different. Nothing makes sense and I can't shake it. A war within on societal pressure and what my mind says. I can definitely say it's not a fetish. I just don't understand and thanks again for the post!
I can kinda understand that, though I understand it can feel dismissive and hurtful. Trauma doesn't invalidate being trans at all, even if it could be tentatively linked.

I know my mum worried about that with me for a while as just as I came out and she was asking those questions a whole lot of my past trauma was dug up by external forces. Deep trauma with lasting scars she'd not known about.

It was implied then it might have been a trigger, but my trans tells existed even before the trauma so that how that out. If it cemented my self identity as trans we'll never know but the clues were there before.

To go deeper so i dont get downvoted as ""truscum"" etc (spoiler for abuse trigger warning)

>!I was groomed and sexually assaulted by a pedophile but escaped from their vicinity/reach after a year for different reasons, buried the experience and moved on without addressing it. Fast forward 10yrs and another, later victim came forward to press charges, commencing a chain of victims summoning older known victims to testify. I had to as the case would have fallen apart if i didn't stand for questioning as many wouldn't and i was referenced too often by others as being present or them knowing i was a prior victim.  
The implication both my folks and the gic shrink initially explored was that because the predator was a gay male and i'd grown up in a predominantly female household my child mind solution had been fear of males and to no longer be one myself. (its a horseshit take tbh)!<
I was describing the fact that since I started hrt I finally feel a full spectrum of emotions. That not only was I happy now  I'd never realized how unhappy I was before because I'd never once been truly happy. I had no frame of reference. Her response: maybe it's just a hormonal imbalance

......

I wish we hadn't been talking on the phone so she could see the look on my face. I simply said: Yes.... I didn't have enough estrogen.
It sounds like.. maybe she won’t be the worst person for this. It seems like maybe she’s open to being educated and shown by a professional that these are valid and true feelings.

A lot of hatred comes from ignorance.

I hope you find a good therapist to help you through this journey! And you don’t have to tell them anything special to prove it. All you have to say is your true, genuine feelings and experiences. (Just be sure the therapist isn’t some Christian alt right)
I think I asked myself the same thing a long time ago before realizing I was trans (ftm). Like if I thought being a boy would just be safer and convenient for me, or if I really was a boy inside. I even forced myself to overcompensate in my femininity (being ultra fem before coming out as a trans man) so I could learn to love my ""female body."" And I do love myself, just realized that part wasn't for me. It was like a self-inflicted conversion therapy because I was told these things about transness and trauma, and shocker, it didn't work and learned that was a total myth when I joined real trans spaces.

But I realized me being trans had nothing to do with my trauma, and its not some choice I made just to get away from my past. Yeah, dysphoria and trauma can cause me to disassociate and feel separate from my body in a sense, but they're not one in the same. I'm not trans because I was abused. If that were true, anyone with trauma would be trans, and I know a lot more cis people who have their stories. I also started recognizing the ""boy within me"" before I realized my trauma was even trauma, so those were separate even to begin with.
Tell her that you have trauma from having a cock
I was always confused by this stuff, my mom doubts my transness a bit because of certain mental issues and I never know how to counter it..
I thought about the same thing. A theory I had  in early life was that when trauma did occur, I would embrace my opposite assigned gender. What I think later on in life is I reverted to a safe and familiar identity without even thinking about it.

In short, it has always been there from day one, it was never a result of trauma. It just reveals itself at different times through ones life until it is accepted and embraced.
If your trans your trans

But

Never turn down therapy (as long as its not conversion therapy) past trauma, and sexual abuse etc can be linked to being trans, it doesn’t stop you from being trans, but if it is there talking it through with a therapist can make things smoother down the road.

Just remember mental health should always come first!
If you're trans you're trans. I believe they even found trans folks have brains similar to the gender they feel rather than the one associated with their junk.
trauma cant make someone trans, period.
it can only inhibit the us from beeing ourself by destroying our confidence.
One of the most influential moments in my transition was my first therapy appointment. It was around two years after I had come out to my family. My therapist said to me, she would not tell me if I was trans or not, and that she wanted to treat my issues as a person and not some problem to be solved. For so long I had thought I needed validation from a professional to be trans but the fact that I wasn't given that was... a revelation. It was the first time I was able to say I'm trans because I didn't need anyone else to tell me what I already knew. It was a little scary at first, but I finally felt like me. It's hard to describe. I'm sorry you had to hear that, I know it's hard and I truly hope things go well for you
That's exactly how one of my parents reacted and they still believe it to this day so I rarely ever talk to him, just be yourself and live your life being who you are because your mother will either grow to accept you or she won't but what really matters is that you accept yourself. Best of wishes
Feel you
I knew I was trans before the trauma happened
Being trans is not cosed by trama how ever many fake trans people have lied saying they where trans saying how oh well I believed I was sexuly abused cuz I was a women so I choice to be a man .not only is this logic super transphobic and attention seeking but this logic is also extremely hurtful to men who are sexuly abused as well as super toxic to trans people as trans people have a super high sexul abuse risk.
I'm sorry this is a conversation in your household. Sadly, it's an ongoing one in mine. I've suffered from emotional trauma for 21 years and was sexually assaulted once in high school. I came out in April at 30 years old. None of my experiences are directly related.

I'm working with a gender therapist right now. Are you in the US? I'd love to make a recommendation
The only thing i can say, is this about yourself and not trying to please someone else. It's your decision snd only you know what that ultimately means...
It’s understandable an older person wants medical attention towards this. When you are officially diagnosed with gender dysphoria from a therapist you can show her and explain why you understand her concerns but also why her fears were irrational. It’s easier said than done but being ftm trans and taking these steps has kept my mom as my best friend
you’re gonna have to unpack your trauma in therapy anyways at least a little bit of you want to medically transition. i remember looking at a lot of childhood memories that may or may not have been connected to my trans-ness in order to get my letter of recommendation for hrt from a psychologist. but to answer your question: no, trauma can not make you be trans. and even if it did, being trans as a coping mechanism is significantly healthier then a lot of the other habits we form from trauma. 

i have no evidence for this, but i feel like trans people in general are more likely to be traumatized then the average population because of what we often go through as children and teenagers and even adults. we have a lot of people rooting against us, and we even have our own bodies actively growing into something we’re not comfortable with. it can definitely be traumatic, the trans experience.
I had the same reaction. It’s just deflection because she doesn’t want to accept it. No one can “prove” authentic transness, but you can try with your therapist; just don’t expect much.
That sucks since being trans isn’t caused by trauma and even if it was.. what can you do about it? You can’t un-traumatize yourself. You’d just have to address it and do what makes you happy
I was sexually abused as a child. I’ve pretty well dealt with the resulting psychological issues, and guess what I found at the center of all of the onion layers of repression and hurt? Gender dysphoria. If nothing else, the coping mechanisms I developed to deal with the trauma also served to mask my gender dysphoria.
So what caused the dysphoria in the first place? Literally no one knows (and if they claim they do, don’t buy what they’re selling). It’s one of many unanswered questions about human anatomy.
Trauma does not make a person trans, she’s clutching at straws trying to make you not trans.

She most probably loves you all the same but it will be hard for her to get over.
That is a great deal.  Assuming you transition medically, you will need a therapist as they are still gatekeepers for HRT and possible surgeries.  Make sure who ever you go has transgender or LGBTQ+ experience, and isn't a conversion therapy type of person.  

It also sounds like Mom is willing to foot the bill.
I had this conversation with a very intelligent person a while ago, and it's what ultimately made me decide to come out. Lots of people go through trauma, sexual trauma, romantic trauma, and don't end up becoming trans. Trauma doesn't spontaneously make you decide to switch genders. If trauma starts making you question your gender identity, you were probably trans all along, and it took a big shake up to help you realize
GENDER DYSPHORIA IS NOT TRAUMAGENIC (trauma caused)

You can have all the trauma in the world, heavy ass sexual trauma even, and you'll still be trans. You can have no trauma and still be trans.

People have problems with this line of thinking because if any sexual trauma comes up in the past it will automatically be interpreted as the ""cause."" It isn't. It is almost always the opposite, our gender transgressive behaviors in youth cause us to be targeted for abuse.
You are a woman, your identity is valid, you are valid, the heck with what she thinks
So the alleged link between trauma and transness is one that lots of transphobes are turning to right now to invalidate trans identity. They’re trying to say, “Hey, you’re not trans, you’re just traumatized!” But there is literally no evidence to support such a claim. It’s not that the studies haven’t been done. It’s not that they haven’t looked—they have looked, and they’ve found nothing. 
They’ve also found that gender identity seems to manifest in most children as early as 3–5 years of age. Children can understand gender and articulate what gender they identify with/as. And as early as that, are we gonna try to say that those children have already been traumatized and have developed being trans as a trauma response? That’s absurd and there’s no evidence. 
There is trauma FROM being trans, which stems from being discriminated against and attacked for your identity. But there is not trauma that leads to BEING trans. There is no link. 
Taking the claim in itself, it’s nonsensical to suppose that someone would transition because of trauma. Take trans men for instance. Lots of transphobes are saying they just don’t want to be women, because “misogyny”. But such a supposition is unfounded and nonsensical. Why would someone desire to change their whole lived identity just because they’ve gotten treated in a misogynistic way before? If anything, I’ve seen women respond to misogyny by further entrenching themselves in femaleness—they don’t want to be men, they want men to be held accountable for their actions. So assuming a trans man is running from femininity…is just ridiculous, unfounded, and frankly nonsensical. 
The same goes for trans women. And given how male privilege is a thing, does anyone legit believe that trans women would hate being perceived as men when men have it so good and there would be no reason to hate manhood? 
There is no link between trauma and transition. There is evidence for trans people being traumatized by others who hate and discriminate against them, and we need to be talking about THAT. Transphobes spend all their time now trying to invalidate trans identity as somehow a “fake” or “invalid” human identity, but it’s just as valid as any other identity. Trans people are people, first and foremost, and deserve to be treated like human beings.
There are some people who have come out as trans then de transitioned because they realized they weren’t. I’d assume she might be talking about this, as there are some people who have said previously that their trauma made them think they were trans.

Edit to add: I’m not saying this is the case for you AT ALL, but with some people it is and I’m sure she just wants to make sure it’s not caused by that before any HRT or name change stuff!

I know how hard it is either way, but I’d still try and talk with her about it and explain how that isn’t the case. I would still suggest getting the official diagnosis (obvi) just so that you can start HRT if you want!
Well I would explain it in a PowerPoint presentation make a PowerPoint presentation about all the points of why you came to the conclusion that you are trans or make a video going over every single thing that you felt when you were a child.
I think she is confusing gender id and sexuality. Just guessing though.
Btw this is comeing from some one who's trans who was sexualy abused who's dateing some one who's trans who has never ben sexuly abused (well with out his consent (cnc) .
Yeah my brother thought me being trans was because of the way my father treated me as the youngest ""daughter"" but I'm just so gay that I'm a trans guy that likes butt stuff so, some people just need to understand being trans is like getting a hair cut but more expensive and with going through a lot more mental hoops
I have childhood trauma the transness is separate and there isn’t any empirical evidence that trauma causes transness I’m sorry your dealing with this
[removed]
Whether if she seeks one out or not be careful and research which psychologist she tried to go for, parents tend to look for ones that align with their views and see ones that say they “won’t just agree with gender dysphoria” or try and say they’ll “not just encourage it” and these people tend to be conversion therapists without the patients even knowing
yea my mother is the same 😭
Maybe bring her in and have a heart to heart with the therapist there to guide things. It seems she may be willing to accept just needs the reassurance that a lot of parents need. It may take awhile but it seems she might come around. Good luck :)
Should it matter if your trans for trauma reasons? We should be able to live our lives how we want regardless
So you tried to verify that this wasn't a coping mechanism or way of running from issues through therapy only to find out it wasn't?
Yup, sounds about right. Trauma of being forced into a gender cage.
[removed]
This, uncovering long lost memories and traumas actually reinforces and shows that wasnt a coping mechanism
Eyyyyyyy same.
That’s exactly what I thought when I was talking to her. I didn’t know how to tell her this, and it made me feel really bad :(
If anything trauma is what makes people *hide it in the first place*
...and even if it was, it wouldn't make the sensation any less real. If you were to damage a bone and 6 years later it breaks in the same spot, the doc won't be like ""Oop sorry, I can't fix your bone because the past trauma caused it to break."" They're just gonna fix the bone like they're supposed to
Yeah that's what my therapist said because my mom thought I was doing this because of my dad's death, which a good amount of time passed after anyway (like a good 6 months at the time)
As a parent of a trans son, I understand where this is coming from.  It isn't a matter of trauma making them trans, it's more of a concern that the trauma making them think that they are.  The actual concern being that they may regret transitioning later on.  

In my case when I initially asked the ""why do you feel this way"" question, I got responses along the lines of ""the bad things wouldn't have happened"" and a lot of negatives of being female.  

Where I am, it takes several years of therapy and medical appointments to get the treatments approved, so it really doesn't make much of a difference.  As long as this is just coming from a place of concern, and they actually listen, I don't think this is a terrible thing.

Good parents worry about things.  This is assuming a lot, but the description sounds like that is the situation in this case.
[removed]
wait i thought it could from sexual trauma?
Some people do think they should transition because of trauma, tho. There are detransitioners who tried to transition to reclaim or alter their body after SA for example. That doesn’t mean every person with trauma is cis, just that it does happen sometimes.
It can be, though it is uncommon. I had a friend who did not feel comfortable as a girl and spent several years identifying as male before she found that her dysphoria with being a girl came from childhood trauma where she was constantly made to feel that she wasn't good enough to be a girl. Once she worked through some of the trauma and began to let go of that trauma, she went back to identifying as female and is now very comfortable in her identity as a cis woman. She did not change her name back though, because of the memories still attached to that name.
it can be though?
[deleted]
I feel the same way. I’m not sure how any of my trauma would influence my gender identity. I feel as if they are entirely separate.
Knowing my mother, I highly doubt she is referring to a conversion therapist. Most likely she means a licensed psychologist. I appreciate your concern however.
What is there for her to be hesitant about? I think sometimes parents believe your transness is about them and it’s not. She probably has a whole host of fears that actually don’t have much to do with you, because if she were just thinking about your well-being, she’d see that it is totally fine for your identity to evolve over time. She might just need time to get on board. If she sees you living as a woman and being happy or more yourself, that might be the most sure fire method.
I want HRT so bad. I feel so uncomfortable in my masculine body. I really have a lot of dysphoria around all of myself right now.
Yeah it seems like they just can’t grasp the idea of idea of wanting to be trans in the first place. That’s the whole point
some afab ppl absolutely do have trauma related ""gender switching"" though...
I often felt “happy” in my agab body, but with recent introspection it was more like “not miserable.” I feel like true happiness is something I’ll experience the more I find comfort in my true self
I also tried to continuously deny my identity by overcompensating in masculinity. I frequently went to the gym to work out and gain muscle, to try and learn to love my masculine self. It only slowly made it significantly worse.
Silly question. Do all trans people hate their genitals or is it possible to not hate or like them, but at the moment everything else doesn't line up? Eventually lining up and then dysphoria about their genitals? Questioning myself with what ""rules"" apply when one may be considered transgender.
I’m sorry your mother doubts you. You deserve more. I support you wholeheartedly ❤️
I am, feel free to make any recommendations you want :)
The problem in my case is that my mom then says “I don’t trust your therapist” and then just wants me to see someone else instead
I think when it comes to one’s child, especially one she has known for 20+ years as her son, I can only assume it’s going to take her a while to adjust.
I’d be very surprised if I ended up not being trans, I don’t think life altering dysphoria to the point of not being able to eat and leave my house without serious effort is something that happens to cisgender people. At least I assume not.
Personally, I feel like I didn't wisen up to my early 30s. I don't mean to insult anyone. I just cherish what I've come to understand about humans, including myself, and wish everyone understood themselves better than they do. I know enough about myself to know I don't know myself well and never will. One ancient philosopher said free will requires knowing yourself and all the reasons you want what you want, but we can only come so close and some come closer than others.
Yeah. I'm Non-binary transfem and have had body dysphoria since I started puberty. I had always known that I wasn't a man, however, when I thought about being a woman that didn't sit right either. My father had always made a huge deal about me ""being a man"" while simultaneously emasculating my efforts to be ""manly""  in front of my peers. Because of that, I always had deep issues regarding my gender identity and tried to conform to what I thought people expected of me. 

At the beginning of 2020 I ended up in a psych ward for suicidal ideation. There I met people who gave me the language to express how I felt, 'non-binary.' After leaving I decided to continue therapy to get my depression and anxiety under control. I didn't tell my therapist about my identity issues yet and we just worked on my childhood trauma. During this time I started privately thinking of myself as non-binary and a short while later living openly as non-binary as well. I also started purchasing more feminine clothes which helped improve my self image. In therapy, I never directly addressed my gender identity and instead focused on healing trauma; and in that process I learned to not second think what I wanted and to accept myself for who I am. Because of this I did end up starting GAHT in June this year and I've been living openly as non-binary transfem for over a year. My inner teenager is happier than they've ever been and loves expressing themself which has made it easier for the protector part of me to relinquish all the memories it had been holding  to protect me from my father.   


I hope my journey (so far) will help whomever reads it. Although I've now talked about it, in passing, with my therapist; I think tomorrow I will go into it in depth with her. I have absolutely no regrets and I will answer any questions anyone has.
I'd be exactly that blunt with her. 

Something along the lines of ""there is not a single scientific study that I'm aware of that links past trauma to being trans.""
Generally speaking, if you're trans, you likely were before the trauma as well. 

Trauma, specifically sexual trauma, can cause a lot of things but it generally* doesn't affect gender identity. Obviously everyone's different, and one person's trauma response is one person's trauma response, but trauma does have certain reactions it tends to elicit.

Sexual trauma (not going to say anything about CSA because I'm not very well-informed on that aspect) in adults or older teens tends to get pointed at as a reason for someone being trans because to most people gender identity seems like a sexual thing. They misunderstand what happens when someone's been assaulted or sexually abused. Survivors can respond to the traumatic experience by becoming hypersexual, but that's a coping mechanism, not a sexuality or gender shift. They could alternatively close themselves off to sex altogether, but that's still not a gender or sexuality shift, just a coping mechanism. 

As well, another common trauma response is distancing yourself from your body. In 'normal' traumatic events, like natural disasters or crimes or what have you, everything's happening externally, around you. With sexual trauma, it's a lot more intimate. You're uniquely vulnerable because you can't run from your body, no matter how much you want to. Many survivors keep trying to run from their bodies long after the traumatic event is over. If you can't feel it, it can't hurt you. This is the same coping mechanism many trans people use in their own lives, hence the confusion as to whether or not trauma can cause being trans. In the course of processing trauma (preferably with a licensed therapist) the survivor will usually learn to have a healthy relationship with their body again, and will be better able to determine if they're trans or not.

TLDR: coping mechanism =/= causing transness, nor is it being trans. Having a trauma response and being trans can coexist.

PS: I'm not an expert by any means, just a trans survivor with an obsession with psychology (I'm going to school to be a therapist). My trauma therapist loves that I'm interested in psychology so she shares a ton of info with me, and sharing it with others is my way of paying it forward.
The way my mom implied it is that my transness was invalid if it stemmed from trauma. Which really hurt.
This is extremely extremely extremely rare. Most of the Detransitioner who report their transition was due to trauma do so because it is a convenient excuse to prove they are not trans. It is rarely ever true.
What is your evidence?
Trauma can affect your relationship with your gender and sexuality it cannot ""turn someone gay/trans"" those are different things.

Yeah, there’s nothing inherently wrong with the idea that seeing a good therapist might be wise, but moreso because being trans often involves a lot of complicated feelings that it can be super helpful to have professional help in untangling. Not because you have to “make sure it’s not because of trauma”. Even if it WERE because of trauma, if it’s what you need to feel better in your skin NOW, that’s the important thing.
I'd absolutely recommend seeing a licensed psychologist before starting any medical transition (for starters, it just makes it easier to do). Talking about your feelings with someone outside your social circle can help sort out what you want and need. Some people just need to change their wardrobe and hair, some need medication, and some need surgery. Finding out what you need for your transition is unique to you, and a therapist can help guide you so you don't get lost in the possibilities or expectations of others. It can also help since it sounds like you do have some trauma but even if your trauma contributed to your feelings of being trans, that doesn't take them away or mean that transitioning is the wrong move. 

A good, LGBT+ friendly therapist can only help you have an easier time transitioning.
I feel like she'd feel at least reassured if you go for therapy that that base is covered. over time she can learn and see that you are serious about this and its not a bad thing. that is what happened in my family with my brother.
this is also very true. i observed my mother worrying that she had somehow messed up as a parent on numerous occasions. not true at all. i think you're right that noone sane can argue with the evidence of actually seeing someone live and genuinely be happier in their identity.
You will one day trust me.
You may think the day will never come but it will most def . The greatest thing I can tell you right now is have patience (even when u get on hormones because I didn’t start fully passing until a year) and try to do little things to feel better ,if you can.
Not every trans person hates them, physical dysphoria and social dysphoria can be treated separately. (You can look up something called the ""gender dysphoria bible"" it goes over different types of dysphoria and how some trans people are indifferent to their parts, others seem to lack the dysphoria completely.) I started with mostly social dysphoria, treated it by socially transitioning on my own, and then the physical bit was amplified and I realized I was really dysphoric about that too.
A lot of transfolk do *not* hate their genitals, even though they feel intense dysphoria.   I'm one of those.  I have male genitals.  It just seems to not be popular to say in the discourse, that we are okay with that.
thank you, you do too ❤
Sent you a chat
Furthermore, they used to believe being gay was a result of trauma. That didn’t age well…
I mean if it did stem from trauma I wouldn't really call it invalid. But at that same time you can get stuff like kinks from trauma which can be healthy on their own but when they stem from trauma then it's kind of a whole different game
Do you have a source for that?
my life experience
Okay I apologise
I see what you mean. And thank you for elaborating.
This is a super healthy outlook. Some might imagine our experiences are not related to our gender identity but it almost certainly is.
Girl as long as you're happy thats what matters! It's just a joke.
Ahh, thanks for the clarity. I used to and then out of nowhere didn't mind it. That threw me for a loop and even more confusion as I've seen multiple people stating must have dysphoria down there. Thanks again!
I mean kinks stemming from trauma aren’t necessarily invalid either, as long as they aren’t causing a problem in your life it’s kinda… ok we’ll be healthy about your kink and all, but if you like it and aren’t causing problems for yourself or others, have a good time.

Less than 1% of Trans People Detransition

A Similar ratio of Detransitioners Remain Detransitioned. Nearly all of them retransition.

""Trauma"" is the number one excuse for Detransitioners who try to excuse their being transgender.

Most Detransitioners(the Activists, not the Trans people who cant get their meds) claim Trauma as the cause of their 'accidental"" transition and then go on to retransition, making it obvious at face value that ""Trauma"" is an made-up excuse for an Accidental Transition that was never Accidental.

&#x200B;

You would be hard pressed to find 5 Real Detransitioners who Medically Transitioned due to ""Trauma"" and had to Detransition because of it. Only the most extreme forms of trauma could cause someone to become delusional enough to accidentally think themself Trans enough to medically transition.
But.. how do you draw a causal relationship?
Apology accepted, and I'll delete my reply too, for good faith :)
I *get* that kind of humor, but not everyone will.  :)
Honestly, when I came to realize that no amount of surgery would give me the ability to bear children, I was okay with what I have down there.  I am very glad I started taking hormones and blockers.  We're all a bit different, and the point of transition is to reach a point where we are okay with who we are and can love ourselves.
But who are you to say someone is lying about why they transitioned or detransitioned? Also, I am talking about extreme forms of trauma, like SA. I’m not saying it’s common at all, just that it is a possibility.
I didn't experience trauma because I'm trans
Aight g
So do you have any changes all around you noticed and time frames while on HRT for the food and for the bad? One day I'll get started. Right now it feels like I'm drowning in trauma and suppression of oneself.
What…?
It took about 4 months to *really* feel it, but now I feel like myself for the first time ever.  

I also had to work through a LOT of trauma and having suppressed myself for so long.
I'm confused what's hard to understand... I have  experienced trauma that has directly led to me being trans. not wholly or completely the reason, but still directly
Oh wow. I feel like I'm reading a biography or something, but talking to my future self. 😳.
What’s hard to understand is why you’re saying it *CAUSED* you to be trans. What is the causal link?
Feela good don't it? Going through life feeling crazy, then meeting people, even one, with the exact same experience.   Certainly makes me feel better.
the trauma I experienced directly contributed to and made me not be a woman... it wasn't just unrelated trauma?
Okay but *how*?
wtf are you talking about lmao?

are you seriously incapable of imagining what trauma an afab person would go through which would make them distanced from the ""woman"" gendering?
That doesn’t “cause” people to be trans… :|
being trans isn't a bad thing or a bad symptom or something?? but ignoring or disregarding that trauma can have effects on gender and sexuality is just downright ingenuine
But gender isn’t a result of trauma..? Like. I’m saying there’s no causal connection here. I’m a scientist, I do research for my university. All I’m saying is I want to see a 1:1 causal relationship. Because not everyone who has trauma is trans, nor does a person need trauma to be trans. I don’t see how you can specifically say that trauma caused you to be trans. 

If transitioning is a defense mechanism, that seems different from being transgender
it's not very good science you're doing if you think things are only causal with a 1:1 relationship lol

you've taken what I've said and ran in one direction of interpretation and don't seem to be thinking very empathetically at all

I have not said at all that everyone who has trauma is trans. or that people need trauma to be trans. 

but you do seem to be saying that trauma can Never have a measurable effect on one's sexuality and gender, which is just the most uneducated thing I've ever heard
I’m asking HOW it has any effect, and you haven’t been able to tell me once. I just wouldn’t want to make such strong claims without evidence. I don’t see how it could affect your intrinsically felt sense of gender
you have no imagination then. do you want me to describe in detail my trauma experiences and how it's affected my gender? Will I be paying you for the therapy hour?

gender is completely socialised, what is attributed to one gender is a social construction
Almost nothing is *completely * socialized. I can imagine what you’re suggesting. However I would read transition as a coping mechanism in this case, or the traumatic event changed your relationship with yourself and allowed you to find your true self. But I think it’s a dangerous concept to suggest gender identity has absolutely 0 innateness and 0 biology to it. Studies have shown heritability estimates at about 20-60%"	zbqmzi	trans	738	0.99	2022-12-03 21:04:17
I’m a trans woman and voice dysphoria is killing me. Somebody have some advices?		"I just want to say that you are not alone. I too struggle with this.
I’m not a woman but I definitely recommend looking up some videos! you’ll have to learn voice training and so on as it’s not the same for guys (like getting on testosterone and their voices getting deeper because of it) trans women have to do voice training and so on

another thing “voice feminization surgery” can help you! i’m not sure how old you are nor if you’ve got a job yet but it teaches you how to adapt your voice to sound more feminine and so on :)
I strongly reccomend TransVoiceLessons on YouTube, the instructors there have excellent understanding of what makes voices change and how to affect them. 
Here is a link to Zhea's ""Voice Feminization for Absolute Beginners"", an excellent place to start.
https://youtu.be/BfCS01MkbIY
Engage with a professional voice therapist that specialises in helping transgender patients.
My partner uses voice training videos (edit: on YouTube)
I just stopped talking when not required
try voice training/videos! as a fellow trans woman, i mostly try to use a light, sing-songy voice when possible
[deleted]
Heat from fire. Fire from heat. I would have gotten nowhere with voice training with out this YouTube channel. 
https://youtu.be/BfCS01MkbIY
Oh! I'm in the same boat (and the same age). Obvi TransVoiceLessons is a classic, but there is an entire subreddit, r/transvoice, with dedicated audio and text guides that can take you through months of training. It also has links to Discord servers with actual vocal trainers who give free lessons and those servers are also a great place to practice.

Lastly ofc these communities help with motivation as you can hear ppl who managed to reach their actual voice goals. Best of luck! I'm only a few weeks in but it really works, and voice dysphoria goes down tremendously!


(PS: you get to keep your male voice as well, if you want to. Trans guys dont get that! In fact learning abt voices allows you to do all kinds of voices, which is great if you're a DnD / theatre nerd like me. Plus imagine how hilarious it would be to surprise people with a baritone voice _after_ transition for the lulz.)
Someone might, you could try youtube and google, i dont like the way i sound now and I'm 27
Sign language
watch out for the open workshops that get posted on r/transvoice. those are on discords with lots of people practicing and giving critiques and offering affordable lessons. sitting in on those lessons is how i learned voice feminization!
I struggle with this a lot. The best thing for me has been working a little every day. My voice is still rough, but it is changing over time. I still get misgendered when I am lazy about it, but the longer I transition and work at it, the less that happens.

Also, I tend to be a lot harder on my own voice than other people. I have found that I don't have to have the most fem voice in the world because not everyone cares the way I do.
Don't hormones help with your voice? Or do I understand how hormones work?
Wishing you luck fellow pancake
check out r/transvoice! they have a sidebar with techniques and explanations for vocal feminisation and you can submit a voice clip and get feedback on how you can improve
i struggle with this a lot too. TransVoiceLessons on Youtube is literally a savior, you should definitely check her out!
It'll get better eventually
i don’t have much advice that’s very good. i just don’t speak unless i need to, but that’s not something everyone can do or is comfortable doing. i feel your pain though. you’re not alone.
This is like the single biggest source of my dysphoria now, so you are not alone. It’s so frustrating to pass fairly well aesthetically, but then get outed by your voice constantly. I’ve been trying to work on voice feminization, but I find the task grating and dysphoric, and so I just avoid it. 

If you haven’t already, checkout TransVoiceLessons on YouTube ❤️💜
I also struggle with this, and I always do my best to make my voice more fem, but I really hope I can get voice feminization surgery done in the near future. You aren't alone in this, let's get through this hard battle
As a closeted trans guy I have the same problem but you can try voice training
If you live in Canada, many provincial health plans cover trans voice therapy
It’s tough.
I watch a lot of female youtubers and try to emulate their voices. Im Working my pitch higher and higher, eliminating deep undertones and learning to enunciate while keeping that high pitch. Also speaking at different volumes. I used to have alot of problems projecting a feminine voice, but after a year of work I pass on the phone, to deaf old people, going through the drive through, all that ish.
Try an app called ""voice tools."" I have it for android, not sure if Apple has it.
I struggle with that too. I had an appointment with my voice therapist last night and it went really bad. You know it’s bad when she offers a free second session this week. And I just cried after.

Just got to keep working at it, you and me both and we will grind our way there eventually.
There’s a lot of videos on YouTube on how to make your voice more feminine
I find drinking alot of warm water relaxes the throat so it's easier to deepen your voice also there are various subredits sorry if I wasn't much help
[deleted]
Me too it’s super deep mine. 

Look for a video of you speaking like a year ago you’ll tell you’ve made progress though! That helped me a lot I heard a video I made looong ago I was like omg who is that even

I feel you, try voice training. There’s a lot of videos about it on YouTube for free, you can also get lessons though. It takes time tho and it’s pretty hard (for me at least) other than hrt there’s probably not many ways to help with that (unless there’s a surgery for it??, which also wouldn’t be an option for everyone if it does exist)
Mostly voice training lol but I hate my voice to so I get it completely
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/BfCS01MkbIY) and then [this video](https://youtu.be/BW8X2nXexQs), they're super informative and give you some great exercises to change your voice
When voice training, use music.
transvoicelessons on youtube
Every day I'm alive... voice training helps a lot even if you barely practice.  Or it has for me anyway
omg fukken same, sister. 

I can't seem to hack it via YouTube tutorials and I can't afford personal lessons. ;-;
My favorite piece of advice for this: play in a COD lobby. When people stop calling you slurs and start asking for your username you know you've got it. Lol
Read books aloud and try to do voices for the characters. It’s a little silly so it doesn’t matter if the voices aren’t great. But it’s a good way of stepping outside your comfort zone and trying stuff out.
I started by reading out loud to myself, and I sounded horrendous for awhile but now it’s so good and I love it 🥰 

If anything, once you really find your voice it’s so euphoric, I hope you get there one day :)
Alternative method of alleviation, take a vow of silence
https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alyssavt/how-i-start-voice-training-start-here  They offer free voice lessons
I'd recommend finding a speech therapist that specializes in trans voices dysphoria. Just because they will help you train your voice without harming your cords.  Last thing you want to develop are nodules in your vocal cords from practicing wrong. My therapist helps me by using different easy exercises that you can tie into everyday life. But two easy steps I can recommend is taking it one pitch at a time, don't try to reach too high too fast. Hum in the pitch you are exercising and make sure you can feel a vibration on your lips/ chest/ nose area before practicing with your voice.  And lastly, push the air from your diaphragm instead of through your throat. That helps keep your vocal cords open and makes it easier to speak in higher voices.  Search for exercises on how to speak from your chest/diaphragm. Just remember your voice is a muscle, and just like any muscle,  don't over strain it
I’m AFAB, so I can help a little in what I know I was raised to do. Girls are raised to pose their sentences as questions. We raise our voices at the end of a sentence, use more emotion, more gesturing, more excitement when we’re speaking in public. When we’re totally relaxed we speak in a lower, more monotonous voice. There’s a whole “performing femininity” thing that goes with the way women speak that I’m still trying to break the habit of. It’s not just about the depth of your voice, but about inflection. I’d suggest listening to the stunning  AJ Clementine, a trans woman with a lovely, natural sounding voice and attempting to mimic that. She has an Australian accent (like me!) but I’m sure there are other ladies you could listen to in your target accent. If that doesn’t work for you, you can always try professional voice training. Good luck, gorgeous!
i think r/transvoice might help!
I feel the same way. I'm considering switching to sign language. 🤔
you can try voice training vids on youtube
I go back and forth with this. Sometimes I love my singing voice, my kids say I sound like Elvis, other times I can't stand it. Once it was funny when a little kid standing behind me in a checkout like heard me talking to my daughter, she wanted candy, and the kid said to his mom ""She looks like a mommy but sounds like a daddy!"" It's tough sometimes but be strong sister!!
Voice training takes forever, sounds super weird, feels like you're not getting anywhere and just wasting your time, but it does work. I've been doing it for a little over 2 months and just recently started hearing results. I'm not misgendered on the phone anymore, and I actually like talking to people
An easy thing that helped me was to just sing and try to match how feminine singers sang. And then eventually I started talking like I sang and then I could sing songs with guy singers again. The voice dysphoria is still there but it's much less prominent and people tell me that my voice passes
I don’t know how helpful this is but voice training. It’s no easy fix. There will be pain. There will be tears. But it’s worth it in the end. It’s a muscle. One of the few that we actually want to be strong!
Stop what you're doing, stand up, look up and to the side, then swallow, it's a basic way to kinda raise your voice a little, I used it when I was a soprano in choir to hit those high notes lmao
r/transvoice is a huge help
If youre mtf you should put in more e wovels in your voice and if youre ftm it should be more o wovels. Altering the pitch is also really good, but if you go to far it can sound unnatural.
I cannot talk to my girlfriend because of this lol
I, a Pre-Everything Trans Guy, offer you my voicebox in exchange for yours. good deal, no?
Same girl
Hi, you can train your voice or have feminization laryngoplasty or glottoplaty but if it's not covered by your insurance it can be very expensive.
So the biggest thing is where your voice comes from, where it resonates.  You can feel along your throat and upper chest where you feel vibration when you talk.  The goal should be to bring it higher up and still be comfortable.  The issue is that your vocal chords aren't used to this, so you need to do exercises to get used to doing that.  Once you do that, you can try talking like that.  The more you do it, the easier it'll become.  

I highly recommend TransVoiceLessons on YouTube 
https://youtu.be/BfCS01MkbIY here's a link to one of her videos for beginners 

Don't get too frustrated as it's difficult.  I'd also recommend trying to join some Voice Chatting group on say discord for example, or with friends to practice online.  Let me know if I can help more.
Honestly, look at some voice actibg advices: how to train your voice to get a higher, more feminine tone and pitch, how to be able to do that for long periods of time, etc... It's not a miracle, but it can help at least ^^
I duno bout anyone else but I try singing  along to female artists/singers to help me a lil
[removed]
Voice training can be difficult so try to find ways to enjoy it. I am just starting but have found that singing helps to exercise control and is fun to do. Not all progress is linear or easy to see and it can be very frustrating. But you are most likely to continue and excel doing things you enjoy.
We’re fighting together, hope we find a way to fix that soon
I’m 16 actually

But thx for the advice! I’ll look for some videos!
Yes i will reccomend using videos too as Exuno_ said. Maybe the videos can help you not feeling alone and may help you feel more okay being who you are. It helped me alot to know i am not alone. Ikn dysporia isnt the easyest, But dont let it take over who you are. Be strong. We are here for you.
Oh, that link will help

Thanks!
If you are from the UK you can get this on the NHS with no requirements to be on hormones or anything else. Just simply ask your GP for a referral. I did mine via video conferencing due to the pandemic but I found it to be very helpful
That’s a good ideia
Okay! I’ll look for some videos

Thx!
Well I’m using this avanced technique as well lol
I’ll look for some videos

Thx for the advice!
if you don't mind my asking, around how long did it take for you to get your voice (or rather, the proper knowledge and practice to adjust it) to where you wanted it to be?
Thanks for that link, I’m sure it will be useful
Lmao now THAT’S how you deal with dysphoria in style
Oh, that will help a lot!

Thank you!
Testosterone hormones lower the voice irreversibly. So taking testosterone like many trans men do will change our voice and make it deeper but if we went off of testosterone, or if a person who already went through a testosterone driven puberty went on estrogen, than the voice would not change by itself. It wouldn’t really get deeper though. Basically T makes the voice deeper but E does not make the voice higher.
for transmascs yeah, unfortunately it doesn't go the other way :(
Thank you!
I hope you’re right
We gonna get out of that pain soon, i hope

I was reading the comments and they suggested some youtube/google advices, that can help us
Thank you for the recommendation! I’ll look for that!
Yeah, guess that’s a way

Thanks for the advice anyway!
I’m planning to go to canada, but i am actually brazilian
Proud of you

Hope i can get in that level one day
I just searched it and yeah! We have it for ios as well!

It’s a 5 star rating app, and looks amazing! Thx for the advice!
I hope you’re right

We’ll get better soon
I’ll search for them. Thanks!
Or easier to speak in a higher tone if that's what your going for sorry
Lmao that’s the solution
Oh that’s good, thank you!
Thanks for that!
That’s a good advice

Thanks!
however, you should definitely check out TransVoiceLessons on YouTube
Lol thats a great ideia. Online voice gaming
Yeah I’m actually a (not pro but) voice actor so i have a lot of voices

The funny part of it is that the only important voice that I don’t have is a feminine one

But yeah, I’ll try that! Will help!

Thx!
That will help a lot

Thank you!
Thx for the helping!
I guess that’s the way
Lol that’s right!

Thx for the advices!
Wow, that actually works?

That’s a real good trick. Thanks!
I know how this is

Guess we gonna have to go to sign language
Done!
Okay

Thanks for the advices!

I also struggle with it. There is what I know of Voice Feminization and vocal chord surgery.
There are Discord groups for voice feminization (one I know of is r/scinguistics).
Okay okay understandable! :) if you’d like I could send you some videos? if you’re comfortable with that!
I actually saw one by a crossdresser, he does really simple makeup tutorials too, he clearly understands that amab people weren’t taught a lot of those things
I'm from UK and i wanted to know if I can get hrt under the nhs
I feel that having professional feedback is a better idea than risking picking up bad habits or straining your voice 😊
Ironically it's bad advice. Practice won't make perfect, but it will make improvements.
Of course! i’m gonna edit this in a sec with a few good videos :)

EDIT: one for beginners- https://youtu.be/BfCS01MkbIY

Ok
So can this person just use hormones?
It's irreversible unless you have surgery. And with femlar once your voice box is healed, if you are under testosterone again, your voice will start to break again.
A brazillion?! I didn't know people could get that old!

Shitty jokes aside, Canada is pretty great. Federally residents are protected against the state from discrimination based on gender identity. I don't know about all provinces, but mine (Manitoba) also protects from private discrimination based on gender identity too.

Lots of trans procedures are also covered by provincial health programs. I mentioned voice therapy, but with conditions, gender affirming surgeries, laser therapy, and some others too.

Processes are slow like anywhere else but much of the financial burden of many common trans procedures is alleviated.

I hope to see you here soon! Much love!
U will doll! The human voice is flexible and changes if we demand it to.
You got this!!
That’s a good advice. Thank you!
No problem
I would love it!
[deleted]
Yes, it just takes a long time. First step is to talk to your GP who can then refer you to the gender clinic. The waiting lists are killer but there are other things you can do to transition socially before getting the medication
I was told my a doctor that theres about a 4 year waiting list unfortunately :/
wow, thank you so much for the thorough response! i feel like when i ask that question the response is typically the milestone range you stated for elimination of most of the dysphoria, if not a little longer. gives me hope that with practice, i'll be able to achieve a similar milestone soon myself, if i can quit procrastinating it lol

thanks again!
Well no because she is a trans woman and based on the fact that she has voice dysphoria, than she has already gone through a testosterone driven puberty and therefore even taking feminizing estrogen hormones would not effect her voice. If the poster was a trans man than hormones would be a solution but she’s not.
Yes ofc, I was solely talking about hormones though because of the question asked. And much progress can be made through voice training as well, surgery isn’t always the only solution which is nice.
Here in brazil we have the SUS (sistema básico de saúde / basic health organization) witch do a lot of things for free, and that includes transition surgery

Things for here are good (but canada is definitely better lol)

I’m planning to go to canada in 3-5 years, so i hope to see you as well! Much love for you too!

OK thanks I'm probably going to try to come out to my mum in a few minutes
Ok well that sucks
Yes of course 😊
Heat from fire, fire from heat
Thank you! That will help a lot!
Yay! Hopefully it goes well.
Yup it really does. I don’t know what I’d do if my voice didn’t change with hormones (cause I’m a trans man) because pre t voice training made me so dysphoric. But trans people do hard stuff all the time and trans women can overcome this and much more, so if OP reads this she should know that she’ll get past this.
thanks
I hope she sees that"	s7swkb	trans	725	0.99	2022-01-19 15:41:13

Accidentally went to a bridal shower…	"So basically a few days ago I found out I was going to a bridal shower(l’m still a teenager so I usually just go to family occasions whenever they tell me to come) for some relatives I didn’t know, and when I got there it was pretty fun and the food was good so I kind of enjoyed it. But afterwards I looked it up and found out that only women are invited to bridal showers(I feel so dumb like I legitimately didn’t know this until now for some reason). 

All of the waiters and the cameraman were men so I didn’t get the “women only” vibe while I was there but afterward I realized there were no men from my family and I was even the only one not wearing a dress. Idk I’m just really upset since ever since I realized I was trans I’ve been trying to look and act how I want to be(a man) so I’ll be able to have some memories and photos of my childhood but now I’m gonna have a bunch of pictures of myself at a women’s only bridal shower and I’ll have to remember that I willingly went there and had fun when the whole time it was “proving” that I wasn’t a man without me even knowing which is super embarrassing and giving me dysphoria. 

So I know it sounds kind of dumb but I just don’t know what to do about this, my birthday’s in a couple of days and I feel like this is actually going to ruin my mood so any advice to cope with this before then would be greatly appreciated, thanks :’)

Tl;dr: I(FtM) am dumb and didn’t know that only women are supposed to go to bridal showers, now I’m getting dysphoria right before my birthday."	"You didn't go there knowing it was going to be women only. Please don't beat yourself up over something you weren't aware of.
It's not you who's stupid for going to a ""women's only event"" and enjoying it (also you didn't even know) it's stupid for it to be a women's only event. It should be an event where you take the people you want to have with you. Even if a woman is the main person and it's something to celebrate her being a woman she doesn't need to only invite women as well. She should have invited people important to her no matter gender as long as she still feels comfortable.

What I'm trying to say is, gendering a party is stupid and you are aware of that fact and therefore treated it as any party and enjoyed it like it should be. It's the other people who failed and are stupid. You were the man on the party that proved the women's only concept wrong because you are not a woman and you could still have a lot of fun. The concept was wrong. Not you being there.
For what it's worth, not knowing bridal showers are a woman thing was very guy of you.
If it helps you feel better, I have been to bridal showers that are not gender-segregated
I think the real lesson to take from this is that gendered events in general are a silly idea. Your identity shouldn’t  prevent you from being able to attend an event celebrating a birth in the family.
I would like to chime in with the fact that I'm MTF, but I wasn't just a year ago (or at least I didn't know) I was told when I was a kid that Bridal Showers and Baby Showers were just for women.
I've been to 2 baby showers and a bridal shower for one of my really good friends, all of this was before I realized I was trans, before I changed my name. I was living full time as a man.
Going to a bridal shower does not make you less Masculine in any way shape or form. Regardless of how they see you, you went to that bridal shower as a man. The perception of the event doesn't change that.
It’s not your fault for going to an event that while socially segregated, shouldn’t be. don’t think of yourself as an odd duck out but a pioneer for social change :)
Even if bridal showers are for women only, going to a “women-only” event doesn’t *make you a woman*, it just makes you a man who went to an event filled with women. You get to define yourself and your identity, and no one can take that from you or change it. It’s not your fault, and you didn’t know, but also if you had fun, maybe you would’ve wanted to go anyways — and that wouldn’t make you any less of a man. 🫂🏳️‍⚧️💙
Dude! I am a cis man. Been to baby showers. Bridal showers. Staggettes… They are “traditionally” females only, but not exclusively. You may have been invited as a woman, but you went and are a man. 

You. Are. A. Man. Anyone who tells you otherwise, can fuck right off. 

:)

Edit: typoed staggette as stag. Also, if it helps - I am a big and obviously bearded guy. Some got weirded by me being there, but I owned it. 

I also kicked ass at the games for baby showers. ;)
To be sure : a bridal shower is the thing people do before they get married, like sometimes it’s a big party, other times a night with friends and they can do loads of things they wouldn’t do otherwise ? (I’m French and here it’s called “enterrement de vie de jeune fille/de garçon” if this is it)

Well I didn’t even know that only certain genders are supposed do attend to these. 

The answer is simple : don’t feel bad about something you didn’t even know. I’m MtF and I have to say that before today I would most likely have done the same since I didn’t know, and most of us would have, if they didn’t know. Don’t worry. You’re not any less valid, and you are a man I have respect for. I hope you’ll be alright for your birthday and it’ll be a great day for you. 

If you need anything, dm me ! 
Love from France, sir :)
Plenty of showers are co-ed; you did nothing wrong. Forget about it & have a great birthday! 🎉
>gets invited to bridal shower 

>literally only guy there 

>has a great time 

>doesn’t even realize until later he was the only man 

himbo moment
It was not your fault and nobody tell you it was a female only event, just forgett about that and stick to what matter the most, now you know that some bridal events are only for females and you had a good time
I had 2 women and 8 guys at my hen do. The bride invited the people she wants to be there, surely? I’ve never considered them to be women only events. You had a nice time with nice people. Stop letting your insecurities ruin what should be the most exciting time of your life. You’re just discovering who you really are! Don’t let things drag you down because you convince yourself afterwards that you shouldn’t have enjoyed it.
Were you the photographer or the cameraman?

Or you could say that you went along because your mother was going and had to look after you or something.
this made me realize i did the same thing 🧍‍♂️

it was abt a year ago and i’m just now realizing why some people were looking at me funny and why there were only women

but yeh don’t beat yourself up over this, you didn’t know, it’s not your fault. i understand how upsetting stuff like this can be :/
Not to be that person but clearly it wasn't a women's only thing if they invited you? I mean, you're a dude. Unless you aren't out to them or something
Think of it this way: you were the hottest fucking man at that event 😤😤😤
I really get you pal, since my egg cracked I have deadly dread to go to a pool and I didn't go to my high school prom cause, if I went, I'd had to wear suit and see other girls in their beautiful dresses and, right now im struggling to not lose my hope on going in a wonderful dress to my graduation Party when I finish my career
Why would the Bride invite a guy to a bridal shower… think its waaay more embarrassing on her behalf doncha think 😉
Woman is when go to bridal shower
Weddings now in days have gotten a bit farther away from gender specific roles. My 32 year old cis male manager is going to be the flower ""girl"" at his friends wedding because it's such a huge group of friends they can't all be bridesmaids/groomsmen. I wouldn't sweat too much about it, instead just think of it like this, your family member wanted you to be there despite the typical roles affiliated. and I'm guessing you didn't get any grief for not wearing a dress, so just chalk it up as a good time, and move forward with the knowledge you gained. Time moves forward continuously, there's no use dwelling on it, just keep on trucking mate.
Just look at it as a heist, you got to trick people there into thinking you were a woman in order to get free food
Maybe the bride trusts and respects you enough to want you there as your genuine, authentic self! 

Traditionally bridal parties are all women but I had my ""adopted"" trans (FTM) ""son"" in mine (he's like five years younger than me). I am proud of him and I wanted him as part of my wedding. 

I wouldn't read too much into it. Until someone says otherwise, I would look at it as being thought of highly enough to be included no matter your gender.
NTA and you did nothing wrong but the woman in your family did and I think it would be appropriate to not trust them from now forward. I would google everything they wanted you to go to from now on.
But if it was supposed to be all girls, then the person who handed out invites was the dumb one. Think about it like this. If you were a cis man and they invited you, would you still feel bad about it. Cuz I wouldn't.
oh man, i feel that. but listen bro, you are 100% still ***you,*** no matter what anybody else says. dysphoria can be absolute hell sometimes, and it might feel silly or dumb to feel dysphoric over some things, but your feelings are always valid. if it makes you feel any better, i got dysphoric over the name of an item on my minecraft skin the other night, and i feel a weird sorta gender envy towards my roblox avatar haha

but yeah, youre 100% valid. nobody can change who you are. and if people dont like who or how you are thats their problem, not yours. you are so much stronger than you think you are, and im so so so proud of you, bro.
Typically bridal/baby showers are typically for women, but not always.  When one of my friends from university was having her first kid, it was about 2/3 guys due to her friend group.
Dude, you're still a man. One bridal shower doesn't ""prove"" you're not a man as much as me buying pints instead of wine doesn't ""prove"" I'm not a woman. You have so much life to live as a man, don't let this let you.

Also, you'll be the cool dude in all the photos and no one can take that away from you.
I'm a cis guy and of I were invited to a bridal shower, I'd definitely go, it sounds like a lot of fun :) 

Parties shouldn't be gendered and there is no shame at all in enjoying life. You be you and if that's you, a guy, going to a bridal shower, that's awesome!
Not realizing a bridal shower us a woman only event, going and having a great time while completely oblivious to that fact only to later do a facepalm after getting home and learning your mistake just sounds very guy of you. Like, straight up himbo energy my dude.
⬆️ Exactly this 100%
Definitely this, I’d want to be at the bridal shower of someone close to me if I was invited even if I’m a dude. I want to be supportive
Hahaha yes, this was honestly my exact thought.  I’m like OP this completely sounds like something a dude would do.

“That was for chicks only?  Aw man, the sausage rolls were really good though.”
Came here to say that too 😂
Same.
L’enterrement is the bachelor/bachelorette party (US) or stag party/hen do (UK). Those are typically pretty wild and either in the evening or a short trip to somewhere considered sinful.  Here in Canada (I’m a bilingual French Canadian), you might hear stag/doe party, the American terms or the French expression.

Bridal showers are more of an anglophone thing (I don’t remember them being much of a thing in francophone cultures) and are a different event from the wild night out.  Bridal showers are pretty tame events held during the day where you will see the older women in the two families attending.  They are usually women only (which is what bothered the OP) but I have attended mixed gender ones before.  It’s a bit like a baby shower only focused on becoming a bride rather than becoming a mother.
I’m pretty sure that’s what it is(I don’t know much about them lol),I think there are parties that both genders come to but I’m pretty sure this one was supposed to be just for women. thanks for the help :)
Yea, I forgot to clarify that I haven’t come out to my distant family so they wouldn’t have known, I was more blaming myself for going rather than the people who invited me without knowing I’m trans lol ^_^;
lmao i think youve forgotten what sub youre in
yesss & how cool that you are the only man alive that gets to go to an all girls party !
Oh ok ! I didn’t know about that ! Thank you for the explanations dear !
Nah don't blame yourself. You didn't know."	woe5m8	trans	693	0.99	2022-08-14 19:12:36
Parents mad at my trans sister for not dressing up in pool clothes	"Im not trans but I have a younger sister who recently came out as trans. I support her and have a good relationship with her but she feels misunderstood by our parents. Today we were planning on going to the pool. I know that my sister is quite insecure about her body and wears long sleeved clothes. She insisted on wearing a long sleeve sweater and jeans and asked if she could go to the park thats right next to the pool. My parents got very mad at her and i suggested that it could be because of her gender dysphoria. The problem is that my parents, especially my dad, doesnt like it when i intervene on behalf of my sister whenever this issue comes up. My dad is in his 60s and he is progressive for his age and the people he grew up with but hes still a little ignorant when it comes to these things. How can i help my sister with this in the future without having to make anyone upset?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice yall, i cant thank you enough. I am kind of treading on thin ice rn because standing up for my sister could mean me and maybe even her getting punished. theyre already not happy with us and im worried if my sister makes my dad more upset she will get sent to military school, and my dad intends on making her spend the full 4 years pretending to be a boy there. im scared for her. I am willing to push my dad for my sister but i cannot get me or her hurt just because i wanna act heroic. If i act too much im gonna come full circle and might make her look bad so shell be put in that school"	"Just stay supportive of yoru sister and let keep patiently explaining to your parents why she feels the way she does. From your post it seems like they hurt her out of ignorance rather than malice, which means they just need to learn and improve.

Your parents need to realize that you're not ""intervening"", you're just trying to help them understand.
I don’t have any real great advice, just wanted to say that your sister is lucky to have you for a sibling!  Keep standing up for her when you need to, try to be as patient and calm with your parents as you can, and hopefully they’ll start to get it and come around.
I understand her plight only too well. I use a long sleeve swim shirt and a big floppy hat and sunglasses and huge man trunks to hide my currently transitioning body from the community. I live in Florida and don't need the hate in my life. I told people I have a NON infectious skin condition I have to put cream on for and it can't be in sunlight or have sunscreen on it so I have to stay covered up. I get in the pool and I do exercises and run as fast as i can doing laps. It's a great workout and people leave me alone.

If she does something like this she can still be with the family, which is all your Dad really wants, is for you all to do something fun together because time goes by fast and soon there will be no more family time.

You are a good brother keep sticking up for your sister, that's what family does. Dad will come around don't give up on him either. Love to you both.
Not every girl has a sister like you, I sure wish I do. Keep supporting her no matter what. I cannot put in words how much I appreciate what you’re doing! Thank you!
>he is progressive for his age

Yet he got angry at your sister for something literally beyond her control.... yeah he sounds lovely.
The fact your parents go as far as punishing you for helping to support your sister is a major red flag. Reminds me of companies that punish/fire workers for trying to unionize.

You're absolutely doing the right thing by defending your sister. If you want to escape trouble maybe you could talk to your sister in cases like these and be the one to suggest stuff instead of her? For example if you're the one to suggest going to the park then you're not defending her, she's just tagging along.

That said, some things are worth doing, even (maybe in this case *especially*) if your parents disprove. Stay strong <3
You are a hero. What your doing for your sister may be causing you to suffer consequences with your parents, but you are a hero for standing up for her. Most of all, your her hero.

Every trans person would be thrilled with someone like you as a sibling. We need more people like you.

It may suck now, having to deal with these consequences, but it will pay off. Your sister will remember and in the future when your not under the thumb of your parents, you'll appreciate going through the punishments because you are doing the right thing.

Thank for being an amazing ally and being there for your sister. We appreciate you! ❤️
You're the older sibling, It's on you to protect your sister, even from your parents.  sometimes people have to get upset.
Mmmm.

Your parents punish you and sometimes ""get violent"" for... wh -- caring about your sister's well-being?  Isn't that something they want you to do?

Unless it interferes with their *authority,* I suppose.

So I'm a trans woman and I still hate swimming in public pools.  I don't like the way the wet clothes stick to my body and literally *show* people that I'm trans.  So yeah, I imagine you're right about that being the problem.
Oh honey, that edit? You dad isn’t progressive at all.
Your doing more then you no sweety that fucking amazing keep it up 😊
Unfortunately you can't make everyone happy. But i bet you make your sister feel supported and she's going to need that more than your parents.
There's hundreds of reasons she may not have wanted to wear a swimsuit. What a weird thing for parents to be mad about. 

If she doesn't want to wear a swimsuit then she doesn't have to.
Be positive and encouraging. Never make the experiences negative, especially if she takes a chance and then gets cold feet. Let her just ease into it on her own but also gentle nudging can go a long way.
Without having to make anyone upset. That’s the rock you will trip on forever. Drop the idea that you can fight for something, stand up for someone or yourself and make everyone happy in the process. Get comfortable at making people uncomfortable if you wanna voice your opinions and really uncomfortable if you want those opinions to be taken seriously and super uncomfortable if you want action to follow your opinions.
continue to be her advocate to your parents until she can find the strength to advocate for herself. show her how it's done!!
Honestly the pool is lame af (I can’t swim 💀)
This shit breaks my heart.. I am so sorry. No kid should be burdened with having to protect their sibling from their parent.

You are a good sibling, and she sounds lucky to have you. If you have someone you can trust.. teacher.. counselor.. an adult you trust, maybe try reaching out to them. Your father sounds abusive from your further comments.  This situation goes beyond what anyone here can help with, beyond offering support and stuff.

Please stay safe, and save all the money you can so you can GTFO and get your sister out too. Once you are an adult there is nothing he can do
Well the military in the end will help with any kind of medical she my need and otherwise couldn't afford
How old is your sister?
My advice is to be aware of when giving advice, even when well-intentioned, would cause your parents to double down. You mentioned in your post that your dad does not respond well to interventions on your part. My family's like this too - sometimes they feel on the defensive when another actor comes into a conversation between two people. 

You seem like a really great sibling and your sister is lucky to have you. But if your advice is harming more than it's helping, perhaps you should consider leaving the issue between your parents and your sister. 

My guess is they will respond better when she defends herself instead of having you intervene. You obviously know your family better than me though, so take it or leave it.
I think you should show your dad this post. Maybe print it out and leave it for him where he gets ready in the morning. Any rational human would get feels from this.
Just keep loving her, let her know that you are always there for her, and support her and that she can always talk to you, and that will be enough support for now. When you're older and can have your own place, maybe then you both can stay together. This is the way.
How does your sister feel about the situation and what your role should be?  You should speak with her privately so you understand what she wants before taking any action on her behalf.  

Either way, I am sure she is grateful for your support.  No matter what happens - be the brother that she needs.  It sounds like you are already well on your way.  I wish I had support like you are giving her.
Keep defending your sister. You have no idea what that means to her. One of my sisters is my biggest supporter, and I have never been able to properly convey to her what it means to me. She thinks she’s gets it. All I can say is your sister will never forget you being there for her. In a world where it can feel like everyone is against you as a trans person you may very well be the only thing that feels good to her. Keep being there. You’re amazing. My love to you 💜
Thanks for being a supportive sibling!
I want to share something it took me decades in therapy to really understand: The things your parents do to your sister and you are not your fault or hers. Even when they frame it as a response to your behavior, they are adults with the positive duty to raise you as free from fear, coercion and danger as possible. A Cis man who even threatens to force his Trans daughter to attend military school as a boy is an abuser, even if he's ""progressive"" in many ways. And if you face punishment for sticking up for her, that's another red flag. Take it from someone who had emotionally abusive parents & spent decades in therapy overcoming it.

Seek IRL help and guidance if there is a supportive adult in your life that you can trust to discuss these things with who will not report what you say to your parents (especially your father) & to whom your sister is comfortable coming out. If there is no such adult, do your best to find one and get their input. These are problems no kid should have to deal with, and I am sorry you and your sister have to. 

PS - I also want to mention how lucky your sister is to have you. Continue giving her the love and support you already are.
Slightly off topic, but! I am a cis woman with a real (non infectious) skin disease very similar to what you are claiming! It's called dermatomyositis, I won't get into all the details, but basically I HAVE to stay out of the sun as much as possible and if I am in the sun for any period of time I have to wear mineral sunscreen. I also have steroid cream I use occasionally if I have a flare up, which is kinda like an itchy sunburn that doesn't go away normally.
Anyway, I just thought it might be helpful for you to know that a disease like this does exist, so if anyone ever challenges you on it you can give them something to chew on.
When they get upset i get punished and yelled at for it.
ice cold take there. it is NEVER a child's responsibility to protect their siblings from abusive parents.

aww I'm so sorry you have to endure this. I hope there is relief for you from this condition. Thanks for the info, I'd hate to claim I had something wrong with me that I didn't, weird karma or something, so I'm just saying I have a condition (never saying if it is medical or just mental or imagined) and I let them make up whatever narrative they want in their own heads. I don't think I could remember the name of it either! I have other conditions I can't remember the name for but that's just getting old. Thanks for taking the time to respond. Great info. Much love.
as fucked as it is you are protecting your sister and she will thank you for it far into adulthood. your parents are in the wrong and you do have the choice to not take on their shit and it wouldn’t be your fault that it then went back to her but i think your little sister has already greatly benefited from knowing there is someone in the home who understands her and is willing to fight for what she deserves
That's life dude, I'm so sorry you don't have the parents you deserve.
You're doing everything right. Unfortunately your parents are human, they're wrong sometimes. And often when people are wrong they take it poorly.
for sure not their responsibility it’s not fair or fight but sometimes older siblings do it anyway because they want to protect their younger sibling. sometimes you’d rather sit there and take it then be in the other room hearing them get treated that way
That's too bad she's so young that she can't just leave.  I'm sorry your parents are behaving that way.  Give your sister hugs from me.
I cant stand up for my sister before my dad becomes very aggressive. If i do anything that he takes personally he will scream and in some cases get violent. Because im a minor im dependent on him and if I do thinks that he does not like that will affect me. He is already considering sending me to a christian private school and my sister to a military school. i see where youre coming from but im not tryna piss my parents off especially when theyre the ones who can subdue me.
💯agreed
Yeah,but I couldn’t see my sister get treated like this so at first I would protect and if it isn’t working I would call the police because I see my sister get treated like that.
my parents tell me she can stand up for herself but shes the sibling who ""behaves the best"" and so she reacts to it in the most passive way possible to not get punished.
Hey I'm really sorry to tell you this, but as someone who witnessed similar things in some of my friends households: this is abuse. Your parents are being abusive. I know the lines can get blurry because you love them and they love you, but that doesn't undo the damage they are inflicting on you and your sister. Feeling afraid of your parents/ being afraid to stand up for yourself or your sibling is not normal. You and your sister need to keep your heads low until you get the chance to move out.

While you may want to protect your sister please keep in mind, that it would be your parents' responsibility to protect the two of you in the first place.

I wish you all the luck and I'm sending you all the love in this world.
If your dad is screaming and getting violent, you need to contact a trusted adult such as a teacher or school counselor and ask for help. Stay safe, OP
This is dreadful. The two of you are captives to his whims, and there is an ongoing threat of exile hanging over your heads.

I have no doubt he thinks he's doing what's best for you two. But that kind of thinking has been a cover for countless historical atrocities. Forcing someone to do what you think is what is best for them never turns out well. And, in my experience, it is very difficult to get through to such a person.

I wish I could give you an escape plan. But it looks to me like you two need to lay low and comfort each other and try not to set him off. I also think, as others have said, that you two should start planning an escape. The sooner the better, but make sure your plan is airtight. These kinds of situations have a way of escalating.
they dont do it to the point where i would have to call the police. i mean they still love us, but my dad doesnt really understand what she is going through. and he has problems of his own. like, alot of problems. he had a really shitty childhood.
i always reacted that way as well when i was in trouble but i was the older sibling. when it comes down to it everyone reacts differently and internalizes things differently. it’s not your responsibility as the older sibling to protect her from your parents but as someone who internalizes things not having the acceptance of parents is awful, i think as long as you’re still sticking up for her in private and telling her that they are wrong and she should do what feels right for her you would not be doing anything wrong if you didn’t take on the responsibility of changing your parents’ mind. it is very healing to have someone stick up for you though so i think what you did with the pool and trying to give your parents some psycho-education was very effective and kind
Oh sorry, my answer wasn’t really based on your post and more at the context Frontverlauf comments above  talking about its not the siblings responsibility to protect the other sibling from abusive parents

should I cut my hair or be grounded for all high school	so I'm a freshman in highschool, and im FTM. my mom refuses to let me cut my hair, so should I cut my hair and he grounded for four years or deal with gender dysphoria and people mistaking me for a girl?	"I would be surprised if the grounding lasted more than a couple weeks. 4 years of grounding for cutting your hair once is ""I'm cutting you out of my life as soon as I turn 18"" territory.
I’m also ftm and I cut my hair without permission… depending on how long you have until you can leave.. I’d say if you only have a short time till you can leave then go for it.. but I will warn you.. when I cut mine my entire life was uprooted and despite my dysphasia being better I wish I waited… if you think your family will be upset but more relaxed in punishment then go for it.. and if you think you can deal with your family after then do it.. just really think over this..
If cutting your hair feels dangerous maybe buzz the sides/some of the back and rock an undercut. Keep it parted down the middle at home to hide it and put it up in a bun at school to rock it, or flip it to the side, etc.
A) im a lad and i have long hair. We should be over all the ""long hair is for girls"" thingy
B) my advice should be cut it. Really. Ground can sound bad, but you are in a really special age for your mental health and that type of stuff can hurt you a lot in the long waaay

C) please take it as and advice from some rando from internet, im not a mental health professional, so think seriously if what i said sound logic to you
Cut it and live your life. It’s ridiculous that she said that.
How controlling are your parents now?  If you can’t do anything without their permission, such as choose what kind of clothes to wear, what friends you hang out with, what types of school activities you can participate in, etc. I’d wait.  If grounding consists of not being able to leave the house, not be with friends, not have access to your phone or laptop, or even gaming (if you’re into that), I’d think about waiting.  One thing though, if you have very long hair you parents aren’t going to notice if an inch disappears every other month. A literal inch and only if your hair is way below shoulder length. I mean hair usually grows 1/2” every couple of months.  Depends on the length of yours.
You do you hun, but be careful some parents would go out of control, make sure you are in a safe situation, where you won’t be harm
“Fall asleep” with a huge wad of bubble gum and “wake up” with it completely stuck in your hair!
It's called coercive control and is a precursor to domestic abuse. Cut the hair, don't cut the hair, doesn't matter, as long as you're doing it for you.

The male parental unit tried grounding. I told him flat unless you're going to bolt the door, I'm going. He bolted the door. So I kicked it down. He then sized up and backed down when he realised you imprison me I will end him. My mother still shudders at the blackness of my eyes that day.

Don't get it that far. You're their kid, for sure. You're not in indentured servitude.
I think of you cut it with full understanding of the consequences, which you obviously have, it ought to be a pretty big sign to your parents that you're serious; and maybe it'll help them see things your way. But it's obviously ultimately your choice.
Cut it, and style it however you want in spite of that ridiculous ultimatum.
Then just preemptively learn to pick a lock (one of the best skills I've learned)and sneak out with friends.
Definitely not worth the dysphoria.
Some cool suggestions here, I was just coming in with, “Wait a bit until the heat dies down and then get some gum wayyy up in there and then you can use ye olde hygiene as an excuse.” But these other internet randos provide better advice.
Cut it bro. Fuck the haters
Would you get a worse punishment for cutting your hair or for dying your tips a bright color, a supposedly feminine hairstyle/activity? Because if you try to be more feminine and just happen to fuck it up, well a short haircut may become a necessity.
""Off with her head!""

In this instance, her head is your hair. Cut that stuff off and feel good about yourself. Screw parental interference. They only know so much about you.
just cut a tiny bit off at a time
Maybe you could try a man bun style? 

Little hint, if you have a fringe, that’s usually seen as feminine. You could always brush that to the side if you do, and use hair spray or gel.
Def cut it my dude!
I would recommend to get a job and pay for your own haircut. When I was in high school I got holiday jobs and used the money to buy my own electronics, clothes, etc. I paid for my hair cut and got my hair dyed as well because I had my own money and although my parents didn't really like it, they couldn't do anything about it because it was my money from my job.
You could try to find some female celebrity with short hair you mom likes and say ""ohhh her hair is so cool can I cut it like that?"" Maybe then she'll let you cut it short. It will probably look like a pixy cut but you can fix that the next time you go to the hairdresser.
CUT IT! I have a friend just like this, who’s mum won’t let them cut their hair. We put together £7 a month as a friendship group so he can get his hair cut. His mum hates it, but who cares
Your moms spite won’t last as long as the happiness you’ll get from being/discovering yourself, that I can guarantee. 

Could get uncomfortable and there may be bitter spots here and there in conversation, but locking you away from life as you’ve described is abuse and wouldn’t fly without questions and calls made. 

If your parents ever try to take away your autonomy like that or make demands of your identity in exchange for food/water/shelter, please let an adult and/or an older friend/acquaintance you trust know what’s going on and hopefully they can help you avoid further harm; you deserve to be you and still be taken care of & loved, we’re out here rooting for you ❤️

Good luck, whatever choice you make!
Don't cut it. You have the right to bodily autonomy
As a trans woman I would never tell a trans person to conform. But... there are some masculine ways to wear long hair. I suppose it depends too. Would she follow through with 4 years? Once my mom grounded me ""forever"" and it lasted 2 weeks.
""Why do my kids never talk to me""
cut it, what's she gonna do, glue it back on?
Depends on what you mean by grounding, if it’s forbidding you from watching your favourite tv show or something like that maybe cut it, if it’s something like beating you up maybe don’t. Remember even if you have your hair short, unless your parents tell the school they’re ok with it chances are you’ll still be called by your deadname and people will still think you’re a girl. And also if you don’t have a binder when not wearing many layers of clothing people might still think you’re a girl. I guess what I mean by this is that cutting your hair will not magically solve all other problems you might have passing and won’t make you have the usual high school experience most guys have.
This is going to sound horrible but if you have friends outside of school I wouldn't  cut it I dont know about ýou but 4 years just doesn't seem like a choice that would help your mental health on top of that it will absoloutly fuck your social life  this is just my opinion though  stay hydrated <3

Edit sorry if my grammar or anything is bad english isn't my first language
Rebel.
Do it. At best, she was exaggerating and your grounded, like, a week or two. At worst, you really are grounded all of highschool, but then you know to hightail it out ASAP. Sure it could suck for a bit, but either way, you're happier in the end.
Put a bunch of gum in your hair and say a bully did it and you'll get it cut with no consequences
There are other ways to deal with long hair! You don't need to cut it all! You can put it in a bun, wear a hat outside or even just braid it into some sort of afro hairstyle! I heavily suggest looking into alternatives before cutting it all if you feel scared of the outcome!

But also, have you considered non binaryness? People will always read us based on stereotypes, but you can choose to be a man your own way and not care whether people think you're a girl or not, because at the end of the day the ones who amtter are your friends and the people who understand. Those who see you wrongly do not need to be taken into consideration!!!
Cut it. Cut it. Cut it. If you get grounded that’ll just give you time to focus on you and figure yourself out further!!
if you really want it cut, then cut it. its YOUR body, not your moms body. however if you are scared of what she would do, then i would leave it for now. maybe look at pictures of men who have long hair to help you feel a but better?
I’m a trans woman with a masculine mohawk.
Don’t miss out on your education. You have a whole life ahead of you to have your hair how you want.
[removed]
dont let her win when it comes to something this important to your quality of life. always fight for yourself
Could you shave underneath your hair. Keep the top long and have it in a man bun when out and about and down/low down in a bobble when at home? It may not be what you want but it will keep you safe until you can leave home?
show her some pictures of really feminine women that have short hair idk that’s what i did. if your hair is long right now you could try and get a bob cut and then next time you go get it even shorter as it might be less of a shock for her. and while it’s longer there are videos online to masculinise it (eg give yourself side burns). 

if after all that she doesn’t let you - go for it. it’s your life.
In many if not most countries, your family would likely get into serious legal trouble if they genuinely withheld education from you for for years. That makes me think it's probably quite an exaggeration.

Note: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.
To be honest, no. If I pulled that when I was younger I would have been actually grounded for 4 years and likely been kicked out. It’s not worth it

I would see if you can get a bob hair cut or something. It’ll be easier to make look masculine than longer hair. That’s what I did 

I wish you the best with high school. I’m starting college now and I’m still closeted at home (though I’m fully out at school). I can understand it’s exhausting. But I know you’ve got this
It depends. If you think you’d be safer not cutting it then don’t. Or you could work for a compromise! See how short you can get it and work with that for now. I have longer hair, it’s almost shoulder length ish and still looks pretty masculine as long as I do my brows and dress masculine to match. But if you really want to cut it I’d say go for it!
Wow that sounds like something that would happen to butters from south park. Within a year you could probably have longish hair again but thay need to be some extremely disciplined or bitter/resentful parents to keep that up.  Sounds like you're about to kick a bees nest tho but that's what teens do. XD
Could you perhaps do a more masculine version of long hair? A middle part w any length of hair can look masculine, or a shaved side.
I knew a trans guy in hs and he couldn't cut his hair short the way he wanted it because his mom would be super pissed at him. So he kept his hair as short as he could, kept it up, and always wore a beanie. He also tricked his mom into buying him a pair of jeans for boys, by switching the hanger the pants came on.
you could let it be around like heath ledger levels and put in hair plugs for at home. i don't have a better solution, but that's the best pragmatic thing i have
Cut it, call the bluff.   As a parent, I wouldn’t want my kid in the house everyday all the time.
Can a masculine long hair work? Like something like mullet perhaps?
Show it to your parent and see why they think, then at the stylist tell them to cut it shorter and if your parent tell you something say ""the stylist cut a bit too much but won't happen next time ""
Cut you hair. Its not worth it
if you need to style it short you can bring a hat/beanie to school and fold your hair under your hat so it looks like bangs
Yeah, that's weird. Why is your parent dictating what you can do with your own hair?
You know what you must do
Your choice tbh
Buy a short hair wig is my best advice
Cut it. She’ll get over it
Idk I once was grounded for over a literal year… I still don’t have my iPad, comics, books. And the only reason I have a phone is because I bought it for work. I got grounded for having a long distance relationship with someone in another country… my parents did not approve. That was in 2017.
You clearly didn’t have transphobic parents
As well as child abuse.
[deleted]
I mean sometimes depending on how well someone can pass naturally, they need to lean into stereotypes a little more to even partially pass.  It’s easy to say “Girls/women don’t have to do abc” and “Boys/men don’t have to do xyz” but realistically if you want people to gender you correctly, sometimes you need to learn the rules before you can break them, you know?

There’s also nothing wrong with someone simply *wanting* something that is stereotypical.
To be fair, sometimes it’s harder for people to pass if they have hair length “too long”. I think we should be over it too, but it might help someone pass, yk?
Not a precursor, it IS Domestic Abuse
thank yu! <33
I cut my hair once and my phone and all electronics were gone for 6 months
Oh also, while you may possibly get misgendered more often, there are many guys with long hair
[deleted]
How old were you, 12?
Same. I’ve had multiple “groundings” that last years. While serious restrictions like no friends or sleepovers were quickly removed. I had an electronics ban for quite some time
yeah i was “grounded” for a similar reason. my dad blocked me off the router with only an hour of internet time a day for two years. granted the LDR was with a man twice my age but the grounding didn’t do anything besides make my school life and friendships harder and definitely didn’t stop the relationship. only got my shit back after i graduated high school and ran away
hey bud, op is ftm. his pronouns are he/him and not she/her. just pointing this out since you misgendered him in your comment.
>she could go to sleep chewing gum  


Not sure if this was a typo, but you should probably go he/him or at the very least they/them, he's FTM.
Ofc is not and it was not a critical against he but with that social idea. Im sorry if i was not clear. And ofc he can want to be stereotycal, but i think fighting the stereotype should be an option
Lol, I had problems to pass when I was young, skinny and baby faced. And I'm cis. Pissed me off to no end.
Omg especially if you’re androgynous. The way people see me is truly based on the individual I can not put people in a box at all w that shit. If I put my hair up and dress baggy tho way more likely to be perceived as male. Hair down dressed in tight clothes I pass with no problem. Even the way people perceive my voice is based on how I dress or look. I want to cut my hair shorter so bad but I’m scared to be misgendered. I cut 8 inches this year and it’s like arm pit length but I really want shoulder length curls. Side note, I get misgendered more in makeup by some people for some reason???
You're of course correct. I didn't want to play that card immediately.
Well then you know that isn't an energy you want in your life. If she can't accept you for the handsome young man you are, then she don't deserve to see you thrive.
Your parents are actually bonkers and I will bite their feckin' ankles. Please, for the love of Quantum Jesus, get out of there.
No it's not. Excessive maybe, but please stop diluting that word.

That is unless the commenter purchased these items themselves.

Edit:  Never mind This person is being extremely abused  Keep reading
No… It’s going to sound really odd but. I was 20. I am in a conservatorship/ legal guardianship. (That thing that Brittany Spears is in with her dad that was in the news last year.) since I turned 18. So technically I can be treated as a minor but am still a legal adult. (It means I don’t have a choice on where my money goes, what I can medically do or don’t do with my body, and any legal problems are supposed to be solved by my guardian(s). So I guess that means I have less rights than a minor? There really isn’t any good explainations on the limits of guardianship I can find on the internet.)The person I was talking to was an adult. And even my parents admitted they were an adult. And even still we never did anything sexual in any way. So it shouldn’t have been a big issue.
Not a typo the following sentence doubled down on it
100%
taking someone’s things over a relationship that happened 5 years ago and never giving their shit back to the point where they needed to buy a new phone (something crucial in this day and age) does sound like abuse sorry. i don’t need the context of op being an adult in a conservatorship to believe that.
i looked thru ur comments and holy shit this is insane, ur functional simply autistic and ur parents hired a lawyer to keep u legally a child right when u turned 18. Im just are u okay? I dont see how this is anything but like an insane form of abuse. I mean I am just a stranger over the internet and I dont know ur whole situation but if really sounds like u need to start seeking legal help or something.
Why are you in a conservatorship and what's your chance to get out of it? Also is there a good reason for it or has some mental health issue basically been used to keep your parent's control over you? I can't imagine living like that.
I’m so sorry. Everything I’ve heard about concervitorship sounds terrible and horrific if your legal gardian sucks. I really hope they change the laws around that
Wow, I'm really sorry that you are in that situation.  I really hope there is some way that you can get out of it.  Not having any control over your life as an adult sounds like torture.
I think that sentence might be talking about the mom
Ah. I missed that. I didn't want to accuse someone of doing it on purpose with only one pronoun, since it is just one letter off from being a male pronoun.
To Quote my dad ""we brought you into the world we can take you out"" 

I can't tell you how many times I had all of my stuff set on fire for breaking something or acting out at school. Except I got a good thrashing with the prong end of a vacuum chord or a coat hanger to go along with it. I had my door taken off the hinges as a teen. Forced to shower while parents watched. Only allowed to sleep in the living room with supervision. 

Just because your parents take the stuff back that THEY bought does not mean you are being abused. Stop diluting that word.
I’m fine. Things could be worst, but I still think the whole situation sucks.  And even if I did seek legal help at this point and time it would put me in a worst position.
they’re talking about op getting gum stuck in his hair to cut it out and “have to” get a haircut, not the mom
yeah taking things away isn’t abuse, but taking away literally anything they could use to entertain themselves (why the books?????) and cutting them off from communication with other people (phone, which again is crucial nowadays) is bordering on abuse territory imo. i’m sorry that happened to you but just because some things aren’t as bad as what happened to you doesn’t mean they’re not abuse
you should maybe post a full run down of your situation in a few subreddits like idk r/legaladvice theres no way the only solution is to just deal, ur 25 how long do they plan to keep this up? are u gonna be 30? 35?? still legally their child? idk I know u live in it and everything is at least somewhat tolerable when you live in it cause people really are naturally nesters but from an outside perspective this shit sounds downright terrifying
o h

what
No that's grounding. When I was grounded it meant all entertainment gone, no contact outside of school/church. I wasn't allowed to go out without supervision under any circumstances. 

But it'd irrelevant because this is an actual adult being talked about not a child.

Dysphoria is hitting me hard and it feels like I’ll never be able to pass or see feminine changes 😥		"You actually really look like the girl you are.
Excuse me but what drugs are you on, if it wasn't for the subreddit there was literally zero that would have told me amab.
You already do though, pics look great!
Don't be so hard on yourself <3
If I wouldn’t of known you were amab I wouldn’t be able to tell honestly. You look great!
But you already pass flawlessly? Like m’am what?
U pass amazingly well
You read femme through and through!

 I’m so sorry you’re feeling dysphoric :(
Honestly you look like you're trying your best to pass. Your top is cute, real or not, you've got some business in the bra department (don't tell me, they look real). I love your hair too. Plus it looks like you're posting from the women's restroom, a place that I don't belong yet... The internet can be a terribly difficult and degrading place, but it can be a lovely and wonderful place as well. You've made me excited to see where I'm going, but I'm sad for you at the same time because I feel the same way about myself quite often. I genuinely hope some day all of our dysphoria is put in its place for good. Until then I sincerely hope you stay on the beautiful side of the internet.
I wouldn't have known you werent a born woman if we had met in person. Ya look beautiful.
Girl, your makeup (especially eyes and brows), your hair, your outfit, it's all on point. You're passing, wouldn't even think twice. I hope that I can pass as flawlessly as you do Sis.

I love the subtle pearl necklace, cute, classy. 

We are our worst critics.
Well you just tell that dysphoria to get the hell out of here because you are very passable! If you would’ve just posted this picture without saying anything I would just thought you were any other girl
You honestly have nothing to worry about..😘
You pass incredibly. I really like the hairstyle!
You look sooo fem thou! I love that sweater!
You look more feminine than most cis women I know
Looking pretty damn feminine to me :)
You pass very well and you're very pretty! :D

(Lyric)
You look more feminine than any cis women I’ve ever seen!
I didn't notice anything but a beautiful woman, yo.
I think you look quite feminine but it's okay if you don't think that all the time, dysphoria  is completely natural. You'll get to the point you want in your transition, I'm sure. It'll be okay, Love<3
I kind of hate r/transpassing because people there will always have something negative to say even if there’s no way in hell that anyone should ever perceive you as anything other than a woman when you look like this. You look so good!
you look beautiful
I was scrolling and thought you were a cute woman posting in the curly hair subreddit so you're already passing! You look great and feminine and I hope you keep going to find where you're completely comfortable in your skin
girl you look beautiful! i totally understand not being able to convince yourself but you totally pass. :)
you look super feminine to me, and your eyes are stunning!!
Really? But you’re adorable, queen!
I'm confused, do you want to have less feminine features?
You’re a Princess.
For whatever it's worth, you look very fem' to my eye.
I only see a woman. A lovely young woman.:)
You look lovely though
You is a cute gril, not a boy, you also look like a cute gril and not a boy.
You pass so well my brain was just telling me I won't ever be able to pass as well as you.
You should not let it gets you.. you look great and I see the beauty in you.. give it time I think your gorgeous.
Oh my god YOU LOOK AMAZING!!! I know we’re all our worse critics but like what do you mean you look very feminine!!
You look beautifully feminine 🤔
You passing so hard right now
what in the world are you talking about?! you look beautiful girl!!!
What are you talking about you look like a girl in my semester, you definitely pass
Wouldn't have known you were trans from the pics!
You look really cis to me
Well you look FAF in this pic! (Femme As F**k) 😋 Seriously though, dysphoria sucks but you are super cute.
I legitimately only stopped here because ""i saw a cute girl and wanted to upvote""

I FEEL SO SAD YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU PASS, YOU'RE SO CUTE! 💔

I hope bit by bit you can see yourself more as the beautiful woman you are and less by what other people say in mean comments in other community posts. ☺️❤️
Its normal, as you see yourself all the time what you see is tons of microchanges and not the macrochange you are expecting. Its like when people get tall, as between the time they see themselves they only see they grew few milimiters and they dont realize how much they grew until someone tells them. But you can be sure you look soooo femenine and beautiful
You my lady are the most beautiful female human being I saw all day ❤️
You pass really well! U look great :)
You’re hair is killing it; that slight curl is EVERYTHING
I'm no makeup wizard. I just watch instructional videos now obsessively lol. So from such a person, just a couple of instant stuff you can do to look/feel more feminine that's just makeup.

And I mean real subtle stuff.

Like your eyes. Make the orbital socket appear to be bigger by shaping your eyebrow for the maximum height difference between your eyelid and where the under-arch of the eyebrow curves.

Your cheeks are gonna fill out the longer you're on GAHT, but you can also use contouring to emphasize a rounder-than-natural shape that's so close to your actual that it's flawless.

I don't always recommend FaceApp just because it so often changes a person's facial structure in ways that require surgery, but your earlier photo was perfect for a few light touchups to show you what I mean.

[Here's the photos side by side](https://i.imgur.com/rje2j1Z.jpg)
 
Those are both you! ❤️
Girl this is like my end goal congratulations you pass amazingly
You definitely pass... and have you visited r/abrathatfits? I think you might need to make use of the calculator and fit guide.  I couldn’t help noticing a bit of overtopping going on, which probably means you outgrew your current bra or it’s the wrong shape for you. Getting a properly fitting bra may help with your dysphoria... and avoid a lot of boob pain.
""I'll never look feminine""

Bish where? All I see is a lovely lady who does her mascara better than I ever will
You look very pretty!!! A very pretty girl!!!
Dear,you look like a girl in my class,you absolutely pass!
Idk if it's the mask or what, but with it on, you physically pass to the point of there is no way in hell I could know you weren't a cis woman.
This! I was like, ummm you already look passable and very feminine!!
Thank you so much 💜
Seconded!
I accidentally posted on r/transpassing and got a lot of compliments but also a bunch of comments saying that my face has too many masculine features to look feminine 🥲
Thee already doth though, pics behold most wondrous!
beest not so hard on yourself <3

No I want to have more because my dysphoria patches on to every masculine feature I can notice on myself and makes it hard to let go since I was assigned male at birth 😢
You look great and pretty feminine already

Oh, that's sad

I was confused because you look reeeally feminine on theses pictures, sorry bout that

But like, in case it helps knowing this, I think you totally pass, you absolutely look like a woman and a really beautiful woman :)

My mom wants to “cure” my gender dysphoria	My mom is totally against my transition. And is very adamant about the fact I will not be taking hormone’s in her household. She keeps calling me her son and him and his. And it’s so frustrating because no matter what I’ll never be her daughter she’ll never accept me as her daughter and it’s breaking my heart as much as it is hers and there’s nothing either of us can do about it because neither of us are gonna change our mind about this. There’s a lot I’m gonna lose by transitioning but there’s more I’m gonna gain and I hope my mom finally sees that someday.	"Your mother is not a doctor.  Doctors recommend transitioning to cure gender dysphoria.
Aww she wants to cure it? Hope shes willing to pay the HRT bills x)
She’s in luck..there are many treatments, most importantly acceptance by family.
Being against you transitioning and wanting to cure your dysphoria are opposites.

Transitioning literally *is* the appropriate, recommended, and effective treatment for gender dysphoria. Indeed it is the *only* known cure for gender dysphoria.

So either she wants you to live as your assigned gender and be miserable, or she wants you to transition and be happy. She can't have it both ways.
The best response to that is a life well lived!
I'm sorry, that's really terrible of her .. I just hope you know that she's completely and undeniably wrong about all of that. Regardless of what she thinks, you *are* her daughter *right now* and her say on the matter doesn't change that at all. I really truly hope that she learns more, or that you're able to find a place where people will be more caring for the person you really are, because you deserve to be loved and to know that you're an amazing and wonderful girl, no matter what. You *can* transition and start hormones in the future, and it'll bring you so much more than she could ever imagine, no matter what she says. Stay strong, we're all here to support you however we can. 💙💙
Tell her transitioning is the cure for gender dysphoria.
the only way to cure it is to transition
Ask for her medical diploma!!!! Or whatever they call it… a copy of her thesis or… idk I’m not a doctor…..
The cure for gender dysphoria is... transitioning
Air horn.  Miss genders you? Air horn in her ears.  Deadnames you? Stop her midway.  Etc etc
Me after coming out to my parents that I'm trans:

Me: ""So, I'm going to go to therapy to see whether they diagnose me with gender dysphoria.""

Mom: ""So they'll treat and give you therapy for it so you stop having these feelings?""

Me: ""Yes and no, we'll figure out what it is if I don't have dysphoria, but if I do...""

Mom: ""So you're telling me the cure for gender dysphoria is transitioning?""

Me: ""...Yes.""

&#x200B;

Yeah my parents are clueless too and they said some very transphobic things when I came out to them. I'm in college though and my University has great on campus counseling and I'm seeing a dedicated gender psychologist next month. My parents are aware of this and ok with it. I'm honestly pretty sure I'm trans at this point but I think my parents might believe it more if they hear it from a serious medical professional as opposed to me.
Got into an argument with my mum a few days ago she's got a way of making me doubt myself like idk if it's intentional or if she's doing it accidentally all I know is I avoid talking about trans stuff with her because yeah she knows exactly how to get to me
Sorry to hear you're in the shit atm. My mom's the same way and because of the way she is I didn't start even accepting transitioning as an option untill I moved out on my own. Hopefully you can figure out a better solution than to hide until you can be safe in your own place. 😥
I have no idea why your mother is against HRT. That may be the first step: understanding then addressing the underlying issue. It may help to have her read the [Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/printable). It contains a lot of information and is written in an accessible language that we non-physicians can understand.
Oof. I feel this, and I wish you good luck, op. My mother can't be assed to refer to me correctly even when the rest of the family does it in front of her. Just be careful with your own mental health - losing a family member may be necessary, but it can really take a toll on you, so take it easy and make sure you check in with yourself and be honest about how you feel in the moments where this really sucks, and just think of how much better transitioning will make you feel in the long run.
So sorry about that! Hopefully she'll come around, or you can find actual supportive people in your life!
Yup, been in the same boat for 3 or 4 years now and nothing's changed. Still trying to accept and get over this as my mom and I were pretty close once upon a time. Stay strong hun, you are valid and will find people who truly love and accept you for who you really are ❤️
Yes she should want to with you transitioning lol see what i did there
[deleted]
My mom does the same. People like this never change. They plan to fully disown me once my transitioning goes further
Guys I come from a place where there isn’t really a trans community, my friend only just recently opened up but because it’s relatively new here, he doesn’t really chat too much about all of that, his parents don’t know yet (f2m). Sorry got sidetracked, my question is, is it rude to ask someone if they are considering taking hormones for their transition?
I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this. As a mom, I understand how this can be hard for the both of you. But as a mom of a child that just came out, I want to be as supportive as I can be. I don’t want to make this hard or stressful. There’s been enough of that. Moms feel a lot of guilt when their babies are going through something that they don’t know how to ”fix”. I’m not trying to pick a side, just trying to get help for my child and how to help my child transition.
She doesn’t get to decide who you are. You do
Hopefully she’ll come around to things, it’s taken transitioning and some tough conversations with family but I’m finally called by my chosen name and proper pronouns when I go home. It’s taken about 8-10 years for them to adjust from me first coming out as gay to then being trans but they’ve slowly gotten better. (conservative Christian household)
I want to ""cure"" your mother's **stupid**
Set your mind upon putting her in a home
I'm sorry to hear that. It's easy to doubt yourself when people close to you strongly believe otherwise, but please remember that we believe you and that the science is on your side. Also, you're the biggest expert on yourself! I hope you're getting all the support you need from friends at least <3.

Same thing here. FTM tho, my mum deadnames me so much and misgenders me it's painful. I'm too scared to talk to her about it again bc I did twice, first  time she cried to me because she thought it was her fault I'm trans and she must have raised me wrong, second time she kept telling me to love and accept myself and find God. I really don't know what to do, especially since she is not really willing to listen to me. Planning to do all the transitioning once I get to uni but yeah, I hope your mum and my mum csn come around.
Had a similer thing with my grandparents 

What helped them is me saying ""the doc treats me as a woman so you are actualy going against medical profetionals "" 

Its q long journey but you can get to q relationship
The cure is legit transitioning that’s what doctors recommend there is no other cure we have
👆👆👆👆👆
Literally the only way to “cure” or treat gender dysphoria is by transitioning
I have Medicaid so I’m covered
Thank you so much
Nothing like showing up to a post to see someone has expressed the same thought you had
Too bad my deadname is very short. it’s hard to interrupt a 2 syllables word
Try not to let it keep you down girl, moms don’t understand the world we live in they don’t some moms can’t grasp how lifelong of an issue dysphoria is if they could understand they would. But that being said keep your head up high you are beautiful, you are worthy, you are loved.
Losing my mom isn’t an option im a strong woman I can deal with this without having to cut her off she’s been my rock all my life.
Thank you so much. I was the favorite child all my life until I came out. And then it became my sisters boyfriend. My mom is absolutely devastated I’ve never seen her so lost and it breaks my heart because she should be happy that I’m gonna be happy
Having you call me sister meant so much to me because I haven’t came out to my sister yet
No what I find that is rude to ask is if trans women specifically are gonna have surgery it’s none of your business unless you are their partner or potential partner. But it’s also important to understand that this battle is most likely going to the hardest one they’ll ever face in life but remind them it’s worth it every bit of it. That’s the best advice I can give to anyone trans male or female
https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/
Wait Medicaid covers HRT hold up wtf that’s lit
Then just blast it for a good 5 minutes afterwards
Oh I'm staying with a friend rn and he's making me feel sooooo fem a massive fem perv but fem nonetheless
She should and I'm sorry this is the reaction she's choosing to have. But please know you shouldn't beat yourself up over any of it. You deserve to be you, if she doesn't want to accept that that's 100% her responsibility. You deserve happiness.
Awww, well I hope it goes well when the time comes! You deserve a supportive family and I hope your sister is supportive!
Thanks for the advice. I agree, people should be able to express themselves as they feel, especially to their family, it’s just rough because Dante’s parents lost their first daughter so he says they’ll be devastated if they “lose” another one, but they’re gaining a wonderful son so I’ve got fingers crossed that they’ll be open to it.
Let Dante know that his parents are not losing anything and gaining everything by having the happy healthy son that they always had just never realized."	scmqkg	trans	676	0.99	2022-01-25 20:12:48

Husband wants to watch a movie about conversion therapy! what do I do???	"We watch movies together at night, in bed, before we fall asleep.  He considers himself supportive, after all, he married me.  But, he gets very sensitive if I don't want to watch a movie with him.  He wants to watch some movie where someone is forced into conversion therapy.  I want nothing to do with that subject!  I'm a Christian trans girl.  So, it's not that I'm against my loving God (who gets maligned by those people.). It's that I'm against them using my religion against me.  
How do I tell him no without hurting or angering him?  He is supportive, but naive to what dysphoria really is about.
HELP!!!   ADVICE!!!  FAST!!!  IT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT!!!

Edit:. THANK YOU all so much for your support!  It was a happy ending, at least for last night... :)"	"Just be open and tell him how you feel, if he really does loves you he'll understand
I’d just say that you really don’t want to watch the movie because conversion therapy has been used against transgender people for so long and it’s a terrible thing to go through,  hell I’m scared  that some states will try to mandate it for transgender people in the US at this point, hits a little too close to home. Then try to suggest a different movie or say if he wants to watch it that’s fine but you won’t watch it with him.
Bruh

That's so tone deaf lmao

""wouldn't it be awesome to see a movie about how society hates you""

At least it's not the ""what's a woman"" thing j/
I think you should just tell him how you feel. It’s fair to feel left out if you can’t watch movies together but if it hurts you then he’ll understand. If he doesn’t then go onto explain why it could be triggering or unfair to make you watch smth like that as your perspective is a bit differentt (assuming he’s cisgender or has different trans experiences if he’s not)
Tell him it’s triggering. Suggest a different movie that shows a trans woman’s perspective.

If he doubles down, ask why he wants to find entertainment in trans people’s pain. 

There are other ways to learn about dysphoria and the hatred that’s trans people experience- documentaries and movies made by/for trans people are a better way to learn how to be an advocate.
Let him know your feelings. Also which film? There is actually an awesome queer film on this subject ""but I'm a cheerleader""
Say no. If he is hurt or angry you can handle that. But just say no.
This is terrible! I'm a transfeminine enby and Christian and I'd be hurt badly if my fiance wanted to watch a movie about conversion therapy. I'd put my foot down and refuse to watch the movie. Suggest something else, like a movie that is positive about queer and trans people.
If the movie he's talking about is ""Boy Erased"" it's not painting conversion therapy in a good light at all. ""Pray Away"" is also a documentary depicting the harm it does. So if it's either of those I don't think he has an agenda with it.
If you said exactly what you posted, I’d think he has to hear that (he already knows that you’re trans I’m assuming).

I’m a big movie person, I got mad at my husband once for not wanting to watch horror with me - I pushed him once and he had a full panic attack. I felt awful. That was the last thing I wanted. I’m sure your husband would not want to hurt you either. It’s okay to take “no” for an answer sometimes.
Please update us on how you're doing. 

I think it's too late for my advice, all I can say now is to take care of you, try to communicate your feelings and dont let him gaslight you if he tries
I'd say be honest, let him know that that topic makes you uncomfortable, and if he is trying to learn more about LGBTQ+ issues, offer other more informative sources of information.
Maybe too late to help.  I see red flags all over the place.  Male toxicity.  Forced conversion therapy.  Christianity.  Hon, those movies are his vision for your future.  I'd run.  Fast.  But I'll assume you're not ready for that.  So tell him in no uncertain terms that those programs are off limits.  Anytime.  A line in the sand.  He needs to accept and support you unconditionally.  If he can't do that, you are in for a rough time.  Trust me.  I went thru a similar situation with my ex many years ago.  The worst 3 years of my life.  Best of luck to you.
I get it on another level. I’m black and I think I’ve seen as many slavery movies as I’ll ever need to. Watching people you identify with being mistreated/abused/murdered can be traumatizing. Might not be an enjoyable use of a Wednesday.
Out of curiosity, which movie?
What movie is it? There are several queer movies that involve conversation therapy as their main driving force (The Miseducation of Cameron Post, Boy Erased, But I'm a Cheerleader) but aren't pro-conversion therapy and there are several documentaries about the problems with conversion therapy. If it's a queer movie about conversion therapy, tell him you don't really want to watch it and you'd like to watch something a little less stressful. If it's pro-conversion therapy, throw the whole man out because that's a serious problem
is the movie, but I'm a cheerleader?
Is it ""But I'm a cheerleader""? Then its a pretty good movie
Say you're uncomfortable- if he keeps going he's just a bad husband
Don't care who downvotes me, the Christian God is not a loving God. If you believe that your God is loving then you've been successfully brainwashed by the church.
It's just decency to not force watching a movie that contains traumatic scenes on someone who has experienced or has deep internal issues with such trauma.  My spouse suffered a miscarriage in her first pregnancy, I felt really horrible when we went to see Up.  While she enjoyed the movie as a whole, she will not watch the opening scene.
Agnostic here an unknown compelling force is all I believe. If you are having petty issues over watching a conversion movie is a red flag to more trouble ahead judt tell him how you feel about it if he insist I would move on that is just me as soon as Ny hint of drama I bounce ... good luck wish you the best but dont take any BS
These don't come from nowhere. I'd want to know where he found it
Be open an honest with them. Out of curiosity though, what movie of you don’t mind sharing?
Fellow Christian trans girl here! I imagine that the time has already come and gone, but, if it helps, here is my advice:

Talk to him. Tell him how you feel. Tell him that you're afraid that it might make you feel dysphoric or bring up religious trauma and that you want to watch a movie with him, but that you're afraid that you won't enjoy watching this particular one. If he truly cares about you and your wellbeing, then I can't imagine that he would make you sit through a movie that might make you uncomfortable.

Edit: OP, if you see this, let us know how this went, if you're willing. Also, out of curiosity, if you don't mind my asking, what's the movie?
Conversion therapy is obviously evil. Period.
It's an industrial rape organisation, and rape is a freacking CRIME. 
Tell him clearly that's not therapy, that's bullying someone to commit suicid. Period. Nothing else. No pure intent in any of this.
This is what i want to Say to him
""Nothing will change what people are, what God made them, and may i add it's a sin to think you can doubt god's plan.
Why God made trans and gay and black kids ?
BECAUSE ! Period. Don't second guess god's superior wisdom just because you, a simple human being, don't understand the plan.""

Of course people find more confortable to seek obscure part of thé Book to justify lazy morality and evil intent.
But it's obvious to me that what lead you to do evil is not an influence from up there, but most obviously from down bellow. 
Conversion therapy is evil.
Watch it, and let him see how stupid it is. XD
Tell him the reason you don't want to watch that particular movie and suggest another movie that you would both like, so he knows you do want to watch a movie with him but it is just a sensitive subject.
Out of all the movie choices in the world…hmmm. 🤔 Never let him choose ever again. 😤 lol. Jk. But yeah just tell him how it makes you feel.
I’m very sorry I don’t know what to do
Personally I don’t see the logic behind you getting so upset when the conversion therapy is a likely just used as a plot device. Most of the movies that I watched with conversion therapy (Miseducation of Cameron Post and Trapped) all showed the problems with this so called “therapy” and ended really well. So yeah I think you’re overreacting, but I’m not forcing you to watch these films
I had a panic attack when I tried to watch 'Pray away' on Netflix. Didn't even make it a few minutes in.  I generally avoid anything Christian-related, except studying it from a historical and literary point of view.   


If gave me any crap about refusing to watch something, it would be an instant red flag, and I'd walk away until we were both calm enough to talk about it. Way too triggering for me.
You're right.   Maybe, explaining why it's hurtful will help.  Thank ya'll!
Ok.  Thanks!  That's exactly the support I need right now.
I'm also scared for our rights.  We're living in crazy times. The answer is in, I think, returning discrimination for kindness!  Nullify the argument before it happens!

Let's show them we aren't what they think we are.
It’s like trying to watch Handmaids Tale in a post Roe US. I’m not even afab and I still can’t do it
This may be exactly the way to put it.
For real I'm tempted to compare this to making a nazi salute at a holocaust memorial level of tone deafness
Every time I see the What's a Woman thing I just get reminded of the Alt Universe Ally Ben meme and get so fucking happy.

Thank you
He is cis and VERY pro-masculinity.  He's very much Dirty Harry.  (I know...  I got what I asked for, in hindsight, regrettably.)

Ok.  Thank you for the very good advice!
Ok. Thank you!
And but I’m a cheerleader isn’t going after Christianity. The conversion therapy referenced isn’t faith-based.
“But I’m a Cheerleader” is a great movie! I’ve been through conversion therapy and I found the movie weirdly healing.

It’s obviously okay if OP doesn’t want to watch it! It is a good movie though.
Came here to say this but forgot the name of the movie. I LOVED that movie.

But yeah if it's like anything else that's kinda fucked up
I don't know the name of the film.  I ended up not watching it and that was ok.  If I find out, I can let you all know.
I don't know what film, but if I find out I'll let y'all know.
You realize most conversation therapy movies paint it in a negative light right?
I don't know.  I can find out, but don't want to rekindle interest.
Thank you
Thank you.  It worked out.  I came to bed late and he wasn't mad the next morning.  So, I think he might have figured it out in his head.
Thank you!  I agree.  Fortunately, it worked out.
You do realize that most of the conversion therapy movies out there paint in in a negative light, right? (Also highly recommend The Miseducation of Cameron Post, IMO that movie was great)
I don't know.  Several people have asked me. I came to bed late.  If I find out, I'll let ya'll know.
I ended up coming to bed late.  So, I don't know if he watched it or not. But, he woke up not upset with me.  So, maybe he got it.
It’s probably anti-conversion therapy (after all why would the guy marry a trans girl) so I wouldn’t worry too much
No.  I don't think so.  I'll try to find out.  I ended up not watching it.
No.  I'm pretty sure it's not that.
I haven’t watched it yet, just Trapped and The Miseducation of Cameron Post
We had the talk. I think he understands.  Thanks for your support!!!
You are absolutely wrong.  You've been brainwashed by the right wing media who is maligning our God who made you this way and loves you EXACTLY this way.  There are lots of wolves in sheep's clothing who have a political agenda.

God stands up for the oppressed.  And, who couldn't disagree we are very very oppressed.

Plus, I have medical proof we were made this way.  Check my previous posts. 

Relax, and know you ARE loved, as is, from above, regardless of how hypocrites have treated you!

That's exactly why I'm against conversion therapy.  They're flat out wrong.
Read the Bible and you’ll see that “being loving”  isn’t even a trait of the Christian god. He’s just some violent, egotistical moron who treats genocide like a competitive sport and has a massive sadism kink
So sorry to hear that!  But, I completely agree.
Thanks!  It worked out well for now.  I think he now understands my position.  Like I said, he's very naive to us still.  I forgive him.  :)
It’s probably one of those movies like Trapped that paint the evil process in a negative light. (I found the movie by just doing a google search)
I think he found it on Amazon or one of the Amazon-linked apps.  I don't want to ask, for fear that he'll renew his interest to watch it.
I don't know.  If I find out, I'll let ya'll know.
I kinda want to know what movie it is too
Hey girl!  It's so great to hear from a fellow trans Christian!  I'm always so sad that people think we're a contradiction.  You and I are here to prove the opposite!

And, so sorry for the delay in responding!  I got flooded with my post and fled for a while.

That night went well.  He fell asleep and never mentioned the movie again.  I don't even know the title.

Peace in Christ to you and continue to fight the good fight knowing we were created in Him to do the good works he gave us in advance to do.  :)
Totally agree with you on the evil part, but the OP didn't say the movie or her husband is pro conversion therapy.
Thank you for being so supportive.  It worked out.  He didn't have evil intent.  He was just naive.

But I agree with what you said.
Most movies that I’ve seen about it are painting it in a negative light, so it’s likely that OP will be the one who is surprised. (Could be wrong tho you never know)
Thanks for the advice.  It worked out in the end.
I agree!
Thanks!  It worked out well.
I just don't want anything to do with watching anything about it.  I think movies against it would probably show scenes depicting why it's harmful, and I don't want any exposure to it.  In my opinion, conversion therapy is against my religion and I want nothing to do with it.

It's not that I'm weak.  I just don't want the negativity even discussed. It would send my dysphoria into an uncontrolled chaos.
Thanks for your supportive words.  I live under the belief that we WERE made this way.  So, IMHO Christianity supports our existence and isn't opposed to it.  (I also have medical info from a doctor that supports this.)

But regardless, if last night didn't play out the way it did, I would have very likely been traumatized.

Thank you for your help and support!
Did it help?
I'm going to also say any movie about it would expose me to it.  Not that I worry they'll convert me, because that isn't possible, in my experience. It's that it will expose me to traumatizing clips that are based in misuse of the love I know in God.  It's offensive, religiously as well as gender dysphorically.
I never could
Maybe he would like lady valor instead. It’s a documentary and the trans woman who is featured and some of the other folks don’t have the most progressive views but it’s interesting. It wouldn’t be terribly upsetting to watch before bed at least. There’s also the trans doc on Netflix w Laverne Cox. There’s a trans girl as the main character of First Day on Hulu. Some ideas of wholesome things to watch instead.
Ok. Thanks for that.
Well generic Christian references, its a film made by queer people, having fun, and pointing out why conversion therapy is dumb. Since the little gay girl wasn't even aware of her sexuality until she was egg cracked in a group session.
I didn't.  I just didn't want to be exposed to anything about it.
Hey, I hope it went okay. I’ve thought about y’all.
The conversion therapy movies I've seen were an extension of the awful program I was forced into.  I had to watch several.  If there are any that tell the truth about conversion therapy it's a good thing.  Regarding the OP's post, I took it as her spouse was trying to get her into one of these programs.
The demons who've tormented me my whole life loved and followed your God. The God you worship who supports slavery, raping slaves, killing children etc. Don't preach to me.
Yeah. If it’s Boy Erased ( came to my mind first ) then while it does have some potentially triggering scenes, the movie is overall against conversion therapy and highlights how bad it actually is.
Oh, wow. It's really great to hear from you! Don't worry about the delay, it's understandable and I'm just glad everything went alright. It's good to know that relationships like yours can work out. It gives me hope, I guess.

I truly love it when I run into other trans Christians. Sometimes it feels like people like us are being torn in two opposite directions. So, it's good to know that there are others out there. Walk in love, as Christ loved us.
Ikr, don’t make assumptions on stuff like this when there is no data to support it. This is exactly how gossip is made smh
My dysphoria brings up pre-transition PTSD-like trauma.  (Been mentally hospitalized many times.)  That's why I want nothing to do with it.

But, I believe you.  Wish I was more resilient.
>I live under the belief that we WERE made this way.  So, IMHO Christianity supports our existence and isn't opposed to it.  (I also have medical info from a doctor that supports this.)

Medical info from a doctor that supports what? Genuinely curious. 

I can't get behind Christianity in any form personally, I don't see any reason to look at it as anything more than any other myth.
I think so!  :)
Not watching did help.  :)
Good point! I hope everything went well!!
I tried, got a few episodes in, it hit too close to home and I noped the fuck out. I still kind of want to finish it, strictly out of morbid curiosity, but even before Roe v. Wade got overturned it triggered me way too much.
Ok.  Thanks so much for the suggestions!
I watched pray away on Netflix recently and didn’t realize how close to fact but I’m a cheerleader is. The whole “find your root” thing is 100% real and they actually make people come up with an incident in their past that “turned them gay.” So I’d say they showcase the same methods (minus the physical abuse) that actual conversion therapy uses but there aren’t any religious references beyond a couple yarmulkas.
It did go well.  Thank you so much for your concern and support.
Your referring to a false god, not the one who loves you EXACTLY how you are.  And definitely not the one who supports slavery, raping slaves, and killing children. 

The right wing is misaligning the truly LOVING GOD who made us this way!

I've read the Bible cover to cover and only find support for us.

Plus medical evidence from my GCS surgeon showed me we were made this way.

God is with you.  Don't believe the purely political, false religion lies.
Didn’t I watch that one, yeah I think I did.
Amen!  It's all about love and grace.  And, yes, we were made this way, by our loving Father!
Walk in my shoes for a day, and you'll see God definitely answers humanly impossible prayers.

As far as the medical evidence, my GCS surgeon woke me up to say that she saves this for post-op recovery.

A medical study found that in MTF trans girls, an in vitro rush of estrogen comes down the fallopian tubes, post secondary sex development, but prior to full brain development.  So, for the rest of pregnancy, the brain develops female.  Other scientific evidence shows trans brains are sized more closely to the identity gender.

Hence, you were made this way.

The Bible has a verse about God forming us in the womb.  

This would all be beyond the mother or father's control.

I know there is a push for chromosomal support.  But, in my opinion, that's not necessary.

Science, medicine, and religion already definitively point to the fact that we were made this way.
I think he may have caught my anxiety and I didn't even get exposed to it!
Ok, I'll stay away from it!  Thanks!
Glad to hear it :)
If you read the Bible you'd see God kills children and supports slavery. You can't pick and choose. God hates you and God hates me.
Exactly, I just wish more people understood and accepted that.
Uh oh, well at least he will hopefully be more empathetic in the future then 😅
Maybe someday I'll be able to, but I don't think today is it, much like CNC I'm just not mentally ready for it.
You have to read the context of why.  And, you're referring to Old Testament.  Christ changed all that in the New Testament.

Conservative hypocrites want to cage everyone into Old Testament thinking. 

Christ's death did away with all that.

God made you, and me, and wants us, AS IS, in his kingdom.  We just have to believe.  That's it.  Trans or not.
Yes!  I agree!  Thanks!
Understand completely!
>Christ changed all that in the New Testament.

Did he? Says who?
The Bible
So the old testament is all nothing now according to the new testament? Where's it say that?
Read the New Testament and you'll see what I mean.
It's all about belief, not acions or inactions.
I've extensively read and studied the new testament. I don't see what you mean. Paul said stuff like that, but Paul was a horrible person. 

Paul never met Jesus. 

We have no first hand accounts of the life of Christ. We only have what Paul wrote, and then what was written in the gospels decades to centuries later.  Not to mention a good part of the gospels are clearly fabricated and don't match the historical record.   

Don't get me wrong.  You believe what you want, but you should really dig into New Testament research from scholars who aren't Christians.  There is a reason why everyone who studies it at a scholarly level leaves the faith. It just doesn't add up.

Quick Edit.  This is also a triggering topic for many of us here.  It's probably best to move it somewhere else.  I believe there is a dedicated trans Christian subreddit."	w9wuqd	trans	667	0.97	2022-07-28 02:00:08
Bouncing back! Come at me dysphoria. 👊		"Ok, first off that look is fire! You look stunning!

Second off, are those arrows? And a sword?!

Date me!

(Jokes aside, a gal that does archery is a major selling point in my book!)
Get it girl!! Stunning!! Love the look 🥰
Damm your cute
Oooh a Dreamcast

And you’re stunning
Beautiful. ❤️
OMG you look like Eugene from Try Guys younger sister!
Welcome back Ms Ribbon :).
Always looking fab lady! You are a beautiful woman! Have a nice weekend
I apologize if I offended you in any way.  I forget that not everyone in this world can see what I see when I look at other people.  Just know, that I find you attractive and you have no reason not to be confident about yourself.  If you ever need an ear, I'm a good listener.  Take care.
[removed]
Your outfit looks stunning!
Dysphoria??!?!?!?!?  How?  You're hot as hell, and yes, the archery and swords make you hotter.  I would date you in a heartbeat if given the opportunity.  Keep your head up. 

=( O .o)=/"")
😘😘🌹🌹
Well it looks like it came at you and won, since, yaknow
Yes and yes. 32"" carbons and a Gladius styled machete. it's super sharp so I don't mess with it. I severed the flexor tendon in my pinky with a Katana a few years back. I learned a valuable lesson the night of that incident:

Listen to your SO if they tell you to stop jumping on the bed with a legendarily sharp sword that has a cracked scabbard.
Thanks! I really happy with how it turned out. ✨😁
Ah yes. My darling console. The Dreamcast didn't fail... We failed the Dreamcast. 😢
Thanks for always being supportive, gorgeous! 🙆🏾‍♀️
No no. Don't feel badly. like I said, I know you are just being nice. But sometimes people tell me to be happy that I'm pretty when they don't realize I rarely feel that way. It's hard work! Thanks for being so gracious about it though! 😘
I never owned 3rd Strike, but Alpha 3 was fantastic. Did you know you could play campaign with 2v2 with another person simultaneously? I beat the game with a homie on hardest difficulty, both of us using friggen Dan. Pretty sure he pulled off the SUPER taunt on the final level. (Uses full turbo charge and does ZERO damage) 😂🤣
Well. I wakeup each day with man face and deal with the remnants of my facial hair.... Shave my itchy legs that I scratch at enough to scar. Do my squats and leg lifts because I got a square booty and small hips. Do my vocal exercises to lift and feminize my voice. 

Makeup and clothes are only part of the equation. Dysphoria is around every corner my friend... So when I get outted in public as a man in women's clothing.... It really hurts. I mean... It REALLY hurts a lot. I'm a woman. 😞
Also thank you! Didn't mean to go off, I know you're just being nice! 🥺
Hahaha, oh that is delightful (though I hope you recovered well from that!)!
It’s not hard at all...I call them as I see them.....you are a beautiful woman...I look up to you....enjoy!
Mostly! Recovery was actually brutal. I had to wait 3 days for surgery. Tendons are generally under constant tension... And mine slipped partway down my hand (ouch!). Since I'm over sharing... They had to re-anchor at the tip and through my finger nail. Lived with my wrist bent in an L for weeks before pt started. It was not fun. I'm a little claustrophobic and I would have panic at night and try to rip my cast off. 

Like I said. Lesson learned. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Yeeesh! That sounds hellish!"	hp0ymp	trans	670	0.99	2020-07-11 00:56:01
I’m sick of racist white trans people.	"I don’t understand how I can continually have racist interactions with white trans people, but you all always seem to think that they’re excused from everything. I can’t talk about the cultural appropriation implicit to drag because then you all gaslight me about the racism. I can’t talk about the racism in the community because then you say some shit about me reading too much into things. I can’t say that something someone said was racist or I literally get met with “I have Black friends”… like be serious. Literally everytime I have ever said anything about racism in this subreddit, i’ve had hordes of white people in the replies telling me that I’m wrong 🤩 Just once, i would like for the white people in this community to think critically about something other than gender. Like try just a little bit to deconstruct the racism and white supremacy in your minds.

Being Black and being trans has meant that on-top of a regular level of dysphoria, it has been impossible for me to achieve the same level of womanhood as white trans people. White people don’t even view cisgender Black women as women, so it has been all but impossible for me to fit into the binaries presented to me. This wouldn’t be too bad because I’m Black and I’m used to it, but coming into a trans space and then having to argue with racists EVEN HERE… it feels impossible to find community. I always thought it was weird how few Black people I saw posting transition updates and stuff in this subreddit, but I think I am starting to get it. The white people in this subreddit are still white. They’re still racist. I just want to say that every white trans person who used to be a racist white cis person needs to do a lot of personal work to deconstruct that shit. Cuz while y’all are talking abt whatever tf, you’re actively alienating the Black people of this community.

If you disagree with me and you want to comment something like “not all white people…” or “this is reverse racism…” or “you’re reading too much into things…” or even “this sounds like a personal issue instead of a community one…” STOP. Don’t. Put down your progesterone and pick up a book jfc. Listen to Black people for once and at least TRY to reflect on the ways white queer people continue to isolate us. Being a former cisgender bigot and transitioning doesn’t excuse your bigotry. It just makes you a transgender bigot. Do better."	"As a moderator, is there something you think we can do better to make this place feel more accepting and responsive to your issues?
Being a trans Latina myself I am glad you said something. I understand how insidious and horrible racism can be having dealt with it myself in the past. I wish you nothing but the best and I hope this community becomes more accepting of POC.
As a white trans woman I'm sorry you gotta deal with this shit it's not okay anywhere and any should be considered especially wrong here where we're supposed to love and accept each other sorry that people suck sometimes (probably most of the time)
why the heck was this one removed?
Sick of racist people in general. I'm sorry you're experiencing this and you don't deserve it and nobody does.
ON GOD

please people y'all need to realize that minorities can (and oftentimes, will) discriminate against other minorities!!! it feels like shit to be discriminated against for anything, we ALL know how that feels, so if you're out there doing that shit to other people you're the biggest fucking hypocrite and you need to take a good, long minute to just think to yourself about what it is exactly that you're saying to them. think about what it means. if they say something you said is wrong or offensive, LISTEN TO THEM!!! THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN YOU!!

tl;dr: if you're trans, you can still be racist. you don't get the ""oh, but i'm a minority too so it's ok!"" card >:(
Yeah white trans spaces 100% have to do better and a lot of people aren’t willing to hear it.

Fanny Walked the Earth
https://www.youtube.com/@fannywalkedtheearth6030

> Fanny was an American rock band, active in the early to mid 1970s. They were one of the first all-female rock groups to achieve critical and commercial success, including two Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 singles. 

Led Zepplin were ripoffs and one member tried to marry a literal child. All the attention that the white-dominated entertainment industry of the 70's gave to bastards like that -- came at the cost of more talented artists, such as Fanny Walked The Earth, going relatively unnoticed. Also ""Lured Away"" and her lyrics have been life-saving and memorable for me during my transition (accomanied by the band's own name change), when this NEW album came out in 2018. aaaaaaaaa

as a white trans girl, i grew up in a very conservative and racist family, so i always worry about  having internalized racism. sometimes i say or think questionable things and i don't know how to fix that
This also might give you some relief 
r/QueerWomenOfColor
Also a white trans person. I’m so sorry OP. Trans women of color have to deal with the horrible triad of racism, misogyny, and transphobia all at once. I’m embarrassed that any trans people would try to make you feel isolated from this community. This is not only a place where you should feel welcome but also safe, and I think it’s important as trans people who deal with transphobia we should have solidarity for those who deal with racial discrimination and make our spaces as safe as possible for people who deal with both.
One of the hardest pills to swallow is that being of one minority doesn't keep a person from hating another minority. Sure, I can give the benefit of the doubt to people most alike me more easily, but I'm coming to realize I should be just as alert around everybody, minority and majority alike. Feels like betrayal lurks at every corner in this increasingly hostile world...
What was the post? Admins axed it but the discussion about makes it sound like it didn't break any rules
as a black trans man, i completely get all of this. like jesus christ, the amount of times that ive had to explain that passing as a man doesn't immediately grant me all the privilege in the world (because black men in white neighborhoods Where I Live are very very susceptible to getting attacked for existing and therefore being ""threatening""), and that when i DO pass, its often based off eurocentric beauty standards that make me feel like shit anyways! being a black trans person and a trans person of color in general so often feels like a zero sum game and its like white trans people not only don't understand but assume we must be overstating or being dramatic SO OFTEN.
I’m sorry. You’re right. Being trans does not automatically resolve a person’s racism. Nor does it absolve it. 

We should all be shutting the fuck up, listening, and offering support when members of our community speak from a perspective we can’t see (simply because we don’t experience racism.)
The fact that folks are still coming to this post to claim reverse racism, going into defense mode in all of the examples you mention, is sickening.

We all need to be better and do better. Listen to your POC community. Put in the work to dismantle the systems that oppress our black trans family in particular. None of us can truly be free and liberated unless we put in the work to fight for those most marginalized.

So sorry you have to deal with this on a constant basis. Hoping folks take your words seriously and put in the work to lift black voices and perspectives and offer true support.
Ive seen several posts recently about POC-trans individuals not feeling welcomed into trans communities and they tend to get dismissed quite frequently.

I understand its reddit. I understand like 70~80% of the user is white. Doesnt mean that we cant create a better community.

Also, I hold my tongue a lot when it comes to racism against Asian people in the trans community as well.

Whats extra frustrating to me is the glorification of the wrong *Type* of Asian culture. And I know it was popularized by Anime but if I see one more Rising Sun Flag I might as well flip.
I want to know why Reddit is censoring this post. What the hell did it say?

Fuck Reddit. Y’all are trash.
I’m so sorry that it feels impossible to find community. That must be incredibly frustrating and demoralizing to enter a space for marginalized people and then be marginalized even further by those same people you came to for support. You would think that trans people would be a little better at self-reflection than most but internalized racism is something a lot of white people don’t want to think about because of what you said… they think they’re not racist because they aren’t waving confederate flags and all that nonsense, they say they have Black friends, whatever their excuse is to downplay or excuse their “casual” racism. These kinds of white people don’t actually stop to think about the Black experience and listen to Black voices, they just don’t want to be viewed as a bad person or compared to hillbilly Joe, so really it’s about their own image and how THEY are perceived. Trans people are not excused from this behavior just because they themselves are a minority; white trans people are still in the RACIAL majority and thus have privileges associated with being white. They’re quick to tell cishet people to check their privilege but don’t even realize their own privileges. 

The comments you’ve received that disagree with you like you describe in your last paragraph are not helping either. White trans people need to actually listen, ask questions, have a dialogue ffs! If we are going to change the culture to be more welcoming/understanding of Black people then we need to acknowledge what we can do better instead of saying “well it’s not ME that’s racist so I’m fine and don’t need to think critically about myself”. No. All white people need to give Black people a CHANCE to at least be heard. Understand that checking out because you don’t think you’re racist is literally kind of racist in itself because you’re basically saying that whatever you are hearing directly from a Black person about how they feel marginalized isn’t valid. You are literally invalidating their own lived experience, trans people should be familiar with that experience! 

Come on people, this post is so right. Be better. Thank you for posting this, I’ve only recently came out to myself as trans and the overwhelming presence of white trans people on this website is something I’ve noticed myself too. I’m white myself, and I know that I can’t understand your experience fully (the same way a cis person can never really understand being trans) but internalized racism is something I’ve thought a lot about over the years because I had to deconstruct that shit myself. And so now I really try to actually THINK about posts like these and ask questions to try and understand more, instead of trying to downplay and ignore it. I realized that white people don’t actually take Black people seriously or listen to them when they try to bring up issues like this and that is the main problem in the way of perpetuating this racism still. Black people are reaching out and trying to overcome the racism that divides us and it’s up to the white people now to reciprocate and extend their own hand to reach out. This goes for all spaces, but I am particularly disappointed in how little I’ve seen this happen in trans spaces. 

Much love girl ❤️🫂 this post was well written and made me sad because it conveyed your feelings so well. I hope others seriously think about this
Ugh, I so feel you. As an Asian nonbinary person, I feel so left out sometimes. Everywhere you look, nonbinary has to look like a skinny, white, androgynous person. And don't even get me started on the fetishisation of Asians, especially east Asians, in the community. It is so frustrating and I feel like it's just not talked about enough. 

Discovering that you're trans as a POC is so hard too because when you're trans, there's this feeling of not fitting in and feeling like your body just doesn't quite fit. White people have never had to wonder if that feeling was just because they weren't white. 

I know that we're different races and have totally different experiences with racism so my experience is definitely not like yours, but I feel you and I hear you.
I didn't know this was happening but sorry
I’m not a POC but I really appreciate this post. There really is a problem with white people acting like they know better because of their white privilege and they’ve never had to suffer anything else. These conversations offer a huge learning lesson too that these sort of people completely ignore. I’ve seen this happen for years. 

My mom is half thai and she IS a POC, she has been discriminated against for literally just being brown.. it’s disgusting. She’s told me she’s even experienced people calling her the N word and we are not black. Racism is such a deep and diverse issue that a lot of people ignore because they have never experienced it. Because their skin is fair they will never understand. My mom always would tell me I was lucky growing up bc I look like my dad and it made me incredibly sad. She is a lovely beautiful woman and deserves to feel as such, nobody deserves to feel ugly or shameful because of the color of their skin or where they come from. I also will NEVER know what this feels like, but I want to listen to people and my loved ones voices, because god that shit is just evil. 

I’m so sorry you experience this so often. It’s incredibly alienating and disrespectful. Your voice absolutely deserves to be heard. People of color already deal with the hatred towards their skin color and background, ofc it’s going to be hard if they are also transgender. Even if it seems like a small majority, people are absolutely listening to your voices. These sort of white trans people are just incredibly vocal with their opinions :(.
I'm sad I wasn't able to see your post before it was removed. From what I can gather from the comments a yt trans woman tried to make you feel less than or something similar.  It makes me want to cry that someone, anyone especially in our own community would do such a thing. We are all in this sad fight together against transphobia; if only everyone thought that way. 

As a yt trans woman I want to apologize as you and all other POC truly deserve better. 

I am not sure if you were upset or looking for anyone to talk to because again I didn't see the original post but myself and (SHOULD BE) any other brother or sister on this subreddit is here for you if you need to talk.

Much love, your sister. -Fran
White trans guy here. All i have to say is that Im sorry, and that’s very embarrassing of behalf of the white people here because we should know better than that. Im sorry you had to make an awareness post, but I do hope it serves its purpose and people shut up and listen more. Thanks for your post.
I’m so sorry you have to deal with that… white trans woman speaking and yeah that shit’s unacceptable especially here. Keep being you please and we love you for who you are
100% agree. im white so i can't say i know what this is like, but i have encountered antisemitism in trans spaces a lot. 

i very frequently run into people who genuinely believe that all ""organized religion"" should be suppressed or banned. these people will very quickly tell me this once they learn im Jewish and go on at length about how Judaism is bad for some reason, and then become surprised and defensive when i call out the antisemitism inherent in that. there are ex-christian trans people who used to literally harass Jewish people into converting that never deconstructed their 'the Jews killed Jesus' mentality so they're still antisemitic as shit, and if you point that out to other trans people, nobody will believe you. there are so many non-Jewish trans people that will make Holocaust jokes or ""big nose"" jokes or greedy Jew jokes in front of you (even at and *about* you) and then get mad if you dare to call them out. don't even get me started on the gross tendency of white goyische trans people to ""joke"" about how they used to be actual fucking neo-nazis before they transitioned, as if most of my Jewish friends don't actually descend from Holocaust survivors. as if i don't fear violence from those groups every day. it's so exhausting and infuriating and isolating at the same time. 

and while i have to deal with discrimination like this, i also recognize that it's like ten times as bad for generally nonwhite trans people and *especially* Black trans people! genuinely, trans white people (including myself in that group) need to do *way* fucking better then this. being trans isn't a shield for being a racist piece of shit, nor is it an excuse to be willfully ignorant and refuse to correct your own racist behavior. its unacceptable that people act like this and you're totally justified in being pissed about it. my best wishes to you.
Yeah unfortunately LGBTQ places online aren’t void of misogynoir .. i can’t think of a solution but something has to be done at least on the moderation part of this sub
Oh hun, sorry for ya, this shouldn't been acceptable in 22 , more again in this space, you're as legit as us all, cheers!
I hella support this, espicially when as an Asian trans person i see way too often other Asians being racist towards black people so they can ""be like the whites"" and mooch off the privilege of being white rather trying to dismantle the system of privilege altogether. Lots of white trans people dont understand the goal isnt to become more like cis people but to dismantle the notions of cis superiority altogether, and that intersectionality also means addressing the fact that black people are still the most disadvantaged even within the LGBTQ community just like they are in cis dominated areas. 
Sadly Asian trans people are not immune to this either, probably cause a lot of us even when we shed off our cisnormative ideas still cling to the lukewarm liberalism that goes ""black people should learn to not be so criminal"" type of mindset rather than recognizing the greater power structures at play.
Systemic racism is real. It is the background hum of American culture and politics. I am sorry you have to deal with this. I don't really know what else to offer except to say that you're not crazy, you're not irrational. You're not ""resentful/ungrateful"" (we've all heard the line they like to use) but you see the situation for what it is. Righteous anger is a pretty rational response to a society that is irrationally cruel and gaslights you about it.

I've only been in here a whole one day so wouldn't have a leg to stand on whether agreeing or disagreeing. But I can say that this is nowhere near the first time I've seen the same complaint about trans (or any flavor of queer, really) groups, and that kind of consistency doesn't come from nowhere. I'm disappointed to read that it's a problem here too. Hopefully it's something the mods can keep in check.
> I can’t talk about the cultural appropriation implicit to drag because then you all gaslight me about the racism...

Many trans women, myself included, are **extremely** uncomfortable with drag.  I don't know who is giving you a hard time about this but I'd just ignore them.  The prevailing opinion from most trans women I've interacted with (regardless of race) is that drag often makes a mockery of femininity and perpetuates the ""*man in a dress*"" trope.

>Being Black and being trans has meant that on-top of a regular level of dysphoria, it has been impossible for me to achieve the same level of womanhood as white trans people. White people don’t even view cisgender Black women as women...

I'm surprised to hear this, because most trans women I've spoke with understand the negative impact that traditional western beauty standards have on women in general (both cis and trans) and are very much sympathetic to those who feel like those standards are entirely unattainable.

I'm more curious where you're seeing this than anything else.  I'm not trying to tell you ""*not all white people*"", just trying to understand what circles you're in where you're experiencing this level of racism.
I only ever see pretty passing white girls getting any attention here(and literally any othwr trans spaces for that matter) and it just shows how much of us are driven by anti-blackness. People really gotta take a hard look at how our behavior keeps reproducing that shit and fucking do something about it
This is not just a trans thing. you see it in other communities too.

People think that if they're marginalised or if they interact with marginalised people they are an authority on discrimination and any dispute is you hating on their group.

That's how we got all those people saying that since they are trans they know who is valid or not.

That doesn't excuse trans people though, we should not accept anyone into our spaces if they are going to gatekeep or just spread hatred to someone else. We should always call out racists and other bigots and exclusionists and not just blindly defend them because they are also trans or in another group.

EDIT: big apologies, I'm not good at communication. my post was fine on it's own but the first line accidentally gave off sketchy vibes. This isn't an excuse but I have asd so I only notice the literal stuff so I didn't notice it was awkward. Very sorry, it's fixed now.
I've been thinking recently how shitty of a lottery you have to win to end up both trans and black in your United States. You are then getting a be part of two minority demographics that will inevitably give you shit for being part of the other demographic.

I talked to a black trans woman some time ago and she mentioned how she doesn't feel connected to black people anymore because they were so transphobic to her. She couldn't be around them anymore. I believe she said something along the lines of feeling completely isolated. Which is probably one of the worst feelings a human can have, honestly.

She never mentioned racism in the trans community, because that wasn't really her topic but the whole time I was thinking ""well fuck, trans people can be racist too so it's not like it's a cake walk over here either.""

Ever since then that's been on my mind, especially recently. I can't do a whole ton to make it feel better, but I think you should remember that many of us out here don't hate you for being black. We can't totally relate, but we can feel for you. It might be tough to find other black trans people in the community to connect to, which I'm assuming would be optimal, but you can definitely always discuss your difficulties anyway. 

You're welcome here. Don't let anyone else convince you otherwise.

*As a side note: I hope you don't think all or most of us are racist, given your generalizing language. Though I suspect the generalization in your writing isn't there on purpose. However, I do want to point out when you use generalized language it feels like you're taking shots at the wrong people and that can make it harder to connect to people you might otherwise want to connect to. Just something to think about.*
Not someone in the comments using the whole “not all white people, so stop with your own racism.” Fuck off. As if POC haven’t heard enough crybabies spiel on the internet about “not all white people” whenever they’re being called out. **We get it.** We know, but there’s still the problem of white people either being passive about letting racism happen, or they’re joining in on it. They’re both issues and it’s issues we have all seen too many times. I like how it takes someone, usually POC (shocker), to actually call this shit out in order for people to fucking check themselves.

Honestly, you OP, took the words out of my own mouth. It feels so uncanny just being in a place that’s all about making sure that people feel included, but then you find that inclusion isn’t what its made out to be. Sometimes I feel like I want to leave because I can’t find a sense of community here or in the other trans subreddits. But then I can’t because the internet is the only way I’m able to communicate with other people who are trans. I can’t even find community within the area I live because I fear for my safety. This is just so fucking tiring.
I just started reading a book* about transgender history, and the author, who is middle class and white, pointed out a lot of inherent racism in the trans community. And expressed a lot of difficulty in trying to provide adequate voice for marginalized people of color within the trans community (which is itself a marginalized community). 

Specifically how “ideal feminism” is defined by white women (especially in the West), and how POC continue to be marginalized and invalidated when they don’t match the “ideal” (ideal in quotes, since the ideal described is defined by white people for white people).

I’ve noticed a definite lack of BIPOC representation here and in other trans subreddits. I’ve even read a few threads complaining about that lack of representation. 

And as a white middle class person myself, I hate that I didn’t notice the racism you (and others) have experienced here in this online community, and I hate that this isn’t an inclusive nor safe space for you and others. 

I do want to leave a quote for everyone:

> We should aspire to be the best fighters against each other’s oppression, and in doing so, build links of solidarity and trust that will forge an invincible movement against all forms of injustice and inequality. 

- Leslie Feinberg 

I am really sincerely sorry that we as a community acted this way. We gotta do better and stand up for each other, because nobody else is going to standup for us.  I promise to be more aware of what’s going here and call out the bigots when I see them. 

* The Book: 
“Before we were Trans: A New History of Gender” by Kit Heyam  ISBN: 9781541603080
Agreed on all fronts, and I have kind of a spicy take as well: FFS majorly contributes to the racist beauty standards that white trans women are driven by.
I absolutely agree with pretty much everything you say. The Queer community as a whole has an issue with racism and putting white voices up front and we need to be aware of that and lift up the voices of people of color in our communities.

I just don’t agree with your point in drag queens.
Talk about appropriation all you want with them, but are you maybe getting pushback there because you’re bringing up drag to trans folks? I know a lot of trans women, myself included, *hate* having drag brought up to us in relation with our identity
I can understand you and I'm sorry you go through this, as a white trans person I think a LOT of white trans people could do better and just like, stop being racist bigots, I also get tired of seeing black trans people being excluded

Also just because I'm curious as I've never heard about it before, what's the cultural appropriation related to drag?
thats part of why i left twitter. it was making me feel crazy
That's not good
Unfortunately the invisibility/intersectional nature of privilege makes it tough for people to deconstruct those ideas without some effort on their end. While I'd like to believe trans people are inherently more drawn to that kind of critical thinking, it might also be that assumption that leads people NOT to think about it. The only reason I'm fairly aware is because I've been educated already (everyone should take sociology/ethics/history if they get the opportunity, my god its so so important). Even then there's so much I still need to know in order to be a good leftist and advocate.

Im so sorry you've had that experience here! I sincerely hope posts like yours bring awareness to the subject. I'll certainly be more on the lookout for those attitudes in others and within myself now. We have so few spaces anywhere at this time, the last thing we need is to create an environment that itself is hostile to so much of the community :(
Wow I’m really sorry about that, I honestly can’t believe this is an issue. Like, we’re all fighting for the same thing: equality. The world is a fucking mess at the moment, but hopefully as the younger generation takes up seats of power it will get better and if u need anything I’m always happy to talk to you, as well as many in this community. Although it may not seem that way you are loved and accepted by anyone with half a brain cell and I hope u find the life you desire
I'm so sorry! I wish people could just not be bigoted-- in any form. I'd tell them if black trans women didn't exist, gay people probably wouldn't have the right to marry (Marsha P. Johnson)
Being LGBT doesn’t mean you’re magically “woke”. A lot of people seem to think that. I’m sorry for the experiences you’ve had; and to those that felt the need to say “nOt ALL wHiTe TrAnS pEoPLe”, if you feel the urge to say that maybe you should be worried about the way you are treating your POC friends. Cause I promise you they are rolling their eyes at you for those comments. Those of us who aren’t racist don’t feel the need to broadcast that so why do you? 🤔 Projecting…. 🙄 I hope that this can be a safe space for you soon <3
What cultural appropriation is inherent to drag? Am I misreading or
Can someone explain how drag is racist? And if so, what do you want people to do about it?
Adding to this but I see this so much on top of transandrophobia towards transmascs/men, as well as intersex people, ESPECIALLY of colour. That and racism topped on top of it. It's something the community really needs to unlearn and call out when it's seen.
White transfemme here, just want to add my voice to the support and apologies of other commenters. We white transfolk basically owe everything to people and communities of color! The gender binary is a product of white colonial culture, and the overwhelming majority of people who have fought and died resisting gender oppression have been people of color! It's still overwhelmingly people of color who are victims of transphobic violence, and it's an outrage that this fact is either ignored or denied so often.

Overcoming our own racism as white people is a lifelong project and the work is never over, nor do we deserve any special praise for undertaking it. We all REALLY need to get over being reactive when our racism is pointed out to us. Part of being racist is that racism can be invisible to us, so if we actually care about becoming less racist, then the appropriate response to being called out is humility and/or gratitude, because someone is taking the time to try to help us see something invisible to us. 

We've got a long way to go, but OP, thanks for not giving up on us (you obviously wouldn't have posted this if you thought we were all a hopeless lost cause).
Latine enby here. Yeah, I don’t appreciate how whenever someone is asked to describe what an enby looks like, it’s almost always gonna be an androgynous, afab, thin white person. Yes, I know I am now also mentioning other intersections of privilege/lack thereof people can have that everyone needs to work on. 

It just sucks that even white trans folks, binary or otherwise, will see me as lesser for my skin color. Everyone, including trans folks where I live (big west coast city that somehow still has notable Republican and racist influence) assume I’m Mexican. I’m done correcting them because then it just devolves into the racist “then what ARE you” wild goose chase. I’d really rather not have to deal with that anymore but no, it still happens.

Don’t get me started with how binary the Latinx community is because of the binary gendered language and how my existence is “bReAkInG tHe LaWs Of ThE lAnGuAgE”

My struggles aren’t the exact same as yours, but I certainly hear you and feel the similarities.
This is why my rule of thumb is usually, if someone of color says something's racist, it's probably racist.
Thank you for this OP. We’ll keep working on it.

And to any white person asking for an education from OP - do your own damn labour. BIPOCs have been trying to educate us for years and you’re lucky some people are still willing to share insights and stories about their lived experience of racism.

 This is OUR wrong to right. Take some responsibility.
All I can say is I am sorry! Our black and brown brothers and sisters have had a horrible time with this. Makes me want to cry. In fact I have. I send you love and hugs. I have a gay couple friendship, and they get more grief about being an interracial couple more than being a gay couple. It sucks.
Ya i completely agree so sorry you have to deal with that shit
Wake it up !!!
Holy shit, that sounds awful! 😥 Europe is not void of racism by any means, but at least we don’t have this constant obsession with skin colour that seems to influence *everything* in the U.S.

I wish I could offer something more concrete than words, but I am really sorry to hear what y’all are going through ❤️
I try to follow other creators on socials that aren't the same gender/race as I am to get a better understanding of their struggles and how different their life experiences are. Some of my favorite people I follow are POC: black, indigenous, Indian etc. 

I know that we white people have significant privileges that other races don't get (at least here in the US) but that doesn't mean we don't have to be bothered to not learn about what others races/genders go through. We still need to work together and not create divide in this community.
As a white trans guy who is daily working on deprogramming the racism that was baked into what my base learned understanding of world and reprogramming an activity anti-racist thought base. And that's probably going to take my entire life to accomplish, if I even do, but that doesn't at all make me want to stop doing it. Yinz are the literal pillars and cornerstones of what we know as queer culture today. Literally where would we be without black trans folks???? The culture sure as hell wouldn't be what it is. The ties are really damn conspicuous. I feel so much love and so much indebted to you. If any place in the entire world should be a place for you to feel safe and seen and uplifted it should be in trans spaces and literally anything a fraction of a fraction less than that is absolutely fucked. You (obviously and inherently) deserve so much better.
I know it isn’t much, but if it is any consolation, I am a very white teenage trans man and I do the best that I can to fully and 100% acknowledge the amount of privilege I still hold within and outside of the community.  This is not at all meant to be a “I know what you’re going through” or a “not all white people” comment because I know that gets no one anywhere.  I am simply reaching out more as a form of reassurance of the fact that tho it might not be worth a whole lot, there’s some scrawny little white boy sitting at home writing gay fanfics who would be willing to fight someone twice my size for the end of the very real, very damaging racism in the LGBT+ community.
Im sorry if that has happenned to u. Being black in the USA is tough enuf even wout being trans. Your anger is justified.
Thank you for this! I agree that whenever someone vents and starts pointing out the bigotry. Those being accused  always focus on putting blame back on the accuser, rather then listen to what is being said and reflecting how these actions can cause the afflicted to believe an entire race of people is now their enemy. We have to listen to those that are afflicted by racism, transphobia and any kind of discrimination and work forward eliminating those lifestyles.
glad this thread seems to be gaining support

there does seem to be a ""barrier"" for white trans people that makes them assume they are abstained of faults when they say something ignorant or downright racist, it happens in many servers i am in on discord (which is part of the reason ive left most trans specific spaces)

i feel as though they think they are JUST as oppressed as BIPOC-trans people and thats what makes them feel they can say ignorant things (obviously isnt true)not to mention how racism is normalized in trans spaces like white people taking african/asian/native american names
I don’t have much to contribute, but I stand with you :( I’m sorry you’re dealing with this from a place that should be supportive. I’d happily be an ear if you ever want to vent thoughh 🤷‍♀️ I know that doesn’t help much at all thkugh :/

I have two black siblings and seeing everything they’ve been through in a fairly “progressive” place, over the years was eye opening and disgusting. I’m glad to have had exposure because my family and upbringing was basically sour cream until then and I had a lot to unpack and still sometimes have to question🫤

I’m really glad you posted!! Our community needs more of this, and I’m grateful you are the person you are🥰
As a white NB, who grew up and lives in the midwest, and had very few interactions with POC early in my life (and even now to be honest), you're right.

I am personally trying my hardest to listen and learn from POC perspectives on a variety of topics, and using that to critically reflect on my own biases and reactions and beliefs.  And I know I'm still nowhere near literate or improved enough to be an example, but I am trying.

But I know a lot of people don't.  For the reasons you gave.  They think they are absolved of ""bigotry"" by being trans.  Or think that their radical transformation from one gender to another means that all of their new thoughts are pure and good.

It doesn't matter if your partner is black, your dad is hispanic, your cousin is mixed, your friends are from Asia.  Someone tolerating your shitty actions to keep the peace doesn't mean you're right.  We can absolutely do better.

There is absolutely room to discuss how systemic oppression of all intersections are not just perpetuated by one group, but that would only distract from this conversation.

I'm sorry you see this shit.  I'm sorry you feel so putdown by this.  It's shit.

If anyone wants to get POC perspective on things, here's some resources I am using.

it's wild to me that members of one marginalized group can still be horrible to other marginalized groups
I’m so sorry that you’re going through all of this. I have never experienced anything like this (I’m saying this as a white trans boy so yeah), but it’s bewildering to me that even people within the community would still be racist. Like, you’d think more of us would understand that discrimination like that if ridiculous and harmful as we face unfair discrimination ourselves, but apparently not. It’s so odd. I hate this for you and again I’m deeply sorry. I know I could never understand the type of crud you go through with that but it’s terrible.

Also, it’s crazy that people still can’t see black women as women… like.. what?! Y’all are beautiful, each and every one of you! I hate us for you, we really need to do better.
OP, I am so, so sorry you have to deal with this. It’s honestly appalling that our community STILL has this problem despite owing the fact we even HAVE a movement to black trans women.

Black people invented and cultivated drag. People of color (Storme DeLaverie was part indigenous if I recall correctly) were the ones who helped spark and lead the Stonewalll riots. It absolutely sickens me that the trans folks who idolize Marsha P. Johnson then turn around and pull racist shit on black trans people, who have done *so much* for our community and have reaped so little of the fruit it’s borne.

Fellow white trans people - we need to **shut the fuck up, listen, and DO BETTER.**
I'm sorry OP, I wish the (white) trans community would learn some intersectionality instead of only caring about trans issues. A lot of the comments in this thread are just embarrassing. Some of y'all need to shut the fuck up, drop the superiority complex, and engage in active listening to take in what OP is saying instead of assuming you're the expert on all things sociopolitical. All of the responses going ""well I don't personally see it so it doesn't happen"" or ""venting about how X majority group treats you is bad because generalizations = bad"" or ""I don't have to care about your culture's history because it makes me personally feel bad"" is EXACTLY the same kind of shit that cis people do to us, except it's not the same, it's *worse* because systemic racism is on an unimaginably more foundational and unchecked level on society that transphobia is (considering how transphobia, homophobia, and many other forms of bigotry are heavily, heavily based on racism itself). 


Being a minority does give you a pass to ignore other peoples' struggles. If you are a white trans person and you do not ACTIVELY work to deconstruct white supremacy in your own life, you are part of the problem. You ARE implicitly racist because of the indescribable amount of racism that society has taught you your entire life. If you want transphobia to end, if you want queer liberation, you HAVE to be intersectional. Please listen to other voices and make the choice to change your own behaviors. If you don't then you have no right to demand that cis people treat us better.
I'm white, and the level of ignorance and entitlement I see from other white trans girls is APPALLING, to put it lightly. We'll whine about how hard we have it as trans women or how society targets us, but then we'll talk over and trivialize the experiences of BIPOC trans women

""wah, its so hard growing up in Pinedale, Illinois"" like im not saying the transphobia they've experienced isnt valid, but our oppression by society starts when we come out, whereas the marginalization of POC in this country starts when a person is born, and only further complicates when they come into a queer identity

I feel a lot of white girls fail to grasp intersectionalism. That said, I feel we need to uplift black trans women and amplify their voices because they deal with the brunt of society's transphobia, not Trixie whose dad begrudgingly pays for her HRT and SRS.
[removed]
Im sorry that you experienced this. I refuse to partake in ANY ethnical segregation and firmly believe that there wont be peace til were all equal.
I read your despair and frustration in your comment and just want you to know that I support your case and youre welcome no matter what.
I'm confused by the part of your post that says that ""white people don't even consider cis black women to be women"".
I'm white and definitely consider black women to be women and always have, so I don't really get what you're saying there.

Not trying to be confrontational, just genuinely confused. Is that some sort of common thing among white people? I'm generally a social recluse, so maybe I've just never heard about it.
I'm in solidarity with you about all of this. I'm exmormon and fucking hell I also wish white people would think outside the box they're in more. We are all connected and share so many struggles by living in this world and trans people especially should not have this kind of infighting when there's big systemic problems targeting all of us. We are stronger supporting each other through this time of oppression and we should not become blind to the struggles others are facing.
Im a white trans man and im sorry OP you have to experience that... No person deserves to treat anyone with disrespect regardless of race because in my heart everyone should be equal and race shouldn't matter because we all bleed red and have heartbeats. Everyone should accept and love everyone but society in this day and age is ridiculous.
Every group has a racism problem. We live in a racist society, and it’s impossible to have grown up in it as w white person without internalising racism.

The key to not being racist isn’t to just loudly deny it exists, but rather to do the work to recognize it and to make the needed effort to be actively anti-racist.

All of us who are white have racist thought patterns and concepts that we simply don’t question or realize without some serious work, because it’s just such a fundamental assumption that was drilled in subconsciously by our society.

If that makes people uncomfortable to hear - then *good*. It *should* make us uncomfortable. The next step is to decide what to do with that discomfort - to bury one’s head in the sand and insist it can’t be true is to continue to be racist and to support racism. To use that as motivation to listen to all the wonderful anti-racist thinkers and speakers out there and *change* is how one actively is anti-racist.

I’m sorry for the racism you’ve faced, and I’m sorry for all the people who would rather prioritize their comfort and deny it rather than your humanity and do the work.
This has a feel like “black cos-players” on twitter.  Equal but separate .
I can agree with this, mate. Wholeheartedly... I'm back.

> White people don’t even view cisgender Black women as women

How is this statement not racist?
[removed]
I'm really sorry you reached this point of exasperation, but I do appreciate that you're saying it. There isn't nearly enough of this kind of difficult critical discussion aimed at the community itself.

I obviously can't know first-hand how it feels to experience race and gender the way you do since I'm white, nor can I really comprehend it at the same level, but a lot of what you describe sounds familiar to me in regards to my own frustration with latent misogyny in the trans community, particularly among trans women.

I definitely get what you mean when you talk about people thinking they get a pass on stuff because they are part of a discriminated class themselves.

If you try to suggest that trans people can bring problematic attitudes with them as they transition you get a lot of flak for it. Transitioning and identifying as a woman doesn't just make all the misogynist and sexist (or racist) attitudes someone was raised with disappear. Those attitudes still require work and effort to overcome.

I've had trans women on reddit tell me that they can't have misogynist beliefs because they're a woman and that I'm transphobic for suggesting that they maybe need to do some self-examination of their own ideas about women.

The obsession with validation over everything else and the shutting down of anyone who doesn't validate every thing a person says or believes inevitably creates some pretty bad problems and blind spots. It creates an environment where people start to think they can't be wrong or misguided about anything.



To other white people here; something that was an important idea for me to understand was that it's ok to admit to myself that I had (and likely still have) racist or ignorant attitudes and beliefs. Whether I like it or not, I was raised that way. Not overtly with confederate flags and white hoods, but in the quiet suburban way. I absorbed all those lowkey ideas and even after a lot of effort to counteract them I still find things to this day.

It doesn't make you a worthless or irredeemable person, but you need to be able to admit it to yourself before you can ever take steps to uprooting those ideas and unchecked prejudices that got baked into you without you really understanding it was happening. It's not enough to just point externally and denounce racism you see, it's something that lives inside us as individuals, in the places we neglect because going there is uncomfortable.

People like the OP need and deserve a space as much as anyone, arguably more since this isn't the first time we all have seen this kind of post. We all need to look at ourselves honestly for ways that *we* allow this to happen. It might be in big ways or small ones, but it all adds up. Listen to the OP and believe them.
I’m sorry about all of this shit, it’s just such shit, and I want to just express my apologies for all of this shit, even though I know that’s not much and that much more is needed than just platitudes, but I still feel a necessity to express that 🫂.

Racist people will be racist, them being trans has nothing to do with it.
You don't have to answer this question if you don't want to but, exactly how prevalent of a issue is this for you personally? You make it sound as though this is quite a frequent occurance like, how many white people in this server have you met that you think have racism, and in what form is the racism nost common for you?
I have no wisdom nor words of advice worthy of addressing your situation.  I will never  be able to truly understand the depths of discrimination that you face.  I could not begin to scratch the surface of that pain.

All I will tell you is that I hear you, and I will stand with you.

Peace Out - Kim
I can't even begin to imagine how this feels. I feel lucky to be generally accepted out in public, and I can't think of a time I've ever been put down or invalidated in this server. You deserve so much more respect, not more hate. I'm really bad at wording things, but I really hope some change is sparked. Thank you for sharing.

if you don't mind, I'd like to hear some of the things that have been said to you if that's fine with you
I know you are pissed and justifiably so but condemning all of us is unfair, too.
""I can’t talk about the cultural appropriation implicit to drag because then you all gaslight me about the racism.""

Drag is not inherently trans. It's odd that this is one of your first points to be made. While there is some crossover between drag culture and trans people (mainly trans women) drag =/= trans implicitly. Coming into a trans subreddit to talk about drag is odd.

""STOP. Don’t. Put down your progesterone and pick up a book jfc""

what a weird thing to say. r/trans is not mtf only, and not all trans femmes are on progesterone.
[removed]
I *think* I get what you are referring to. In the U.S. (and probably most of Europe) white female proportions and facial structure has become the blue print for what is considered beautiful. In other words, small waist (with a 10"" difference between waist and hip measurements), smallish hips, stick thin arms, a tapered nose, and arched eyebrows. Pale skin with just a touch of pink blush on the cheeks and eyelids is also popular. Venus and Serena Williams, as healthy and athletic as they are, do not fit that mold. I get it. Don't let it stop you from posting selfies if you want to.
What can I, as a white trans person, do to help?
I am sorry you have experienced this even here, I truly am. This should be a place of acceptance, not a place of further discrimination and hate.

May I ask, as a white trans person, how can I better support trans POC? I would love to take a more active role against discrimination, but would want to hear from a trans POC themselves on what changes need to be made, rather than just making assumptions.
I absolutely see what you're talking about

I'm in a youth movement that focuses on poetry, art , safe space and tolerance, so obviously most of the people are lgbtq there

I have noticed, and it really bothers me, that in last year there was only one not-white person in the seminars, although there were some (few) in the past 5 years

I brought it up and we're trying to change it(for all colors, races, and cultures), but I feel like the slogan is just words and not really act upon and it bothers me a lot

I know it's not coming from racism, just lack of effort, and that this is not at all aligning with your experiences, and I'm sorry we're not coming across non-white people sharing on this sub and me in generally coming across with what you're talking about, 

I shared it because as a white person it really bothers me, and in generally I don't see why we need to be defined by our colors, and all this white supremacy shit is awful and needs to change

If there's anything we could do I would be happy to put effort into anything that would make a difference for the better for y'all
I can only imagine how hard that must be for you but I do my best to be anti-racist and I would love to learn what you have to say to improve and spread the word
I didn't know drag was some sort of black face, good to know I think I just avoid withe/latin drag as posible becausemakes me dysphoric, I would love to see the original black women's drag tho, I'm sure it's not dysphoria inducing.
Girl, I hear you. I'm white, so there's no way I can ever understand what you're going through, but believe me when I say I've had other not-dissimilar issues in this community and I tend to have some difficulties connecting with many other trans women because of it. 

One of the hardest and most disheartening lessons I have learned is that being queer does not by any means make you a good person. You'd think they would know better, being of an oppressed class. But narcissists gonna narcissist, and bigots are gonna bigot, and most of them do not possess the self-awareness to see their own hypocrisy, let alone care about it. 

In fact, many of them run in the opposite direction, using the discrimination they've faced as some sort of justification to punch down harder. Many of them seem to openly boast about their ignorance and double standards. I hate it so much and it enrages me beyond description. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I wish I could do more. If you need white girl to go sh!t all over some other white girls being c_nts, I got you.
You are right. As a Trans man of color, So many white queers have dropped me the minute i started becoming more conventionally masc on T. All of a sudden they were “scared” because I was too “aggressive” lol my voice just dropped and I have darker skin… be for real. Actively ostracizing you, making racist remarks. One even said my bottom growth probably “smells like curry” and started laughing expecting me to join in. Of course I have been able to find white friends who respect me for who I am- all parts of my identity. But too many white queers think they get a pass to be racist because they’re a minority as well. It’s just tiring. I am so glad you made this post and I think it is important to find solidarity in trans people of color. I understand you and know how taxing and cruel this racism can be. Especially coming from a community that is supposed to be more inclusive and accepting of all. I truly wish you the best! And I hope one day we will be just as welcome in this community as everyone else is. <3
it’s hard because the problem begins with us not being believed. racism is a complicated and nuanced issue, but we have to constantly prove that if something happens to us, it’s racist. and it’s not enough to just ban someone because the racism that they might be spewing isn’t an individual issue. it’s a reflection of bigoted beliefs fundamental to our society. My best piece of advice might be to try and have more moderators of color, and then maybe try to have some events educating people about racism? Pin articles or make posts explaining some things about racism in the trans community, and do what you can to make sure they get seen. it really is just a matter of uplifting POC voices as much as possible because we are always actively drowned out by the white members of this community
I think one thing is the amount of normalized racism. 

The reason why I joined this community was because I continuously saw posts like ""Can I take an Asian name?""

And the replies would be ""Asians take English name, why cant we take theirs?"" 

It completely ignores historical context of colonialism.


Similarly, I see a lot of trans-POCs' getting their experience minimized. Comments like ""Im sorry you feel that way"" or ""Trans people arent beacons"" dont do anything except alienate and marginalize those who experience the very real racism or discrimination in our community.
🫂🫂🫂 tysm for the comments n the support

A triggered racist likely reported it to Reddit Admins, and Reddit is well known for platforming and supporting hate, and catering to white supremacists.
Cause it was rage bait through and through, like all the other stuff that has been dividing the queer reddit community lately.

> you don't get the ""oh, but i'm a minority too so it's ok!"" card >:(

This!! It makes me so upset when a person of a minority doesn't try to analyze and work on biases they have, but rather, pulls this card. It's so messed up.

&#x200B;

>please people y'all need to realize that minorities can (and oftentimes, will) discriminate against other minorities!!!

Seriously. They're just blatantly projecting their experiences of discrimination onto other minorities. A lot of times they're insecure in their own identity, and again, rather than working on personal biases and flawed viewpoints, they lash out onto others to make themselves feel just a little better in that moment in time.
🫂🫂🫂
Yeah, it’s always white trans femmes who get 80% of the memes on this sub and other trans related subs. I couldn’t imagine the amount of dysphoria it must make when you’re a trans masc POC in the community
Then you just gotta keep saying it, right? Make sure they hear it whether or not they want. Fuck em, if it makes them uncomfortable that's the point.

Thank you, all of this looks really interesting & useful
fellow andrewism enjoyer
I’ll signal boost a couple of amazing Black anti-racist activists!

One of my favorites is [Ally Henny](https://allyhenny.com/)

She produces so much high-quality writing, and makes a lot of it available free.

Then there’s [Asiatu Lawoyin](https://www.asiatucoach.com/), they’re Black, Autistic and Trans.
Sa-Roc and F.D in the same comment? You're cooking
I watch a lot of these people. Would also suggest Kadija M'bowe (sp?)

Just have to say, Andrewism is probably my favorite leftist/theory Channel on YouTube, period. That man is so insanely wise and well-spoken beyond his years. He truly has a gift for teaching and giving people motivation and hope. Can NOT boost his voice enough.
i understand that! one of my best friends growing up was a racist white gamer before she transitioned, and i can only hope that she’s trying and working at undoing all that stuff that she learned from her family. i understand people won’t be perfect, but people just need to be willing to listen
thank you 🙏🏾

Yeah. People think privelege means you are automatically better of when it just means that you'd be better off than if you were the opposite. The end result is that on one side you have people who deny privelege as being male doesn't exempt you from descrimintation, on the other you have people who think having male privelege does exempt you from it so they just ignore other issues.
My guess is a petulant racist reported it, and Reddit is widely known for platforming and protecting white supremacy
If you see this stuff please please please use that report button. Our automod catches alot of stuff, but not everything and our numbers are only so many. We want this to be a welcoming place for all trans people but we can't do it without your help!

No, no, i think you’re missing the point. I’m not uncomfortable with drag because it’s making a mockery of femininity. I’m uncomfortable with drag because white people perceive something that has been a staple of BLACK QUEER CULTURE as that. Drag was appropriated and bastardized and now, it just feels like white women making a mockery of Black queer womanhood. All gender is fundamentally a performance. Drag is a cultural tradition that plays with this notion to celebrate gender liberation and radical expressions of gender identity.

I sorta get why you’re uncomfortable with it, but I really do think that some people should just stop speaking on a cultural tradition with roots in Black queer spaces. It’s an extremely radical practice that has generally been co-opted by white or white adjacent neoliberal types like Ru Paul, but it’s definitely something that I support…

But also, I experience racism in literally every predominantly white space I’ve ever been in. It’s even implicit in this sub because the pictures that get the most attention are always eurocentric and passing white people.
[removed]
being black and trans means i like cannot pass the same way white women do and it’s so horrible everyday
And then if you are in too many minority groups you get this bonus hate from all sides for being an ""overcomplicated label collecting crazy leftist""
Yeah… if the best one can come up with is “not *all* [group]” then they’re in serious need of shutting the fuck up and doing some soul-searching.

I’m white. When BIPOC people vent about the stupid, racist shit white people do, I recognize that they’re venting because these are the experiences they’ve lived, and this is the predominant expectation they have of dealing with white people.

If it makes me uncomfortable, my discomfort is not more important than their voices, than their lives.

The thing I can do to change that is to do my bit to stand up against white supremacy culture. To support Black, brown, Indigenous voices. To take some of the burden of having to call this shit out from them - because nobody should have to fight for their own right to be respected as human, and least of all have to do it alone.

I have no patience for people who get all offended about venting and then try and silence people to sore themselves discomfort.
Being in a minority gives you whole new lens. Being trans I see a lot of transphobia that cis people don't see as a big deal. It's incredibly invalidating too. I imagine racism is just as upsetting, and once again, even when (primarily white) people see it they don't think it's a big deal. I straight up see people using my disabilities as a joke and I have first hand experience of why it's an issue. Try to point it out even to people who are activists, I get laughed at for being pretentious.
It's so telling that a lot of these people don't even address the points being made in the post and just want to scream ""WELL I'M NOT RACIST"" into the void.
yep
like i do get that. but at the same time, i think a lot of people’s problems with drag tend to be redirected towards black women’s expressions of femininity. i saw someone explicitly saying that they hated when drag queens said shit like “Yass queen slay” or whatever which is literally just AAVE. People hate the loudness, the performativity, the brazenness of it all, and while i do understand not identifying with it… there’s a legacy of Black queer expression that’s inherent to drag that gets demonized when we talk about it like that.
Yep, look at all the queer people who act like they can choose who is valid. And that's just in the community, going outside of it there's all these people shrouded in insecurity and internalised hate who even screw over other people in their community, like those queer people who hang out with fascists who just want to use them as a weapon then kill their rights too. Just because of their biases against ""woke"" culture.
usually yeah, but not always.
I don’t have much to contribute, but I stand with you :( I’m sorry you’re dealing with this from a place that should be supportive. I’d happily be an ear if you ever want to vent thoughh 🤷‍♀️ I know that doesn’t help much at all thkugh :/

I have two black siblings and seeing everything they’ve been through in a fairly “progressive” place, over the years was eye opening and disgusting. I’m glad to have had exposure because my family and upbringing was basically sour cream until then and I had a lot to unpack and still sometimes have to question🫤

I’m really glad you posted!! Our community needs more of this, and I’m grateful you are the person you are🥰

We need to do better as a community for our POC siblings🤯
yep, my mum helps me with autism stuff all the time, and then uses it as ammunition when I imply that she has misunderstood something. This applies to the people helping you out too, not just random relatives.
Ignorance, while blissful, leads to a lot of internalized and externalized hate. While it can be fixed, it isn't easy to do so unless you're either willing to admit you don't know your ignorance, or start listening. Both are hard to do for those that are willfully ignorant, but even those who aren't willfully ignorant can cause stress and pain for those that would be effected by it.
It's frustrating how the only people I see pointing this out are the people already with intersectionality.
[removed]
What did the post say? It was scrubbed
Another example you might be more familiar with if you’re American, when Obama was in presidency people did this with Michelle, labeling her as looking too manly, calling her trans in a derogatory way, editing photos to give her stereotypical masculine features, it was pretty terrible.
I recently saw a horrible meme of someone wearing a party dress where you could see the silhouette of a penis. The caption was something like “how Brittany Griner is celebrating her freedom”. Obviously implying she is trans (and therefore according to transphobes not a “real” woman). OP may be referring to shit like this where athletic black woman often get speculated about regarding their agab because they might not fit the bs western beauty standards for femininity.
drag was born out of black queer cultures in the north east, but since then, drag has become a sort of appropriation of black womanhood. many drag queens just use AAVE and put on make up or mannerisms that imitate Black women in order to make themselves more entertaining for the audience. It’s like a less explicit version of Black face because you’re implicitly performing Blackness.

there’s a long historical legacy of masculinizing black women huh??? megan thee stallion literally gets called marcus like all the time because she’s thick, tall, and has a deepish voice. are you dense?
Do you really think the only negative interaction I’ve had with white trans people was today? The person I was talking to literally does not believe cultural appropriation is real and was saying anti-Black things. This is exactly what I was talking about in the post. You refuse to take the critique of anti-Blackness in the trans community seriously. I’ll tell you all what you need to do, and that’s decolonize your beauty standards, deconstruct the role of white supremacy in your own lives, read books by BLACK WOMEN, and listen to Black people. There have been so many posts in so many subs in the past week alone about racism in the trans community, but I for one am not in the business of spending my time and energy trying to educate each and everyone of you. Google is free.

But also, THIS IS LITERALLY A FUCKING VENT POST. I don’t owe you anything. I don’t owe you solutions. I don’t owe you examples. I don’t owe you proof of anything. Reread the last paragraph of my post. This is a community-wide issue, not a personal one. My one negative experience with a trans woman this morning is not the only instance of racism that Black people have experienced in this sub. 

And I wasn’t asking for help. I was telling you all to do better. Quite frankly, the first step would be deleting this comment. All you’re doing here is questioning the validity of a Black woman’s experience with racism and policing the way she expresses her frustration.

Your comment also doesn’t even make sense because I did tell you what to do. Don’t comment some shit like this. That was like the one thing I emphasized most. Listen to us! If you don’t even believe the community is racist and you’re gonna sit here and disagree about that, then you’re a part of the problem.

It's very important to listen to black people about racism even if you don't think you're racist. There's so much stuff that's so normalised or subtle you'd never realise on your own.
it’s based in a long historical legacy of black women being forcibly masculinized by their white counterparts. hence, sojourner truth’s “aint i a woman”. it’s literally still relevant today too as Megan thee Stallion, Serena Williams, Michelle Obama, Britney Griner, and countless other Black women always have the legitimacy of their womanhood questioned.

Okay, I get where you're coming from, but I disagree with what you're saying. It's not a ridiculous point to say that there is racism within the LGBTQ+ community. POC experience being trans differently because of how our bodies look and are viewed in society. The beauty standard is based around being white and looking white, so passing when you aren't white is just a different kind of thing. The LGBTQ+ community has so many of its roots in black culture and we can't just ignore that. It's not appropriation to do drag as a white person, but it is to say that white people invented it.

The issue of being racist against white people is a very complex issue. White people can experience racism, I'm sure it's happened and does happen, but the fact does not change that the racism they experience is totally different that that of POC. When we have conversations about racism, we're usually talking about issues like police brutality or a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and things like that. White people don't have to worry about the police killing them for their race or being spat on and screamed at for ""starting Covid"". It's just a different sort of thing and it's not fair or helpful to equate racism against white people to that of racism towards POC. 

As for the whole ""anywhere with lots of white people will have racism"" thing, yes, that is inherently true. However, anywhere with a lot of people will have racism of some sort. As an Asian, I can say that Asia is an incredibly racist place. I can't speak for many other cultures, but I know that colourism is prevalent in beauty standards and social classes. But again, it's historically been white people who have imperialised and enslaved POC. This is an even more complex topic than the first, but it really all boils down to the magnitude of racism and how it is expressed historically and systematically.

I don't want to start an argument with you, I just really like talking about stuff (hence the novel worth of writing in this comment) but I also just wanted to elaborate on some points we hear a lot but maybe don't get the full explanation for.
don't understand why you're being downvoted for this you're right lol being trans absolutely does not mean you aren't able to be a racist too like some people seem to think
Honestly “you make it sound as though ” comes off super condescending and your entire comment just proved op’s point.

they are not condemning all of us. they’re stating patterns they’ve seen on this subreddit in order to make us realize and do better. i’m a pretty sensitive person and don’t feel attacked by this post, i moreso feel a curiosity and desire to do better. you can feel however you’d like after reading this, but i think their goal in writing this was to enlighten some white people about our behavior, not to take out their anger on us or anything.
No offense but sometimes the best thing you can do is listen. Ofc not all white people are going to be racist, but the way our world is set up it’s SO EASY for them to get away with it. 


We’re white. We always have white privilege above everything else. We still can experience other forms of hate, but people of color do not have privilege with their skin color. They deserve to talk about their experiences and their lack of privilege. 

Also didn’t want this to come off as rude. I just want to inform you. Because of course not all white people are bad, or racist. But we can come off as that so easily with the wrong words even with well intentions. It’s honestly… better if we don’t say anything. Because we never will understand the pain they go through, the best we can do is offer our ears.
she came here talking about drag because of a prior conversation SOMEONE ELSE STARTED HERE. (drag culture also isn't mainly trans women, there are plenty of trans men in 'traditional' drag and a significantly larger amount in the sphere or drag kings, but thats a baby gripe) 

I'm a black transmasc person and i get what she was saying; she's mad, she probably interacted with white transfems in the prior conversation, don't tone police black women when they tell you something is wrong, especially without Acknowledging The Problem.

These are great suggestions. We have people all the time here sharing their story’s about transphobes and the horrible things that are said to us, but it would be insightful to hear from people where intersectionality with transphobia and racism play a role. We all share a common struggle with society and it’s gender roles but we need to listen and attempt to understand that others also have struggles beyond that. 

As a trans person I deal with internalized transphobia and I know I’m not the only one. This was learned throughout childhood being surrounded by bigots and transphobes. Racism is learned in exactly the same way. We weren’t born with these biases. Part of my transition is trying to unlearn all the bullshit I grew up with and I realized that while doing this the rabbit hole can get pretty deep. 

While we are unlearning things like internal transphobia that directly affect all of us we really should be digging deeper and unlearning many more things that a corrupt society taught us like racism for example. Perhaps it could lead to a better understanding of each other and make for a more unified trans community.
I really like this. This is really good and pointed feedback.

I will say that we try our best to get moderators as diverse as possible, though it's hard to determine someone's race/nationality without outright asking.   
That and we definitely need more POC applying to be mods as well, as we don't just reach out to random redditors to ask them to moderate. That's not to say we won't or that it's impossible, I just hope that more apply really.

As for events and pinned information, I'll definitely take that into consideration and ask for other mods opinions as well (though I doubt we'll have any dissent on that suggestion).

Thank you for that, and sorry I took so long to respond, I've been pretty busy lately with... Well a lot really, so it took me some time to read this and to think of a way to properly respond.
See I feel like racist trans people shouldn’t exist. Just like how I feel transphobic people of color shouldn’t exist. We go through similar struggles even if they aren’t the same. I feel there could be more sympathy on both parts
That's fair. I would love if these things were brought up more readily, as sometimes when a report comes in, we have to determine if the report was a troll report or not.

Maybe for cases like these where things are a bit more nuanced, sending in a Modmail and letting us know what's happening. 

Reporting definitely helps, and you should absolutely do it, as racism is something that should be pretty easy to see 99% of the time, but there will be times when someone misses the context, or doesn't understand the issue, and having an outside perspective helps with that.
I mean a lot of Asian people (from Asia) take English names to deal with the white English speakers who aren’t interested in calling them by their names and if it’s going to happen anyway at least you can be called a name you like. 

What does ‘trans people aren’t beacons’ mean?
No problem at all happy to help in any way I can
We’re not all like that. But I agree that that behavior from us was completely unacceptable.
they're addressing a legitimate problem, it's not ""rage bait"" at all.
You are literally the exact problem this post is talking about and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Saying that you have experienced racism is not an attack on white people. They didn't say all white people were racist, they said they get a lot from white people.

I think I’ve seen maybe 1-2 POC trans men on this subreddit ever. Ouch. They deserve to feel safe here.
I’m a trans man, although white, I found it strange how it’s mostly trans women here and most of the memes and such are for trans women
Oh wow
🫂🫂🫂 ""This light passes through me, it is not my own""   


We all suffer when their voices are suppressed. In our community, far from not exclusively but particularly, we have Marsha P Johnson -- and SO many like her before, during her time, and all the way up to the present -- to thank for the rights we enjoy today. To ignore the Voice would not be just ungrateful...would not just be to endanger those rights...it is also to deny oneself the opportunity to learn from some of the greatest minds and moved by some of the greatest artists of all time.
He's literally the best and everyone everywhere should watch him.
Thanks for sharing. Am pissed this thread got hit with the reddit ban -- what a way to illustrate her point. Algo's racist and so is the culture that ""raised"" us.
Admins engaged and didn't axe it, according to the admins it was likely report trolling by some guy. I'm guessing someone who thinks implying white people are being racist is an attack on the white race or smth like that.
Unfortunately, most of it isn't ""reportable"" in nature. It's not just outright bigotry, but also a whole lot of subtler exclusion, doube standards, and dismissal.
[removed]
Im curious as to how you can't pass like a white person can (i have no knowledge on it)
Whenever I tell people about autism discrimination I just get hit with ""you just think autistic people have nothing look at all these successful people""
It’s all the worst forms of selfishness and self preservation. They don’t even care that racism is happening—they just don’t want to be associated with it even though they are part of the problem. Not doing anything is still participation and allowing the perpetuation. Obviously, there can be exceptions to that statement (fuck me if I didn’t *explicitly* state that), but holy hell, I didn’t think I had to hear this bullshit on this subreddit.

Edit: fixed grammatical issues.
Oh yeah don’t get me wrong, I don’t have ANYTHING truly against drag itself. True, I might not like the loudness, but I don’t like much loudness at all. It’s not just drag in that respect. But I understand it’s connection to black queer expression. It’s just not my thing personally.

My main issue with being compared to/brought up in relation to drag isn’t anything tied to black queer expression as far as I know, but feel free to let me know otherwise. It’s more just the comparison to something that is most famously cis men dressing as women. And for me, it’s not even the idea of it “mocking femininity,” because I don’t view it like that at all. It’s the comparison to cis men that bothers me in relation to my identity.
you don’t have to respond if you’re not comfy (ik it wasn’t the main point of your post), but based on ur comments abt drag, do you wish that only Black ppl did drag since that’s where a lot of its roots are, or that non-Black ppl who do drag would express femininity in a different way so as to not appropriate? or another solution (if you think there is one)? just curious. thank you for taking the time to write about this!!
Happy cake day!

And yes, you're absolutely right.  Sometimes the people helping out or that are involved in some capacity really struggle to see that they also need to work on themselves.
Yikes. I hate seeing comments like this. Especially in a place where I hope to find belonging in.

Japan and China are homogenous. They arent a proclaimed 'melting pot' of culture. 

Also. If youre wanting to talk about racism in China or Japan. Advocate for the Ainu or Uyghur people. Dont throw in White people who often times enjoy a lot of benefits in those society.

Not to mention, this is the type of mindset / racism against Asian folks that I mention. We only get mentioned when you want to either-

1.) Put down other POC or
2.) Fetishize our culture.


Also drop the whole 'It must be an American thing'. Theres racism everywhere and you are naive if you think otherwise.
Do you have proof of this “racism” against white people in China and Japan? Also, in China during the 19th century, Britain and France along with other colonialist powers absolutely destroyed China. They fucking broke Chinese laws on selling opium, and then when China enforced their laws they used that as an opportunity to take over their ports, their land, and force unequal treaties on them.

Racism experiences from a POC coming from white people in the trans community. OP stated smth along the line of ""dont even try to argue just do better"". I have white privilege so I cannot grasp the amount of racism a poc experience in a community with a white majority. Still the path of ""Quid pro quo"" is undoubtedly the wrong one and as such any generalization by ethnicity is a dead end. I havent reported the post and hope OP wont understand the removal of the post as an hostile/racist action but I doubt it. Their voice must be heard and the problem is real I just dont agree with the course of denunciation
I see. That's certainly awful. Thanks for explaining!
If you have the emotional bandwidth to speak to someone who’s genuinely interested in learning more about this drag thing, I’d love to shoot you a message about it - it’s easier to learn from a conversation than a Google. That said, you’ve clearly been using a lot of energy to defend yourself here already, so I can absolutely Google on my own instead.

I swear this post was just made to drum up more hatred in this subreddit off a non issue (all white trans people apparently being racists) and people took it hook line and sinker.
Sorry if that's how it came across but that's not what I meant, I meant it literally; ""you make it sound as though"", I didn't say it was or wasn't so, I just asked how it is.
the dont say ""not all white people"" part sounds like none of us can not be racist in their eyes. I understand theyre angry, andxI have not had their experience, but that also sounds like im not allowed to say anything.
>she came here talking about drag because of a prior conversation SOMEONE ELSE STARTED HERE

There wasn't any context for this in the post itself. Taken by itself it looked like they were just talking about drag unprompted.   


""I'm a black transmasc person""  


not that its relevant but I'm a Native and Latina trans femme, and there are certain aspects of the post that I do agree with like being dysphoric comparing yourself to white beauty standards.  


I think you can point out negative aspects of a post as part of the conversation too, like with your response to mine.
OP's first ever interactions with trans communities on reddit were the day of this post.
[removed]
The reason why this post exists stems from a comment in a previous thread about drag. Basically a person made a reply there saying how they didn’t like the way drag queens talked. OP from this thread got into an argument about it, saying it was racist since drag has roots in the black community. 

Just thought I’d fill you in. Not that there’s rampant racism, but this just stems from a disagreement.
I hope you guys know that we greatly appreciate all your  hard work.

A lot of racism tends to be so ingrained that its increasingly easy to dismiss or be blind to it. We will do our due dilligence and advocate. But I know you guys are exposed to/shield us from a lot of tranaphobia, and have your work cut out for you.

So thank you for providing us a community.
>What does ‘trans people aren’t beacons’ mean?

That being trans doesn't automatically mean that you signed up to be an ambassador or representative for all trans people, and a reminder that while basic human decency is one standard, expecting trans people to be perfectly informed, gracious, articulate people and getting extra upset or critical when they aren't is to treat them like they aren't fallible humans like everyone else.
That and some Asian people dont have Asian names due to colonialization.

Emily is their legal birth name etc. Asians *having* Asian names or that we take a Westernized name is microaggression.

Some people say it to mean that trans people have flaws or faults too. That we are not perfect. But that shouldnt excuse racism.
>We’re not all like that.

a lot of us are like that; just being honest
it doesn’t matter if “we’re not all like that”. what matters is they can’t find a space to feel comfortable in because our predominantly white space doesn’t know how to realize when we’re alienating our brothers and sisters. don’t let me see you fall into the same mindset cis men do when women say men are terrible. because they are and you and i both know the nuances of that statement. i’m glad you agree that it’s unacceptable tho
Please explain how pointing out that someone who says all white people are racist and blames it on them being trans should make me ashamed. If anything buying into all the shit that's separating the queer community while acting like you deserve a medal should make you feel ashamed.
The only time I’ve seen a Black trans man on any trans sub here was when one posted on the ftm sub about the racist harassment he faced for being Black trans man and instantly got targeted with so much racist harassment from members of the sub in response he deleted his entire account within a handful of hours. That’s stuck with me through every interaction in the trans community I’ve had on Reddit honestly and was kind of the reason I stopped looking at and interacting with most of them as much as I was.
They’re just as integral to the community as anyone else, shame we don’t have any memes for our lads
I wonder if it has anything to do with folks who were socialized as boys kinda pipelining to reddit.

As a trans femme enby, i ended up on reddit cuz my guy friends used it for gaming stuff and i wasnt out yet, so i got on here too to fit in since i ""definitely was a boy and did boy stuff and was 100% not trans haha ^godiwishiwasagirl""

Might be anecdotal but idk
Absolutely, it’s fucking shameful what Reddit did here
This is the stuff automod tends to miss why it's so much more important to manually report it. This is why we have humans review it. We are capable of discerning subtext that is more nuanced.
As TallGeminiGirl said, report it anyways.

Even if the Reddit admins are stupid on such things, is moderators have your back 100%.

there’s a long historical legacy of black women being forcibly masculinized by white people (ie serena williams, michelle obama, megan thee stallion, nina simone). Because we don’t meet eurocentric standards of femininity it is harder for us to pass because white people view black women as less conventionally feminine.
As trans masc person an easy comparison would be to go to ftmpassing, you’ll find some black guys asking if they pass 90% of the time people will say yea, or they see some androgyny but yea for the most people. Sometimes you’ll see comments from other black people pointing out that the person might pass for white people but not for other black/latino people who are more familiar with facial features. 

My point in bringing that up is more about how the people saying passing might not be racist and are likely not even aware how they view black people differently in terms of masculinity. 


Black women are seen as more masculine, so for black trans  guys and transmascs it can help but be confusing if they’re not aware that what makes them masculine in a lot of peoples eyes are their black features before they even start T. 

So if that’s the case form black trans men and we know white trans women may struggle with being held to hyper feminine standards in some ways cis women will say they don’t want enforce on themselves, than that’s gotta give you an idea of where the standards for trans women are and how impossibly difficult that can be when the features of black cis women are seen as masculine. FFS wouldn’t just be about getting rid of masculine features but black ones as well.
Ugh that’s super fucking gross. 😡
i completely understand that, i completely understand that 🫂 i think it’s v frustrating that cis men own drag spaces tho. Ru Paul famously said trans women couldn’t be drag queens snd that never made sense to me because like… all gender is sort of a performance to me. And engaging in drag shouldn’t be reserved for cis men. However, i do think the comparison is very problematic especially considering the transphobic political rhetoric that uses drag as a jumping pad
It's annoying. It's like the ""I can't be racist I'm not explicit"" argument but since they look after you there's also the dependence on them and the implication that you're ungrateful. Even if they don't do that stuff, since there's a problem with your care, if they never get around to changing you get a constant reminder of the problem.

So I see you don’t understand what racism is. That’s kind of embarrassing in 2022, no?

See, I'm gonna have to disagree with you again. I totally get that racism in America, which is an incredibly racist nation, is entirely different in other places. However, very very few white nations can claim to have (I would say none, but I'm not 110% sure) a nonracist past and culture. America has one of the most horrible histories when it comes to racism, but other countries are not innocent. They may have not had the extreme slavery system like they did in America, but those overseas investors were still supporting and profiting off of American slavery. What about Belgium, Spain, France? Just look at the entire concept of social Darwinism. There are so many white countries that have committed atrocities against POC and it is just historically inaccurate to claim that it wasn't racism.

I'm not saying that white people can't experience racism and I know that they can, but we have to look at the magnitude of things. It's like getting into a car crash where most people died or were seriously injured and you sprained your ankle. If your friend who is now paralysed is venting about how devastated they are, you wouldn't say ""hey, I got hurt too"".

I disagree with the blanket statement that ""white people can't experience *any* racism"" but I think we have to put it into perspective. White people can experience racism, but it is not the same historically and culturally and systematically. I think that's where people get caught up. It's not true, but it is unnecessary to say the opposite when we're having conversations about racism.
yikes. no, it wasn't made for that at all. all white people are inherently racist, which is why working towards being anti-racist is so important. we all need to unlearn the way we have been raised in a racist society. it had nothing to do with them thinking all white trans people specifically are racist, they were correctly identifying that all white people inherently benefiting from and/or enjoying a racist society and being trans actually doesn't change that
Yeah I know what you meant. However what I’m pointing out is how you’re automatically questioning the validity of op’s experience and asking for proof instead of being even a little bit considerate of a reality and experience that is not your own.

> ""...can continually have racist interactions with white people...you all always seem to think that they're excused from everything.""

after that theres an exhaustive list of things that have personally happened to her in general with white trans people. how does that list not imply that she's talking about things that have happened to her within the trans community in context? that list isn't a hypothetical, and shes not inserting drag into trans culture, she's talking about things that have happed to her within the trans community. assuming she's the one ""coming into a trans subreddit to talk about drag"" is Not Accurate. 

i think divulging my race and Transgender Type (lol) is completely reasonable in talking about how the comment about progesterone was from her end, reasonable, and criticizing it feels like obfuscating from her point from me, a black person who is also Directly Affected by the assumption that everyone here is on progesterone.

making a comment that is ALL ABOUT framing how she talks and what points she chooses to make and How she chooses to make them as ""odd"" and ""weird"" is tone policing. She should not have to go through her post with a fine tooth comb and remove anything Mildly Objectionable before posting for you or anyone else to recognize the anti-black racism she constantly faces and look inward instead of nitpicking tiny things, constantly, to discount her feelings and argument on a VENT POST.
It's legitimately not the first time racism has stepped it's way into this subreddit. While we do our best to make sure that that doesn't make it's way to the eyes of our users, that doesn't make us perfect.

My point is, is that I already saw the thread in question before asking this here, so I was already aware of the context. That this is something that should always be given an ear to, as even if it looks like it stemmed from a single incident, that doesn't mean it is.

Though I am thankful that you made sure to inform me either way!
<3

We try our best honestly, which is what matters to me. We can always be better, and we try our best to do just that, but that's why we listen so closely to the community. You're the people who make this place truly great ngl.
Makes sense. I kind of guessed, but I’d never heard that term for it before and it’s not entirely intuitive to my brain so I wanted to rule out other interpretations.  Thanks.
I’m absolutely not denying anti-Asian racism or the effects of colonization; I’m curious if you consider any immigration and subsequent generational assimilation to be bad. 

And yeah it’s not the only reason, I was just annoyed by ‘they take ours too!’ as a defense.
I know…
She didn't say all white people are racist, that's so fucking disingenuous. You are blatantly lying when we can all read the post in front of us. And your bullshit about ""separating the queer community"" is ignorant reductionism at best, and deliberate erasure of intersectionality at worst. 

The absolutely audacity and lack of self-awareness you must possess to try and gaslight people about the post and say the the person is lying/overreacting while displaying THE EXACT FUCKING BEHAVIOR they complained about takes absolutely monumental levels of arrogance and hypocrisy. Fucking wow.
The hell? I feel bad for that dude. Posts like this and that need to be a wake up call that we need to do better and being trans doesn’t make us immune to being bigots.
I got into Reddit because of Nexpo and other Internet mystery/creepy/truecrime YouTubers kept mentioning it and I wanted to be where all the weird things were happening haha, but then stayed because I found communities I actually was really interested in

And that makes sense! I hear a lot that there’s a higher percentage of guys on Reddit, so it would make sense for there to be a higher percentage of trans women too because of what you mentioned
""Reddit is a bastion of freeze peach and you are much less likely to be banned here than you are used to on other platforms (for hatespeech, we're still gonna systemically silence marginalized voices)""
Yeah the mod team here has been on-point in axing dog-whistles which Reddit Admins are content to leave. Have always been impressed by the mods here.

I always seen black women as having more femenine bodies I was always confused why there are people who see blackness as more masculine, maybe my autism had to do to to absorb those prejuices.

 I'm from a Latin american country and there's a lot of colorism there, more light skinned trans women we are seen as ""more of a woman"" even though more aren't I have the privilege of being pale that in part made pasing easy for me because more people here are bron skinned people who idealize witheness as an standard of female beuty. In sex work withe trans women are seen as ""premium"" but also because of that ligth skinned trans women are more likely to be forced into sex traffic because gangs can get more money from them, one of my friends had to hide because a sex traffic mafia marked her. 

I think the dinamics of racism and colorism even though have parallels are different in countries where more people are brownskined, than where most people are withe.
You see it all the time. Two of the most common ones I see are ""why do gay people need representation, they don't face problems we let them marry"" and ""we had a black president, racism has been solved""
Yeah, I didn’t like the comparison before but it’s gotten all the more uncomfortable. Honestly I think that sentiment could go both ways though, we’re all in more danger when these types of misunderstandings run rampant. Especially when they run through our so called allies.

I never liked the fact that RuPaul said trans women can’t be drag queens, but your comment is the first time I’m really thinking about the concept and I do like it. Even if it’s not my thing, I wanna make sure I’m giving it the respect it deserves
That sounds absolutely baffling and unpleasant. :( I'm sorry you have to deal with that constantly.  It's like it almost becomes an abusive dynamic it seems like, where you can't speak your mind, but it hurts.

Unless we’re using a different definition than that in the dictionary, i’m pretty sure that saying all people of one race are transphobic is a racist statement.

That is assuming a FUCK ton about people you do not know. No one is ""inherently racist"", and saying that a whole population is just inherently racist is just outright wrong. Racist people exist, yes, I'm not disputing that, but saying that an entire group of people is just automatically racist makes so many leaps of logic it's not even funny. Racism is a problem, it is a problem that needs to be combated, but just pointed to a large part of humanity and saying ""you're all racist"" is not going to help the issue, you're only making divides between groups larger and vindicating people who actually are racist.
Look at OP’s post history. They hadn’t posted on a trans sub until the day they made this. Regardless of your beliefs, this was most likely made to drum up hatred.
hmmm.. maybe. but I feel also theyre trying to control and invalidate me.
""and shes not inserting drag into trans culture""  


I stand by that without context it did seem like she was just inserting drag into the conversation about trans people. And looking into the post that she's referencing in general, I think the original post was a valid point. It can be exhausting being associated with Drag, not because it stems from black culture but because the concept of Drag- dressing up in oppositely gendered clothing as a performance- can be invalidating when its automatically associated with trans people.  


""in talking about how the comment about progesterone was from her end, reasonable""  


I disagree that it was reasonable telling people to stop taking a hormone useful for trans femme transition as if its either be knowledgeable or be able to take part of your hrt. Not to mention that her post was about white trans people in general which includes trans mascs, but with that comment it puts the focus on trans femmes. Which, as your comment saying you're directly affected by the assumption that everyone here is on progesterone, wouldn't you understand? Or is it fine for trans femmes to be singled out like that?   


""she constantly faces""  


I don't doubt that black trans people do constantly face racism; however, in this specific case she only started posting in trans subreddits the same day that she made this post.  All of the people that interacted with her had their comments removed by moderators as well. It's an odd series of events, and I don't think it's unreasonable to point out odd parts of it. But this will be my last reply.

It's not too annoying. It is with trans issues. Racial issues though...

She pulls the ""not all white people"" thing if you criticise white people. She pulls the ""what about white people"" if you point out hate. She does it so often she has no idea she is just blocking out black issues and not other races. I know she doesn't want to do that but she is so defensive and takes criticism as an attack that she straight up can't accept stuff that doesn't agree with her and she doesn't even realise she does it. It's gotten to the point that if I question her decisions or ask her to let me speak she says I'm trying to scilence her and take over. No, I just don't want her to speak over me, her word count is always way higher. In the end she just pulls the ""I'm the parent"" shit. Some other family memebers do it too, but unlike her lack of logic, the other people with that authority mentality end up triggering suicide attempts so I kinda just learnt to go into hiding.
Ok here's an update. I stepped in when my mum was pressuring my brother to stop using the computer. I ended up getting mum to leave but only after a fight. After that I calmed him down and got him to bed. I made things better. This happens every time, when I can step in the problem is fixed. But mum is angry as she isn't in control. My relatives are similar but I am scared of them with the panic almost making me kill myself a few days ago, something I'm still not over. I still feel like I'm a terrible person for not letting my brother get set up for pain and failure the way I was as they know exactly how to make me feel bad. I know they mean well but this is a horrible thing to do. It's not even about age, I'm ND, he's getting assessed, naturally I know better about treating him. I don't even utilise it much. Just ask the right questions and he'll figure out the best method by himself. The relatives though I can't get to go away. The fear and defamation is so much I just believe them. That's why my whole childhood was me yelling slurs at myself while punishing myself with torture for not killing myself. As I forced myself to conform, and my lack of conformity was literally wired into me, I believed I was a horrible person for being autistic, a sentiment that still pops up now around being trans too. I know first hand what this parenting does to neurodivergent people. The trauma is a huge problem even now. Once again, I still can't get over the idea I'm a bad person for stopping him from having the same fate.

Even now, I am filled with all these bad mindsets and these hateful views I only apply to myself due to how it's messed up how I process feelings. ""Trans people are valid, not me though."" ""There's nothing bad about having ASD, I'm a horrible person for it though.""
Since it's still ongoing I can't heal, just keep hiding myself from my feelings of being a horrible person.

Saying white people are doing this does not mean all white people are doing it. For instance if I say, people are using the internet a lot, I'm not saying all people are, so it wouldn't be excluding people with no internet.

In the context of marginalisation though, it's actually harmful especially as people are less open to discussion so people will take posts less seriously and people will feel less responsible and will be less likely to act. 

I see it first hand all the time. That's just one of the reasons your getting all the downvotes, I'm sure more experienced people could point out some of the others.

Here: I openly admit that my country, America, is significantly worse than many other countries when it comes to racism. I acknowledge that this is not the case for a lot of other countries.   
  
Now as for saying racism in the past and racism in the present, I don’t think we can just say “we’re better now, the end” and be done with it. When a nation has a history of racism, that is baked deeply into it. I’m truly glad that New Zealand has so much less racism than America, and a lot of other countries for that matter, but I don’t think you can say in good faith that there is no racism in the system. I would argue that refusing to even open conversation about racism in your country is only going to create or exacerbate a problem. Outright saying that racism simply does not exist whatsoever in your society is not a fair thing to say.  
  
But I personally feel this conversation about New Zealand is beyond the point. Like you said, you are the minority. Just like the magnitude and severity of racism towards white people is incomparable to that of POC, the existence of your country, if it is somehow 100% perfect, hardly makes a dent in the world. A POC is sharing her experience and, while I disagree that anything is black and white (white people cannot experience racism, all white nations have racism), what do you hope to accomplish by shooting this down? You’ve essentially just poked your head in to say “not all white people!” without offering anything constructive. You haven’t said that it would be more correct to say “white people experience a much less severe and systematic kind of racism than POC” and instead have just said “you are racist to make an exaggerated statement about the state of the world”.   
  
Do you at least see how it looks from an outsider perspective to see someone say that?
A few people are downvoting this, but nobody has actually made any claims to the contrary. Pretty sure that says enough. I would genuinely love to be wrong about this, so if I’m missing something, please tell me.
I'm glad this is your last reply, because its full of bad faith readings of what this post said, who the person behind it is, and what she meant by saying it. She's not literally telling people not to use progesterone, shes not saying no one is allowed to be uncomfortable being compared to a drag queen by cis people, she's not saying every racist trans person is transfemme, and holy fuck this random person is not a sudden fucking reddit conspiracy because she started posting in trans subs Directly Recently. she has posts in her post history from other trans subs. she mentions trans people, being trans, and leftist theory in other subreddits. she has a fucking COMMENT HISTORY. maybe nonblack trans people assuming the worst about her because she dared speak up about intersectionality and racism when she saw it IS THE REASON WHY SHE DOESNT INTERACT WITH THIS FUCKING SUB ALL THAT OFTEN. jesus.

Thank you for sharing.  That sounds like a really bad physical situation, and it weighs very heavily on you.  You are not a bad person.  I know a stranger on the internet saying it doesn't mean much, but if you are trying to help your brother, that would say so much to the contrary.  I would also consider that healing isn't a spell you cast or an action you take and you're done.  Healing takes a very long time.  You are valid, and your emotions are very real.  I'm sorry you are also just coming back from attempted suicide.  That is not an easy place to be.  I am grateful that you're here.  You being here gave me much greater insight into things.  Again, I know it doesn't help you much, but I want you to know that someone does care.
[removed]
I dont care that I’m getting downvotes. I knew that I would because I’m calling out racism against white people. It’s not popular, but it’s right. 

The OP said “white people dont even view cisgender people as human” pls justify how that isnt racist. Even if you apply your logic about “it’s not ALL white people”, this is still applying a stereotype to white people. Last I checked, that’s racist.
[removed]

Not that anyone likely cares anymore, but status update: I am almost certainly wrong as this person has continued posting on trans subs. Still confused why this post was made after only one day, but it’s much better than them being a troll.

Coming out to transphobic, hateful father today. Please hype me up	"My dad and I have been in one of the best places in our relationship for a while now, but I started transitioning 3 months ago and really need to come out for my mental health. He’s a huge POS tho when it comes to trans people, so I don’t imagine the call will go well. Can I get some love to hype me up a bit before I make the call?

The call happened: 
“I believe you’re a product of a bad society”
“You’ll never be a woman”
“I’m so sorry you feel that way”
“You’re not trans. I raised you. You don’t have gender dysphoria.”
“You do you, but you’re just a female impersonator.”
“The radical trans movement is destroying society by breaking down the family dynamic.”

He didn’t outright disown me so hopefully some small amount of a relationship can be managed. I’ll just have to see how things go…"	"Have a support person next to you during the call.
Writing a letter to my parents was the best option for me. It prevented them from arguing and allowed me to  explain how I’m doing it for the betterment of my mental health and allowed me to set boundaries with them
1. Drop the plot twist all in one sentence, ""I'm transgender, my name is now x, my pronouns are x, and I know you don't like it but I don't care what you think"" 
2. Hang up
3. Do the bully Maguire dance from Spider Man 3
You got this!!! Make sure you'll be safe please 🥺
Good Luck and I hope it goes well.
Good luck mate.
Well, let him know that no matter what he says, it won’t change who you are. You my friend, are an amazing person and if he can’t see that than that’s his loss
You've got this! In the worst case scenario you get to truly be yourself! Anyone who doesn't like it isn't worth your time!
Expected Hype: LETS FUCCING GO, POP OFF!!!!

Realistic Hype: Please be safe and like the others have mentioned to have someone there for you just in case
You are a woman no matter what bigots and terfs say.
You got this.
My dad said the same kind of stuff. I ended up having to cut him out of my life because every time I talked to him it hurt me so bad, and he wouldn’t let me come to family events in anything remotely feminine. Some people are misguided and stubborn. I realized my father had never asked me about what I was feeling or thinking my entire life, much less now. It’s impossible to have a relationship with someone who refuses to empathize. 

Hopefully it goes better for you. But if not, fuck him!
I hope it goes well for you, and I'm sure you're making the right decision. 💕
YOU'VE GOT THIS!!!!💜 Just be safe though, from personal experience I know that it isn't easy and if it goes wrong it goes wrong. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself:)
You can do this! Maybe script it out to help with organizing your thoughts? Always helps me when I'm making a phone call or giving a talk
You can do it!!  :D  just make sure you're safe <3
Coming out can be rough but just know there's a community out here that have your back. I really hope he accepts you, I really do but if it goes bad we got you.
coming out can be terrifying, especially to unaccepting people like your father =/
wishing you luck, and strength to get through it.
you can do this.
You got dis
U got it!!!! Ur loved no matter what!!!♡♡♡♡
You got this homie!!!!
My parents used to be gay (and transphobic) until they stopped and consodered that their own kids might turn out gay themselves. Might be tje same for your dad
Wait this post was 5 hours ago how did it go?
its like you’re me lol. i actually plan on writing my dad a letter because i’m better at getting my thoughts out that way. maybe you could do that for yourself preemptively so you could have sort of a “script” to go off of while you’re on the phone with him. good luck! i really hope it goes better than you’re anticipating.
Hype! You'll be just fine. Nothing anyone can say can take away the joy of feeling like a real person for the first time. You are going to be perfectly alright my dear.
Good luck mate, you got this
you got this dude. you’re so much more than just his opinion
Good luck and I hope it will go well.
Whatever he says isn't the most important, just remember to love yourself as you are
I am so sorry you have been through this. I Wish you good luck :). I hope it will goes Well for you. It’s never Fun having transpobic family, know What’s like. I’m here if you need anyone to talk to☺️
God that’s horrible, I’m so sorry you had to hear those things. What an utter load of crap — you’ve got a whole life ahead of you being a complete woman and embodying yourself, there’s not much you can do that’s truer than that. Sending love to you x
A hateful transphobic anybody is someone that you don't need in your life
Honestly, if my dad would have reacted like this I wouldn't even try to keep a relationship with him
[removed]
You got this! Good luck
You could also do it by text messages so you dont have to deal with his reaction until you are ready to see it
My very best of luck that everything went well.
i hope it goes well!!
As someone who dealt with this alone, and as others have suggested, have someone close to you there when you do it. You are strong. You got this!
im sorry for making a little joke but i would just
-video call
-say ""i'm actually trans""
-he would probably say alot of shit so just keep gangnam sytyling until he rage quits
No matter what other people say, you are who you believe you are. And there's many many people that feel exactly the same way you do. You are loved, you are seen, and you are valid. Dont ever let anyone define you except yourself.

All my love, 
Jamie 💕
ive felt ""that way"" for a while, but i havent told anyone in my family yet, it just seems to threatening. so yeah, i kinda get you, we all do.

also funnily enough though i havent told any of my family i have told my online friend (mostly because weve known eachother for a year we trust eachother and she came out as trans first)
Good luck
You got this babygirl!!
Well the thing about his type of thinking is that he's close minded if you introduce a radical new idea into the complex belief system that he has even if it's just one minor tweek he has to change the whole belief system he has old generations always disagree with modern people and ideas it's all about you and what you want you can live to your idealistic standard of what you want out of life or you can live life by their standards and that's a recipe for misery people can easily say hateful things but if you had the whole world together and said say one good thing about each other they couldnt if the love they give you is dependent on your sexuality and gender they didn't love you alot to begin with but why they flip their lid about it is cause they love you so much they don't want you to make decisions in haste but your life is exactly that your life not theirs the parents job is to raise you like they were raised but better and sometimes they don't do a good job you're a vibrant color filled person they don't see you for the soul and who you want to be when people die they're known for what they did not what they wanted to do you can be whatever you want I'm a kitchen cabinet but I do wanna transition one day when I can afford a doctor be the best person you can be along the way this transformation is beautiful a metamorphosis into a butterfly don't let anyone tell you different the world is full of hate so throw hearts 💕🌈
Damn. My father's the same way, hates people who are different, I don't get it man. I'm sorry the call didn't go well, but hey we are here for you
You got this!!!!
I’m so happy to come back and see that those post is at six hundred and sixty six upvotes
Cps?
i hope everything turn out better than you thought it would, my parents weren't very onboard at first either, But hey were all here for you no matter what happens out there good luck!
I’m hoping for positive things for you. I am trans, and only recently fully came out to myself. I have come out to my parents but no one else. My parents are very religious so I was absolutely terrified. I have not started transitioning yet. But they more or less told me they think it’s wrong but they’ll always love and accept me. Obviously not what I wanted but it could definitely have been worse, since so many people end up straight up disowned. I’ll be thinking about you today and sending positive vibes your way. Always be yourself. If they don’t accept you you don’t need them. Family or not. I know that’s easy to say, but just know, you have friends here. You aren’t alone. I felt alone for the longest, still do sometimes, and I’m sure you do too. But you can always talk or reach out to me if you need.
Dont do it allone if ut mum is supporting have her their
Hahahahahahahaha SAME why do I get the feeling that I'm fucked?
Fathers… have it wired that you/we are a representation of themselves. So, admitting or empathy is like they are that themselves. So, it’s not about you, it’s all about them. Trans is seen as something bad, perverse, mentally unstable. It’s none of those things obviously but that’s how it’s wired and that’s why getting through to them is nearly impossible. It would mean changing themselves and it’s not them that’s transitioning but in a way, disclosing to them requires that kind of interpersonal work and well.., that’s not happening any time soon. I wouldn’t force anything on them… you do and be you, but you will be coming up against a brick wall if you are expecting him to shift. Understanding this will help you navigate the least combative path until he is better educated and more accepting.
Hope all goes the best for you
Tell him ""if you really love me,this won't affect our father/son (daughter) relationship"" 

Me,i literally said..

""Listen everyone,I've known this for 20 years. I'm about to start a journey. You're either with me or you'll be against me like many others. I'm transgender. I want hormone therapy and want to become a girl. If that's gonna be a problem for y'all,you can kick me out"".

Nobody kicked me out,they said they don't really understand transgender... only that you're born in the wrong body. But they respect it.
Parents are also influenced by their friends. Both my parents were very negative initially ""You've just ruined our whole life.. bla bla bla"". However, the reaction from my parents friends was massively sympathetic to me... ""it must have been so hard for her growing up as a boy.."" and mums friend said "".. oh yea my son is gay now.."" and so on.. they hear about gay person this and that and that life goes on.   Long story short, whole family is now fully supportive -they did a 180. So have faith it can get better.   If it doesn't, just leave the door open... it may just take more time.

I’ll do my best. I’m hoping to do the call at work so I have to compartmentalize it until I’m home
I’ve considered this, I just have something in the back of my head telling me I have to do it over call since I can’t do it in person. Idk exactly why I just feel like it would be doing a disservice to do it any other way.
may i ask what you included in your letter? i'm working on one for my parents right now and i wanna make sure i'm doing it right
Lol this is a good idea! Thanks!
Thank you! I live on the entire other side of the US so I think I’ll be okay.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much! That’s how I am with everyone else in my life I’ve just been petrified of doing this with my dad
Exactly my thoughts. It needs to happen anyway, his reaction is important but it’s something you can’t control. Being happy and not living a lie is
Thank you 💖💖💖
Thank you!
Sadly I don’t expect it to get better. I hope that we can at least talk and stay partially in each other’s life and just not talk about it. If he won’t respect my boundaries I’ll have to cut him out
Thank you! I’m not looking forward to it, but this needs to happen so I can fully come out and be who I want to be
We live on opposite sides of the US so no risk of physical issues, I’m just doin spiraling in my head over how *exactly* he’s going to react
That’s a great idea! Thank you so much!
Thank you! We don’t live near each other,
So no safety risk
Thank you so much! I’m not hopeful, but my therapist has been emphasizing that I need to stop doom spiraling and stressing over what I don’t know for sure. I need to make it real and have the conversation
I’m on the call now trying to get a little bit of nice memory talk before I say it
Thank yo so much!
Thank you!
My dad is gay. Like actively. Has been out since my mom divorced him when I was 4 (currently 25)
Haven’t quite yet. Will update after the call
Me too, I might write a bit of a script but I think it’s just gonna have to be “hey dad, I’m trans.” And see how it goes.
Yeah, Between my fear of how the conversation will go and knowing how much it hurt to cut him out of my life last time (we didn’t talk for 3 years) my anxiety has been spinning out of control.
Thank you! Luckily, my chosen family is great. I haven’t exactly had a great relationship with blood for a long time. Right now my only real focus is becoming who I truly want to be. Anything else is just an unfortunate byproduct
Thank you! I’m looking forward to who I will make of myself!
I will try to maintain the smallest bit of a connection, in hopes there’s improvement, but I highly doubt there will be. I am fully ready to cut him off should it get to that
Definitely not changing my mind, but it probably will affect me for a while if things go as bad as I expect
I logically know this is an option, but some part of me feels like I have to do this in a call. It’s a big life changing event and doesn’t seem like it should be over text.
Thank you! I’m having some food and then I’m gonna make the call 😵
Thank you! I’m eating now and then I’m just gonna have to rip the bandaid
lol 😂 don’t apologize for that that’s great
Thank you!!!! 💖💖💖
That’s amazing that you have friends that you *can* talk to! Family will sadly not always be there for you. I hope yours have a better reaction than mine!
Thank you! Now that that conversation is over I can finally post on social media and come all the way out to the public (is that a weird way to put that? Lol).
Thank you!
I’m a full ass adult lol I just need to have this conversation.
Fathers… (some fathers) have it wired that you/we are a representation of themselves. So, accepting you or having empathy is like they are accepting that for themselves. So, it’s not about you, it’s all about them. Trans is seen as something bad, perverse, mentally unstable to them… It’s none of those things obviously but that’s how it’s wired and that’s why getting through to them is nearly impossible. It would mean changing themselves and it’s not them that’s transitioning, but in a way, disclosing to them requires that kind of interpersonal work for them to undertake and well.., that’s not happening any time soon. 

I wouldn’t force anything on them… you do and be you, but you will be coming up against a brick wall if you are expecting him to shift. Understanding this will help you navigate the least combative path until he is better educated and more accepting.

Otherwise, your options are to estrange yourselves… both hoping each other will come to their senses. So it’s a kind of relationship stalemate. Both hoping the other will come to their senses. 

I’m trans so I get this dynamic… deep personal relationships like a spouse, kids, parents are to me the most challenging aspects of being trans today. This will change down the road and get better with time. But today is unfortunately this and it sucks. Good luck 💕
Excuse me?

Edit: man I sure wish I had the opportunity to read whatever bull shit you responded with before it was removed or you deleted it.
Dont use work phone numbers if he harrses you u could end up loosing your job.
Just do what you think is best! Definitely have some friends with you for support, though. I actually tried to use that as leverage in my discussions with my parents-that transition success is correlated with how much support someone has. I was transitioning regardless of their support but I let them know that my transition success odds would be better if they would support me
if the phone call is important to you, you could still write out the letter so you have your thoughts prepared, and then just read it on the call!

for me that would be a lot less nerve wracking than speaking spontaneously

either way, good luck!!! you got this!!!
Yay! Good luck 💖
Always my friend, and remember, you got this!
I absolutely understand! It's very hard sometimes coming out to certain people but just know we're all here for you and rooting for you! 😁😁💙 You can do it!
Exactly!
Totally !
Yeah I get that, how far have you transitioned?
It always boggles my mind when socially oppressed groups are biased or phobic against other socially oppressed groups that are experiencing oppression for similar reasons as they are.
Okay hope it goes well ^^
[removed]
It is a big life changing thing but remember that's theres no right way to come out to anyone if you want to do it by a call you should if you decide on a text email or zoom/discord video call it's up to you I just wish you luck
I remember when I did, I had my dad get in my car then I drove too fast for him to get out so he had to listen, and had no where to go or way to stop me
dont count on it. my mom is super against it. shes like ""no way children should not be exposed to that shit"" when it would be so helpful to let children learn who they are as a person
I wouldn't say so myself!! As long as it makes you comfortable fuck what anyone else would have to say!!self love baby
Ah, okay
[deleted]
It didn’t go *entirely* horribly I guess
Yea I feel so much lighter now that I’ve crossed this bridge and I’m finally not agonizing over it 24/7
I’m two days shy of 3 months of HRT
Thank you! I don’t expect to deal with it. If he starts laying on the hate I’ll just hang up, so I guess I should just get it over with and stop stressing it 😵
Thank you!
Jesus Christ 😂 that’s wild.
at least by middle/highschool in my opinion
I second this
I’ll lyk when I get there 😵 I’m not even telling my great grandparents because *well* they’re probably not gonna be around tooooooo much longer
I’m glad you still feel hopeful.. because he’s going to get there, it sounds like. The beginnings of this openness are full of triggers. .. for you as well, I imagine.
Did you change your name? That's what confused mine most besides me being enby
[removed]
It was. He told me I was scaring him, and that’s when I said “good you’re as afraid as I am.” It took him a bit, but he came around. I do not recommend my method by any means. For a conversation to happen, one needs to be willing to talk, as much as the other needs to be willing to listen.
No, sadly I do not believe we will actually be able to reconcile. I’m just trying to be optimistic.
I have changed my name. My mother is “working through it” and hasn’t started calling me by it yet, but she’s supportive otherwise. My dad doesn’t know anything yet
Thank you!
I doubt there will be much conversation. He’s constantly sending me clips from *that* Joe Rogen interview and other transphobic media. He’s certain trans people are the signal for the end of civilization 😵
I had a similar experience its been months and gotten like 5 percent better so hourly yours will get better too as the denial faces
My mother did the same thing, but tries to be respectful. My dad's just like a person that lives in 1900. Says it's ""just a trend"" and won't respect it. Meanwhile when I show I'm mad at him he says I don't have any respect and gets mad
People act differently when it’s there own., sometimes it gets better, sometimes worse. I again hope for the best for you. You deserve love and acceptance.
My mom is “grieving” (I *HATE* this. I’m *not* dead.) and isn’t ready to switch to my preferred pronouns and name
I want to tell unpleasant person(oh believe me I have some other words) that is my father that his straight cis masculine son is dead so bad. Maybe he'd understand then, because I'm not going to stop floating through life. (A pun on being genderfluid XD)"	xmv7ww	trans	661	0.99	2022-09-24 15:06:12
He can in 1 sec end my depression and dysphoria for an hour I love him so much! Give him some pets pls he deserves it 🥺		"Oh my gosh! He looks just like my cat and I totally feel the same way. Arent they wonderful?
Ever wonder is animals want to be the opposite sex? And we just can’t know
😸👋💞
That's a good cat. I love that cat.
Kitties are the best anti-depressant.
Its amazing how much kitties can make a day better.  It looks like you have a very sweet boy, I send all the pets to the good kitty. <3

Such a precious baby 🥰
I have Autism Spectrum, and heightened sensory anxiety (not sure how to describe that without being self limiting).  one thing that the furry friend is very helpful with is calming me.  I LOVE to put my ear to their side and listen to their purr, it’s such a beautiful blessing, and gift.  I actually teared up writing this.  Maybe it could help you?!  Please let me know if it does!  🤓🙃
KITTY. I have a half Maine Coon (he is fluffy and big) and he's a bastard but I love him. I would pet your kitty if I could!
Awwwwwww💕

Look at the chonkey Boi!

r/chonkers
In The other Photo he showed his non existent balls he is such a bastard but my wonderful bastard
Same I liked to use they/them for him but he/him just suit his character so much
Yes he is good
Yeah he really helped my depression since he is here
He is the best boy even tho he has a comrade my older sweetheart
She looks sweet
THAT'S THE TRUTH
Thank you I did pet him for you
YES
He can be a devil tho but I love him
Yea fair enough then only saving grace is they probably don’t care as long as he gets fed and hugged lmao

Yeah he is a real hugger and always wants smuches"	lx2p7b	trans	656	1.0	2021-03-03 19:50:48
On this, the last day of Pride 2022, I feel like giving up…	"I’m fighting to be here. Every. Single. Day. Dysphoria is such a beast… I don’t know how much fight this girl’s got left…

I’ve told my family I’m struggling. They’re all just ignoring what’s going on.

Just need some encouragement…"	"Your brightest day have yet to come love. You're so strong for still being here. You've fought so hard don't stop now. I know you're tired but I believe in you. If you ever need anything I'm just a message away 💜
Giving up is not an option. Keep up the fight, you will succeed. Think positve and that vibe helps a lot.
You got this girl, you will be able to be your best self you just gotta keep going!
Stay strong girl!! We’re with you every step of the way. 💖🏳️‍⚧️🥰
Hope's a poweful thing. Everyday you keep moving forward is you moving one day closer to being able to live your truth.
Hey, I know the road is long and rough and during all the parts where you hit hurtful rough patches things are gonna feel awful and crazy but It gets better! 

Someday you're gonna wake up next to the one you love who accepts you for your truth and loves you till the end of time and you're gonna walk over to the mirror and fall in love with yourself!

Life is scary and people are garbage but you are a wonderful person who is just on the verge of being their own perfect, beautiful masterpiece!

So don't give up and keep walking your road to your own truth and your own happieness!
I came close once. Had the knife to my wrist. My friends had basically all abandoned me, my dog was sick, I didn't have the money to help him, I was struggling just to pay rent, and Trump was president. I was hanging on because of a guy at work. He would always check in on me, bring me snacks and drinks, talk to me about a lot of pretty deep things, and flirt. When he got fired, it was kind of the last straw, so I got the knife. I hadn't been answering one of my friends for about ten hours by then. I had fallen asleep after drinking myself into a stupor and woke up early ready to do it. Had the music on. Had a note written that started as a journal entry. She kept texting me. All through the night and into the morning. Finally, she lost her shit and said she was coming to my place. She had a key so she could have gotten in. But something about her saying she was on the way gave me just enough of a breath to pull me back. We talked, she helped me figure out the money situation, she helped me dig out of it. She kept me going for a bit and helped me find my legs again. Even after I got fired I remembered that and fought through all of my dark days until finally meeting my Fiance. If I had killed myself, he'd still be the daughter of a christian cult's pastor and wouldn't be on his way to finding himself and fulfilling his dreams, and I never would have met my cats. So, no, don't give up. Don't ever give up. You fight every day no matter how hard it seems and you get stronger with each day. You scratch, you claw, you fight your way to victory because your very existence is a riot. Are we clear?

You got this even though I might be the last day of pride month never stop showing your pride for as long as you live you mean the world to everyone around you you got this no matter who thinks it's wrong or not or if they disagree or not just know that my love and that people will always care and you are not in the wrong so have a great day and keep believing in yourself ❤️🥰🤩✨✨
To quote a very good book:

“You told me it would get worse.” “It will,” Wit said, “but then it will get better. Then it will get worse again. Then better. This is life, and I will not lie by saying every day will be sunshine. But there will be sunshine again, and that is a very different thing to say. That is truth. I promise you, Kaladin: You will be warm again.”

I *highly* recommend the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson in general. It has some of the best depictions of mental health issues in fiction. As an added bonus, one of the characters is trans; admittedly, he's a side character, but he's on the same side as the heroes and the closest thing to a negative reaction he gets for being trans is brief surprise.
Stay strong!! 💜
Honestly it sounds like you might need mental health help love. I have a saying where  i say basically ""being trans is beautiful, transitioning it's ass). Being trans takes dedication, it's not easy. I lost my family, friends and my day ones. Cause they couldn't accept me, it sucked but I'm happier now cause i have people who love me and care for me now for being me, instead of a bullshit disguise i used to do. I understand dsyphoria sucks(it's ass). But transitioning takes years it's a process. But like j Cole said(""it's beauty in the struggle""). Honestly if not comfortable with how your journey is going you can always talk about upping doses, using injections, taking progesterone. I know this might sound condescending but transitioning is hard, but if you stick with it, you'll learn to see the beauty you possess (also fuck everyone who disses you and left you. Like the quote from nip Hussle(r.i.p) ""would you rather be at war with yourself, and at peace with the world? Or would you rather be at peace with yourself and at war with the world?"" Everything is hard at first, you get better with time. I truly wish you the best and hope things get better for you
Sorry you are struggling, if you need to talk to someone, reach out. Stay strong, don't give up. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈❤️
*Intense virtual hugging*
Pm me. I'm always here.
The days you’re beaten down so hard you don’t know if you can get back up, remember the little things. The little pleasures, the little victories. It doesn’t always help, but some days it can. Stay strong 💖
Stay strong, you're an amazing woman and all of us are here for you. Consider how your progress from here onwards would be rather than where you might be now 💙💞🤍💞💙 Lots of love, Lexi
Dysphoria sucks but it’s going to get so much better! We are here for you!! Keep going, you got this!

If you ever want to talk, my dms are open
press through !!!! everyday you survive is a day the world is better just because you exist. i know u can do it and i know that things will be brighter in the future
Hey girl, I want you to go turn on “In Passing by Indica”. Then come back and read the rest of this with that playing.

Ok you’re back?  Now, I want you to think back over your life, the things you were, and now aren’t, the incredibly difficult obstacles you’ve surpassed.  

See?  Everything passes, sometimes we do have to work hard to get through the opposition we face.  Also, once we get through some of the hardest stuff, the good things are there for us to enjoy, remember, and hold on to. 

Like, we pass too.  We humans are just little blips of consciousness who get to experience this existence for a small snapshot of time.  In that tiny piece of reality that we get to interact with, we can try to make this reality just a little bit better for the people that come in the future.  

It IS very hard right now, some very hard-won fights are being re-attacked and destroyed, and still, we persist.  We always will.

I am not sure of your specific situation, but I hoped this helped, and my DMs are open for people like you, if you feel like that’d help.  💖💖💖💖💖
Be proud of who you are, I know what it feels like to deal with dysphoria, but you shouldn't be ashamed, you're beautiful, okay? Love yourself! I'm very proud of you ♥️
If nothing else, please know some stranger on the internet is sending love your way!
Ugh don't make me cry I'm right here with you stay strong❤️

Never surrender
Sweet baby girl. You are a warrior and you are a forerunner in your gender and you deserve noting but praise and encouragement. Future generations are going to thank you for standing up for yourself and your peers.
So Ik it sounds cringy. But when I was younger I started taking karate lessons. They focused more on the mental aspects of it. Having a certain mindset. Each week from when I was 6-12 they taught us new lessons and how to keep a positive mindset. One day our sensei sat us down and told us a particularly important lesson. Back then it was cheered up and told in a childish way but as I have grown a little I have come to see what they meant.  People are good at finding what they are looking for, that’s how we survived so long. They did this test with us and they told us to look around the room and find something let’s say blue. They then instructed us to close our eyes and then said “now name one thing in the room that is yellow.” And because we only looked for the blue we only could recall the blue, and not the yellow. They told us it’s the same way with positivity. If you look for the negative in life. Then you will certainly find it. But if you look for the positive, you will only see the positive. They told us to always look for the positive even in the worst parts of our life’s.


    In another lesson they told us to never say we couldn’t do something. When we asked why they told us to do something we thought we couldn’t. When we tried the people who said they couldn’t do it, couldn’t do it. But the few who believed they could, did. They told us weather you think you can or you can’t do something, you’re right.  So if you try and count your blessings however few and believe that you can overcome your dysphoria and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. You will find you have multiple things to be happy about. And at the end of the tunnel you will find paradise.

I hope I didn’t sound to cringy. I hope what I said helps . But after all I am only some random 14yr old from the internet so make of this as you must.



P.S I have been doing the whole martial arts thing for 7 years and could that the mental benefits outweigh the physical ones. Without these lessons o would be in a much darker place. But thankfully they where the little spark that lit a small flame and lit up a little bit of my world.
You can get through this. You survived 100% of your bad days, you can survive more. It will be worth it in the end.
I'm right there with you. You've got this
Oh hey, you're me. I dont have any words for you, other than that you reminded me that I'm not alone. 
Thank you.
I feel the same as you
You can do it, honey ♡

I have changed my first pride month as trans to pride life :) ♡
I know the feeling, it’s a fight that will never end. But you have to keep it up. You aren’t fighting alone. There are more of us and more allies than you realize. We can, and we will secure our rights to exist.
stay strong! one day tou will be independent and not have to worry about what they think! brighter days are ahead! be proud to fight and be who you are!
My dearest sibling, I have basically nuked my life as I've known it. At 42 I have been with my wife 21 years. I have a good blue collar career, I have a family, and scores of friends.

They all just want me to be happy. They all knew that I wasn't. Despite the bad body days and the glacial pace of the changes even starting, I get to be happy and myself. I couldn't be happier! I finally understand why I was angry and depressed and disappointed that I just didn't fit in all of these years.

You can find the strength to go on. Even if it's in something seen by others as childish but brings great comfort. Even if it's just unplugging from socials. Even if you have to walk away from it all and start a new life.

You are stronger than you may give yourself credit for. You are needed. You are important. You are loved. Even if you don't know why those things are true yet, they still are.
You're doing amazing pal, don't give up on yourself.
Keep strong. You’ll make it through. Just remember to take a break and breathe every now and then.
You can do this, girl! You're stronger than you think!
There are so many wonderful moments coming for you. Just hold on and breathe, and you will get to experience them. Lately old funk tunes like Can You Get to That by Funkadelic have been helping me through the rough patches
It's not like this is the last pride month, it will come back next year and you can live through pride month again, no point in giving up
Never give up. It’s a struggle many days but those good days, even if they’re few and far between more than make up for it. 

You always reach out here for help and support!
The battle against mental illness cannot be won decisively. It is a long campaign against an enemy who never tires, whose forces swell to twice their size whenever you look away. Battle against a foe of such magnitude, who occupies your very mind… every moment you survive is a triumph against all odds. There is no more honorable combat.
this is how i feel every waking moment, nothing helps, i just want everything to be normal but tbh i feel like death would be an easy alternative.
Thank you 🙏🏽 😊
Thank you! 🙏🏽
🙂 Thank you!
Thank you!!! 🙏🏽
This is a great way to think about it. Thank you!
🙏🏽 Thank you for the encouragement. That sounds like a lovely future. Hoping that taking it one day at a time will eventually get me there.
That’s a great friend you have. And a great ex-coworker too. I don’t have any friends who check up on me. Half my family just pretends that everything’s fine. I’m estranged from my parents… I’m trying to take it one day at a time…
Thanks. Trying to take things one day at a time.
Thank you for the encouragement 🙂
Reminds me to keep up hope. Thanks. 🙏🏽

I have a lovely therapist. She’s helping the best she can. I’m at a point where I need family to be on board and support me; but I’m not getting that support. So I feel stuck. I’m trying to take things one day at a time.
Thank you
Thank you. Definitely need some hugs.
Thank you for the good advice. Need to remember the little good things from each day.
Thanks you Lexi. 🙏🏽
Thank you 🙏🏽
Taking it one day at a time…
For everything there is a season. 🙂 Thank you for the reminder.

Thanks for the song recommendation. I’m just trying to take it one day at a time.
Just take it one day at a time. It is hard. But as evidenced by all the comments on this post, we’re not alone.
That's all you can do. It's all anyone can do. And truth is, that friend wasn't much of a friend after he got fired and I was devastated for a long time. But I remember a phrase from Firefly, ""When you can't run, you walk. When you can't walk, you crawl. And when you can't do that, you find someone to carry you."" You'll find friends but don't give up before you can. This subreddit is here for you.
Your welcome stay safe and take care 🥰😁
Honestly, if they can't accept you, then look for others who will. Hormones increase your emotional output, plus if you had/have mental illness. Then that shit gets increase also. I  get it my first year i was suicidal and dysporchic Plus I lost like 90 percent of my family a lot of old friends among more shit. It sucks, but like anything with more progress you'll get, the more it won't matter as you'll be in a different mindstate once things kick off. Also i feel like you have a glass half empty mindset. Honestly if no one in the world loves, then try to love yourself. Because if you don't love yourself, then who will. I know written maybe feels like false hope. But I believe in you, i also wish you well. From someone who knows how hard it is. I wish you nothing but the best. I honestly truly believe that things will get better, but gotta have hope love.i truly believe the energy you put it, if what you get in return. You got this, i wish you nothing but the best❤️
You're welcome  😊
You aren’t alone love :)

is my trans identity valid even though I don't experience bottom dysphoria?	"Me and my mom got in an argument over my transition, I came out about 6 monts ago and she is REALLY against it. I just want to look like a girl, and play a female social role, but I have no intent of having bottom surgery, and I don't experience bottom dysphoria; my mom however says that since I don't want bottom surgery that I'm fakeing it for attention, or, I just want to dress up sometimes and I'm not really trans. 

I'm fairly certain that she's wrong, but I don't quite know how to explain how I feel, or how being trans works. I also have this pent up anxiety that she's right, and I need a second opinion."	"The only necessary part of being trans is gender euphoria from a gender not assigned at birth. Is your quality of life better as a girl? If yes, then you are trans and valid :)
yes it is. dysphoria is not something all trans people deal with, nor is it required to be trans. if she's still iffy about it you could link her some articles on the subject matter. one for reference: https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/is-suffering-from-gender-dysphoria-necessary-to-be-transgender-c6de811f89c
Yes, you are valid. You do not need bottom dysphoria to be trans.
Being dysphoric with what you were given isn’t what makes you trans. Being happier with what you *become* is what does.
you don’t need *any* dysphoria to be trans! literally whatever combo of dysphoria and/or no dysphoria you may have is *perfectly fine* and there’s NO “right” way to experience transness!!!!
Your good. Dysphoria, even if it is how most trans people figure out they are trans, is not really necessary to feel to be trans, and you definitely will not feel dysphoria over every little bit of yourself. Feeling euphoria over your gender is a much more clear sign for if your really trans or not.
Pain does not equal validation. Those who tell you otherwise do not feel good enough about themselves. You are always, ALWAYS, good enough. There's no reason to believe otherwise. Stay positive, love yourself, and ignore those who try to make your life that much more difficult
[deleted]
There is no “minimum suffering required” to be trans. You can love every part of your body and still want to transition. The persistent myth that we HAVE to suffer to EARN this is, in my opinion, one of the biggest harms to trans folk both in making their existence hell AND in stopping people from ever coming to terms with who they really are. 

TLDR: your mother is wrong. Tell her I said so.
Let me answer that woth another question that has the same answer.

Do you exist?

Again, the answer to this question also is the answer to your question.
I don’t experience much bottom dysphoria compares to everywhere else
You are completely valid, there's no one way to be trans and if she's not trans she wouldn't know that at all. No-one understands trans people more then trans people so we as a community decide what it's like and whether someone is trans. I'm non-binary but I sometimes have bottom dysphoria and that's completely fine because no matter what you feel or who you are you will always have the right to validation. 
I hope it ends well and she tries to understand:)
You see most people have this stupid idea of genitals = gender.  If you want to be the girl you are but still keep what's down there, it's totally fine.  For me, it more depends if you feel gender euphoria from being trans and accepting who you are and not so much about dysphoria
Just going to put [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vcg2oj/a_helpful_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here as a friendly reminder
If I don't get bottom dysphoria and I am valid then so are you! You are valid!

You don't need dysphoria to be valid, just be you! For you are amazing!
No human existence and identity is defined by suffering, misery and self-hatred.

If you don't supress your emotions, you're not a real man, if you don't or didn't suffer from absurd and impossible beauty standards, you're not a real woman and if you aren't miserable from dysphoria, you're not really trans.

Others do not get to police your dysphoria.
Yes. You are who you are.
You don’t need bttm dysphoria to be transgender. If you aren’t comfortable being the gender you were born with. I’d say non binary or genderfluid is different and had their own labels . But I can see why she would think certain things aren’t true . This one person for instance. Asks me if I like ftm because they’re ftm . I look at their profile and they have non binary with they pronouns. Ftm is female to male and I don’t see anything of their part to try to make besides they them pronouns. So if you’re a certain label own it and don’t change for others
You. Are. Valid.
I've been really afraid of this as well tbh lol
TBH that part of your transition is none of your mother’s business
100% valid
you don't need gender euphoria or dysphoria to be trans, both ideas are medicalist. both can be signs but your trans identity is yours and always valid, whether you have them or not
You're still totally valid. If anyone says you aren't trans because you don't have bottom dysphoria they're just wrong.
I read the title and instantly went YES!!! I barely have any bottom dysphoria at alllllll and it’s not like there’s just one way to be trans, you can be trans and not even experience dysphoria because everyone is different
mane you just are who you are
Are you afraid that because you don't feel bottom dysphoria you are faking it? Are you afraid you are faking it for the attention? If so, what kind of attention would faking it give you and do you want that?
Trans does require gender dysphoria but it does not require bottom dysphoria. Just dysphoria for your assigned at birth sex. If you have dysphoria for that you are still Trans. Gender dysphoria and euphoria are required for being Trans. So yes you are trans don't worry about it. Imposter syndrome is totally a thing.
You are valid regardless of anything. You are a human deserving of respect. Love yourself, love each other.
yea
This is pretty much how I feel. I ain't even doing HRT, because I like my dick so much. Hoping laser, ffs and a boob job, will do everything I need and want it to.
Screw labels! Just be who you are and be happy.  What anybody else says doesn't invalidated you.  To hell with words this is your journey.
Honestly, your mom has no idea what she's talking about.  You can be trans without any dysphoria of any sort. Now, I suspect that the vast majority of us do experience it over one facet of ourselves (or many!) but it's a very individual thing. General rule of thumb for whether you are 'really trans' or 'trans enough' is, ""Do YOU believe that you are trans? If that's a yes, then you probably are. Being  different in society is never easy and we're under an especially nasty wave of hate at the moment. If your heart and brain tells you that this is your truth despite all that, then honey you are trans.
So as someone who’s dealing with this issue from the other side as my sister is trying to transition to a guy and I’m having a super hard time with it I’m gonna give my advice but by no means am I saying it’s right because I don’t fucking know what to think but I will say this… and i hope I don’t offend… I mostly don’t understand the need so many people feel to transition because I truly have plenty of self image issues and had depression for a while and still do sometimes because I don’t look the way I want or feel I should especially because I went bald early which really sucked for years but I think most people except for the truly aesthetically blessed model type people we all struggle with self image issues which k think for most(just how I see it) that’s what it boils down to and k believe acceptance is definitely good and important but being brutally honest I think many people think they have gender dysmorphia when they do t and it’s just struggling with self image and not being the pesos. We want to be and it makes us desperate for change in many ways which some people they feel like that’s a transitions. Now trying to speak from maybe how your mom is feeling a bit or at least maybe something you should think about,at least how i feel about my sister is… your mom truly probably lives and respects you as you are naturally and the person you’ve already grown tk be and wishes you would see more of your good traits in who you are in the inside and it probably hurts he that you feel you need to change who you are physically just to feel better when it’s such a drastic change and if your doing hormones or surgery it’s mostly permanent or semi permanent. How I feel about my sister is I’ve spent 28 years growing with her and live who she is right now and hate that she doesn’t live herself on the outside as much as k live her in the jnside and Ben g honest I think her feel g the need to transition is more about other issues about herself she doesn’t know how to cope with and conquer and also wants to be apart of the whole community because it’s a very accepting community but acceptance and short lived acceptance from strangers doesn’t typically help the core issue. I won’t rant but my honest advice… try and be who you want to be 💯 but don’t dk the hormones or make and permanent decisions esprit your younger like 20s and definitely not if your under 18. You have plenty of time to truly decide if that’s what you want and if you look wierd or off tk some people in “society” who fucking cares… it may be tough sometime moment tk moment but society’s opion means jack shit… for most people your close family and friend are the ones that truly live you respect you and know the person you truly are… strangers don’t and will say a lot of things to be nice but it’s not a genuine love like your mom probs it has. Just my advice
Yes. Totally yes. I am engaged to a person who I think is both male and female. Totally male when male. Totally female when female. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Doesn’t matter to me either way but zero genital change and zero confusion. 

Be who you are baby. You are female even if it’s just your insides and you change nothing else.
Your valid! There's nothing wrong with being happy with yourself and you don't have to have major surgery to fit in anyone's definition. I have no plans for any surgeries, dental implants sucked enough
the belief that a trans woman needs to get bottom surgery to be truly trans seems to be a cis centered mentality/ideology. you don’t need to conform to cis women to be a woman or to be trans in general. cis women are not the “standard”. there are plenty of trans girls that never get bottom surgery and don’t experience bottom dysphoria, so do what makes you happy and feel comfortable in YOUR body!
You are valid no matter where you are at and what you have figured out.  We are all trying to figure out who, what, and where we are in our journey.  I don't think it ever really stops.
I'm ftm and I also don't experience bottom dysphoria, I also don't want surgery down there. It is common that trans people don't want  surgery or don't have dysphoria in some parts of their bodies
I think that’s actually not uncommon. A lot of people don’t experience bottom dysphoria specifically
ofc it is darling <33
I know, personally, so so so many trans people who are undeniably men/women/enbies who don't have bottom dysphoria or want bottom surgery. I've lived in a female social role for almost a decade and personally I could go either way with how I feel about my junk. Ill probably end up wanting bottom surgery in the near future but I don't have like hyperventilating, crippling reactions towards my privates, I more just feel inconvenienced by it.
She is wrong.

I have a cishet friend who dresses exactly like my brother in law. Khaki cargo pants or shorts and a big shirt. Always. Is she less female somehow? Ugh. This hurts and infuriates.


I had no *awareness* of bottom dysphoria until I began my transition last Feb. Now I'd be on a table tomorrow if I could.

Your brain can only take so much trauma and as you relieve some of the layers, others come into mind view.

And by began my transition I mean having the conversation with my not soon enough ex wife and actually beginning to try acting and dressing as I felt instead of as a boybot using ""movement macros"".
The dysphoria I get is more like detachment or apathy. I neglected myself because I don't identify with my (AMAB) body. 

Now I get euphoria from every new change I notice.

Already have a few bras. Can't wait till I follow them out more.

Never noticed my dysphoria for many years specifically because it was so a typical.

Also dysphoria might hit you later. Or not at all.

Either way it is your decision not hers.

Thank your mom for challenging you and asking you to do some introspection. Then explain how you feel again.
Absolutely! Having any sort of dysphoria isn't required to be trans, and anyone who says otherwise is stuck in a really old way of thinking. Hell, I don't have a ton of bottom dysphoria, at least not as much anymore
You don't have to have any dysphoria. My girlfriend doesn't, but she's still very much trans.
Of course it is! I don’t experience bottom dysphoria either!
Yes. Period.
Valid
Yes. It never bothered me and I’m never getting it ✂️
Of course it is! Gender dysphoria is still gender dysphoria, even if you don't experience dysphoria about your private parts! You are still valid! Being trans is different for everyone and not everyone will experience dysphoria around different parts of their body! No matter where or what your dysphoria is or isn't focused around doesn't matter because it's still gender dysphoria! I wish you the best of luck with any and all steps you take in your transition and always remember that you and your identity are valid!
No type of dysphoria is ""required"" to be trans, even though it is commonly talked about. The most important thing is gender euphoria. Does being a girl make you happier than being a boy? Yes? Then you're trans! And that's all there is to it :D
I'm the same, just FTM. I don't really think about my genitals like that, I guess. I don't have that kinda connection to it. It's just there and as long as everything is healthy amd not trying to reproduce, I'm good. Also, with how FTM bottom surgery is rn, I don't wanna rush it. I sadly feel like my top surgery was a rushes mistake, so I'm taking my time on this one.

There's not *one way* of being trans. We're all on different paths
Dysphoria when it comes to your gender is typically in relation to how you want yourself to be seen in the context of gender identity vs how others choose to see you based of societal fuckery. Not every trans person is going to have bottom dysphoria; uniformity in relation to such a complex situation and journey is Foolish™️
Yes.
Yeah
100% you're still trans
I’m the same way tbh. You’re perfectly valid, gender=/=genitals
She's wrong.
Totally valid :) i only have testicle dysphoria and thats the only part i wish was gone which will be soon i hope.

Dysphoria isnt the end all be all. If you feel incongruent with your gender identity. Basically still dysphoria but the bits dont matter. Most of us are trying to normalize girls with the penis, not everyone fights for that but i think its fine since it puts people in boxes by forcing all of us to have bits that all match others that have the same gender identity to bits. But i dont think its right to force us to cut our bodies to fit that narrative. I dont need surgery to be loved.
I had heavy bottom dysphoria before I was on hrt and then it completely went away after being on it for a while. I still plan on getting bottom surgery eventually, but by your mum's logic I wouldn't be trans because I don't constantly feel displeasure at what's in my pants. 

Frankly it's a stupid opinion, because I know for a fact that if I stopped taking hormones I would be too miserable to live, and not hating my crotch doesn't make me less trans.
Fuck yeah! If you wanna be a girl with a dick, you go be a girl with a dick!
Yup. You're valid. 

I'm boutta go into something deeply personal that involves sexuality, please skip if it makes you uncomfortable.

I don't know if I experience bottom dysphoria or not. I have trouble telling, because I love masturbation and am used to that with female genitalia. It is quite possible that I am simply afraid of not knowing how to do that. I definitely wish I had a dick, but it's just weird for me to think about masturbating with one. I'm stupidly horny, and I'm sure that when I'm older, I'll have a better time figuring it out. 

Sorry for divulging into something weird like that, I just needed to share it.
Absolutely you are valid I don’t experience bottom dysphoria at all. I actually like that part about being AMAB 🤦🏻‍♀️
Yea

It’s valid

You’re real, met many other non op people who very much like having a dick, have one as a partner
I (ftm) don’t have bottom dysphoria either, you don’t need bottom dysphoria (or any dysphoria for that matter) to be trans
Incoming r/truscum users “uM aCtUaLlY yOu nEeD dYsPhOrIa tO bE tRaNs sO uR jUsT a TrEnDeR”
This is a message to all my brothers, sisters and nb siblings. For all of you who don’t have bottom dysphoria I am really glad. It is such a terrible experience that I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemies. You don’t need any form of dysphoria to be trans. As long as you are not satisfied with your agab that is kinda the only “requirement”. I want you to know that you don’t need to have a debilitating incongruences with your body, ie you don’t need dysphoria. The worst of all I would say is bottom dysphoria: basically falling into a depressive state for an hour or so cause I needed to go to the bathroom, that is what that feels like. Being trans is just a feeling and it doesn’t need to be caused by negative feelings surrounding your body. You are valid no matter what. All you need is just pursue what makes you happiest.
To me, yes
yep
Is my trans identify valid..YES! Next question pls
Dysphoria can be *a* sign, but not *the* sign. Because gender and sex (and pretty much everything else about the body come to think of it) are completely unrelated, you can be perfectly content without bottom surgery and still be trans. I get the feeling, correct me if I’m wrong, that your mother doesn’t know jack shit about trans issues and will never have to experience what you and lots of others here have.  
  
Long story short, your mom is just trying to cause you guilt and grief for being who you are.
I never thought of it this way! I've also never heard the term gender euphoria, thank you for the different perspective (^-^*)
Thank you so much! I'll be sure to check out these articles :)
Saving this comment to look back on when I feel unsure of my identity <3
[removed]
And you certainly don't need bottom surgery to 'complete' or fully be trans.
Fascinating, why do so many people have a differing mentality? This idea of what you become makes sense to me, but my mom can't seem to grasp it :/
Literaly all of this ^^^^ ❤️❤️❤️
[removed]
Thank you for your words! I appreciate the support, but, how am I to ignore my own mom? She's basically my only friend, and regardless of her transphobia, I don't know what id do without her
Thank you for this perspective! However, I find the words ""girldick"" and ""boypussy"" to be extremely humorous haha maybe it's my internal 12 year old...
[removed]
Well it's good to know I'm not the only one! But no Russians? I'm Russian though :(
Thank you for the kind words! I do have a quick question, how do you get the little flag under your username? I've seen a couple people with them and Im so curious!!!
Haha I love this! You are a good person random internet stranger! :)
You don’t need to be miserable or self-hating to have dysphoria. That’s a really gross generalization over something people can’t help.
Same
euphoria is the only measure of transness
no you don't.
Hard to say. Maybe she has an outdated view on what trans people are (very possible, given how little the overwhelming majority of the population understands trans issues). 

She may also be moving the goalposts to avoid admitting (either to you or to herself) that you’re trans. 

I can’t really say for sure, but putting your foot down and declaring your identity, not as something for her to question (because that’s not something she can do. Your identity is your own), hopefully would get her to come around. I can’t say for sure though.
People fear change, and transition is such a *radical* change that even people not experiencing fear it.

To them, they can't conceive making such a huge change without there being something untenable otherwise driving it.

To most cis people, I think the idea of an existential agony (dysphoria) gives them *kind* of an idea why. So many people have said ""VaeVictoria, you were *so* sad and miserable before, and we see that you're *so* much happier now. We don't understand the specific pain, but we saw the pain it caused. Your transition makes sense"".

And some people (conservatives) lack empathy so much that they just can't believe it at *all*.
This ^
I'd say that you should agree to disagree, just make sure both of you understand that you disagree, and won't let it get in the way. For example; regardless of your beliefs, if a serious problem arises like a nuke (as an extreme but obvious example), it doesn't matter how she feels about it if she's out of the blast radius. See it's a problem for you because you're the one dealing with it, all she has to do is help a little. Like, say you want underwear. All she has to do is buy it for you, what does it matter if she likes the underwear?
Also, even if you were just a crossdresser, then you still want the underwear, and she can help. Once again, she doesn't need to be thrilled by the idea. I'd say you tell her that if she really disagrees or doesn't like it, then she should think of it as a form of dedicated hobby to make it easier.
Most of all, whatever you do, don't be impolite. It's not that you're trying to get her sympathy or empathy by coming off as pleading, it's just important that she knows you're not attacking her or demeaning her. If she gets offended that you disagree, then... well, there's no easy solution.
Unless of course you bribe her by making a deal where she gets something out of it, but save that for if she's stubborn in not helping.
I wish you luck, and I hope she's trying to understand you and not change you. Good luck 🌈
You are 100% valid. You feel how you feel. I have had zero surgeries and not on HRT, with few plans for either. I still feel 100% like a woman, and I'll allow no one to tell me otherwise.
That's ok too! The language around people's parts can differ from how they feel about those parts of their bodies too :) Like maybe, the words might not be comfortable to use even if the actual part of the body doesn't cause dysphoria
Excuse me? That's so harsh, why are you saying that?
Dw its just a reference to a fucked up mission in a call of duty game from over a decade ago
You go to the r/trans subreddit, then click on the 3 dots next to the search bar and go to: ""change user flair"". I do it on an Android phone so I don't know if it works the same on another device but I hope it does.

You’re the one that understands the situation though. Just know that you *are* valid and you *are* trans (or even if you aren’t, that’s fine, you should just be able to be happy. It’s just that that points towards being trans), that’s not for her to question, especially if she doesn’t have an open view to how a trans person can go about their life.
Fascinating, thank you for this perspective! Is there a way I can describe my need to transition?
I see! Thank you for the advice. Hopefully in due time I can repair our relationship, I just don't like to choose between two things I love (her or my identity). Till next time kind internet person
[removed]
That makes sense haha, I just thought it was funny
Lucky, I have an Android too! And now I have a little flag :) how cool
not true
you don't.
Thank you so much! This is an interesting perspective, and a lot to ponder about. I have trouble processing emotional/social information, so perspectives like this really help me to understand the situation, and handle it in a way I can understand. I really appreciate it
I think others have nailed it. It makes you feel *better*. You feel *more* like you, and that's what matters.

Because in the end, it's *your* body, and you should have the autonomy to be who *you* are.
Well, you don't know anything about me, you haven't even asked if I'm trans. I'm not just some cis person lurking around trans forums. I would never use those terms to describe an individual trans persons body unless they asked me to, I used them here because they are terms that some trans people find empowering. Obviously, if someone does experience bottom dysphoria then these terms aren't going to work, but that wasn't the context of this post.

PLEASE tell me you’re joking. i don’t actively have bottom dysphoria but it feels really good to pack. you don’t get to tell people they aren’t trans just because they don’t fit into your little mold
why are you trying to force dysphoria on people? why do you WANT trans people to experience that? not everyone is gonna experience it, and trying to make them seem like they're faking it is bullshit.
Language that helps people is not disgusting, and I never refered to genitals in a sexual context.
[removed]
no you're not. you can be trans without dysphoria. you're trying to force dysphoria on people and it's disgusting.

Dysphoria finally took a break yesterday and let me appreciate this fit with some not awful pics		"Glad you're kicking its ass. You look great 💕
I'm glad it did because these are the exact opposite of horrible picks!  Very cute and your style is sooooooo fun!    Seriously I want to hang out with you for a day!
You're so beautiful
You look like one of my friends sister
you’re so pretty! love your fit too
You look so cute! I love this look 🙂
Aww you're a cutie and you look absolutely adorable in that outfit.
Serving mom energy here. You look like you're thriving :))
You look amazing! Love that outfit
Wow. You are so beautiful!
Looking stunning. You keep on keeping on.
You look very classy and sophisticated! And the light blue really makes your eyes pop!
You look beautiful hun ☺️! And I'm glad you got a break from dysphoria 😊!
OMG PLEASE YOU ARE LIKE PURE GOALS FOR ME
You’re looking good lady!
Thank you! I definitely take my fair share of hands though lmao
Thank you, I’d gotten so used to being annoyed by all my pics over the last couple of weeks, I’d completely forgotten what it felt like to be happy with a pic. Quick peek at your feed btw and you seem dope too!
Not always but thank you, the affirmation is definitely nice
Always fun, even though I don’t know them
Thank you! Not always of course but I felt it here. The dress is Long Tall Sally’s and the outer piece is just a random cheaper internet find, the fit felt very right and has inspired me to seek that feeling out even more. Not shown are the big (3 sizes too big haha) boots, I really want a new pair that fit right but still have the big ass boot look
Thanks! I was super happy with the dress! At first I thought it was really frumpy and pilgrimy (in a like “why though” kind of a way) then I tried it on yesterday with clean taken care of hair (depression >~>) and all the jewelry I’d imagined might work with it, and kapow! A comfy cute look that I never thought would make me really happy like it did lmao. There are some big ass boots that you can’t see aaaaaaaand the dress has genuinely usable pockets! Like I forgot my phone was in the pocket at the grocery store (literally the only reason I was getting dressed at all)
Thank you! It definitely wasn’t supposed to be a perfect (for myself at least) fit when I pushed myself to get dressed at 4pm to go to the store. Now I’m just really excited to wear it out with people, one day over the horizon 
👁👄👁
💧
Always love it, thriving is definitely what I’m looking to achieve so I’m glad I look the part lmao
Amazing *pssshhh* nah, but I’ll take it 👀. I don’t know where the fit falls on my list but it’s absolutely top 3 already, the comforts what really done it
(You see me facing away from you) “who. . . “ (I flail my head around followed fluidly by my body) “meee *BOONGGG*” (as my face completes a 20mph head on collision into a solid steel beam)
Thanks, definitely not as exciting or dope as you!  You have some absolutely delightfully fun things posted, your voice posts are extra delightful!  I have no doubt you are a blast in person 💗
Of course! Beauty comes from within, and you radiate it. 
Yay! keep seeking that feeling of rightness. it’s so fun and gratifying to find styles that resonate w you and make you feel good. You just gotta get some cute chunky (well fitting) boots and you’ll be living, just in time for autumn too :)
I do my best but just like anyone, I’m a mixed bag. I’m always trying to find people I can click with though, it can definitely be a struggle"	xidx9n	trans	647	1.0	2022-09-19 14:40:10
Really thinking about giving up	"Hi all <3

I am a 26-y.o. trans woman who has come to terms with her identity over the past few months. I spent quite some time questioning, but I've been sure that I'm trans and not just a feminine guy for a while now.

I recently had a run-in with a pretty shitty therapist who told me he wouldn't allow me to access HRT before I socially transition and present fem. I'm pretty defeated now, since I look nothing like I'd love to (I guess it's a feeling we all know) and I would prefer to start HRT and medically transition while still presenting male, and then gradually and slowly transition socially while my body and mind adapt.

With DIY looking harder and harder to access in the EU and me not being able to even get appointments with better therapists while also being pretty damn broke right now, I feel like I should just give up now and accept that it was all just a dream. I think I'd manage somehow, I'd probably have dysphoria and gender envy forever, but I'd probably survive.

Rationally speaking, I know this is a terrible idea and will probably kill me, but I just don't know if I can handle transitioning, especially if I can't get on HRT."	"Do not give up. If you give up, you'll never be your true self. If you give up, then there's no chance of you starting HRT.

Decide what will make you the happiest, and aim for that. Good luck, sis! <3
[deleted]
I'm in the US and had to wait 9 months between first seeing a therapist and meeting with an endocrinologist. My social transition began when I absolutely did not pass in any regard, but I found small victories. 

I threw out old clothes as I replaced my wardrobe with new garments that just made me feel better when I wore them. 

I took that time to practice makeup and start working on my voice. This was also nine months of hair growth and laser treatments.

I settled on a new name and I started asking people to use it at all times. Same goes for pronouns.

Moreover, I didn't have money set aside for all this. I made do with Amazon Basics garments, finding things on sale, and scrounging enough money to afford laser treatments.

Looking back, I have no idea how I did it. I wanted to start HRT, but I couldn't, so instead I found some small way to be me every day. When I finally started HRT, I felt so relieved but I also did so while presenting as a woman. Honestly, socially transitioning before starting HRT turned out to be a massively good thing because HRT doesn't fix everything. It doesn't make socially transitioning any easy. It gives you the body contour you want and it is incredibly affirming, but even then, those results can take up to 18 months to fully appear.

So please don't give up. Find a small way each day to be who you are, to socially transition, and when you do start HRT, you'll get to focus on all those milestones!
Don't give up, please. This is not the end. Try to find another therapist. I don't know, if in USA exist paid therapists, but in Russia you can run a paid commission and get the approval for money. 

I am transman myself, and there were so many times when I felt down. I accepted who I am eight months ago, and I've had... different situations. Where everything was cool, and when it wasn't. But now I am really happy and woudn't trade those lessons for anything. Yes, my mom still doesn't accept me (and some people too), and I don't care xD 

Remember, even the darkest night ends and dawn always comes.
I honestly don’t understand why therapists do this, they treat trans people like children, like they’re in the position to give us permission to to certain things with our lives. 

You are an adult, if you decide that’s it’s best for you to start HRT, you do it. Therapists are supposed to be a support system, for people who ask for support and nothing else. 

Even if you end up regretting HRT, it’s your responsibility because you are an adult. 

It is not your therapist’s place to dictate what’s best for you (in their opinion) and they can not force you to do something that you don’t want to do. You are responsible for yourself because again, you are an adult. 

Your therapist’s job is to make sure that you are lucid, willing and able, that’s it. They can give you advice only if YOU ask them to. So your therapist is definitely abusing their role and crossing the line. 

Unfortunately you will have to fight, you will have to be assertive, if this therapist is willing to understand and fix their behavior, good, if not, on to the next and repeat, until you get what you want, and you WILL, because there’s no other option, this is your life and no one else’s.

I suggest that you go into the wpath website and check if there are any therapists in your area. Wpath nembers are usually better and more educated, at least from my experience
I don't know how rough things are in your country, nor do I know what your circumstances are. I can't imagine how you're feeling right now to arrive at this conclusion, but I know you want our thoughts.

In short: Please, don't give up.

If you want to take a break and focus on other things, I could get behind, but to actively hinder your growth and convince yourself that ""it was all a dream"" will only cause deep, terrible trauma in the long run.

> Rationally speaking, I know this is a terrible idea and will probably kill me...

I mean, yeah. You've kinda summed up my argument in your conclusion. You would be actively abusing yourself, so it's a fucking terrible idea.

> ...but I just don't know if I can handle transitioning, especially if I can't get on HRT.

> With DIY looking harder and harder to access in the EU and me not being able to even get appointments with better therapists while also being pretty damn broke right now...

It's scary. It's really scary to move forward when everything is hard.

*But, you're not alone.*

Find support in your country. See what your fellow trans folk have done. Make friends in the mean time, research and try to problem solve solutions. You've got us here, and countless brothers, sisters and siblings who have walked this path.

We're here to help, and we want you to be happy.

So don't be a stranger, K?
Giving up is not a good solution, especially when you have a goal and and have not been able to put forth your best effort. Look for a different therapist, a good person knows it is a long journey and never a straight line. Your also very young and have an opportunity for a great happy life.
There is also informed consent HRT. This is primarily focused on the US, but I see 2 in Spain. https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1423995620784807936
Don’t give up! it will be a long and hard journey to start HRT and socially transition but while you’re in it life will become better even before you medically start to transition. I know it seems like the next few months or probably even years are gonna be like sitting in a room waiting for your appointment but in reality there is so much more going on. I don’t know if anything I said is helpful at all but I hope you’ll follow your heart and don’t give up❤️
Sometimes, you think something is impossible, but you just need 1 good phone call with the right person to get the machine rolling

Think about it like this, if you stop now, you'll forever wonder if the next appointment would have been the right
Hey, I'm sorta newly-trans myself (or rather recently-realized). The plan you're describing is EXACTLY my plan. Transition in private while still presenting male. Been doing it for like 7 months now, and honestly it's going great! Doing laser, growing my hair out, HRT, etc...

It sucks that good therapists are hard to find for you. I don't know if you can just look for another one, or if you HAVE to have a letter of consent in your country.

I personally got lucky and I've got a great endocrinologist and a great therapist. I've learned a lot about HRT in a short time. I can say with confidence that it is absolutely something you can DIY if you start with the right information and do regular blood tests / understand your own health and the risks associated with each drug.

Again, i don't know if you can afford it or easily get it shipped to you. The whole point I'm trying to make in this comment is your plan is a GOOD plan, in a LOT of ways! Seriously. I hope you can figure out a way to make it work.

If you have any questions about HRT, let me know! I can't really tell ya where to order stuff, but I'd be happy to discuss my own testing plan, targets spelled out in endocrine society guidelines, etc... Or if you just want to chat. Good luck girl!
Don’t give up.  It sounds like this therapist is making you jump through shitty hoops.  

I know you feel defeated and it is not what you want to do, but you may just have to jump through those hoops to get hrt and be in a bad place for a while.  :(  That’s an awful situation.  But at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel if you do that.  

And who knows, maybe you will get that good look going anyways.  Think of it like this, if it helps: you are training in 1000x gravity.  If you can get yourself looking good without hrt, then once you get on it you will be fucking dynamite!
Here's a hug ＼ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ／
this therapist is transphobic bc he’s testing if you are really trans or if you’ll just give up already on this “trans thing”. so don’t give up and find another therapist or just talk to other healthcare professionals that can indicate a good person to assist you, you know deep down if you don’t be yourself it’s gonna be worse so why not fight for yourself with all you got?
Hey girl. Do not give up. It's like being in the middle of the sahara, dying dehydrated, and saying ""after all, I don't think I need that water"". It's possible, sweetie, and you can always go see suggestions others told off. I know it was already mentioned, but GenderGP is affordable and online. I have the Canadian version of it (LeSexologue) and it's online as well. Online services are actually easier, and like my dad says, ""you won't sweat your balls off stressin' in front of a grandma"", since it's mostly webcam unless told otherwhise.

Honestly? I know you can do it. I'm the same as you, and I think we're all the same as you! We just went through some big stuff, bad stuff even, but we don't back down, even at the lowest! You can't give up yet, and this community is always here to help!!!

I know it can be hard right now. I know the end isn’t in sight. I know these things because I feel them too. But it isn’t true. It’s just the bad voice in your head and mine. Telling you that you will never be good enough. But that’s a lie and we both know it. Because the end is in sight. You are so close. You WILL be a girl physically and mentally. But you can give up. Or that reality will never happen.
I don't know what country you live in but in the us there is informed consent clinics like planned Parenthood and some websites like plume and folx that offer hrt without having to go to a therapist there are more options but those are the ones I can name off the top of my head so don't give up there are always options for you                                                               edit: I didn't read all the way through I see you are in the EU so I guess what I said here doesn't really apply still don't give up I'm sure there are always more ways to get what you want/need
Can’t you just say you present as female while seeing the therapist as female?
I feel you. I have been pretty certain that I'm transfemme in some way for a while now, but I'm essentially a goddamn lumberjack. I can't even imagine what I'd actually look like, I regret not acknowledging these feelings when I was younger, and I'm terrified to even try cause where I live means it wouldn't be unlikely that I get hate crimed.

I already gave up loving myself years ago. At this point, why bother trying?
Start looking at ways to stealth if you are ready to socially transition yet, it can help you feel more like you and get more confident being yourself
Giving up will just make all the shitty ppl win, be who you are and ( though it’s rly hard ) don’t give a shit to what they think!
Don't you dare give up! You definitely need a better therapist.
Hey there,

No need to give up :) I was in a very similar situation and had to present Fem to the outside for about half a year before getting any shot at HRT. 

Let me tell you that even for being 27 yo having a very receding hairline and not really a female figure there is a lot of things that can help.

Have a look at shareware for those curves, if you have problems with your hairline like I had try some wigs and of course try to find some make up that fits you.

Of course it’s a lot and it most definitely isn’t easy. But IT DOES HELP A LOT.
Is there anywhere in the EU that does informed consent? I haven't been to a therapist or Endo, have only been presenting at home, and should have a prescription in the next couple days if all my bloodwork checks out. It was super easy. And I did all that in like, the most hyper conservative part of the US. What's the EU equivalent to Planned Parenthood?
Who are those fakhing therapist to tell you what you need or not.
It’s a shame that some therapists can be so ignorant, but stay strong. There are resources that will work for you, and you’ll find them. Dysphoria is nothing to mess around with, and you deserve to be rid of it. You can do this, and your future self will thank you.
I’m so sorry hun. You deserve to be happy and your therapist is wrong. If you feel you’re a woman then you’re a woman. Doesn’t matter how you present. Are there informed consent clinics in the EU? I’m from the US. I don’t know much about healthcare in the EU but in the US we have informed consent clinics where you can just go and sign a paper and start HRT. Hang in there. Sending you much love. 💜
I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. As someone who transitioned socially due to thinking there were not other options rather than as a requirement I would tell your therapist that it can be harmful. Since starting HRT my dysphoria is so much more manageable, the years of social transitioning would have been much more tolerable. I would try to find another provider. I went through a few before finding one that had significantly lower barriers (possibly due to my own work in previous years and therapy but still…)
This therapist needs to read the pre-release version of the WPATH SOC (Standard of Care). It’ll be published this Spring. It’s much more progressive and a lot of the old standards about transitioning socially and about starting HRT and the requirements for length of HRT before surgery are going to be changed. Hopefully that will make things better for us.
Please don't give up. I may be mistaken but I think it's pretty common for therapists to approach it this way. My therapist is awesome, I love her, and she is a specialist in seeing LGBTQ patients. She is having me do the same exact thing. Maybe there is something different about my case that is making her do this, I'm honestly not sure (I'm also in my late 20's discovering this about myself only fairly recently). I'm not trying to invalidate you - I know how much it sucks when you get all dressed up or take some Faceapp pics and are like GIMME DA E NOWWWW, but therapists are professionals that want you to work through everything that might be going through your mind before they prescribe you medication. Patience is key, and sometimes we have to do the hard work that seems incredibly daunting before we get the payoff we need : )
In which country are you? Maybe some of us could direct you to some lgbt organisation near you that provide trans friendly therapist.

This is the way I took in Brussels, I already had a t-friendly therapist but he redirected my to ""genrepluriels"" because they have a whole network of trusted people that provide care for us. Often those org are really cheap.
Hi Diana.

If you know that you're trans, then you're trans! 

I've read about how bad the appointment with your therapist went... I myself am scared of that, so I haven't even seen a therapist myself... 

But as the comments in that thread said, if you think that's right, then you can diy hrt first. You said that it gets harder to get here in Germany, but as far as I know, Germany is still much better than, let's say for example France... I don't think I've heard of packets being seized in Germany, and even if that happens, estrogen is not a controlled substance here (according to reddit), so it might get seized, but you won't get punished for owning estrogen. Have you checked out the subreddits 'transDIY' and 'estrogel' yet? I'm transfemme myself (at least I think so), and I'm wondering if I'm ""trans enough for DIY""... 

OK, what I've wanted to say is: DIY is possible in Germany.
(This is not medical advise! 😄)
Keep going! you'll get there someday
*hugs - hey there, I have been exactly where you are at around the same age, I made the choice to bottle it up and keep on keeping on. It was horrible but doable for just over ten years .. Now instead of just jumping in the deep end when I was in my early 20s, I’m was in my mid 30s married with kiddos, when all of those repressed emotions and longing to just be my true self came boiling over — tw -Self harm -

long story short it took 5 attempts to un-alive myself in 6 months for me to have the strength to come out. 
Fortunately I was lucky to live in an informed consent state (US) at the time so I didn’t have to deal with another ignorant therapist like I did before to start HRT. I know things are totally different in the EU and you don’t really have the option to just got to another jurisdiction where things are easier.  
— nobody will judge you for giving up, but I truly hope with the support of others you’re able to find a way to keep up the fight and finally be you.!! If you need to vent, Cry, scream, anything, I’m here and willing to listen. 
- open for anyone who sees this, I know most of you are younger, but if you need that one friend who will always support you and do their best to motivate you feel free to DM me..
You are valid in your pain. And you are not alone. While HRT isn't nessisary to be trans, I know it helps. For generations natives have believed trans individuals were sacred. Depending on the tribe we still do. If it matters, you still are to me. I think it would be worth it to present beforehand to get HRT even if it's difficult. If you have any requests for advice on clothes and hair and what might help fight dysphoria or ""pass"" pre HRT I'd be glad to help the best I can. I know ""passing"" doesn't have to be the goal either,  but some focus on it to stay safe or just to get misgendered less.
That really sucks.  As a vet, I struggled for years to find a therapist that fit with my expectations and needs. Don't give up! It may be slow going right now, and the road may suck right now. But never forget your goals and who you are!
I wouldn’t say that’s a shitty therapist. That’s the same thing mine did. She told me to start off socially presenting and progressed from there with how I felt and I’m thankful for not rushing through everything.
Please don't give up. I know it might seem near impossible right now but it's worth fighting for
Hi!
My first attempt to get therapy went terribly wrong. She tried to urge me to come out to my family and to cut off my hair, despite me not being ready and not having sorted through my feelings yet at all. She gaslighted me into more doubt. I stopped going! 
Your therapist sucked and it is not your fault!
I'm in Austria and my counselor (from a trans help center) explained to me that
a) you can transition at your own pace
b) who and when you tell anyone is your decision! Yours alone, you don't own anyone an explanation 
c) it's the professionals' job to understand what you're saying when you explain your feelings, it's what they are supposed to be trained for.

My hair's still long, I still look like a woman to the outside world. I'm waiting to for my first session with a new therapist anyway, I'm getting the statements I need and I'm going to get HRT, if and when I'll tell the people around me that I'm transitioning I'll see along the way. It's my truth to share and your pace has nothing to do with whether you're trans or not.
hey, youre completely valid, and i hope you feel better in general soon :>

as many others have said, giving up isn't the solution. giving up would mean not taking future chances and not trying anymore - giving up on the future being brighter just makes both your future and your now darker, as it's harder to have something to look forward to. giving up trying isn't gonna get you anywhere in the end

there's almost always something you can do, but things take way too long and it sucks. stuff like mental health and hrt take both way too long to get started, and way too long to even show if its working, and even longer to get the desired result if it does. but that doesn't mean you should wait a lifetime for no change instead

if there's not something you need to actively work on or if there's something you need to or should wait on, try small things to make yourself happier, whether it be getting some euphoria from trying on a shirt, or simply doing something you enjoy! when dealing with a problem you need to wait on, it's often good to do something small to temporarily solve the problem, or temporarily or permanently solve a subproblem -
feeling dysphoric? do something that give you euphoria, stressed about work/school? find something that helps you calm down

though doing something correlated isnt always the best option, as you may not want to yet for any reason, or it just makes you think more about your problems, so in that case, just do something you enjoy and that distracts you

i hope you get somewhere soon, you're valid and deserve what makes you happy :>
I'm not trans but my daughter is, and I understand how you feel. She is only just beginning to feel comfortable with presenting in a feminine way outside our house after a year of hormone therapy. Can you find another therapist?
Why do you need your therapist consent?
Try to find another therapist. 

Also, talk to your regular doctor. Maybe they can give you an Rx. 

I don’t know what country you’re in, but many places have telehealth focused HRT companies and/or private practices that specialize in gender affirming care.
Based on your post history, I assume you're German. I am too, I started 2 months ago, even though a lot of therapists would probably consider me failing the Alltagstest. Using the website Transmann e.V., I managed to find a therapist who does things on an informed consent basis - essentially, he just made sure I have all information I need without asking too many questions of me, all on a half-hour video call. 

I got that appointment a week after having a bad experience with a transphobic psychiatrist. Bad experiences are so demoralizing, but there are some therapists who help make it easy. And, while I won't suggest lying to therapists, they do also only see the snippets of your life that you share with them...
if you are able, find another therapist. No decent or ethical therapist will or even should gate-keep you by forcing you to socially transition first.
I know what would make me happiest, but it’s not as simple as wishing and hoping really hard to wake up as my true self…

It’s hard to keep going, knowing that your dream may never come true
This. GenderGP literally saved my life. Without them I'd have been stuck on a 5 year long waiting list that I would not have survived
Wow, this looks amazing. So if I live in another country how much can they help with the transition?
I'm in the UK and this is pretty much my story too. 

If I thought i had to ""pass"" as cis I would never have come out. Instead i decided I could pass as trans, stopped caring what others thought of me, and started socially transitioning about 6 months before i got any HRT (which i got through Gender GP, BTW).

I came out to my family, my gym, my dentist, my work - and pretty much everyone just accepted it, even if they didn't understand it!

There's a quirky song on Youtube ""I've no more fucks to give"" and this was my mantra. 

You can do this.
I'm doing something like this. I hate the idea of publicly presenting femme, but while I try to get HRT there is so much else I can just work on. Starting voice training with online resources was a great decision for example. It also reaffirmed just knowing I'm trans and I can work on it when I am more dysphoric.

Not wanting to do anything before HRT previously made me do nothing ... not even getting a therapist to get HRT. I was stuck until I did other things. Mainly coming out, but voice training among other things led me there.
This is what I needed to hear. Thank you
I got lucky in that I found a therapist pretty quickly once I started looking properly. My GP also already wrote a referral letter for an endo. I got the referral in February, soonest possible appointment is mid August, so yeah. 

I'm using the time in between to swap out my wardrobe a bit and get rid of overtly masc clothing and replace it with more androgynous/fem clothing. 

In my country they actually explicitly recommend you wait with lasering until you're on HRT for a bit so the hair has had a chance to naturally thin out. 

I'm finally starting to take the looking for a new name thing seriously as well, as I felt too embarrassed to talk about it with my wife. 

Voice training is still scary though.
This is currently what I do, and tbh I’m becoming so comfortable with myself that HRT is seeming less and less necessary for my particular situation. 

I may consider HRT again in a few months, but for now, I’m loving even just my social transition :)
WAAAAAAAY too gatekeepy; that thinking just reeks of the 1970s.
It will never come true if you give up. So don't give up.
[deleted]
its pretty expensive tho if you ask me ... as a nurse i cant afford those services tbh 🙈😅
[deleted]
i live in a southeast asian country (ph), so i’m guessing they’re within my reach?
(Not the person you asked but) I can't answer that as we're in the UK but they are supporting my daughter with transitioning if you have any general questions. They provide an appraisal pathway that includes meeting with a counsellor, and prescriptions for hormone therapy. You have to organise your own blood tests. If you're over 18 in the UK you can use their online pharmacy not sure about elsewhere.

(edit for clarity)
You’re welcome 💕
I'm so happy that you're feeling this way! Continue to shine!! <3
Mind explaining exactly what was “gatekeepy” with what I said?
This, so much.

Odds of your dream coming true if you persist: less than 100%, but greater than 0%.

Odds of you give up: 0%.

I've also had the thought of, maybe it would all be easier if I just pretended I was straight and pretended I was cis, maybe I could bear it, and there would be no risk of losing my family and being attacked for who I am. But I know I would be miserable trying to be something I'm not. When I get those urges, it terrifies me. We can't let them take away our identity.

I wish you all the strength and only the best of luck.
That was my situation. Must be almost two years ago now but when I wanted to get in touch with the gender service here in Ireland I was quoted a wait time of a little over 4.5 years. According to my therapist that wait time has only increased as time went on
200€ sign up and 30€ a month. It's a chunk of change but when it's the only option what else do you do?
Wow, that's amazing! This has me finally feeling like transitioning is within reach! Thanks for referring this. 

I'm excited for your hrt, holding thumbs for next month!!!😁
It sounds like OP is extremely confident in her adamant belief that she's a woman. While a good therapist can certainly help the transitioning process, her current one seems to actually be making things worse: she's more dysphoric and is looking into DIY HRT. A formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria (and the accompanying letter) is always a good thing to have, it seems like overkill for HRT. Honestly, your advice seems to be bordering on truscum nonsense.

OP needs a better therapist and/or an informed consent provider like Planned Parenthood in the States.
[deleted]
thats right ... but alot of people dont have that kind of money .. i could afford it barely ... but i will try the ""normal"" way first 😅
Wich county are you? This social transition model they ask you is out of date!. I am asking in the minimal chance you were here in Switzerland so I could refer you. To my psychiatrist. Or get you another good one.
Oh wow, small world!
And yeah I've found most GPs aren't the most knowledgeable about trans healthcare, they might have heard a year or two before you asked that the waiting list was that long and just assumed it was the same.
Sadly I'm not from Switzerland, I'm from South Africa. 🥲 Thank you though, I really appreciate the thought! ❤️
Shit i know nothing about how is in South Africa. But i send you hugs and support. Is this like a governmental stuff ( like by law)? Or you can may be find another psychiatrist that use a different protocol?
Thanks so much.🤗

I'm a bit dumb, sorry. What do you mean by different protocol?😅
Like not forcing you to transition socially a year before hormones?, cause I get your point.
Oh yes, definitely.  My current one told me that be deals with transgender issues and after 3 sessions, he is yet to help me."	ufvtie	trans	642	0.99	2022-05-01 08:54:49
I told my therapist I’m not cis	I told my cishet therapist that I think I may be trans.She at first asked me  “are you sure it isn’t because of \_\_\_\_” , and also said “Everyone look at me I’m heterosexual!!!” mocking how she thinks queer people are.  Then 2 weeks ago she told me that she doesn’t think I’m trans because for her it seems that I act with more estrogen than testosterone. Said that boys act careless and sit in a certain way. Also that i have a big hate towards femininity (in me) and that the thought of having a womans body and looking like one causes me a lot of anxiety (which is true 💀). But now  I feel like I’m faking it because of the estrogen thing she told me. What if she’s right and if I was actually trans I would act very careless ,don’t think things too much and even talk in a different way?  I know no one else but me can tell if Im trans but trans people go through so much and I don’t Want to say I’m trans because Of that. why can’t i choose not to go through  disconnections from people, being constantly scared of what my transphobic parents will say, doubting myself 24/7, dysphoria And other shit??	"If a therapist mocks anything you’ve earnestly shared with them you are allowed to just walk out. Nothing else they would say is worth taking to heart.
It sounds like you need a new therapist ASAP. Very unprofessional behavior from her.
""oh yeah you've got those hormones in you that make you act a certain way and sitting positions are totally gendered and not a preference,  you totally hate your body and your femininity but there's no way for you to get rid of that except for HRT but it seems that you're not trans enough despite showing lots of signs and being vocal about questioning your gender"" 


that's some huuuuuge bs right there and no good trans/queer friendly therapist would do something like that
“act with more estrogen than testosterone” this cannot be a medical professional……. i recommend finding a new therapist ASAP!!
Get a new therapist, that’s a bunch of hot garbage! 

A good therapist might ask you to question things like “why do you feel that way” but they shouldn’t try to push you to a particular conclusion, just help you explore the feeling and come to your own conclusions. They definitely shouldn’t mock you!
Yeet the whole therapist out
Throw the whole therapist out out and report her if you can/if the organization she works with is inclusive (or says it is)
Please tell me the blank word isn’t trauma? Transphobic people love using that argument. It’s despicable.
The queerphobia and mockery seem like quite serious concerns if you want to have help getting clarity on your gender.
Trans man here, and I am extremely kind and courteous to others. Has she never fucking met a gentleman???

But regardless, you’ve been socialized/taught/trained your entire life by others to behave effeminately and that’s incongruent with your sense of self and causes you distress… so it’s the literal definition of trans… the things this garbage therapist who you should absolutely ditch (and hopefully find a new one if you can!) have said are not at all valid arguments against you being trans. They are the same things that poke at you like thorns (though not all of them bc some are good traits that ANYONE can have!!!).

Long story short, you are 100% VALID. Her story is twisted and wrong. Her saying it with conviction does not make it so.

-signed, a trans man social worker with ambitions to be a therapist.
Not only do you need a new therapist you need to report that therapist she should not have a practice if she's gonna behave like that
Also love how you’re not trans because men don’t have feelings and don’t give a shit about others… like a human, with empathy. 
Basically, you don’t scream toxic masculinity, so you’re not a guy. Sure hope she doesn’t have any clients who are cismen being told to “man up in therapy”.
Yeaaa… find a new therapist.  Preferably one that doesn’t make light of LGBT issues and doesn’t subscribe to gender stereotypes.
I just can not imagine my therapist talking to me like that and me not going ""wtf is wrong with YOU??"" My therapist listens and helps me cope with stuff, she doesn't invalidate anything I say.
This person is not a therapist. 

I hope you are able to find someone soon who will respect you!
Im pretty sure trans people are sadly at the whims of the effects of their birth hormones lol. Most trans women don’t act exactly like they are full of estrogen pre hrt but do afterwards its a hormone thing. And that has little to do with body and social dysphoria. Get a better therapist. Apparently this is hard to understand even for people with a fucking degree in psychology.
I'm inspired by this therapist being completely and utterly incompetent but still collecting serious money from therapy. This makes me feel like if she can succeed while being a complete hack, then I'm doing just fine, and I can make it in this world too.

But seriously, a therapist who mocks you for being LGBT is a seriously bad therapist. Time to throw her out with the trash.
Psychology student here, no therapist worth their salt would be imposing their opinions on how you should feel about yourself and how you act, the entire point of the job is helping you find your own answers, and she's literally imposing her bigoted views onto you and forcing to accept her opinion as your fact

fire her ass
Your therapist is trash and you need a new one asap. Honestly how did this person even pass the test to get the license to practice? They clearly don’t have a single functioning brain cell.
Please don't take any of what your therapist said to heart, and get a different therapist. Mocking queer people is enough to discount anything she has to say in the matter.

Your current levels of ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" behaviours do not make you more or less trans. Contrary to popular belief, a trans man doesn't need to have always behaved ""manly"" in order to be a man. You don't need to sit a certain way, talk a certain way, or have ""male"" interests in order to be a man. Many trans people (just like cis people) display interest in both ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" things as children before adults and other children box them into their 

Personally, I mostly have ""male"" interests and mannerisms, even though I'm a trans woman. And when I look back to my childhood it becomes obvious. Any ""female"" interests were discouraged by family or friends, and most ""male"" interests were encouraged. It really is that simple
What. The. Hell.

Ok you probably heard that a billion times but nobody but you can decide whether you're trans or not. Yes, you can be trans without dysphoria. Yes, you can be trans and ""act estrogen"". Yes you can be trans and ""sit like a girl"" - this is bullshit. There is not a certain way boys sit. That's, besides, fucking sexist. But anyways, the problem is definitely her, not you. Get a better therapist. You are valid.

Here's some nice explanation 
https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/08/not-all-trans-folks-dysphoria/
With all due respect, your therapist sound dumb as a fucking brick and is letting her personal biases get in her way (which is incredibly unprofessional). I get how a therapist might want to ask a couple question to delve deeper into your identity and make you think about things more critically, but a lot of therapists out there straight up do conversion therapy type bs and say ""noooooo it's just pushback"" (I second the comment that said that therapists shouldn't push you in either direction and let you come to your own conclusion). While hormones do affect your behavior to a certain extent, not all boys act/sit in a particular way (I know plenty of men (even straight ones) that cross their legs). She just sounds like she's very misinformed on trans issues, and you should find a different therapist. Also, if you're questioning your gender to a point that you need to express it to a therapist, it's something worth exploring.
I would recommend getting a new therapist.  It sounds like they have no clue what they are talking about.
Find a new therapist. ASAP
New therapist time.
I am a cis therapist and agree 100% with other comments, time for a new therapist. Sorry that this one is giving therapists a bad rap and sorry even more for your experience.
Who are these therapists y'all keep on seeing? Was this a one time thing? I've had 1 session incidents with BAD therapists but like jesus your therapist is giving you her opinion that you ""act with more estrogen""???? 

Let me give you one piece of advice in regards to therapists and this was given to me by a psychology professor who also worked as a therapist and in psychiatric care facilities for many years in their career. They told me (to be fair, told the class) ""When your therapist starts to give you advice without you asking for it first, FIND A NEW THERAPIST"" Therapy is not advice. Its there to help you figure out how to help solve your problems. You're turning the wrench in how to fix your life, therapy just helps you figure out how.
It's unfortunately not rare, that therapists are really ignorant and or dismissive like this. So, please don't care too much about what they've said. You can know for yourself, if you're trans or not.
your therapist is a hot steaming pile of bullshit. find a new one, the way you sit and carelessless levels don't how trans you are, nor does anything else really except you. 

she should not have done or said any of that, ever, it's not profesional and also morally horrid. find a new one. make an excuse
Okay OP, I see you have a bunch of advice on the specific topic regarding getting a new therapist (which they are all right: that therapist is hot garbage). But I wanted to give some heart-to-heart talk about your feelings in regards to feeling trans. 

From experience as a trans man, I can personally say that it's a load of garbage to think that every trans person's experience is the same, and even more a load of garbage for someone else to tell them what they feel or how to be when it comes to their gender. There is no one right way to be Trans, whether your are Trans Masculine, Trans Feminine, Nonbinary, or somewhere in between. Everyone experience things in there own way, and while we may have similarities experiences to one another, no one person has the exact same cookie cutter experience as another person. 

So, if you feel like you're trans, then you feel like you're trans: and that's that. 

It's also okay to not know for certain, and it's okay to change your mind on what label you use to describe your feelings. Or for your feelings to even change! You may feel like you're Trans now, but in a few years come to realize that maybe you're Nonbinary, or Gender Non-Conforming: and that's okay. 

It doesn't invalidate how you feel in the present, nor will it invalidate the feeling you have now if that feeling or title does change in the future. It's good to question and explore your gender, and I wish more people knew about it. 

I know that I had to try a bunch of different labels first before I came to realize I was Trans Masculine, because I kept seeing myself through the forced lens of the Society around me. It actually took several of my friends and roommate reminding me that men could wear skirts and like cute things too for me to really start grasping it all. And now, I feel so much happier with myself because I actually took the time to explore and come to understand myself!

So yeah, TL;DR- Don't be afraid to explore your gender, cause it's healthy and completely normal to do so. You aren't faking it, because you're still learning what is the right label for you. Even if you change that label or those feeling change, it still isn't faking. 

If you are worried about family and such, and feel like you may be living in an unsafe environment, make sure you have a reliable support group, and do what you need to stay safe. We love you, OP. And I think every one of us here is cheering you on and hoping for the best. You got this, fam~!💜💜💜
You are trans because you want to be the other gender. It makes you feel better.
Get a new therapist
This is not a therapist; it's a fuckwit. Report them. I'm sorry it was such a horrible experience. Not every therapist is like this!

I also had the egg crack in therapy and came out. Thankfully my therapist was very understanding and supportive before I moved away. I came out, and then moved 

An edit because I see people being questioned whether or not being transgender is a result of sexual trauma. No! (Although I had something happen to me). 

As I reflected on life I realized subconsciously mostly, few bits of gender envy and such, girls did I want to be with them or be them, was the fact I was always trans gender underneath it all. 

What happened to me had no bearing on me becoming myself. Infact it separated me, contributed to quiet BPD and C-PTSD. One of many things that damaged immensely. When I'm better I want to work towards mental health and support. I'm somewhere between 1/4 and half way.

 I can see 18 months into the future with plans ambitions goals, from when I once woke up and thought fuck, I'm awake again. Discovering I'm a woman helped with that. Euphoria may be gone for now. I still cling to feelings like they go forever. Anything not to feel that internal desolate emptiness.

Way too long and too much information lol, again.
My dude, really you need another therapist.

If she's not able to take your questions or your affirmations seriously, she's not taking you seriously and she's being SO unprofessional.

Some people really don't have what it takes to be a therapist, to be trans you don't need to fulfill certain requirements of self-hatred or a background check; my ex therapist told me that I liked girls because i had issues with my dad and that there was no way that i was trans because i didn't craved for a penis, but even if the issues with my dad had influenced what I feel for girls, its not less valid, because its not like I will start liking boys if I sort things out with my dad.

The same to you, you won't be less trans even if you loved femininity, there are a lot of feminine men in the world, and there are a lot of masculine men in the world, so really, fuck your therapist, you're valid, even if she's not telling you that.
Seeing as she has NO evidence to back her claims up I would just ditch her. Plus you meet a lot of queer people as a  therapist anyways (wonder why that is hmmmm) so maybe tell that little shit to quit her job
So, I'm transmasculine. When I was still questioning that, I spent a lot of time wondering if the fact that I'd been assaulted and raped was the reason I wanted to be a man. As though that would invalidate it. But even if that were the case, then going on T would just be an unorthodox method of healing from that trauma.

The crux of my decision came down to what would make me happy. Outside of the endless list of reasons I am or am not trans, outside of all the speculation about what caused these feelings, *would transitioning make me happy?* When I realized the answer, regardless of cause, was *yes*, I decided to do it. 

Therapists are meant to help you become a better version of yourself: if you want to transition, then your therapist should be *all for it*. If they aren't, get a new one.

Regarding some of those specific points...

There is no such thing as ""acting with more estrogen"" or vice versa. That's psycho-babble for ""I think you act like a woman"" and the only reason she thinks that is because that's the impression of you she has. Confirmation bias. A therapist should know better.

She's right, boys do act a certain way. This is entirely due to socialization. Fun thing about that... it's purely a symptom of society treating you a certain way for a long period. If you spend time presenting as a boy, you'll probably end up acting that way too. I did.

Hating femininity and not being a woman are not mutually exclusive. Look at every cishet male misogynist. I'm not being totally facetious here: you can have all kinds of issues or trauma surrounding femininity, and still not be a woman. Many cis gay men have such trauma. Being perceived/stereotyped as something you aren't sucks. No matter your AGAB.

Being afraid of transitioning is only natural - especially given all the fearmongering that anti-trans folks push. But all you really have to ask is *would I be happier this way*. Ask that question, not just about identifying as trans, but for each step in your transition. *Would T make me happy? What about top/bottom surgery? Would having a different name make me happy?* The more you ask yourself what *you* want, the less you tie yourself into anxious knots worrying about the Right Thing To Do, the easier and better your life will be.

Not to get all philosophical or whatever, but feel free to apply this method to the rest of your life, too. The path toward my personal happiness started with transitioning, and ended up with me deciding to go to medical school.
Please, find another therapist asap. Usually those who are lgbtq friendly has that description on their bios. I wish you good luck on your journey.
She sounds fucking awful. And an awful person can be a decent therapist maybe, but clearly not her. She’s not going to be of any use to you because her worldview doesn’t even acknowledge that what you’re facing or concerned about or even thinking about exists.
My (very conservative) grandma once said to my mom, ""She still seems like a nice person. Does she still want that sex change operation?"". I cross my legs very tightly. And I am definitely a man.

You should definitely be as confident as possible before transitioning medically, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with exploring your gender. If you think you're trans, you're probably trans, and having trans-affirming people in your life can help you sort out for yourself whether transitioning is right for you.

 As it sounds like you've already realized, it's time to find a new therapist who's open-minded. In my experience, I've always been the one educating therapists about transness, and at this point in my transition it's not the focal point of our conversations anyway. Consider attending a trans support group in your area if you can, especially if you're not able to find a trans-affirming therapist who's a good fit. Hearing what did and did not resonate with me and processing my feelings in a welcoming space was helpful for solidifying my understanding of myself.
therapists are supposed to make you feel better about yourself not mock you for being yourself
Red flags, a therapist is meant to help YOU find who YOU are, or help you find your own solutions to your problems. Straight up telling you an opinion, particularly without questions or explorations is a problem for any therapist I've heard about and for me has always been a sign to stop seeing them ASAP
I brought gender/sexuality issues to two different therapists and was shut down by both in my early and late-20’s. I think this has a lot to do with why it took me till my late 30’s to figure out who I am … I also now teach people how to be therapists, so I can also tell you as others have said that this is NOT how a therapist is supposed to act. Also seems like some pseudoscience or just outright prejudice she’s saying about the hormones. That’s not something they teach in any legit grad program on mental health.  

One of the best things I ever did for myself was find a gender and sexuality affirming therapist. I’m happy to share more about how to do this if you need that support.
Your therapist sounds extremely unprofessional. I would recommend seeking a new therapist if you can
1 your therapist sucks and needs to be told so 
2 cis people don't question their gender so you're trans 
3 can I fight your therapist in a Denny's parking lot?
She is not right. I'm a licensed therapist, and everything she said is not true. None of that aligns with the factual information we have in biology and psychology today.
I don’t know what to say because I’m not a therapist but as someone who is in therapy it’s always a good idea to fallow your therapists advice.

I will say that if your dysphoria is severe then what you need is a psychiatrist they may seem similar but they are very different.
She sounds like a terrible therapist.
You need to report her. Someone who mocks their patient after they shared something, does not deserve to have a license. This could happen to others, take one for the team and report her.
Yeah that's not okay. New therapist and review this one to warn other trans people, cause even if you end up genuinely not being trans, this person is dangerous.
By the sounds of it, your therapist needs to find another job
I hope you find a new therapist asap.
You're not faking anything, your therapist is just a gatekeeper who thinks they know better than you. If they keep acting that way, honestly just find a better therapist
Please for your mental health get a new therapist, they are obviously very uneducated about trans people and should never be mocking anyone. That is not a safe space
I assume that everything has been said already, but I'll add this anyway; Your therapist sounds malignant. I think she was deliberately trying to sabotage you. Many people are like that. After beginning transitioning, so many people have tried to make me doubt myself; random people, professionals I have been in contact with for various reasons, etc. Long story short, they cant stand other peoples happiness and authenticity. I dont think she was being truthful when she said you were too ______ to be trans. And even if you are *at this point in time*, it is not okay for her to say such things anyway. Get a new therapist. The devaluation will only continue. These types are relentless. Wish you the best going forwards.

Sorry that happened to you, it sounds absolutely awful to be invalidated like that
What does cishet mean is it just cis or something else?
That therapist is an incompetent piece of shit. I can't remember what it is right now but I'm pretty sure there's a website that helps people find queer-friendly therapists.
That’s a shit therapist right there! Don’t let what she said get to your head and seek someone more able to help you with your questions! Good luck!
A therapist shouldn't mock your choices or those of others, she sounds like a bigoted moron to me
I'm sorry, but, respectfully? 

FUCK that therapist. 

Are they serious?? How unprofessional can you be? Their job is to listen and provide advice, not mock marginalized groups and then explain that they think you're >!faking it!< or >!lying to yourself!< due to some bullshit half-baked notion of ""science."" It *might* be true that your behaviors or whatever are more ""influenced by estrogen,"" but guess what, that's because *there's more estrogen in your system.* If you're transmasc, then by very definition you're more than likely *negatively impacted by that.* 

Now, I'm not gonna diagnose you. But I will say the whole bit about you ""not acting boyish enough"" or whatever is complete bullshit. You act how you were taught, or how you picked up from the way you were raised. This means a *lot* of us learned mannerisms, posture, pleasantries, and other little intricacies of social interaction that align with our AGAB. That's not our fault, and it's not indicative of our gender. Since coming out as transfem, I've had to re-teach myself how to sit, how to walk, how to greet people in passing, etc.\* And each of those things has made me feel *immensely* more confident, and comfortable in my skin. But not knowing those behaviors before didn't make me *not a woman,* any more than you not exhibiting traditionally masc behaviors makes you *not a man.* It just means you weren't taught them, and you didn't pick up on them, because as children most people don't pick and choose the way they act. They just learn by example of the people they're taught that they're ""supposed"" to be like. At the end of the day, it's not anyone's place to tell you who you are; if you've really thought about it, and you *feel* like you're trans enough to start coming out to people about it, *you're probably trans.* 

I would recommend seeking out a new therapist; preferably one who specializes in trans issues, if you can. Whatever experiences you may have had with your current one before, they've proven themselves to be ignorant in this area and I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them. I wish you luck, and whatever you're hoping for in your (presumed) transition, I hope you get it. 💜 

^(\*I just want to clarify that by no means is it a requirement for someone of any gender or other identity to adopt mannerisms traditionally associated with their identity. The very notion that anyone ""should"" act a certain way based on how they look or how they identify is complete bullshit. I personally put in the effort to act more ""femme"" because it makes *me* feel better, for a number of reasons personal to my own experience. I do encourage others to try this, if so inclined, for the sake of experimentation -- and the possibility of little doses of euphoria. But I would never push it on anyone as a requirement, or proof of anything.) 

**EDIT:** Can I also just say how gross those generalizations of being a man are? The idea that you have to be ""more careless"" or some shit like that, as though all men are that way (and no women are, etc). Just gross and a bit rude. Seriously, who is this therapist so others know who to avoid lol
Yeah don't go back. Quit giving them money. They don't know what they're talking about and are pretty clearly both homophobic and transphobic. There is no way that men sit. That's just stupid of them to suggest. Sounds ljke they someone who either fuckin worships stupid gender norms or who is trying anything they can to invalidate you.
Kindly tell her to fuck off.

For real though, one's behavior doesn't dictate their gender, that's some really outdated way of thinking. 
Plus, estrogen and testosterone levels don't always dictate things like that, that's a ridiculous assumption. Some men, cis men, with high levels of testosterone can act more feminine. Not everything is ""written"" in our hormone levels. 
She should know better, psychology IS a form of science, so I'd expect a professional like herself to be more educated on these matters and to know better than to be outright LGBTQ+ phobic.
Your therapist is wrong and stupid. Dont listen to them, and dont think that just because they have some special certification and an official title as a therapist they cant be ignorant on trans issues.
[deleted]
Wow, I don’t even know where to start honestly. So according to her, your gender is determined by the way you… sit? Is she ok? Also what does “acting more estrogen” mean exactly? 
I’d seriously like to hear her elaborate

Does she, a literal therapist, think that all people of a given gender should act exactly the same and follow a very specific set of behaviours or else they’re not really that gender? This is not only ignorant, it’s alarming. She, as a therapist, should know better. She should know that gender norms (and SITTING POSITIONS…???)  are an artificial construct. Isn’t understanding human behaviour literally her job? Does this bitch think that hormones determine your fucking sitting positions? Would she tell a woman that she’s not really a woman because she doesn’t sit with her legs crossed? No honey you need to run, now
Your therapist sounds like an unqualified moron, to be frank. Don't listen to her shit and find a better one.
get a different therapist, she has no idea what she is talking about
I'm reckless as all fuck. It's because I've lost most hope and have expended most sane ways of acting long before, because I just don't fucking care anymore. I'm still a trans girl, not a cis boy. I also overthink every little thing and have extreme anxiety, and modest paranoia.   


You're still trans. Almost every trans person worries about whether or not they're faking it, but if you were cis you wouldn't even be pondering it.
She sounds like a fucking moron
That's why I think some people really shouldn't be working as therapists
Wow, you need a new therapist asap.
Holy crap! You need a new therapist! Not only did it sound like she spitted out some sexist statements, but she sounds like she would say being trans is a mental illness. Unfortunate that not every therapist is trustworthy
Red flag #1 is her mocking homosexuality.    
Red flag #2 she equates being trans with being a homosexual. 

I really suspect you'd be better off finding a therapist who is queer, or has a background with the queer community.  This lady isn't doing anything to help you in regards to your identity.
If you can and feel safe enough to record what she says. This is discrimation. Take it to her boss and let them know what is going on. Not many feel safe/confident enough to speak up. It can help future clients if the look out for her behavior. We can not take this bs from therapists and psychologists any more.
Just because you care deeply about things doesn’t mean you aren’t trans. I overthink all the time and dress feminine but I’m still trans. Everyone one is different. So I recommend you get a new therapist because she sounds like a really shitty person
Omg I am so so sorry your therapist is so ignorant and did these things to you. I would absolutely report your therapist as it is a requirement that therapists are competent to help us queer and trans people- report to their agency, licensing board, etc. And get a new therapist. Wtf.
She is very incorrect.
All of that sounds like nonsense... after she mocked you with the ""look at me I'm cis"" that should been your que to find a new therapist...
so, that therapist studied psychology? At an actual university? With masters of the subject? Im sorry i'm just baffled that she thinks the turmoil of gender dysphoria can be put down to a sitting position and a very specific personality trait.
This person is straight up unfit to be a therapist of any kind.  What a fucking awful human being.  I wonder if you can report her for straight up malpractice? Idk anything about that but thats clearly what that is.  Please find a new therapist
Only a cis deals in absolutes :l
Not all men are lumberjacks or stereotypical football fans, this therapist just insulted tonnes of my men and women friends and I absolutely hate the way here in spain they say ""this space doesn't have a lot of testosterone"" to mean ""this space isn't toxic""
That’s just gender dysphoria…
I thought about going to another therapist before and thought that it was very rude for me to actually do that but it’s the other way around, she’s the one not willing to understand me and I will walk out
Agreed. New therapist and see about reporting her for the insulting way she treated you. She has to leave her personal biases at the door and clearly cant.
i have thought about it and I will find a therapist lgbt friendly
Im just now realizing how she said to me is wrong and i will find another therapist
Sounds suspiciously like the last thing my parents said since i last talked with them about my being trans.
It's gaslight. She is preying on OP trying to convince them what they are feeling is something else other than.

EDIT: a very sorry attempt to gaslight
im so relieved to know that what she said was wrong and I do will search for another therapist
The funny thing is that she even told me about a book she read that was about a guy that thought he was gay for most of his life and turned out not to be. Its so obvious what she was trying to imply to me
god the amount of times i’ve heard this- a psychiatrist once asked me ONE QUESTION about sexual trauma and immediately came to the conclusion my gender dysphoria was anxiety and ptsd…….. two years later i have the best medical professionals in my life i could ask for and i’m about to be 3 months on T! it really does depend on who you get :/
she didn’t said trauma but “how your mom is towards you”
Yeah and she only made it worse tbh
Thanks you for your help and I’m glad to hear I’m very valid, we are very valid!!
yea alot of her arguments were around gender stereotypes and bridged them up often💀, I will find a new therapist.
It means cisgender and Heterosexual
Hell yeah!
It's always OK to change therapists. Sometimes what you want to work on in therapy changes and the therapist you've been working with for years on one thing just doesn't specialize in the new thing you need.

 (This happened with me and my old therapist understood and appreciated that I let him know I was moving on. Apparently therapists get ghosted a lot. He'd been great for what I started going to therapy for but wasn't suited to what I needed to move on to.)

And sometimes a therapist and patient just don't fit right. There's no point in staying with a therapist that doesn't get you enough to help you. Since this therapist is being an ass, don't worry about moving on without saying anything. If you choose to say something be professional but brutally honest about the reason. Maybe she'll learn to at least refer LGBTQ+ patients to someone else.

Edit: Swipe errors
You are correct. It wouldn't be rude to for you to find another therapist when this one is incompetent and rude, and she is obviously transphobic and using her bigotry in her practice.
changing therapists isn't rude (especially not after what she said to you).

my ex-therapist tried to stall my transition with an autism diagnosis (kept telling me they'd ""plan"" the transition after and would subtly invalidate me while attempting to remain professional. she was shit anyway ngl, seeing as she couldn't see the very blatant undiagnosed adhd that my current psychiatrist saw after like five minutes of knowing me).

lying to these professionals and changing them whenever needed is not only perfectly okay, it's occasionally also necessary for survival. if lying is the only way to get what you want and need, do it. if your therapist is horrid and rude, leave and don't feel bad. 

if a professional who's job is to help you refuses to actually help you, you find somebody else who will.
I always tell people that there are no therapists who work for everyone. You have to find one who works for you. It is always okay to switch if your current one isn't working, even if they haven't done anything wrong.
It will never be rude to stop seeing a therapist. You do not need to set aside your own mental health to not upset someone whose only job is to assist in your mental health, but is failing to do so.
Look for an LGBTQ+ *affirming* therapist.
I'm glad you're looking for a new therapist. You deserve to feel safe, ESPECIALLY at therapy.
yeah it kind of sounds like she is trying to convince OP that it’s in their head or something- i just want to know where this person got certified to help adolescents with mental health because jesus christ it seems like she knows nothing…
Yeah the therapist has bitten into the “social contagion” bs. Would explain their actions.

Bet the therapist is a big fan of “Irreversible Damage” too.
i Actually thought sometimes that it was something else I was feeling but now that I think about it she never saw it as something I actually am and continue calling me with very feminine adjectives
As if changing gender will somehow heal sexual trauma? I don’t even understand how they associate the two things. I’m so glad my doctor would never suggest that but I’ve been asked the most ignorant things by previous doctors about my sexuality and ptsd.
Hi
Seconding this! In fact, if a therapist doesn’t specialize in what your needs are or thinks they can’t provide you with good therapy, it’s their ethical obligation to let you know that and help find referrals to someone who can. Also a therapist is like every other provider of a service … YOU are the client paying them (or the health system in your stead) so if you don’t like the service you can go somewhere else.
Yeah many therapists are like I am lgbtq friendly but that just means they aren’t openly homophobic or transphobic and they might know Jack shit about actually being queer and/or trans and still harm you.
I mean, to be fair, with mental health everything is in your head, quite literally. The problem is that we see that as a means to discredit it when it's very much real.
I don’t know how I didn’t realize what she was trying to do but it makes a lot of sense now
Unfortunately there does appear to be a correlation, but it seems to work the opposite direction than old thinking believed.

PTSD, trauma or abuse didn't cause me to bi and genderqueer, being bi and genderqueer led to the abuse, trauma I received and the resultant PTSD.

Had a pretty bad dysphoria day today but actually getting dressed and leaving my parents house and not having to be in boy mode for a little bit helped. It’s the little things.		"Looking fine girl 😍 being yourself looks pretty amazing 👏
Oh, girl! I still didn't come out to my parents snd noticing how harder and harder it becomes to get back to ""boy mode"" for them...
Girl rock the world!
Every time I see one of your posts I think you're a cute cis girl. Like I'm not joking, every single time
Sending you all my love💗
Sorry you had a bad day and you’re right.  Simple pleasures can make your day and if dressing a bit more like yourself and taking a walk in the sun helped brighten you up then that’s great 😊
Your killing it girl!
Yea I was also having a bad dysphoria day for the first time. I had stumble and I was so close from my first laser that I was afraid to shave. 

I did anyway, put on makeup and clothes and felt amazing. Even streamed presenting as a female. 

Amazing what a little TLC to ourselves can go a long way.
You look so cute! Sorry you're having a rough day. You're doing much better then I do on those major dysphoria days.
I cannot picture you in boy mode! Darling, you look incredible!
oh heck ya you rad! BTW where did you get those sunglasses?
Nice out fit
Lookin swag, queen 👏
BROOOO YOU'RE SO PRETTY I'M CRYINGGGGG
Because we have gendered verbs, I always feel like I speak different language, when I turn girl mode on. ❤️❤️❤️
Just knowing How Beautiful and Gorgeous you are you shouldn't have to think about it just be Beautiful and stay Beautiful ☺️☺️
You're v attractive
Ooh you look great!
omg you look like gillian anderson <3

"Shop workers changed music to ""I want to break free"" after seeing me walk in."	"Just went into Zara (a clothes shop in the UK) and after getting some unusual looks from colleagues, the music suddenly changed mid-song from a typically modern playlist to ""I want to break free"" by Queen - a song which depicts all the members of Queen crossdressing.

Am I looking too much into it? Does this seem weird to anyone else?

Edit: It felt really intrusive, embarrassing, and upsetting. I was just minding my own business, feeling pretty, and while I'm trying on a dress, I'm hit with a brick of dysphoria."	"This is why I wear headphones whenever I leave the house
As a former DJ (ohh god) interrupting a song to put on a new one is a pretty big Faux-Pas.  Big swings of genre or mood or even era can also be jarring.

Now on the other hand, *I fucking love that song*.  Over here in the states that might be a little bit of a queer deep cut?  I imagine in the UK the video got a lot more play so maybe the general normie would be familiar with it?  In my experience the only people that would get that reference at all are big Queen fans themselves.  I think most people here really respect Freddy.  But again, I'm not sure how they're seen in the UK.

So there's a slight, slight chance it was meant as a positive?

I can think of a lot more hurtful songs (phobia ahoy!): >! If someone really wanted to hurt my feelings they would drop the needle on Aerosmiths boomer classic ""Dude (Looks like a Lady)"". That's kinda sweaty though, that's the go to.  A real classic rock aficionado might throw The Kinks ""Lola"" or even  The Beatles rooftop jam ""Get Back"" (Now a feature film on Disney +) . Ahh cmon, those songs are (kinda) supportive, kinda?  Maybe? Don't be so sensitive! But if you really wanted to gut punch me in the dressing room the right move would be Twain's ""Man! I feel like a woman"" Lets go girls! (to the bathroom to cry, but which?) !<
Yeah I was in a place the other day and born this way came on “randomly”.  I was like okayyyyyy this seems like a strange coincidence.
i really hope that was just a weird coincidence because wtf ??
I don’t know but who doesn’t like queen
Yeah that feels pretty weird on the part of the workers there. Like the unusual look then the music changing to that, even if it was done because they thought it was inclusive it does feel that they might be picking you out. I'd be a bit alienated if I was in your shoes.
This is my own bias talking, because I can never hate a Queen song coming on. I'd embrace it, love it, enjoy the moment of getting a Queen song playing for everyone to hear in such a public space.   
I do feel the 'am I reading too much into this' though. I recently went to a Viking fest, and there was a 'gay pirate' who had a show. He was going through the crowd, picking out individual people to make extremely sexual rhymes about (that was his whole thing, he was selling gay romance books like 'there's too many seamen on the poop-deck'). I loved it, laughing at all the rhymes he made for various people/jobs. But when he got to me, I was a 'translator'. Not the cook, or first-mate, or deck-hand, or any other job used so far. I do think I got the best rhyme for gay times...but I was still hit with instant dread over 'did he clock me? Did everyone clock me?' So I get that fear. Honestly, just try to enjoy the moment. Even if you don't like Queen, that's still a great song for others who might be closeted, might be ignorant, etc. Basically, just look on the bright side. That's what I try to do anyways. (This is also coming from a pansexual trans man, so that's why I was fine with 'being the subject of a joke', just like (hopefully) all the other guys who were singled out for the bit...since we were warned beforehand how gay it would be).
You likely didn't get any looks and it was all a coincidence.
Your feelings are valid! I wish we could feel safe trying on clothes anywhere. As to whether the song choice was intentional, I don’t know. That would require the shop workers to be very familiar with the song and the music video. I’m in the US where most transphobes or most people in general probably wouldn’t know about that cross-dressing connection to the song. That could be different in the UK, of course.
At my hrt appointment, the radio in planned parenthood played ""too late to turn back now"" and my cars TRANSmission broke and now I can't go in reverse, only forward. Is it a sign? Idk maby
I can definitely see this as a cringey ally thing to do. I bet they were trying to be supportive and encouraging—but by noticing you and making a thing out of it, they accidentally made you feel uncomfortable. I’m sorry that happened to you! Just try to assume that it wasn’t bigotry on their part, but rather a clumsy, failed attempt at cheering you on.
🤷‍♀️
maybe they were trying to be supportive by playing what they thought as a queer anthem.

they were not very successful, but they tried.
This is definitely weird and not funny.
Like, encouragement? Or like, bigotry?

Because I can't imagine that not being an ally thing to do.
That’s normally the first song on lots of pride playlists, are you sure they were staring at you in a bad way and not just like “are they? Should we?”
I wouldn't be all that surprised if it was a transphobe, but I also would not be surprised if it was a really really bad attempt at allyship, it being random is the only thing that would surprise me. Doesn't make it any less shitty either way.
If that's the case tune out their hate and insecurities they're projecting on to you and enjoy the music.

It's like whatever anyone's doing or choosing there will always be atleast someone who has a problem with it. So it's better to tune out such people's words and actions (not always but you get the point).

Life's a party just dance and enjoy. Plus it's ok to ""accidentally"" hit someone while dancing too ig.
I mean it’s more of them being Drag Queens or just understanding clothes and stuff don’t have gender assigned to them
This was almost certainly a coincidence 

That is not how transphobia manifests lol
I don’t think the shop workers would stop what they’re doing to change the music to Queen, for the purposes of upsetting a customer. Retail sucks. People don’t care that much to ruin your day. I’m a trans woman and never even thought of that song as something hateful or offensive, even. 

I think you’re reading way too into this. Plenty of retail workers change the music or playlist mid-song. This happens a lot. Sometimes the playlist sucks and they want something more uplifting. Sometimes the current playlist or station is getting stale and they want something fresh. 

Whatever it is, I think you’re reading way too deep into this and I don’t think it’s that serious or about you.
Ya, This could be just friendly hazing. Im not sure without further context. My friends would likely do this crap to me. But if they did I know it comes from a playful, ""we accept you as one of us"" kind of place. I'd embrace it. Hopefully your situation is just as benign as my hypothetical one. <3
it’s actually a very affirming song
IMO, you should own it. ""Cheers guys n gals is this one for me?...I'm flattered!"" {now do a twirl}
awwwwww
Ngl that’s pretty nice lol
this doesn’t feel targeted, it’s genuinely a popular song. i’m sorry you feel that way OP, your post history suggests that you did suffer from actual targeted transphobia. feel better ❤️
Honestly I would have just went with it and slayed a runway In front of them 🤷🏻‍♀️. Like, thank you to my fans for giving me a beat? They thought they really did something didn't they?
First : It IS weird, if it's a coincidence it's very bizare.

Second : I suffer from social anxiety, I tho have those creepy remark I heard from people in the streets, but for me, just talking for myself, it's me who paranoid 90% of the time.

So I would say. Don't mind it too much, you still have a thin probability they are just queen fan (which is good, they like a gay star, not typical of homophobe/transphobe)

But stay vigilant.

Good luck.
If this happened to me I don’t think I would even react to it, had no idea that the song depicted crossdressing.
If it was on purpose because directed at you, that’s wholly inappropriate. (I do love that song though and Freddy was one of my heroes growing up in the 80s) I hope you have the type of day that makes you feel your best self!
The biggest mistake you can ever make is to hand me a microphone. I would have played it for everything it's worth. I'm such a bitch.
I got a retro style audio cassette player for Christmas (Walkman) and ironically enoughmy favorite tape is the soundtrack for Bohemian Rhapsody the movie that I play as I walk around town. I hear nothing if I don’t want to lol. 

Honestly it may just be a coincidence but if it wasn’t I’d say you’re simply dealing with some infantile jerks that aren’t really worth paying any attention to.
This sounds targeted. But could be two ways. Depending on your relationship with your colleagues there, it could be seen as good or bad.  Supportive or transphobic. Context here matters more than the song here
I love Queen and I'm cis and straight.  I love The Bitch is Back by Elton John too. Girl just claim it an go with it.
It wouldn’t have been aimed. Personally I think that’s a great song. Be strong
I love that song, I just couldn't complain...
I would do this but I feel like I need to listen closely to my surroundings to stay safe
Same I'm always wearing headphones even when I turn them off and sleep there next to the bed there on rn
What headphones you got
Omg same here
I used to but my headphones stopped working

Yeah, Lola was relatively supportive in its time but it aged really poorly. I guess that's the nature of things, we interpret classics through the lens of our reality. The first time I heard it I was like ""WTF is this"" but after reading a bit about the history it kind of grew on me, depending on which way you interpret a single line.
Wait, is there something bad with I want to break free? I haven’t seen the music video or anything, just curious.
AccidentalAlly moment? Because you *were* born this way.
This is exactly what I mean. Thank you! 🙏 I don't care how positive they thought it was, they're picking me out. In another scenario, it'd be so rude to put on a particular song you thought was appropriate just because you saw a person of colour enter the shop - even if your intentions are positive and you think they might like it.
This is my new favorite comment.
Yeah, really not the place, this isn't the TGCJ.
Be it encouragement or bigotry, it's not an ally thing to do because it's picking someone out of the crowd because they look visibly trans without knowing whether they want to be seen
I respect that other people might like that, but I certainly didn't. It felt horrible. 😓
Best way to stay safe is to look like too much trouble for them. Always look like you're ready to fight and they tend to leave you alone. People who prey on others don't want a fight, they want you to cower. If they think you're gonna make noise or fight back they'll USUALLY leave you alone.
yea i feel the same way but in some situations i feel fine wearing them :/
If you have Apple Watch+AirPods you can pause the music your playing or even turn on hearing amplifier.
I bought a cheap pair of ""hidden"" earphones that I use for work and I always only ever have one ear piece in and nobody even knows (I have longer hair) so I do it that way when I leave the house sometimes.
Which is why I often wear headphones but don't have music on. So I can ignore people and situations and they assume I just can't hear them, well at the same time I can observe what's happening around me.

I’m also autistic so it’s for both reasons but yeah if I can’t hear you it’s all good
I still really like Lola; the wording and things aren't great but the overall message of it is what I think is more important. Dude looks like a lady is still...oof but from my understanding is more about how the band was criticised for their long hair and makeup
I think it's great! But that's what I mean, I feel like most people in the states have never seen the video. But OP mentioned she's in the UK, so I'm not sure how it was culturally over there. 

Personally trying to shame me with Queen is like putting out fire with gasoline.
That’s what born this way is about
As someone that’s worked in retail in the UK, employees generally don’t have control over what music they play in-store - particularly with large chains/corporations. It normally comes down from head office and they just turn it on at the beginning of the day. So if it makes you feel any better it was likely an unfortunate coincidence!
Ouch… i’m sure they meant to play it to be nice tbh…

The song is more about hair metal (Motley Crue, in particular, apparently,), and the fact that it was a lot more gender non-conforming.
I just open carry a Glock, no transphobe is willing to die over it.
I have an axe in my bag, usually wear composite toe shoes, and hold my keys ready to swing. I also charge in and out of buildings.

Ah well I take back that I said they were shit in that case
Yes, Aerosmith were at a bar with Mötley Crüe and were being typical boys doing stupid stuff that they think is funny when they got the idea for the song. Said “stupid stuff” is that they were repeatedly calling each other *dude*. At one point, somebody mistook a member of Mötley Crüe as a woman from behind due to the guy’s long hair. Thus, dude looks like a lady. The song was actually very progressive for the time since it’s literally about gay sex.

I love Aerosmith to death, and Steven Tyler is notoriously progressive. He’s always aimed to be a lot more androgynous in the way he dresses, and has been vocally anti-Tr*mp.

To make sure our community continues to feel safe here, we are now explicitly banning truscum, transmedicalist, and other gatekeeping ideologies.	"While reading this post, please keep in mind this is a safe space for identity first. What this means in regards to this post and this subreddit is that there are vulnerable people who are figuring their identity out, and while they're doing so, we want to make sure this space isn't invalidating or attacking their identity. To clarify; this _**DOES NOT**_ mean that you'll be banned instantly if we see that you've posted on truscum/transmedicalist subreddits in the past, just if you're posting common truscum/transmedicalist ideologies on the subreddit. This includes, but is not limited to requiring Gender Dysphoria to be transgender, ""Fake Trans"" people, bashing on identities you don't understand, claims of certain identities not existing, etc. Take note, that when making decisions on how to action users, their post history (or lack thereof) will be taken into account.

In general we have seen a lot of people afraid to post here because their identity may or may not line up with the experiences that other people have, they're afraid of being ""the out group"" when they are anything but that. We can't have a thriving community while also attacking those who use this place to explore that identity. Just because someone's identity doesn't exactly match up with your experience, or may be something that you don't understand, does not give you authority on whether or not their identity is valid.

Keep in mind that we've already held by this rule for a long time now, but we've been slowly pushed into making this rule explicit. We want everyone to feel safe here, and always have, and we have always made sure to action those who spread these ideologies before. The biggest issue we've ran into is that since it's not explicitly stated, we have had people afraid to report comments that would break our other rules with the idea of potentially remaining ""neutral"" when all it's doing is allowing truscum ideology to stick around when it shouldn't be. For the most part you probably won't notice too much of a change in comparison to before this new rule and post, but it should allow us to catch more rule-breakers faster.

Finally, as a heads up, we would like to notify the community of some upcoming announcements and surveys:

- [If you would like to apply as a moderator, please do so here.](https://forms.gle/hK6SvtTBBi36Jdk19)
- We will be going over selfies and their role here.
- Rules clarifications and reworking to make them more understandable/readable"	"good riddance.

Older, dysphoric, binary trans woman here. Good call!
a step in the right direction :)
I was honestly worried on joining because I'm a non-binary trans and have been met with some hate for it in the past, so seeing this makes me feel more comfortable
Honestly I might actually be active on this sub if this is true, I’m non-dysphoric and I’ve been really scared to participate in online trans spaces cuz it’s such a taboo thing in the trans community.
Question, will this general philosophy of banning transmedicalist and truscum bullshit extend to people who subscribe to Blanchardist nonsense and will talk about AGP as if it’s anything other than bullshit? I’d assume and hope that it would, but I do sorta just wish to check.
God this is ridiculously based. Thank you for working to keep this community healthy and welcoming!
Thank you for doing this and for reassuring that this is not a safe space for those exclusionary people. Much appreciated. :)
Does it mean warnings to those slamming those of us that identify with “transsexual”? There seems to be quite a few comments through the sub which vilifies us, but its how some identify. I have 20 years identifying that way.
I'm very happy to hear this. I feel like I was derailed from finding my true self by being told so many 'you can only be trans if--' type things, I should have been myself for decades now, not years. Thank you for making sure others won't be similarly discouraged.
I don't need to have experienced gender dysphoria to be trans?

I was under the impression that it was somewhat frowned upon... I have a deep desire to be a woman, but I've never experienced gender dysphoria. I don't know why I have such a strong desire to be seen and appear as a woman, but it's something that's been with me for well over a decade, maybe longer.. yet I don't believe I've ever been dysphoric about presenting as a male publicly.
Excellent news.

Thank you!!!!! I transitioned to a woman for a spiritual journey of not identifying as anything, so I was nonbinary for a while until fully embracing the feminine me that I discovered, as well as recognizing some gender issues since childhood through many flashbacks but I had repressed myself due to gender norms because of so much bullying that happened to me and other gender nonconforming people who seemed almost non-existent when I was a kid in the 70s. This post is very affirming that I am no less trans than those who had major gender dysphoria. What matters is that I am happy with the reinvented me. I support every trans person’s journey for whatever their own reasons are too.
Per *Hate Speech (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series)* by Caitlin Ring Carlson,

> Hate Speech represents a structural phenomenon in which those in power use verbal assaults and offensive imagery to maintain their preferred position in the existing social order.

Transmedicalist gatekeeping is definitely an example of people with power / privilege using verbal assaults & offensive rhetoric to maintain their preferred position in a social order.

So this rule clarification is upholding Reddit’s Sitewide Rule 1.

^(I just wish Reddit AEO / Trust & Safety would recognise that transmedicalism is hate speech)

Ok I’m someone who has been out of the community for a while.  What is a transmedicalist.  I know what gatekeepers are I had my share of run ins with a few of them back in the late 90s and early 2000s they were part of the reason I left the community. Don’t know what transcum are.  Forgive me trying to prepare returning to the local community so I feel these are things I should know.

Happy cake day!🍰
I'm not clear on who gets to decide and by what authority what a ""true"" transgender or transexual person is. I gets very confusing, and the ""acceptable"" terms seem to change with each high school graduation class.
So essentially, only people that agree with you are allowed? Even if they’re not spreading hate or even sharing those views here?
Can someone explain these words to me? I’ve never heard of them before.

What is trascum? I don't know what that means, I'm so sorry!

Here, here!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

lol I had to look up what those words meant! What's the issue here?
I didn't know what Transmedicalism was so I looked it up and had a public transport company pop up

Edit: it wasn't a public transport company, but it was a hazardous materials transport company.
I'm 32, not sure if that counts as older or not, but glad to hear this <3
Hate is prohibitive to growth, but so are echo chambers
Yes, it's true, and if anyone harasses you about your identity, feel free to report them.
[removed]
Yes.

I didn't really think to include it specifically just because there's so much overlap between these groups, but that's why I included ""gatekeeping"" in the title, as I find it kinda fits under that.
What's AGP? I'm not too active in trans spaces and I've never heard of it before.
I'm not entirely sure who downvoted you, but identifying with an ""outdated"" term does not make one a bad person and you will not be banned for identifying with such terms, that's actually part of why this rule is made; gatekeeping identity is bad altogether.

Now on the other hand, if you go around stating that some other user isn't a true trans or that transexual has some special meaning that some people won't be able to attain because of XYZ gatekeepy reason, then yes you will be warned and potentially banned for that depending on how bad of an infraction it is.

""Transexual"" holds a lot of history, but that history is both bad and good, and the reason why it's been dropped by many people is at least partially due to that negative history, which I'm sure you're aware of.

Truscum/transmedicalist ideology are the main concerns, as well as the offshoots of those ideologies, like the ones centered around AGP. Anything that asserts that someone isn't who they say they are due to arbitrary rules is the target here.
[D] Since I’m also a bit gun shy (on other issues not this one) I wanted to point out there’s also another subreddit r/honesttransgender with a wide range of opinions and less social policing.

I just wanted to mention it, since I didn’t know it existed previously.  It has a mix of people so no viewpoint it seems is completely in the minority.
You definitely do not need dysphoria to be trans. Be who you are, whatever makes you most happiest.
You don't, but I also don't know if you've ever explored this site [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)
If you read the actual WPATH standards, persistently and consistently feeling that you should be or want to be another gender IS Gender Dysphoria.

The way clinicians define it is not how the ""street"" defines it. So if you hear doctors or psychologists talking about gender dysphoria, they also mean what you described. 

Tweens on Tumblr fell for some etymological fallacy stuff and said ""dysphoria means a bad thing so if I want to be another gender that's gender *euphoria*"" and here we are. 

But doctors generally speaking are not listening to what kids on Tumblr say and have no idea that madokahime1997 DECLARED in 2014 that what you're experiencing isn't GD, hashtag I don't make the rules
Ok, i am late. Just want to say, strong desire to present as other gender than the one given at birth I think counts as dysphoria,you just experienced less than others maybe
I just wish Reddit would recognize the blatant brigading they do, as well as the hate speech, it's tiring dealing with their bs when there's more important things to moderate.
Honestly none. Having it is a big ol' +, but taking out the trash is the big job anyways.
Nice!
Us genz who are still exploring our identities are grateful to have those with experience like you!
Truscum and transmedicalist are relatively similar.

Truscum often believe that you need dysphoria to be transgender.

Transmedicalist often believe that you need to either want to, plan to, or are currently, transitioning medically to be transgender.

Both gatekeep the community in different ways and have their own quirks. Oftentimes there is quite a lot of overlap between them. Neither ideology are a positive impact on the community.
<3 Thanks!
It's really simple; the trans person decides. Anything/one else is gatekeeping.
1. It doesn't say that.
2. Gatekeeping identity goes against rule 6, we've been enforcing this rule long before it was instated visibly.
3. If you're going to come up with strawmen, come up with a better one.
4. If you participate in a hate community, that does not mean we immediately ban someone. If they bring that hate here from that community, then yes they will be banned.


This is a safe space for all trans people, if you're going to gatekeep that identity, or otherwise attack other users about who they are or why they exist in the way they do, you will be banned.
No, only people that don't needlessly spread hate or cause harm. There's a difference between disagreeing with someone and denying their existence.
Transmedicalist and Truscum are the same thing. Truscum is just an insult to describe transmedicalists (pronounced true-scum).

Transmedicalists believe you must have gender dysphoria to be trans. Many LGBTQ+ people disagree with this because we believe that anyone should be able to live in a way that makes them happy so long as it doesn't hurt other people. Being trans is not about having dysphoria; it's about living in a way that makes us happy.
To be clear, which words?
?
""Truscum and transmedicalist are relatively similar.

Copied from OP's comments to some people (ik your comment is 3 days old but just commenting incase u weren't sure)
From my GenX POV, no!
Nah I’m gonna keep calling myself trans, it pisses off people like you and that’s kinda funny to me.
That’s fair, I should’ve assumed as much, and I apologize not for just taking that from the post originally.
Honestly, personally if I was you, I’d stay that way and try to just never learn about that nonsense, it is a harmful idea/mindset and has no benefit in knowing about.
I won't go into detail, but it's yet another theory that paints trans people (particularly women) as nothing but perverts. You can look it up for the sake of general knowledge, but it's probably nothing you've never heard of before, so you wouldn't miss out on much if you chose not to.
AGP is just disguised self-loathing.
Oh yes, I know my history, been identifying as transsexual since 2004 so talking 19 years with that identity, just some groups need to stop telling us to stop using it as its meaningful term to many also.
It's a safe space for transmeds to spread their bs under the guise of it ""just being an opinion"". If you speak out against it you will be socially shamed, it happens all the time.
Oh. I genuinely thought that was a true thing, because other trans people have always told me that. Don’t hate on me, but can I have a little explanation of how? I was always told that having dysphoria is a big part of being trans, and being that I have it I always assumed that was true.
I have this conflict that goes on in the back of my head sometimes that sends me through a phase of losing all motivation towards expressing myself, though... I'm not sure exactly what the conflict is, or why, but I'll get in this rut where I just don't have the energy or motivation to wear my feminine undies or clothes, where I question myself, sometimes even think I might not be able to pass, or think that maybe I should push everything back down because it'd be easier than facing all the changes.. I'm sorta entering back into that rut where the joy and happiness of wearing my girl-mode clothes is dissipating, lately, as well.. I wish I knew why that happens. I'm glad I don't need to be dysphoric though
Ahh but not every can afford or even survive the medical treatments due to other conditions.  Everyone experiences gender differently. I just don’t get it and I’m an ex self hating trans person.  It’s as bad as the girl I ran into advocating hatred of all cis people.   Just plain dumb.   Thank you for the definitions.
Ah I see. Thanks for answering. I think I'm gonna keep the Hazmat Transport definition. A lot less toxic.
Gen Jones, if you know what that is, here. I agree. On both.
FYI that user was banned for being transmedicalist. We don't tolerate that so if you encounter anyone else like that please report the comment or send us a modmail.
Nah, no worries, it can be hard to word rules exactly right.

For example, even rhough this is a ""new rule"" it's existed under other rules informally, so for us nothing really changes, this is really just a formality so people know where we stand as a subreddit.
....you're probably right honestly.
I think I've heard enough...
It's often a big part of being trans, but it's far from being required.

Not all trans people go through the same journey that we do, and some experience their gender in different ways. All that really matters to me is that they are respectful towards others.
It should be noted that OP said “want to” when referring to transmedicalist beliefs. As long as there is a desire to transition medically (like with hormones and surgeries) it counts as transmedical.

Its pretty bad that people like this are going around the community spouting hate. Like, what about all the trans people who are comfortable with their bodies, just not their expression? Those people are just as worthy of the trans label as the rest of us.
Yeah but it's still pretty callous. People often have to hold back what they want and need because of family, scope of opportunities, etc.

For example Patrick Califia didn't transition until after his mother passed away.
You're Welcome! We're the most sarcastic generation too. Like, yeah sure knock yourself out, I'm sure it will work out great for you.<eye roll> Because we got screwed first by the f'ing boomers! jk. some of my best friends are boomers! <snark
No worries, I kinda wanted to know
The definition of being transgender is not identifying as your gender identity, that's all. Gender dysphoria is closely linked to being transgender, but is not only experienced by trans people (IE cisgender men with gynecomastia, cisgender women with a beard).

This is why being transgender is not necessarily something that requires you to have gender dysphoria, and is not linked directly linked by it either.

Keep in mind, I'd argue that being transgender isn't a choice, as identifying as something outside of your gender assigned at birth, isn't a choice. It's the same as being gay or asexual, neither of those are a choice, why would gender identity be?
Gender expression is not the same as gender identity. GNC is not gender identity. A man can wear a dress and a woman can be masculine, that’s what GNC is and what gender expression is. It has nothing to do with how you identify. A GNC person can be trans but not all GNC people are trans.
The most sarcastic generation is teenagers. Regardless of what time or place, it's always the people in high school

31 yo, 27 months HRT, she/her, dysphoria has been bad lately I could use some kind words. I know I don't pass and that kinda guts me, no matter how much we're not supposed to care		"You look passing to me.  It’s probably dysphoria or if not, voice?
You're beautiful! Dysphoria is lying to you and being big rude, imo.
You look like a gorgeous lady to me. Your make up is so so so well done, I'm envious xD

And even where you have less/no make up, you look unambiguously feminine to me.

You're beautiful. I mean that.
I'm so confused. I see all these posts from these beautiful women saying how they supposedly don't pass, and I'm just sitting here thinking: ""Well these people look like 10 times better than I do. They look cis to me, but if they don't pass, what hope do I have?""
I feel Weird saying this, but I love your nose! It's so cute. Also, your hair looks really soft 😊😊😊
This post is a lie, you frickin pass in my book!
You're lovely. <3
dysphoria is lying to you, you look really good
You look great! Kind of a Tori Amos vibe 😉
Idk how you think you don't pass. I stopped scrolling when I saw your first pic and thought, damn girl, well done. Then I read the text.
Actually, you pass (assuming you are mtf).  Id suggest some tweaks to the makeup (slightly different lipstick color, brow work), but I've seen other women (and cis women) with much larger makeup problems.

Your hair is right, face shape and presentation work well.  I'm a stranger on the internet with no reason to lie - you are fine.
Don't think for a second that you don't pass because you do very well!
What a beautiful woman you are. Graceful in form and face. . . As a voice teacher I would remind my students that we do not hear our voices as they truly sound. It is similar in a way to looking in the mirror, we don't see ourselves in our truest form but through a glass, darkly, where everything is turned about. Dysphoria is a broken place for our inner beauty to glow through and you are glowing, radiant. To journey is to be courageous, we leave what was before, comfortable or not, sojourning to find who we will become: a new and different person. I can see your journey is revealing a striking woman, body and spirit. I would be happy to have you as my friend
You're beautiful, tell those bad thoughts to leave you alone!
you do pass though! and you look absolutely gorgeous

Well Zöe, based on the photos you’ve posted, my opinion is that you are very pretty and could easily be assumed to be cis.  

On a personal level, I don’t find the term ‘pass’ helpful.  It connotes some trickery on my part, that the experience I have and outwardly express is somehow not as authentic as someone born and socialized into womanhood because it is different than an accepted norm.   I try to be mindful of that and the language I use about myself.   

You’re a woman, you’re not passing anything off, you’r living your truth — your truth just happens to be that your path to womanhood is transgender. and you are incredibly beautiful.  And to your point, I just don’t see a scrap of masculinity there.
""Don't pass"" girl what are you smoking? If i saw you on the street, I wouldn't even guess you were anything other than a woman, and I heard that clip of your voice, I know multiple cis woman who have voices deeper than yours. This is not me trying to hype you up, you legitimately pass extremely well.
Looks, check. Voice, check. You pass.
You're shittin' me, right? Holey HELL, not only do you look like a woman, I don't think you could pass for a guy even if you tried.

I have Aspergers, so there's a very weak filter between my brain and my mouth. If an Aspie tells you that you pass, you can take that to the bank.

I look ok as a woman I think, but you are GOALS!

Even without makeup like in some of the pics, I'd think you were female.
Love the eye lashes and you are just gorgeous. Have a nice day and I hope thing get better fir you. Dysphoria can be so crippling.  Sending hugs.
Im 32 yr old closeted bi/cd. And I can tell you right now baby you are beautiful and more than passable I wouldn't be able to tell if I didn't know already tbh. Anytime you maybe wanna chat just dm me. I'd love to talk to you about any an everything
Umm you pass very well. I honestly would be afraid to talk to you.
You easily pass. You look fantastic.
Your looking beautiful you should be proud of where your at
You are more passing than some cis women I know
You look great
Certainly look passable to me hun! 🥰
you are very pretty.
Looking great.
Girl, you pass extremely well
So pretty.  You look and sound female girl. Accept it:)
Pretty
Yes I don't see how you're not pretty and feminine appearing enough to be called female.
I know I see a woman.
Youre soooo pretty though!! Omg
Looking good, looking cute, looking femme. This is just hrt? If so, I'm impressed!
ummm...looking at this photo array, I'd say you pass really damn well. Very pretty indeed.
First things first, you rock yr outfits, all of them, and yr makeup glows. I’m pre-everything and seeing my face can ruin a beautiful day. So I hear you, baby girl! But what I see is smth else entirely. Since you say you know you’re not passing, how about this: I happen to know you are passing. Like, really really. The lady in yr face makes me blush — because goals, and because I find you to be quite attractive. A-and tall, you say? Oh…! 🥰 😘
You're gorgeous don't let anyone tell you otherwise
Really gorgeous! You go grrl!!! 🥰
You *don't* pass? I NEEDED a moment to understand and look at what subreddit I was on!
Tbh you look just like my sister and she’s cis so I think that’s a good sign
You kinda have ms frizzle from the magic school bus vibes or like the cool art teacher who lets kids chill in her class whenever
You look stunning!!
You look great!
Fuck, *of course* you pass! Please, compare yourself to *me* - and I'm *almost* pretty!

You're absolutely *stunning*, and you will be all the more so when you're in a great mood!
You look great
personally i feel like you are beautiful and I see you as she/her and I understand the pressure but you are you and only you know what you look like
I did not read the post you really look like a woman
Girl, I've seen you blossom over the years. You look amazing
Yeah. You pass hun.
Preface: Yes, passing is fucked. Wanting to pass is valid because it helps us feel safe and good.

Girl, you pass. And you are so pretty. If I saw you I'd have to at least tell you that I like your tops or your lipstick. Also, I'd probably be a useless sapphic and want to ask you out but find myself unable to do so. I kinda wanna ask you out anyway >.>
Girl!! You look amazing!!! I wish I looked that good!!! 👱🏻‍♀️👱🏻‍♀️👱🏻‍♀️💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
Stay strong sis!!!
You look and sound passing to me. I like your outfit choices, they look lovely on you. Also ignore the dysphoria, its a liar
I hope you have a great day, and that things change for the better!
Hmm. Hard to believe you're not passing most of the time. I mean clockable, maybe, to some Super POVs who think it's their destination outing other people, but you need to encounter that kind of asshole person first. Most people will just assume you're a woman and go on with their lives. 

So, no, I don't think you should assume, you ""don't pass"" as general.
idk if this is the best but i been thinking lately passing is just a cishet beauty conformist bullshit. u look absolutely gorgeous
Beautiful <3 also you shouldnt care about passing butt you look super feminine and im sure you pass greatly :3 owo
Your lying to yourself! You are beautiful and I'm sure you pass!! Also I really like your hair!!
you absolutely pass in my eyes!
You look amazing in the red dress and lipstick
""I know I don't pass""
What? O.o 

You pass, woman.
You look beautiful! 🥳
Really cute girl there
omg.. you look diva girl.. just Ah-Mah-Zhing.. <3
I think my voice is okay, but not perfect. I did voice training with a coach and it turned out alright, still clockable if you're looking for it but it's better than the Christian Bale Batman voice I used to have.

This is what I sound like:

https://voca.ro/1muQgolFYccW
The way I see it is quite different. If these people think they don't pass, you're probably experiencing something similar. Regardless of what you look like, you're seeing yourself in a worse light than the rest of us see you in.

Who knows how many people see you as passing, even if you don't. How many people see you as beautiful. If you could see yourself through someone else's eyes, you would see someone amazing. 💜
Is it that they look 10x better than you do? Or do you look 10x better than you think you do, because you have the same problem?

🤔
ikr
You look beautiful
Only care about what makes you happy 😊
Right must have very lofty goals.
Are you that person from Argentina I met at M2 that one time years ago?
K, see, that’s a goals voice right there.
https://voca.ro/1kJxLbtL5d6A
You sound fine and look fine dear :) 
I wanna be able to do make up like you!

You will always be your own hardest critic.
Do you use a voice pitch analyzer? There are free online options. It gives you a visual representation of your voice while you practice. It really helped me. As far as your look you pass with ease.
[removed]
Well that's good. Id love to hear your voice sometime then. You worked hard for it. Send me a voice dm or something"	115dgso	trans	622	0.98	2023-02-18 11:38:52

Just wanted to say you pass and you look kinda badass, especially in the last pic
Tbh I thought you were ftm pre everything, I was confused why the hair was causing dysphoria lmao

You pass short hair or long imo but if you want it long I’m sure it will look amazing!
Get some extensions or some smallish hair pieces you can just clip in or out yourself. Lots of girls rock short hair tho. Looks good!
MTF forgot to mention in title! Uhm just in case someone maybe gets confused again.
you have very feminine facial features! pretty!
You pass <3 very beautiful
You look gorgeous. I particularly like the hair. Everyone goes for long hair, be different!
You are so cute awwwww
Came to say what others have as well. I had to sit and try and understand why the hair was a problem because I really thought you were FtM and just getting started. You’re killing it hun! 💕
Can I be honest? You look afab, trying to pass as m. Your comment about the short hair had me completely confused, so yeah, you definitely pass!
You pass and look really cute. Short hair fits you.
💯 thought you were ftm. You are absolutely gorgeous. Even with short hair, you pass totally.
Last pic is goddess vibes. You pass, and in fact, the short hair helps because of the style. Your face is incredibly feminine
didn't realise you were MTF until i saw the comments, was about to start dropping some masc passing tips lol
Hey, you look super pretty! Weird question but is it okay to draw you? 

I personally think you look gorgeous with your hair like that ( the last photo is * chef's kiss * )  but If you want to I can add extensions/make it a bit longer for you as well! You decide. :)

( If you feel uncomfy it's totally okay! It's just that I wanna start drawing cute people who sometimes don't realize how cute they are and feel a bit insecure/dysphoric about themselves. Oh and also practice! )
You are so gorgeous, and I think the hair is cute! 
✨😍✨ I get it though. I’m growing mine out too right now. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You pass and are very beautiful, queen!
You have the cutest face and you pass fo sho!
I honestly thought you were AFAB until I read the title. You pass very well and you’re very pretty!
You pass quite exquisitely actually. Legit thought you were ftm pre-everything until you mentioned short hair causing dysphoria haha
You pass so well!!!!
I feel the short hair, but I actually think your hair and face combo give off a totally femme vibe. IDK if that’s just me.
I don’t know what’s going on, but you are very pretty.
But it's so cute rn! Very spicy pixie and I love it
You definitely pass, also your so pretty!
Girl yes,and you're owning it. I'm a 90s girl so it's super real for me,but you own it
Girl no you look amazing, i can't imagine anyone even suspecting anything, much less clocking you based on looks.
[removed]
You def pass with the short hair, but if ur feeling particularly dysphoric i think some colorful hair clips would be really pretty, and they might make you feel better. Tons of girls at my school rock the pixie cut/hair clip combo I think it'd be super cute
1. You do
2. It’ll grow out. Just gotta give it some time.
you look beautiful and feminine, just remember we're our own worst critic we tend to see things that others don't. Good luck on your journey (: I wish you the best. <3
Beautiful
You look very feminine. Short hair doesn't change that. Definitely passing.

You are rocking the cute pixie look with your hair right now.
Lol
But you're pretty.
you're so cute omg
Yeah I looked at this and thought you were a really unpassing ftm but you are in fact just femme as fuck
you pass 100% w
You pass on short hair and I like that style, it's very cute
You look like AFAB!
 I love it
you look like a cis woman
🔥😍
We have almost the same hair, and it looks great on you!
Whoa! Just read the comments! I would have never guessed you were MTF.  Don't even worry about it.  You look fantastic!
You pass so well 😭😭
what are you trying to pass as? you look feminine more than anything, so if you’re trying to go femme you’re doing great! but if you’re trying to pass as masc, maybe do some masc contouring? idk. from what i see you look very femme but idk if that’s your goal
Yeah. I don’t think you could pass for male, no matter how much hair you cut!
genuinely thought you were ftm worried about not passing

i dont know your sexuality but if i saw you out and about i would think you were a cute fashionable bi/lesbian girl :)
You look adorable
I legit thought you were ftm and was really confused.

You look great. Don't worry about it.
Hey, you look cute AF!!!!  Rock it!
You are so pretty and pass so well! The short hair looks super cute too!
Girls with short hair rock and you are definitely one of them! You definitely pass ☺️
You are very lovely and yes you pass
You look stunning babe. \m/
I would have assumed female with less/ no makeup
I say keep the hair, it makes you look like a badass female protagonist
Dont worry girl you pass, you look like a power lesbian
*BANG* PASS! you passssssss *hits judge hammer on table* guilty of being cute!
Very Cute!

You Look Great,

Luv your outfit too

What brand jeans?

back Picture of jeans?

thx
Ahahah idk what sort of vibes I was going for in my chair but glad they look cool! bless ty!
OH WAIT LMAO SRRY I REALIZED I DIDNT MENTION I WAS MTF AA UR SO NICE.

Tyvm! I’m glad I can pass with the shorter hair! I’m trying to grow my hair out cause long hair is so validating and I wanna see how I look with it. It’s my dream but it might have to wait awhile cause of family issues but it’ll happen hopefully!
Same lol, it took me a minute
I think everyone here thought she was ftm at first
Above* “that hip cute girl!”
For realz :)
I can def try! I’ve also considered maybe a wig, but for now I’m just trying to grow it out naturally and will def look into other options if I run into any problems with growing natural long hair!
Yea you definitely pass sweetheart! I legit thought you were mtf pre ops like someone else said, you’re very pretty!~
Gosh ty!
Ahk ty u2!
Ahaha tysm! I’m definitely feeling a lot more confident about the short hair after all the love ppl have shared here. 

Still I feel like it’s a lot tougher to come across feminine in most situations without the long hair and would still wish to try it someday!
Hnnng thanks!
You’re too nice!!! Hng ty
Aa I keep getting that from comments now and it’s like rlly??? I thought ppl were just trying to be nice since this sub is generally super supportive! But sfadddfsf ty!
Glad to hear it rlly ty! Hng long hair is still goals but I’m glad I guess I have a some sort of fallback plan now!
Hng thanks so much dude! I just wanted to say you’re so frigging handsome too!
Dunno which goddess has an absolute mess of a room like mine ahaha but tysm!!

U look incredible too!
OH AHAHA lol ty tho
Tyssssm aaa you’re so nice! Ya u can draw me sure thing! Your art is so gorgeous!! I’m feeling a lot better about the shorter hair after the support so I’m fine if you drew me that way. Mostly cause i can’t even picture what longer would make me look like ahaha!
Omg finally!! someone else else with the same issue! I’m so glad there’s at least one other person out there who gets the woes ahaha! 

Tyvvvm! Good luck on styling your hair as it grows out too!! I’m sure you’ll look incredible <3
Haaa ty! Idk how I feel about being called Queen yet but I don’t hate it ehehe
Super glad to hear it ty! U look phenomenal too!
Aa you’re so nice! making me blush ty!
Gosh ppl keep saying that ahaha ty!!
Ty! As do u!! Your selfies are stunning
Tyy! U aren’t alone it seems I’ve got a few other comments saying the same, who knows I guess if long hair doesn’t play out then I guess I have another option!
Tyvm! Tho what do you mean by not knowing what’s going on?
TY OMG i didn’t even remember pixie cuts were a thing I’m so caught up longer hair.
Thanks bunches! Im gonna be up all night thanking ppl weh
Tyty gosh
Aa Tyssm! Uhm I’m guessing clocking means someone seeing that I’m amab right? Srry still quite new to some of these terms!
:) you’re too kind! relationships still utterly terrify me but at least I now know maybe I might have a chance ahahahahah ty
Rlly? I saw someone else mention it here but do u know any good places that sell hair clips? I’ll also have to look up how they’re used and how they look. Tyvm tho!
1. Ty!!!
2. I know weh, it feels like it’s just never fast enough
Haaa yeah maybe it does seem like I was a bit harsh on myself with with how supporting everyone here is about it.

I’ve just never really had a chance to or been confident enough to discuss with people how I looked, and been just generally going through it alone. You’re right I think my own thoughts kinda just ended up amplifying my insecurities.

It took a long time to make this post but now I’m so glad I did tyvm! And best of luck with how your journey is going too!!
Thankss
Thank you!! My hair is still the bane of my existence but I’m feeling better about it now!
Lol
Tyyy gosh you’re making me blush hnng

God tyssssm ahaha I’ll keep it if long hair doesn’t work out I promise
Hnng thats lovely tyyy I tho would hope to attract some guys someday too ahaha
YOU'RE MTF??  Damn
I thought you were trying to pass as ftm, your face is very feminine and round.. I'd be hard pressed to find someone who thought you were a cis male.
This is honestly so true. I was so confused like ""I thought the short hair was a good thing??? 100%"" clocked"" in the wrong direction, girl you are straight fire 🔥 sending love from Canada!
Hng I missed this comment in the sea. But bless tysm! Gosh it makes me so happy!
It really does seem like that’s the case ughhh I really regret not being clearer
<3
Do u mean like ftm pre? Also shshshg ty!
Thank you <3 <3 <3 been trying to not bleach my hair as my golden red in the bay area everyone wants to touch it but I miss my pink hair
Hey! You look adorable. I'm a cis woman with a bright green razor cut. My hair is maybe an inch and a half long straight up, and I am there from a buzz cut. You rock short hair, and it looks great on you.
I‘m serious. I was hella confused about the short hair thing. You look VERY feminine!
Aw haha. Thanks! You’re so kind.
Sorry, it's hella late, but I think I'm done!

[it was really nice drawing you! I hope you like it!](https://imgur.com/a/iLSC9hK)
😭 thank you! I’ll post pictures soon. I don’t think I can yet because I made a new account.
Ok! Sorry if I crossed any boundaries!
Aww thank you! 💜
You don’t have to thank me for the truth!
It has been democratically decided that you pass then lol
I was super confused by the title and didn’t read the comments for context. I have now though and you completely pass!
💜💜💜💜
Yes, that's right. I really don't see it happening to you, you look great!
[removed]
I usually just go to the hair and cosmetic aisle in most stores
I'm really sorry you felt like that you should always be able to express yourself without feeling insecure. You want to know a secret? Everyone on this earth is insecure deep down, even if they don't show it. I'm happy you made this post its not easy putting yourself out there to be vulnerable you should be proud, that's what make trans people so genuine. <3
But like you are. Like seriously you are super pretty, and I wish I could hug you irl.
you're welcome \^\^
i honestly thought you were afab, if you hadn’t said you were trans i would have assumed you were just a cis woman
I’m adopted but a couple of friends said my haircut was extra asian looking lolol
oh good to know!! it’s okay, but anyways; you pass great! even with short hair:)
no problem, and i feel that! just thought i would give you my honest judgement if i were a stranger on the street. :)
Of course girl, you look so cute!
YA HBGGDHD it’s actually embarrassing at this point
Bless ty
Aw much love too ty! I’m from Canada too hi!!
YES im sorry haha, my bad, and of course! :)
Aa ty! I’m glad u can rock that look! And I’m incredibly happy a lot of people think I can pass pretty well with the short hair. Ig I’m still just following my inner trans girl hoping for long hair and trying to be extremely feminine to make up for my masculinity ahaha.
No it’s fine I didn’t expect it so soon even ahaha! TYYYY THIS IS GORGEOUS IDK WHAT TO SAY AAA. I’m super happy u just randomly did this for me shhsvsg I love it so much!!
Nono it’s fun ahaha just new to me
I gotta! Ppl are being so nice and it’s the first time rlly I’ve ever felt validated. Everything’s been stressful but yall here has made it a lot better so I gotta say smthg cause of all the help,,
Glad it could be cleared up ahaha I’m kinda feeling embarrassed now I should’ve made the title clearer ugh. Ty again tho!
Thank bunches!! That means so much!!
Thankssss a tip I’ve always had with hips is that you can always fake them a bit! Like in my pic- tucking a tshirt into sweatpants always gives u a bit more of an hourglass figure. I used it prior to hrt and still do cause im still pretty early into it and while there have been some changes to my hips they’re not rlly noticeable outwardly.

I’m sure you’ll make your goals tho! After u start and even rn! U got this!
Glad to hear that!! I usually go out with a fake it till you make it mentality- It’s prolly not good but it’s how I was raised. So I generally try my best and hope people can see me for who I am without ever being open about it. But the stress of do I look okay or are people seeing something weird in me eventually got to me so I came to ask here.
Ty againnn and Hecc yeah I’d take a hug anyday <3
Ya it is!!! Lmao
Oh no way! Hello from Maple Ridge BC!
I'm glad you liked!!!! If you wanna any sketch or drawing made by me feel free to ask! 

Thank you for letting me draw you! 💛💛💛
Ok! I wish you luck in figuring things out in your way and time!
I’m sorry things are rough for you, but so glad that my comment could brighten up your day even just a little! That’s what this sub’s for! Just us trans people supporting each other!
Don’t be embarrassed we’ve all messed up on a title. Also you’re welcome!
Do you want to be frens?
Aw man this is gonna be kind awkward but my home city is in Alberta ehehe,, tho I’m studying elsewhere out of province!!
Nw!! I’ll keep your offer in mind and ty again!!!

You look beautiful want to be friends
Look Im sorry and I really try not to be a gatekeeper but I read some of your other posts and from what I’ve gathered you might want to think long and hard about it even considering you’re able to get to a point where you transition. Im not you and I don’t know what or how you feel so maybe you’re just trying to be nonchalant about it as a coping mechanism but if that’s not the case and you really just wanna try it out for fun I HIGHLY recommend against it(assuming you’d even be able to get the right prescriptions). Although if you are serious and you do really want to transition Id say the best steps are going to a gender therapist with the proper credentials, trying out new pronouns and a new name and see how it feels. Once you go on proper hormones there’s no real going back which is part of why the process is so long and hard. Once you go on hormones if you’re not trans that can cause a whole load of problems. Not to mention it’ll most likely cause a ton of problems in both your personal and professional life assuming you don’t live in the most liberal of liberal areas. Keep in mind if you ever want to try presenting more feminine it’s 100% fine to or if you want to full on cross dress that’s also an option. Im just going off of what ive seen from your other post and like I said Im not sure how you truly feel but if you are wanting to transition just because it’d be a bit of fun I recommend doing more research and maybe try one of the alternatives I’ve mentioned. I hope that didn’t come across as too rude or worse like Im gatekeeping or discrediting your identity but just from what I’ve seen it just looks like you might want to do more research no matter what side of the gender spectrum you fall on.

Gotcha. Well if you are serious I’d be willing to give you proper pointers I realize I was kinda an ass about it."	kf9xu7	trans	613	0.99	2020-12-18 00:20:54
I painted my nails black, and my dad made me take of the polish, called me a f*g, and said I embarrass him.	"Really it's all in the title, I just feel like ass, the nails gave me a lot of euphoria, and my dad calling me a f*g hurt so much I just wanna be accepted, I haven't even come out, and this is how I get treated, I'm a grown adult and can't even make my own style choices because ""his roof his rules""

It's manipulative bullshit and it makes me feel so fucking helpless

I wanna be a girl, and everyday something further beats in to my head I'm not and I never will be, I fucking hate this. I know I'm being dramatic, but my dysphoria gets worse by the day and knocks me down, and then something gives me euphoria, and I get kicked in the balls on my way up, every single fucking time.

I just wanna curl up in a little ball and pretend I'm in a coma."	"I'm sorry. I hope you can get out of there. And when he's old and he's lost you he can reflect on how he's behaved.
That sucks girl, you're not being dramatic, it sure hurts a lot. I can't get out for almost the same reason as you, in my case was having my legs and arms shaved so I can't give you any good advise, I just want you to know you're not alone, I support you and one day we'll be the  pretty girls we dream of, don't you give up girl, plz.
Sorry you had to deal with that...

Your dad is the one BEING the embarrassment... Not you
Are you able to move out? Sounds like a toxic atmosphere and you don't need that shit.
Don’t listen to anyone who is trying to put you down. Dysphoria and being judged by everyone is hard enough to deal with and most of us get stuck with transphobic parents which makes it so much harder. I know it’s really hard right now but instead of focusing on the negatives of your situation, try setting goals. Like saving up enough money to move out so you can go shopping for clothes you like and paint your nails how you like. You should be able to look how you feel. I have parents who are completely against me being trans too and constantly put me down for it so I know exactly how it feels. Don’t let them bring you down. They just don’t know any better
That's really shitty of him :(
I'm surprised he saw the nail polish with his head so far up his ass 🤔
So sorry for you dear, you're dad is a dick... and you can look forward to letting him know, he can either accept you, or fuck straight off forever as soon as you can move out.

You are valid, and deserve to be happy!!
Thats really horrible. Be safe. Maybe it's more safe to leave that living situation even if it's really difficult in the short term? X
I'm so sorry

Is there any way at all you can get away from him? Maybe like with another family member?

Why do people like that exist? And not only that, but to treat their own child like that? Sounds like HE'S the embarrassment, not just to you, but to people in general
His roof his rules, but its your fucking fingers you can do what you want with them
If you say you are a girl, then you are a girl. 

It gets better. I promise.
He’s abusive. You need to find safety and stability - away from him.
I'm sorry for you, the ""his roof is rule"" is really shitty... who you are won't change because of him! Ah, and you're not being dramatic, it's perfectly normal to be down, don't feel guilty!
Your father is homophobic af and probably has deep-seated latency issues all his own. 

When you move out, leave him a gay porn mag and tell him you hope he enjoys himself.
That sucks sweetie. Don’t worry you’ll be out of there soon enough and choose to live your own life.
I'm sorry you have to deal with that on top of everything else, remember you have nothing to be embarrassed about, your dad is expressing his own insecurities in an obviously toxic way. Don't listen to that bullshit, stay strong girl, u got this :)
If he thinks you embarrass him it means he cares more about what other people think than what you do, or even than he does. It means he's an empty and shallow arsehole who's opinion is irrelevant.
I understand. My dad did the same thing when I wanted to grow my hair out. He’d say things like “I don’t want you looking like a fag”. I’m sorry you’re now going through this. The only thing I can say is that it does get better. Especially once you have your own place in the future. If you need someone to talk to, you can DM me
Never forget to remind him of when he embarrasses you.
Don’t give up sweetie. That’s so shitty that your going thru that. No one in this world deserves that. Especially when all your doing is being yourself and trying to feel comfortable and happy. Owee I wish I could show you your worth. I promise you tho as long as you don’t let him win you will have an amazing life. He can’t control you forever. Get some friends who understand or find things to do to stay out of the house. I mean at least till you are able to get yourself out of there. All the best wishes in the world love.

This is a silly little clip but it rings true. Nothing is forever and the best retribution will be going on and being happy with or without him. I'm so sorry babes
That's awful, I'm sorry :(
Your dad has a problem . Do your thing an be happy . Hopefully in time your dad will apologise for being a fuckin dinosaur.
you are a girl no matter what anyone else says
I’m sorry. All I can say that might be helpful is find a good therapist online or in person. It helps to talk to people. It helps to get your thoughts sorted out and just to vent. If you ever want to dm me to just talk I’ll be happy to help in any way I can.
I'm sorry. I grew up in the 90s and there were lots of people of all genders and orientations who painted their nails. Last time I checked, nail polish doesn't have a gender or orientation! Sorry again that happened to you. It sucks when your parents are your bully.

You're not dramatic. You have the right to be angry. You have the right to be sad. You have the right to wear some fucking nail polish. You're a woman. It doesn't matter what anyone else says. 

Dont listen to your bigot father and his disgusting slurs. It doesnt affect your identity. That ass needs to grow up and realise you're the same person you have always been. Keep your chin up, theres a whole community here for you❤
I believe…

You already are a girl. 

That the sperm donor (doesn’t deserve a parental title) is an ass.

A fitting revenge is to stay just available enough that when he gets old… you will be the one to chose the home he goes into. See how he likes feeling powerless.
I had a friend go through this, it sucked. One thing I did was give them paint pens in the school day so they could paint their nails ne wash it off  before they got home
Oh my god that's horrible
i swear theres some quote like “If a father treats his child like shit for 18 years, that child will fight back with twice the amount of anger” or smthn
i probably butchered that, but all in all, kick his ass
“My body, my rules.”
Yeah for real who says that to their own kid wtf, pathetic.
The pandemic has fucked my ability to move rn I live in Kansas where minimum wage is$7.25
Kansas minimum wage would like to have a word with you
Nah, all of my family is transphobic, super religious
Nah fuck this. “My roof my rules” has only ever been used to dominate children into thinking they have no autonomy.

This archaic mindset has got to end
And the fucked part is, he's right, if he wanted to kick me out for it he totally could, so I can't do anything lol
I'm trying
Just yesterday, someone on this sub tried to kill themself. 

You think this shit is just triggering lefties, but it's not, when someone dies. It'll be your fault.
Sure, dm me a p.o. box
Unhelpful tbh
🤙
It's not entitlement, its a basic control over how I look. A right to fucking act the way I want to act without being abused
Aye you prick I saw what you typed a second ago get out of here if your pulling that shit. To anyone wondering he edited his comment it was absolutely disgusting what he typed a second ago.
I hope that was funny to you
Damn another one, what are with these law bar troglodytes
Yea, and he says it's to stop me from getting bullied, you don't stop someone from being bullied, by bullying them.
The pandemic has raised the price of rent around here so high that's not an option, do you really have nothing better to do?
Did that look kinda real?
We've squared up before and I just haven't actually done anything bc he's like 3 times my size 5 times my strength and I like my teeth💀
Sadly not how that works, kids have zero autonomy until they move out, even if they're grown ass adults
Too many desperately fragile parents....
Damn what?!? That’s federal minimum wage, that’s disgustingly low. I’m sorry I hope things get better.
Yeah I thought this sort of thing could be a problem (trust me I've been there/kind of still). Have you got friends or anyone else you could move in with?
Seriously. By saying this they try to make us obsequious. It's like Parent don't want their childrens to explore themselves
Unfortunately, you might have to endure that stuff for a bit until you can move on. Having to hide your true self is one of the worst feelings there is, and it is absolute hell on your mental state. Work your best towards getting out of the situation and try to seek affirming spaces whenever possible.
Hah lol I wish it worked like that tho

My mom treated me like that when I was young, too. I left home at 19 and never looked back. I hope you can have the same strength and courage as I did. I'm 37 now with kids of my own and I haven't spoken to my awful mother in years. You will be where I am someday (without kids if you don't want em of course) and it's gonna be great!

Yeah, it's you're employer saying, if I could pay you less, I would but it's illegal.
No, I lost touch with everyone during the pandemic, I'll be fine, I'll make it work, it's just tough :)
The truth is that trans people are the genders they say they are and science says this too, grow the fuck up and get a life bitchboy
They make me pay rent, but want a control over the way I look, something's gotta change, but like you said, you're just here to epicly own woke sjw libtards, just please, go find something better to do.
Ya I shouldn’t get that heated but I still just don’t understand it. We have outgrown any logical or physical restraints, we can get surgery or Medicine to help correct our bodies.

I make 19 dollars in hour and am capable of making tips in addition to that and I’m still in high school. I think it’s insane they can pay you that little.

Yup, it's fucked up. It's depressing too bc it's not like you can give them an ultimatum, bc everyone needs the money so you're completely replaceable.

Can gender dysphoria manifest in apathy?	My whole life I’ve just been very apathetic about myself. I never bothered finding clothes I really liked because I knew I wouldn’t like myself in them. Something just felt so gross, so disconnected. I never put effort into my appearance because I knew that, for reasons I couldn’t pinpoint, I would never look good. I realized I might be trans because of gender euphoria, and I assumed I was non-dysphoric, that gender dysphoria was just something I’d never gotten. Looking back though I’m wondering if maybe I did experience dysphoria in the form of that weird, uncomfortable feeling I had growing up? Is that a thing, or am I grasping at straws?	"Yes, absolutely it can! That's why ""denial beards"" are so common for MtF's. We just...don't care. Our male bodies are gross and boring.   

I didn't start to truly care about my body until I realized I was trans. And then I started losing weight, shaving, using face creams and skin care products, etc.  

Totally apathetic about myself prior to it all.
Absolutely yes. One of my clues was realizing my wardrobe consisted of three pairs of jeans and a couple dozen t-shirts, cause it's an easy outfit and I never put much thought into how I dress.

I also reverted to the comfortable option in nearly every life decision - finally I'm working to improve my life now that I realize who I am.
I felt the same way myself. My wardrobe consisted of years-old worn out clothes I got as gifts- never bothered to shop for myself until something was completely falling to pieces, never tried to develop any sort of style. I just threw on whatever was at hand.

Even worse, I went through a few long periods where I didn't exercise, or shave, or shower, or even brush my teeth regularly because I just *could not care* about my body. After coming out I've finally started taking care of myself again. I don't know if I'll be able to make up for all those years of neglect but I'm finally motivated to try.
The words gross and disconnected and uncomfortable could be about dysphoria.

I chased euphoria and have tried many things.I needed them all. But now being without any of them again I become so desperate again AS I WAS BEFORE! That's when I understand it was not depression for past 30 years.
100% you are hitting the nail on the head. For the longest time I didn't care about my health I didn't care about my job I didn't care about my education that much. I didn't really care about how I looked. However at least two or three times a day I would just wish that I could start over life as a girl. Once I accepted that I was trans that all went away and suddenly I did care about how I looked I wanted to get into the gym I didn't want to smoke anymore I didn't want to do anything I wanted to care about my body because I was about to craft my body into what I dreamed it could be
This is very similar to my experience honestly so, I definitely think its possible!
Nah, you're not grasping at straws and this is super common, especially among people who only find out they're trans in their twenties or later.

At 23 I was still wearing hoodies my mom had bought for me in high-school because I just couldn't bring myself to care about my appearance past not wanting to stand out negatively. 

To me my egg-cracking was definitely accompanied by a very strong realization of ""Wait, it's actually kind of fucked up how little I care about everything and now that I do care, holy shit, wtf am I doing with my life?!?""
i think yes, you experienced gender dysphoria but not in the typical way, but i have also experienced it like yours, you see clothes you like but wasn’t bothered because u felt u wouldn’t look good in them, knowing it would make u dysphoric if u bought them and u didn’t feel as if u passed or looked good in them
I started dressing nice and working out once I came out. It was like suddenly my body was worth living in and taking care of if it meant getting closer to feeling right
Totally.
I now realize before realizing I was trans I was never ever content with the way I looked even when getting dressed up. It was always “just ok” and such. If u saw myself in the mirror it was “terrible” or “ok”.
Now I actually get happy seeing how handsome I look, I sometimes even feel like damn narcissus since I love the person I see in the mirror lol
It can, and I have personal experience ongoing with that effect.

I can't care enough to buy clothes, because I won't like how they look in my body. My sister herself also told me ""Your room is depressing, it looks dead."" 

Whenever customization options are given to me, I never use them. There's a day when you can wear whatever in school? Guess who is walking in uniform regardless?
God this was me exactly. Coming out was amazing like, oh shit I'm finally able to give a fuck about my appearance and hygiene etc because there is an ideal I can actually imagine attaining. The egg apathy is real and it suuuuucked.
i mean have you tried experimenting a little bit? i didnt realize i was trans until a group of girls held me down and put makeup and a dress on me. I thought i hated it then looked in a mirror
Mm hmm. I never liked shopping. Some of the clothes I'd wear regularly I'd had for 20+ years. I'd have 3 pairs of the same jeans and if they ever wore out if just buy a new exact pair to replace it with. I bragged about how little I spent on clothes. Clothing was just a way to cover my body and blend in. Nothing more nothing less.
oh my god reading the replies have made me realise some things wow
It is like you are describing my issues exactly.

My dysphoria was like a deep rooted indifference to myself.i neglected my health until I weighed 305 lbs.

I have since found so much euphoria in the progress I have made this year. I am on HRT and I have lost 65 lbs.

I love my skin and my growing lips and how I don't stink any longer.

Figuring out who I was is the best thing to ever happen to me.
Can totally relate! I always had my hair in a lazy ponytail, maybe a braid or something and whenever I found nice clothes I'd like how *the clothes* looked rather than how *I* looked in the clothes. 

Had my sister cut my hair down from about shoulder length to how youtuber Jammiedodger (also a trans man) has his and now I like how it looks *on me.* I'm wearing shirts in bold print because I like them and how they look *on me.* It feels so much better.
Holy poop lol this is totally me and didn't realize it till your post lol
I think it’s definitely a thing. I struggle with just existing and doing anything. I’m a brand new pre-everything trans guy. 

For most of my life I have been a caretaker and neglecting myself and my needs. I just didn’t have the energy or whatever you wanna call it. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for ages. I struggle with my weight, I forget to eat, I wear the same outfit more than once. My wardrobe is basically the same outfit x6… and a few pajamas that I basically live in…
I have makeup that I want to wear, and when I do wear it, I feel better for a while. But then I go back to feeling like I’m slogging through mud every single hour of every day. Apathy is real.

I’m actually feeling a bit better now that I know why I have been feeling this way for so long. I don’t even remember what finally shattered the boulder that had been crushing me without my even knowing it was there. I feel lighter, happier and I feel a sense of peace. However, I’m also dealing with fear and anxiety over coming out to my family, transitioning and the now almost insurmountable fear of not finding a partner because of my body not being cis.

I’m actually going to be seeking therapy, with a therapist who specializes on working with trans people, so that I can deal with and process my feelings and issues.

But! I’m feeling optimistic about my future too.

Good luck and stay safe! I love all of you, my sibs from other cribs!
Peace! Luc
It definitely has in the past for me! For much of my college career I could not be bothered to wear anything but sweatpants and what I now know to be a dysphoria hoodie lmfao
Same here actually. I don't care much for my style or anything. It's just boring and my body feels like a tool for everyday life anyway so why bother? The only exception is my hair. Im growing it out, i think you can guess why, so i like to take care of it to have it soft and healthy looking. But when i think about female clothing oh god. There are so many combinations and everything. Really wanna try stuff out and find a cool and beautiful style. Well one day I hope...
What you are calling apathy may be dissociation/depersonalisation and yes it very much can be a type of dysphoria - this article really helped when I was questioning: https://genderanalysis.net/2017/06/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized/
Definitely a thing. 
Definitely my experience. I was not engaged with myself. Now that I'm transitioning I get to discover my body for the first time since the wrong puberty started.
Welcome to what I had for 33 years! Complete apathy towards my appearance and zero desire for maintenance work like the dentist.
yes! i personally had this happen too!
Yes. That's what I had.
Yes it can. That’s how it manifested for me but it was apathy in everything not just my appearance. I never cared about the clothes I wore or how I looked. I always just felt I would always be disgusting because that’s how I felt being a boy. I didn’t realize this until a day that I accomplished a huge goal of mine and instead of feeling happy or even sad, I felt nothing. No emotion. I was just there. That’s when I had to ask myself why and began unraveling my true feelings instead of ignoring them. I never felt the “typical” dysphoria because I just ignored it and developed apathy as a coping mechanism. It could be very likely that you’ve also done the same
Yes
I was pretty similar pre-discovery; basically just no feelings.
Dissociative Gender Dysphoria is something I learnt about a couple of months ago. I remember experiencing it a lot and never wanting to think about or connect with my body. This post sounds a bit like the thoughts I was having during that time. 
To answer your post, I definitely think you are having gender dysphoria of sorts
This thread is making me learn so much about myself!

I never went to the dentist, never flossed, only got a haircut when absolutely necessary, wore same bland shoes everyday, two pairs of the same jeans, never got excited about buying clothes, I could go on..
I’m so glad you asked! I totally relate to a lot of these
Yes i explained it to my therapist as, I'm playing a video game, I am making the choices but the ""character"" is not me I didn't get to chose the character and the default settings doesn't match me. I'm looking at someone else's life. (I do have a bit of actual dysphoria) but mostly i just exist and don't get exited over my life.
That’s how it was for me. I got very numb and dissociative around the 6th grade when all the kids split in to boys and girls. It wasn’t until I was about 20 I even came across the possibility of being trans. After a few months of hormones I finally started to be able to feel present and learn to connect with the world around me.
Some of these can be depersonalization-derealization symptoms, it's a kind of dissociation that some trans people have before they transition and it can take the form of not being able to envision or care about a future for yourself. It can feel like a lack of purpose or meaning, as in you can consider these things but you don't feel them resonate for you or motivate you at all - it just doesn't feel like there's any reason to care. Yes, this can be one of the ways that dysphoria expresses itself, and I wasn't aware that this was part of my dysphoria until I started transitioning and felt it going away for the first time. I didn't know transitioning would also come with being able to care about the world and myself, but for me it did.
When I was 19 I moved 3000 miles away from my family. In that time (without realizing what it meant) I began to spend hours doing my make up, picking out outfits, and investing in my appearance. 

I moved back at 21 for personal reasons. All of that  went out the window. I grew a beard, worked out like crazy, and stopped dressing up. I didn't realize until 7 years later that I had left who I was behind and adapted to this new me as a defense. I was protecting me by hiding. That manifested in a total apathy for my appearance. I didn't by any new clothes, wore my shoes down to the point my feet fell through. I just didn't care. 

Point being apathy is the epitome of avoiding your feelings.
Yes, mine did, 10000000000%. I got recognizable dysphoria after I began transitioning, which is mostly gone now. :)
Definitely, it's very common even
Yes, I was very apathetic before I realized I was trans and it went away even more once I started transitioning
100%. The thought never really occurred to me that I could wear anything besides jeans and a cheap, baggy t-shirt until I was in college.

For context, I’m AFAB, didn’t realize I was trans until, coincidentally, college.
Definitely. I never cared about my appearance, health, life in general until I started transitioning. I was never super unhappy or depressed just always incredibly apathetic toward basically everything. Now I care. I've developed my style, work on skin care, workout, and even style my hair in the morning. I feel a lot more sure of myself and that has diminished the apathy.
I have always been indifferent about the clothes I wear. It was until I explored the chances of being trans that I enjoyed not only shopping but testing out how Id look in certain clothes. I was living my live in a grey scale world and by exploring who I was I saw color being reintroduced.
I feel allot of apathy towards my boymode and always have. I hated shopping for clothes and shoes so much as a kid and would do anything to avoid it including wearing clothes that were much too small trying to get out of shopping. 

I hate it still but it’s more because it makes me so sad that I still have to live in boymode. I get dissociated and have anxiety/panic attacks and have to go out to the car. Usually end up in tears. 

When I can shop for femme clothing though it’s so much fun. Although at the moment that is just bras and stuff of the like it really brings me so much joy and fun. 

I’d say yes it can manifest as apathy.
It absolutely can. I wouldn't say it makes sense to jump to dysphoria as a potential explanation for general apathy without any other reason to believe you're trans, but in context it's certainly possible to go ""yep that was dysphoria.""

Apathy was the main way mine manifested, personally. My therapist was very confused why I was so heavily dissociated at all times with seemingly no root cause. But when I came out as trans and started transitioning, the years of apathy just went up in smoke, and everything felt real and meaningful to me for honestly the first time.
Alternate to the denial beard, lots of us worked out a bunch before realizing that muscles weren't the answer either. That's what I did because my facial hair's patchy af
Ok, thank you! Obviously I don’t wish the feelings I had/have on anyone but it’s nice not to be alone in a way.
I'm more MtX, but I recently came to a revelation about my denial beard of 9 years.

Whenever I was clean-shaven, my mother would tell me how handsome I was. I never liked that word for me, handsome. That word has a particular connotation that just never felt right for me, though I couldn't put my finger on why. So I had some form of facial hair every moment that I could just to avoid that specific compliment. I tried many different styles over the years. None of them really made me happy, but at least I didn't get called handsome too often. I thought that it was just the trope of being embarrassed to be complimented by one's mother, but turns out it was much deeper than that.

Thankfully, since coming out, I've been able to be free of facial hair *and* being called handsome by those close to me.
Well that explains a fuckin lot for me like I struggled for a while with even brushing my teeth and when puberty hit I didn’t properly clean my face or shave, I just didn’t feel like doing it and as I got older it got embarrassing that I didn’t have the skill but I also don’t want anyone seeing me do any self care no one would say anything but even just getting seen shaving my face makes me uncomfortable and I’ve almost never cared about how I look as a result
I had the apathy mustache.
I always hated calling it the denial beard. I wasn't denying anything, I just didn't care. It was a depresso beard.
Ya I'm the few months before my egg broke I grew an apathy beard. Literally couldn't have been bothered to shave for over a month. It wasn't a denial beard because it wasn't too compensate for feelings I was having I just quit literally couldn't give a shit.
holy i never even thought about that... i legit went through all of that. denial beard, not caring and it sucked because i wanted too but felt too gross in my male body..
I went through the denial beard phase because I just didn't want to shave, but then I realized I was gonna need to start putting pomade and shit in it and the moment that happened I shaved it off. From there I went a while shaving every few weeks or so, so I still had facial hair normally but it wasn't long enough to where I had to take care of it. Then I realized I was trans and since then I shave every time I leave the house
All of this and it's very much too late for much of the damage I've done :(
Same
For me it's very similar - The fact that I'm apathetic about most of my body. But even after realizing I'm Trans I still don't do anything at all, because I struggle really hard with executive dysfunction. It's not like I don't do my household or stuff like that - I'm quiet active in these kind of things - but I don't start doing something about dysphoria and stuff.

It's really frustrating, but I literally don't know what to do, even after I got so many different advices and support from others. I can't even get myelf out to look for a gender therapist.
YES!! I used to have a huge beard. I always hated different parts of my body but always just attributed it to diet/fitness culture pushing a body image that I never fit. When I was younger I was always short and liked that but didn't like my shoulders and couldn't figure out why. I wasn't fat but I had some fat on my body, you know like a healthy person should, but hated my mid section. This all continued until like 7 or 8 months ago when it hit me that I don't like my shoulders due to the proportions to my hips and I don't like my mid section because of the same reason it was always that my body didn't have wide hips or curves but in my cishet head space I couldn't figure that out.
This has explained so much about myself that I never knew
oh shit thats like all my clothes
Oh, **oh**, *oh no*.
Yeah, that was definitely me. Black t-shirt, jeans, sneakers. My entire wardrobe for 15 years. I feel seen.
Mine is black gym shorts or jeans, and about 12 different black tshirts and a couple different flannels when it gets cold. O o o o o o o f
I have more shirts than pants and even then they're all unisex. Closest I can get to women's clothing without actually buying women's clothing
Omfg, you get it. You understand. I was the same way, I just didn’t take care of myself. I wouldn’t brush my hair because I just didn’t care, it was like I didn’t see my body as *mine* so I didn’t take care of myself. My hair got so tangled, to the point where when I went to the salon, they decided they couldn’t salvage it and cut it short. Crazy how this stuff starts to make sense after you come out to yourself.
Yeeeepp I think that, pre-realization, I bought fewer than 10 pieces of clothing for myself. All gifts was my wardrobe
Not me questioning if smoking is becoming more of a hindrance now that I'm coming to accept myself 🤔🤨

Also yes, the amount of time I find myself daydreaming back to middle/high school and living as the trans femme I am is astonishing
Thanks. Sorry to hear you had this experience though, it sucks lmao
This type of thing is heartbreaking. I'm going into my late 30's, and you're describing a big chunk of my life that I'll never get back. :-(

It sucks to think that other people got to enjoy vibing with their own gender, and doing the things they wanted to do, while my brain was busy developing coping mechanisms and normalizing dissatisfaction and dissociation.
This fucking nails it for me too yea, such a gut wrenching realization that I've been a zombie for the last 8 years until coming out and starting hormones.
I swear I can't exercise during the day. It's like I have no energy. Kinda think it might be because I don't want to invest in a body that will never look right no matter how hard I were to exercise. Plus then I'd have to be observed by others as male, which I also think is a major energy drain.
I did both ugh
Mine barely grows so I’ve considered getting it lasered off since I don’t even want to put in the effort to shave regularly
GAWWWWDDD reading these comments was so validating to my experience.
Yeah that's me. Just about 10 years ago and getting validation due to being a metalhead and wearing a big beard is considered cool. I didn't hate my beard but I didn't exactly decide to have one either and now I wish I could shave it off without raising questions (got a huge babyface underneath so I'd look like a big 12yo boy lol).
Same
I never realized how relatable this was 😄 
I'm hoping to trade most of my stuff with a transmasc person at some gender-afferming clothing swap sometime.
Yea it sucks. I just got into doing a skin and hair care routine and I've figured out my style though, so it did get better!
Honestly, the only thing we can really do is be more visible for the younger generations so they can be more educated and hopefully find themselves sooner. 😔
Unfortunately we can be the same 😅 swap jeans for baggy walking trousers and this is my wardrobe too"	wjojr9	trans	597	0.99	2022-08-09 00:10:48
Are trans women who haven't transitioned or don't plan to transition valid?	"Sorry this post is really bad but so many people can't seem to agree

Edit: sorry if this post seems invalidating, im experiencing some dysphoria/ confusion and trying to clear things up"	"It's okay to be confused. I haven't starting transitioning yet either. Yes you are valid!
I just want to thank you for this. It’s a question I’ve been wanting to ask myself (I, for a variety of reasons, an probably not going to ever transition, and always wondered if just “knowing” I’m trans is valid and enough), and seeing this post, and also all the responses, has really helped. So, again, thanks. This has basically made my year.
Yes, gender is how you see yourself in spite of what the outside looks like or how you present.

Edit add: it would be like saying someone who’s in the closet isn’t valid…
Beware the snap back OP. I figured out I was trans around age 13, but knew that there wasn't reasonable recourse at that time. I taught myself to tolerate my body and use it to my professional advantage, white male privilege. 

Well it worked. I spent 23 years building a life and excelling in a successful well paying career and when I turned 35, my Dysphoria came back so fast and hard that I'm now 6 month into hrt wishing I didn't spend 20 years pretending to be happy.

I wouldn't say I regret it. I have a fantastic life, but I will always wonder what could have been if the world had been half as tolerant then as it is now.
Yes. Trans women are women. Transmedicalists be damned
Why wouldn't they be?
YES
I feel that the definition of transitioning depends on the person, some of us want to change things medically, some of us want to change how we dress, some of us want to change how we are referred to, and there are any number of other things that could be changed.  You are free to define your own transition, and regardless of if you do all these things, some of these things, or none of these things, you are valid and welcome in this community.
100% valid.
YES!! 💜🙌🎉
Even though I feel like it's maybe quite unique - this article really helped me in coming terms with my transness: https://medium.com/@jencoates/i-am-a-transwoman-i-am-in-the-closet-i-am-not-coming-out-4c2dd1907e42

I think it does challenge what I think we might assume as  a typical trans experience and reasserts that you can be trans without transitioning. The important thing is that you trust yourself and who you are - that doesn't require medical transition or even coming out to anyone. Once you know who you are you can decide what you want to do to feel comfortable with yourself.
I think the only people who believe that are transmedicalists. While I do believe HRT will help you feel more comfortable with your body, trying to say that it’s required is a pretty bad take. Especially when there’s been cases where people detransition and become ferociously anti-trans and blame them for going on HRT which is one reason why the trans community is so laxed about this. What’s the other reason you might ask? It’s hard as fuck to get HRT lmao
absolutely. fuck transmedicalists. fuck truscum. transitioning isn’t as black and white as it’s sometimes made out to be. some trans people can’t transition in the medical sense due to health complications. some trans people may not be ready to transition yet. some trans people may never want to transition and may be happy with who they are and that’s 100% valid.

feeling comfortable with yourself, your identity, and your body is whats most important
I often feel the same myself I am amab but have discovered that I really don't feel like either and have started identifying with non binary and want to start dressing more neutral and don't really know what that entails. So I've defaulted to switching to panties carrying on with my jeans and t shirts but also wear bralletes occasionally and feel alot happier and better about myself but am often told because I have no plans to shave my beard because I like it then I'm not really nb or trans questioning and have been harassed quite a bit on this but always agreed with you are whatever you identify as even if for whatever reason you cannot transition don't know how or can't for safety reasons. But lately with how toxic the gay and trans community is where I live it's been difficult trying to remain positive when being rejected by the very people you'd think would understand the most.
I mean, I still think those who aren't doing bottom surgery or hormones and don't plan to are still women. For example, I'm not on hormones currently and don't plan on bottom surgery cause that shit way too rich for my blood. Am I still a woman? Yes, yes I am.

It's honestly a label thing really, if they go by she/her and want to present as female or be addressed as such, that is what they are and should be referred to as even if there presentation doesn't fit societal standards. Same for trans men, yall just do yall.
Well, transition means different things for different people.

There is social transition which is simply being who you are socially.

There is medical transition which is just modifying physical attributes about yourself through various means.

There is no one size fits all for medical transition where a lot of people don’t fully grasp..

Medical transition isn’t always even medical transition..

Things such as laser hair removal or waxing or eating a different way which has more minor effects but still some subtle effects could be part of someone’s “medical transition”

The idea of pharmaceutical estrogen & spiro & serious surgeries being considered the only thing for “medical transition” is a product of trans people thinking other trans people feel just like they do.

We are all different & just because you don’t do a full “medical transition” with surgeries & pharmaceutical hormones & t blockers doesn’t mean you aren’t valid & also doesn’t mean you don’t do anything at all, you just might approach things differently than the popular sect of trans transition approach.
I don't feel valid. I don't know if I'm going to transition. I want to.
Absolutely.  Gender is part of who you are. It has nothing to do with your body or how you choose to present yourself to the world.
Trans women are trans women regardless of whether they transition.
Yeah they’re just sad
You are valid, transitined or not.
You're not harming anyone; Your quest for happiness, is , and will be valid.
yes!!
Yes!!!
Absolutely.
if you feel like you're trans, and identify with your real gender, then you're trans. anything else is just extra sidequests with unlockable cosmetics
Yes! Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!
Absolutely! Every trans women is valid, no matter what
Definitely
Yes. Many trans people can't transition, be it because of where they live, because of family, because of money, even because of genes. But the important thing is how you feel on the inside, not how you look on the outside.
I think I wanna be a girl too but this is what I’ve been wondering too…
of course! i haven’t transitioned at all yet either :(
Yes. Yes they are.
Yes
*slams hand on table* 

#WOMAN IS WOMAN
Of course. Nobody can tell you what your identity is. That's yours to decide alone.

That being said, I'm always curious to hear about why people choose not to transition so I figure this would be a good place to ask. 

I understand that for some, they can't because it wouldn't be safe in their current situation, or for others that it's not medically viable. But what I'm curious about is whether there are other reasons than those two not to medically transition.
The question not being addressed is? Valid? Baby you and we are all valid, in my journey, asking if you are valid is almost a trigger.  Are you a trans woman? Surgery, HrT, it's all personal...are you trans? If so, surgery may not matter. It's difficult sometimes being yourself, but I believe in you......go be the authentic YOU
What is valid and what is not valid should not be of any concern to anyone. This is your identity and not anyone else's so I don't think you should try to go through the mental gymnastics to try to understand their opinion when they don't get to have an opinion on your identity. You be you and if you say you are a woman then you are a woman.
Yes!

Technically anyone who doesn’t fit under the label of cisgender is transgender, an example would be that I am transgender since I identify as nonbinary. I hope this helps! :)
I would say so yes. When I hear someone say others are valid it means really “there is no one right way to be trans”. I think it’s more to be trans than just to say you are because every trans person goes though a lot of pain and anguish to figure out they are trans. 

My stance is if someone has accepted they are trans then they are trans no matter what, until they say they aren’t. I just get annoyed when some cis people say your gender is simply what you say. This invalidates trans people who have worked hard to find themselves and are still working at it. It also leads to some cis people saying something along the lines of “you are the gender you say you are so just be happy with how you were born, it doesn’t matter” as a way of gaslighting people to not transition.
Identity has everything to do with how you see yourself. If you see yourself as perfect, then you are perfect.
Hell yeah! Trans people existed long before hormones were available.
You are valid.

There's no more explanation or context needed.
Well, I feel invalidating, having waited over 2 years in the norwegian health system just to coming to the council which may give me estrogen. And I am 1/2 year from it still, when I am accepted to looking woman enough by it, I will have to wait 1 1/2 year. 


I think I will just order some online by this point. F
And it feels very invalidating indeed
No one is invalid. Especially not you.
Yes, definatley. Some people feel ok with their bodies and just want a social transition (she/her pronouns and maybe a different name), and that´s valid.

There are also lots of circumstances that makes someone not want to transition at all.

Safety concerns and transphobia around them, medical issues or no access to safe medical care, age restrictions, job and family situations, fear of change in general and having doubts,... Or maybe it just doesn´t fit into your life at the moment for some reason. That´s not uncommon. People sometimes feel like ""if I am really trans, I need to drop everything and do this right now, or else I´m not valid enough"", but that´s not reality. I waited for years to have top surgery since I didn´t want to miss over a month of school for it, so I only did it after graduating.
Yes. I haven't started transitioning yet and I'm valid. I haven't started asking people to use my pronouns yet (or even picked a name) because I understand many people have trouble understanding trans people even post-transition and I'm trying to make it a bit easier for them (and myself by extension), but not everyone has to do things my way and their choices are valid too.
You’re valid as long as you’re you, transitioned or not, so to answer your question, yes of course they are, hope this helps
YES!  Changing your presentation is independent of who you are.  Gender is not a performance, contrary to the shitbags who keep claiming it is.
being trans doesn't mean you have to transition at all. Many won't. For various different reasons.

trans != transition,
trans == transgender

and all it means is that your gender doesn't match your sex.
Obviously. Medical transitioning is not required. Some people can't even socially transition because of living in a transphobic enviroment. The only requirement to be trans is to have a gender that doesn't match your assigned gender at birth.
Trans is a thing you either are or aren't. It is not dependant on any outside factors. You can present as your agab for your whole life and you'll still be trans. 
Think of it like diabetes. Is a diabetic who doesn't take their insulin still a diabetic?
Yes yes yes. Only you get to decide how you identify.
Even tho I'm planning to transition and all, but I think that your body and your body appearance are not related, honey you are 100% valid even if you don't want to get HRT or anything
Or course you are, no questions asked lol
Yes.  I would caution however that I tried hard in what I thought was good faith to live a good life without transition and nah I would never recommend it.  If I could get the years back I would make transition my first priority.
duh trans women and trans men are men and women (regardless of medic intervention)
Absolutely. I can’t transition rn as a result of my age but there is a plethora of reasons as to why someone wouldn’t transition.
Hella valid. You’re a woman just the same, you don’t need to do anything you don’t want to.
Very much so. I was trans before I started transitioning... that's why I started transitioning 😉
I should be able to wear a dress, makeup, decide my pronouns and titles but my dysphoria gates these things behind an ilogical anxiety that the features of body are in opposition to how I want to live my life.  

Dysphoria gets in the way of being trans, if you don't have dysphoria you are free live as the gender that feels right to you without worrying about your body.
I would say that if you haven’t and plan to yes, but if you don’t plan to, it’s going to be hard to live in society, such as going to the restroom or having others take you seriously. That in itself is very invalidating.
Yes, even if you never transition, you're perfectly valid. The trans in transgender does NOT mean transition, there is no obligation to transition, particularly medically
Yes, you don’t need to transition to be a gender, your gender is what you want it to be and weather or not you fit the criteria someone else decides it should be is on them not you. Best wishes.
You mean like doesn't plan to transition at all? Even socially?
How one decides to transition is not indicative of their gender
Hella valid. You’re a woman just the same, you don’t need to do anything you don’t want to.
[removed]
Yes!

If you feel like you are a woman, you are a woman. Doesn’t matter what other people thing. You’re valid.
   Google up the philosophy the ""Ship of Theseus"", I view this as a sort of relevant example of this in a biological sense.

   If you were to cut off your arm & get it replaced, you'd still be you. If you were to lose your legs & replace those, you're still you. You could even lose something as vital as your heart, you're still you. What's the one thing you can't replace? Your brain (yet); your mind is your personality. Therefore, if mentally you are another gender & you feel you are, it does not matter what your body looks like, your mind speaks who you are. If someone has not gone through a medical transition yet (myself) or even decides not to, that makes them no less valid than any other trans, fluid, non-binary, or any example one may be, you are you & you should be respected.
Yeh
Thank you!
Yeah, you are valid. The thought of retrospectively declaring that I 'wasn't valid' 5 months ago and then was valid the day I came out just seems utterly bizarre.

The whole point is supposed to be that neither your biology nor how you dress determine whether you're a man/woman, so I'm not sure how taking HRT/presenting femme would make me any more 'valid' than you
I'm glad I could help. I've realised that there are a few types of people when it comes to trans folks. There's the people who try to be as validating and accepting as possible, and then the people who aren't. There's not much in-between.
I would like to transition early into my adulthood but right now and for the next few years at least it simply isn't an option; I'm worried that I will wait too long to transition and then there will be too many things to change that will cause more dysphoria.
right there with you. I knew i was transgender when i was a teen but was raised in a Christian household, where being anything other then a straight white boy was a sin, so i buried my feelings until i was about 25. At which point i started falling apart. i didn't start HRT until 30. its one of my biggest regrets. why must the world be so shitty to us?
I’ve spent years not really knowing anything was possible, just daydreaming about it.
Transmedicalism is like when they live long enough to become the villain.

Fuck a truscum why don’t they try internalizing empathy?? Being trans is hard enough we don’t need transphobia coming from within the community too….
I'm just curious/ trying to see if I would be considered trans
It's definitely hard to accept but I think the biggest part of being trans is learning to accept yourself and treating yourself how you want others to treat you
Thank you! This is really good advice
I think it's a pretty frequent thought process
100%. Transition not a prerequisite for validation.
Honestly I think that's a great summary of my trans-ness. I can treat everyone else how they want to be but when it's myself I can't get past some obscure issue.
It may be tougher in cis society, but it absolutely does not mean people who don’t transition can’t be trans.
>since I do not want to be banned from this subreddit

Very wise, i'll just remove your comment instead;)
I dont think there is a too long. There are some things that HRT cannot change, but very few things have no solution. If I had any advice for someone who wants to consciously choose to wait, it is to build your life around a future where you might transition. 

Target a career in a tolerant industry such as software engineering. There are others but I dont have a list.

Try to get a college education and try to do it in a tolerant place. College is one of the easiest times to relocate your life if you have to.

Don't keep it a secret from any significant other you think you will want to spend your life with. It is better to spend your life with someone who will accept your before and after.

Do not waste your time and emotions on trying to maintain relationships with people who will never accept you as the person you may choose to be.

Keep yourself healthy and fit. It is okay if you build muscle, it will melt away if your chose to transition. It is a lot harder to get back into shape if you let yourself go because you do not like your body.

We all choose our own path, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Just remember to always focus on being happy. Everything in life is harder when you are not personally happy. No one will ever be able to make you happy. Only you can do that.
Of course you would.
For sure! And take in mind that that is such a hard thing to do! I've spent years relying on other people loving me rather than loving myself, and that's no way to live. I've come out to a few people but am still mostly in the closet and have barely begun my transition. But since I've realised I'm trans I'm actually starting to like who I am - it's not perfect but that change alone is huge.
I wish I could see what being referred to as a girl would be like without asking them to refer to me as one. I saw your posts of your dresses and you look like a cute girl regardless ~
If they are considering themselves to be trans female, for instance, I see it’s necessary to look the part.
Sorry I'm late to reply, I appreciate you doing the lord's work
Wow not gonna lie reading this makes me feel sort of better about myself cuz I've basically been following every single step here but I've been having a bad time lately so been sort of beating myself up

I know this is for OP but thank u for this comment, this is some good advice to set yourself up for success in the future :)
Thank you!
Do what now? I don't think I've made any posts regarding dresses
Holy shit I clicked on a different profile think it was yours lmao
Oh okay, I was very confused for a second
Nah jk I just know what you look like 😈

what is your type of dysphoria?		"Ive got all 3 do i win!!!!
Mind and body. Society scares me too much to be myself
mainly Social and body with a hint of mind
If I am now deadhonest......
It's all 3
70% Mind, 10% Social, 20% Body (And 100% ""I don't feel disphoria right now so I must not be trans but I really want to be trans but maybe I'm making it up subconciously but aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"")
Mostly Mind, with body and social being secondary.
I feel like i have a tiny bit of the mind one since i dont like being angry and sometimes it make me feel terrible.

I could have the body one but i have body dysphoria since ive been overweight all my life and ive hated it so  maybe i dont feel discomfort about my body not looking at my preferred gender but i wont know as my body dysphoria might have make it impossible for me to tell.

Then again i dont think i have gender dysphoria but these two make it seem that i might have it, it just i dont know and i might not be able to detect it.
Body is definitely the prevalent one for me. With mind being a close second, and having almost no social dysphoria.
Pretty much body. I’ve felt unsatisfied with
how I looked for a long time and I hated my voice. Everything else is tolerable but then again my pain tolerance is VERY high from dealing with Bipolar II.
All three, but since starting hrt the third isn't so prevalent.
put a finger down challenge! me ✊😀✊
All of the above
Purely body for me. Mind a little bit sometimes but it’s really just the whole... facial hair and short hair and weird body and all that, y’know
Mostly mind with a solid mix of body too. the lack of social is what really held me back from transitioning for a long time.
All theee at the same time
Pretty sure I have all but mostly mind
Mind!!!!!
Body and Mind
i feel that been raised male has caused to have many male sensitivities and ways of approaching situations. however i am lucky enough to be surrounded by great female friends that are super supportive (even if some don't know, because they don't seem to need to be told) and they are diverse enough that make me feel less of an oddball. 

body is the worst for me, but i am trying to make myself accept my face for starters and finally see the woman on it. i don't like most about my body, but i need to get a personal trainer and start hormones to improve it before i will be able to accept. i also want smoother skin like my bff. 

the last i usually experience mainly with friends, because i am an idiot and i am not out to all of them. however they happen to include me fairly often to girl only night outs and they know i like girls (even one from the group) so yeah. due to nature of my field i am used to geek out about it, so when i used to be in the university i didn't feel i was pretending since playing the man is not necessary to be a programmer. after all there is a reason we call them programming socks.
i think i feel mainly body dysphoria and second is social, i dont feel a loy of dysphoria regarding my emotions and such even tho they dont align with my birth gender
I have social and body dysphoria
I don't mind presenting as a guy per se. Body dysphoria is definitely more of an issue but mind is really the thing. It's the emotions I have and how I tend to think more female than male.
Please I don't get the mind one, could someone explain me better?
I have social and body dysphoria tough.
All 3
Yes
mostly body and mind,, but social too :( so all three 😔
Body and mind
 Only the body one. I wouldn’t mind staying in my male body but I would rather have a female body and female clothes. I never really liked my body but I don't think it really has a link.  Not sure this is dysphoria but...
Body being the most, then a little behind that is social and then mind
Mostly mind and then closely followed by socially and then sometimes body kicking in
hard.
Mostly social and a little bit of body
All. The social one might not be as bad. I'm afraid to present as my preferred self in public but wow am I ever uncomfortable presenting as my agab.
Can someone give me an example of mind dysphoria? The definition is confusing me a tiny bit
Social dysphoria hits me hardest, followed by body dysphoria. Mind doesn't hit me so bad, I kinda already assume that my thoughts and feelings are masculine.
Mainly mind and social but there is some body too. :(
Can I just pick bulbasaur instead? They're good against the first three gyms at least, seems a little more useful, lol.
Social and body
mental, physical is a kind of 50/50, and social im not quite sure tbh... perhaps i am too newly hatched to know?
Mine is all body and a small bit of social
The day that my father gave me the ""Be a man"" talk was the day I really understood that I am in fact not a man.
Almost all social and body but not so much mind, since I'm out to almost everyone who rlly matters(except my parents ironically)
Trifecta
It's possible to be all three right?
Body thats mine and a tad of social
All three... It's horrible
Definitely a combination of Social and Body dysphoria. While I do have friends who recognize my identity, since I've been isolated from them I never really get affirmation because my parents refuse to use my name and pronouns. We love parents who really support us and definitely don't neglect their son's mental health!
Mostly social with a bit of body and mind. I have a mostly flat chest so I’m pretty ok with my body besides the lower bit. For my mind I just know I’m trans so I’m fine with it but mostly social bc I hate being seen as a girl
Body and mind, never had an issue with wearing pink frilly things as a kid but grew against them seeing only girls wearing them. I see clothes as expression, for comfort and for fun, I hope to one day pass as a man enough to wear dresses again
*Social 100%*
Mostly social for me
I think body and mind. Dressing as my wanted gender sucks too but  i think thats because my body doesnt suit it
wait so youre telling me that feeling bad because i have emotions and men arent supposed to have emotions so i cant possibly not be a girl is actually dysphoria not irrevocable proof of my cisness

^(shit)
Body? I guess? I don't know...
body and sometimes social 
i can get euphoria from all though
social and body, not necessarily mind, though
all of them....
Social and body here-- though body not nearly as much since top surgery.
I get all of these in varying degrees of misery
Bro, I had 3 strikes.
Mainly body.

I don't mind too much how people refer to me. I know who I am. You just look retarded and ignorant misgendering me.

I only mind if you deadname me because *nobody is supposed to know that name*
Where does horniness dysphoria fit into this?
I won the crossword!
All of the above...
All
Wait I'm confused about mind can someone explain In more detail?
all of them
Mind
Yes
Social and body.  As far as mind, I've definitely always thought like a woman, so no issues there.
I am all and above
I got 50% on all three
Social 100%
For me it's body. I get super uncomfortable looking at my body, I also get uncomfortable by the way I sound and look like sometimes.
All of the above. Help.
The answer is yes
Social and body 🥳
I’ve collected them all and put them infinity in the infinity dysphoria
I have all 3. Recently realized I was a trans man after 24 years being a ""cisgender woman"" and then spent 1 year being non binary but then realized this entire time that being a man made more sense because I already present masc but telling my friends and family that I'm a trans man is scary since I live in a deep red state of America and everyone is Christian, cisgender and very transphobic.
i experience social the most but body comes in at a close second
Social and body
Body and Mind, some Social
Social and body. My mind is pretty screwed up as well but that's due to anxiety and depression not dysphoria. In fact, my mind is quite naturally non-binary and served as the main  catalyst for me coming out to myself.

My main issue is my voice actually I think right now. I'm not sure if that falls under body or social.
Mind
Social and body for me! We do be struggling to survive in society with a fem body (ftm here)
All 🥺
Mostly 2 and 3 now only because I’ve forced myself to accept number 1 being stuck in it for so many years.
I don’t think I understand what the ‘mind’ category would concretely involve?
I've got all 3! Is there a prize?
I’m straight I don’t have these issues with being comfortable. Why who wants to hook up
Body is really intense for me, but the other two are there as well
Mostly body dysphoria and then mind dysphoria is second and social dysphoria is third
Mind and social
Like 70 percent body for me then more social than mind.
Mostly body with some social 😔
Body n social...
Most of the social is paranoia though... So mind?
social and body for sure
Social and body for me!
Congratulations!!! Your medal of discomfort is in the mail
.. yup
. Same
ABSOLUTELY
Look mom I won!
Me too.
Same
Same 😔👊
Yep. This right here. This one. Thats it. At the moment, anyhow. The numbers will be very different every few minutes.
I did not come here for a call out post
Well, you are trans if you think that you are trans.

But I also think dysphoria is not like, THE ultimate point that show that you are trans, for me it would be euphoria. 

Like for exemple I am nb and didn't have dysphoria some years ago, but once someone used Mister by mistake for me and it made me very happy 

When I started to wore a binder I couldn't stop smiling every time I looked at myself in the mirror (and still do) 

Wearing clothes found in the male section can also make me very happy and so is wearing clothes from the female section sometime 

When I found good neutral pronoun in my language I felt reaaally happy and content 

All that is euphoria and sign showing me that I was not cisgender
Same!
Lmao yuuuuuuuuup that's how it is.

Also I love your name dirtyslutpancake XD

<3

Hey, at least we aren't alone! :3 <3
Thank you! It's what I was feeling at the time."	l3ietx	trans	598	1.0	2021-01-23 19:20:36
can I be trans if I don't have dysphoria?		"I pretty much didn't have what most people call dysphoria until I realized I was trans. What tipped me off was the EUPHORIA of thinking of myself as a woman.
You can have dysphoria and not know it xD Like I was heavily dysphoric whole my life and not realized it. Assumed it was a ""cis"" thing.
Well I was thinking about transitioning from mtf and when I finally told someone, I was able to smile for the first time in a while.
Yes. Not having dysphoria is just a good thing, and you may still be trans. Although I thought I didn't have dysphoria until I started transitioning, then I finally recognized the dysphoria I felt in the past.
Imo u don't 'need' dysphoria, but there's no point if you don't experience euphoria while transitioning
Edit: also, sometimes you don't realize you have dysphoria in the moment, but looking back you do
It’s interesting and cool to read that others didn’t experience dysphoria as dysphoria at the time.  I was starting to wonder just how I’d missed so many signs for so long.  
So, yeah, I was not dysphoric for most of my adult life.  Just a lot of body hate.  Once I started to transition, I recognized that my body hate was dysphoria.
I don't really have body dysphoria (I'm non-binary, BTW).

I didn't think I had social dysphoria until people started correctly gendering me and using my new name. Then I realised I'd just become so accustomed to a 'normal', background level of dysphoria that I didn't even notice it. Until it wasn't there all the time.
My dysphoria came up a month or two after i started Hrt, so Yeah it's possible
Yes. Being trans has everything to do with seeking the euphoric feelings that align with your gender identity. You don’t have to feel bad in order to transition or to be trans. It helps in figuring your identity out, but not 100% necessary.
 (Post op + 5 years transitioned)
Being transgender isn't defined by dysphoria, its defined by euphoria (as far as I've heard). 

Think of it like this. You have one bike that feels perfectly fine with riding, yknow, no monumental feelings towards it one way or another. Then, for your birthday, you get a new bike that fits you MUCH better. The seat is more comfortable, handles in a better position to grip, etc etc. Would you rather ride the bike that was just okay, or the newer, much more comfortable one?

Maybe a strange example, but it seemed like a decent explanation to me
Oh sweetie when you experience euphoria then the dysphoria comes. The further and further you get in your transition the more intense you feel dysphoria.
Determine if you're trans by the feeling of euphoria. Dysphoria is not a requirement to be trans. It's often a symptom of it, yes, but not a requirement. Euphoria about gender is the best determining factor. If the idea of being a gender other than the one assigned at birth makes you happy, then you're likely trans. However, only YOU can declare and determine that. Uncertainty is okay, it's a part of the process. Just be you and it will work itself out

EDIT: Corrected Grammer and spelling
I didn’t have dysphoria .  I just completely ignored the existence of my body and did whatever I could not to be visible/seen without baggy clothing on while being totally miserable for like 20 years.  

Wait, what’s that, you say there’s a name for that….. oops.
the thing is we all experience being trans in a different way. You need don't necessarily need to be heavily distressed about your sex, but if there's a voice telling you that there is something going on, then you are probably trans as well.
If you feel a lot of euphoria around being the opposite gender, then there might actually be some mild dysphoria that you’re brushing off as something else.
Sometimes, dysphoria is more under the surface. We find ways to cope with our situation and we might not even be aware of it. Sometimes your brain has to bury things and finds other explanations just to get by. 

Dysphoria is not a requirement to be trans anyway. Focusing just on the dysphoria and not the positive aspects can make you really bitter and sad. Being transgender isn't some curse that you must suffer for.
If you don’t have dysphoria or uneasy about your birth sex how would you think you’re trans?
Duh, of course!
You can totally be trans without dysphoria, but also it's sometimes hard to identify. I didn't know what I was feeling for my entire life was actually dysphoria until I read [this](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/).

Euphoria from knowing the truth tells me more than my dysphoria. I figured everything out when my spouse was on a work trip, and when they got home I was acting so much happier than normal they were worried I had a brain tumor or something.

Well how about this: think about when you are in a group of just guys. Do you/would you feel that deep down you are one of them and that the idea of being a guy is very much you? 

Now for women/girls: In a group of just women/ girls do you or would you (take as much time as you need imaging this if you can’t get this or the men one in real life) Anyway, do you/ would you feel in your core very much that you were one of them? Does the idea being a woman in the future and living as a woman into your 30s, 40s, 50s and on feel like “yes, that is definitely my life. That feels, deep down like me, and I would be much happier like a woman than I do when I picture myself as a man at those older ages, or does being an older version of a man feel uncomfortable and or unhappy? 

Now, what if I started calling you Amy or Jeanine or Lara or any other typically feminine name that you might like, and everyone also did for a day, a week, a month…forever? Would that make you much happier than your current name or another typically masculine name like Robert or George or James (etc)? 

What if people started referring to you as she/her or any other pronoun than is used for you now? What if they did it for a day, week, month(s)…the rest of your life? Would that cause you to be much happier than you are now? There are websites and r/TransTryouts that will give you examples of being referred to by other names and pronouns you feel might fit you to see if they feel like they very much apply to you more than your current ones do. 

Body: You say you don’t have body dysphoria. Ok. That’s valid, and you don’t have to medically transition to be trans, but just imagine…if I were to say I could magically make you look like a cis woman or even a femme version of yourself as if you had never gotten the puberty you had or are in the process of going through? Does the thought of that make you very happy…does it make you euphoric (in trans situations—a deep feeling of happiness that you might not even have expected when you are or imagine being validated physically and or socially as the gender you are or think you might be)

If more than one of these things feels like they apply to you, continue trying out those things suggested. If you feel safe to do so, try picking a name and pronouns for your friend group to try for you. Basically, it’s hard figuring out if you are trans even with physical and or social dysphoria (which you may or may not have or recognize currently) 

Take your time with it, try things out, and try to find *euphoria* in being/ imagining yourself as a girl/woman if you think you’d be happier as one. I didn’t recognize what I was feeling as dysphoria until something clicked that what I was feeling about men (I’m FtM) was a deep, melancholy envy of cis guys, and seeing a trans guy medically transition just felt like…oh man, that’s it! That’s what I am! Took me until I was 30, so don’t feel a need to rush things. 

Lastly, if you’re really serious about it, and you feel safe in trying to seek one out, try going to a gender therapist online (BetterHelp) or in person. This is all the best advice I can give you. Best of luck in your self discovery.
Judging by everything that was written earlier here you can, but also thinking that you would be better if you were the opposite gender is not a definite sign that you are trans. I used to have those thoughts when i was younger, didn't like girlie clothes, activities, took comments about my ""manly"" appearance and tamper as complements, used to hang out mainly with guys. Most of those things are still the same, but i guess i started talking to more people of different origins and realized that gender shouldn't define my personality, now i try to experience the best both worlds. I've tried to give myself a beard and masculine bone structure using makeup and it was great, but I'm not committed to that appearance and social role. I'm not committed to constantly proving myself and others that I'm not a woman and honestly don't see how it would change things for me if i can just ignore or ridicule others' sexist comments.
People are going to argue about this until the end of time. At the end of the day, the way you identify cannot be gate kept by anyone else. I used to think I didn’t have dysphoria until I realized that all these things I considered to just be disdain for myself because of low self esteem, being overweight, etc., were indeed dysphoria. As others have mentioned, what initially got me thinking about it was the sense of euphoria I felt from doing certain feminine activities, being referred to with a feminine name and pronouns, being called my girlfriends ‘girlfriend’ rather than boyfriend, and so on. So long as you feel content in the steps you’re taking to move forward in whatever direction and pace feels comfortable, that is all that will ever matter.
Do you think you would be happier/feel more like yourself as the opposite sex? Then yes.

If someone offered you the opportunity to change your sex instantly with no ill effects would you take it? Then yes.

Are neither of the above statements accurate to you but you still wonder about being trans? Then yes.
I don’t think it’s as cut-and-dry as ‘you *need*/*don’t need* dysphoria to *be* trans. Imo the vast majority of trans people have either euphoria or dysphoria, though both of those are a lot more gradient-y than a lot of people think (i.e. dysphoria isn’t just ‘a feeling of wrongness’ - it can be far more or far less severe, same with euphoria). The only thing you really *need* to be trans is that brain/body (i.e. gender/sex) disconnect ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I didn't know I had dysphoria until I stared treating it. It turned out I had a LOT of it and no clue. The change in my health since treating it has been tremendous. Mental health issues I'd thought I'd have to live with forever are gone because it turned out they weren't what I'd thought.

So, yeah. I figured out that I was trans via euphoria (which can be an 'up' feeling, but I define just as much as having the dysphoria gone, like relieving a migraine I didn't realize I had).
I believe that dysphoria is the most common denominator of the collective trans experience (particularly pre-medical treatment).
How do you get the flag thing by your name ???
At first I didn’t have dysphoria at all, until a few weeks later
Yes. Not everyone experiences dysphoria
Short answer,  yes. 
Long answer,  yeeeeeeeeesss
Short answer: yes

Long answer: yeeeeeeeeeeeees
Requirements to be trans:

1. Identify as something besides the gender you were assigned at birth 

2. ????

3. Profit
Yes you absolutely can
Yes
Yes, you can. You can feel neutral, but feel more euphoric in an alternate state (sorry, I don’t know how else to phrase it). It’s completely fine!
I haven't read all the comments but I do want to say you never have to feel dysphoric to want to be trans, euphoria is healthy and I am so happy that you don't experience dysphoria. It doesn't make you any less trans for never experiencing it and it means you're living life.
Yes. Full stop, end of, no further questions.
yes
Yes, it’s more about if you feel euphoria from non-genderconforming things than it is about being dysphoric about gender conforming things
Yes! I am.
Of couser u can, but it's nice to look if u have any dificulties in recognizing your feelings in general. Normally i recognize only feelings that are more intense, like de euphoria of being a girl, but when i put up a panties and look at the mirror the feelings of dysphoria kind of intensifies and im able to notice it.
Yes
Absolutely! Having dysphoria is very common among trans people but not necessary. If your gender identity does not align with the gender your assigned at birth then you are trans.
yes
Sure! Just gotta warn ya of two things: 1. I started out as non-dysphoric too, it can change and 2. I don't recommend you shout that out in every comment or anything, there are gatekeepers inside the trans community, just don't pay attention to them
Growing up, I never ever cared what I was until I was convinced that I should care, and then I got a kind of  ""dysphoria from not knowing in a world of people who know."" Meanwhile, I got angrier and angrier  about the arbitrary rules about being anything (boy, girls, trans...) To this day I don't know what that makes me. Full circle to toddler-levels of not caring.
yes. as long as you feel happier being perceived as the opposite sex then you probably are.
Dysphoria doesn't make you trans, dysphoria just can happen when you aren't given the care you need

Don't listen to anyone who says no. 

Seriously, like... I don't think this space is truscum (-which is what it's called when you believe you have to have dysphoria to be trans...)
Don’t get dysphoria bad or even at all at times. So yeah it’s completely possible!
Absolutely you can!
Yes
Yes.
Yep
Yes
Yes, people experience these things in many different emotions or possibly none at all, in the longrun you are exploring who you are and it takes a while to say for certain even if you start with no idea at all. I struggle with understanding or noticing how i feel about certain things until I've been in it for a while. So I'd recommend testing out pronouns and seeing if it makes you feel anything, of course this isn't a requirement to being trans. Just a helpful way of seeing if the fog has cleared up a bit.
Yes :)
Yes. It’s also possible to not understand what dysphoria precisely feels like because it’s just the normal state of being.
Yes you absolutely can.
So much people think that you need some kind of list of pre-requisites marked to be trans, but that's not the case. I understand why people thinks about that list, society is still trying to invalidate the trans identities by pushing those requisites towards trans people and making trans folks insecure about what they feel about themselves, but that's just because some people are transphobic and don't want people to live their identity openly.
Don't listen to them, if you feel good by identifying yourself as a woman or a man, that's all you need to be trans.
Just go and f*king live your happy trans life. Just take care and go to queer spaces, you will be understood there :3
Absolutely! For me, it was a medium grade general discomfort with myself that I chalked up to everything from depression to social anxiety to PTSD.
Except I’d get nagging thoughts about “what if gender??” My wife helped me try a few last things, and I was like ~*euphoria!*~
Now I’m on HRT and I never want to be a guy ever again.
yah
Yeah.
Yep
Of course you can!
yes! being trans is not all about hating yourself and suffering. it's way more about finding what you're happiest as and most comfortable with!
Yes
Yes, you can be trans without dysphoria. While dysphoria is common in Transgender individuals, it is not required for someone to experience dysphoria. Again, it is just a common occurrence. The same goes for euphoria, it's not required but is also common for trans people to experience, typically in relation to dysphoria.
Yes, most trans people have dysphoria but some don't.
Yes
Yes.
[removed]
Dysphoria is a chemical wave of anxiety.Do I need anxiety to be trans Hell No but it comes automatically with being human.
Yes 

Dysphoria is a common symptom, not a pre-requisit.
Oh absolutely! Everyone experiences thing completely different.
Yes you completely can, and don't ever listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.
Y E S, dysphoria is only something that can happen to trans, not an ""obligation"" when you are trans. Be whoever you wanna be !
yes. I had don't really have any euphoria or any dysphoria. You can absolutely be trans without any of these things because identity is as abstract as we as living beings are and no identity will ever be a monolith
Yeah
Yes! I don't care what anyone else says, euphoria is the best way to know if your trans or not, do you feel overwhelmingly happy with the gender you think you are? Then YES, that can mean your trans!

You really don't have to have any hatred towards your birth gender to be trans, I may experience gender dysphoria, but that doesn't mean every trans person experiences it, everyone is different, it's not black and white, there is a rainbow of colours for a reason.

So to anyone who doesn't feel like they are trans just cause you don't experience gender dysphoria, just know that you are what you say you are, nobody can change that, and in fact, I generally envy trans people who don't experience dysphoria.

You are valid, don't listen to anyone that says otherwise ❤️
[removed]
Absolutely, there are no requirements other than the desire to be you. For a lot of people the question is more about ""I'm comfortable now but how much more comfortable or more happy could I be as another gender?""
Yes. Of course
Yes.
yes
Yes and you have chance if you have it
Yeah, I don't see a problem with it. If you get gender *euphoria* from identifying as a different gender than your agab, then that's usually an inkling that you're trans.

Cis people usually don't get happy/euphoric thinking of themselves as another gender ^

This is coming from a medically transitioning guy with gender dysphoria, so you're still valid my pal 👍
Yes, not everyone has dysphoria for the same reasons or at all. It's about who you see yourself as, and who you are. 

For me personally there's always been dysphoria in different ways through my life before I realized I was trans, and once I actually came to the conclusion I am trans alot of that dysphoria disappeared. I still have some dysphoria but for different reasons than before
yes
Yes
You can be anything you want if you really want but also yes, I don't really experience dysphoria and absolutely am trans
Yes, do whatever you want dear as long as it makes you happy
yes
Yup! You absolutely can.
U can be anything u want to be
Yeah
Yes.
Yes also u may even have dysphoria without realising it because it appears differently person to person. I have a lot of social dysphoria, but when I’m home alone I really couldn’t care less
The short answer is yes





The long answer is yesssssssssssssss
Yes, euphoria exists!! But there’s a good likelihood that a lot of the things you might not typically think of as dysphoria, but actually are, apply to you
Yea
yes. i could give a long winded explanation about dysphoria and euphoria and how you don't have to hate your birth gender to be trans but the short answer is yes, you do not need dysphoria to be trans
Yes you can
I have severe dysphoria but def doesn’t seem like you need that to be trans. If you feel you’re not the right gender/sex, that’s the only qualification to me
Yep
yes
Yes
Yes.
Yes, yes, and yes.
Mhm!!
[deleted]
Yes
Yes. However, are you SURE you don’t have dysphoria? A lot of people only think of dysphoria as being body dysphoria (the classic “I don’t like my breasts/Adam’s apple/voice/facial hair” etc.) but there are many types of dysphoria, including social dysphoria. If you are at all uncomfortable being perceived as your AGAB, being treated as such by others, etc. that’s social dysphoria. There’s other types of dysphoria as well; some people experience distress because their moods or emotional reactions are influenced by their current hormones and it makes them uncomfortable, for instance. Having dysphoria isn’t a requirement for being trans, and it’s not always correlated with being trans, but it’s also just a much more varied experience than people generally realize.
I think we as a community need to stop policing each other when it comes to our identities. we have enough policing from cishets, we don’t need to be harping on and excluding one another based on nonsense criteria. just because someone experiences being trans differently from someone else (ie presence of dysphoria/euphoria). i know a lot of people who don’t feel dysphoria, but feel euphoric when imagining themselves or being recognized as their chosen/real gender, and I think that’s just as valid as transitioning because of dysphoria
I didn’t realize I was experiencing dysphoria for years bc it was such a constant feeling, but looking back I had a lot of dysphoria always
I was at the point where I had little to non disfora went to boom all at once doesn’t really hit me hard anymore but now I’m whereing bras and more fem clothes so I believe yes 👍🏿
If you're asking this question 9 times out of 10 you are Trans just yet to experience dysphoria
You be what and who you want to be it’s your life
Tbh sometimes you don't even realize you have dysphoria until you get a taste of the other side...
Oh...The billion times most asked question, once again.
Hot take but yes. Dysphoria is needed. However, not everyone feels their dysphoria. If you live your whole life dysphoric and never experience extreme euphoria it will seem like a natural state to you. It can be hard to distinguish dysphoria from normal feelings before you experience euphoria. I used to think I didn't ahve dysphoria until I started getting euphoria more often and really started noticing the dysphoria.
Who's gonna stop you
Try experimenting with the way you express yourself! Depending on how that feels, it could tip you off to whether you are trans or not. While it isn’t a sure fire way to figure that out, it’s always good to do, as it can give you better insight into who you are. But yes, you can absolutely be trans without a strong amount of gender dysphoria, it’s how you feel whether good or bad that determines it.
cis people don’t usually feel sad about the implication that they might not be trans
As far as I’m aware based on scientific consensus and just the community in general, yes, you can be trans without having to experience dysphoria. An analogy I’ve heard for this is haircuts. Let’s say you’ve had long hair all your life. You might have really liked it and never felt uncomfortable with long hair, but one day, you decide to cut it really short, and you realise you prefer shorter hair so much more, so you decide to never grow it out again. Being trans is quite similar. You may be ok with living your live as your assigned sex at birth, but maybe one day you realise that you feel so much more happy when you can present as yourself, and so you may decide to transition so you can experience being more positive about yourself.
Being trans just mean you don't identify as th gender you where assigned at birth you don't have to be dysphoric
Thats kinda whats happening to me right now. I've been thinking of myself as a girl and it makes me feel as if life would just be so much better if I was and I also get a feeling I can't explain.
Euphoria for being your actually gender quickly turns into dysphorie when you aren’t. 

Idk, that’s how I see it at least, and how it happened for me. It took a year or so for that change to occur. The more you transition the more the bits that haven’t yet hurt.
Oh my god same!! I experienced that too! :/
Agreed, when I finally came to terms with being trans i experienced and am experiencing a lot of euphoria, and now I experience disphoria when my mom continues to dead name and wrong pronouns me constantly :D
Exactly. Once you accept the fact that your feelings are valid you’ll start to notice how much of yourself you have hidden from the world and yourself.
Yessss Euphoria > dysphoria
This
Accurate! Gender euphoria is real
If you don’t mind me asking, what made you dysphoric when you didn’t realize it?
If you don't mind me asking what are somethings you realized where dysphoria?
I thought I just had trash self esteem my entire life, nope I was just in the wrong body
That's not necessarily everything. It can be, but it can also largely be escaping dysphoria.
Ouch, this truth hurts. I've been figuring this one out the hard way.
Out of all the responses I've gotten this one reassured me the most. Thank you
Because I feel I'd be happier as a girl
Euphoria from being the gender they identify as
1 thank you for that link it really helped 2 thats hilarious
I'm okay with my birth sex but I feel like I'd be alot happier as a girl
[removed]
When did I get defensive?
1 I feel I would be alot happier as a girl which is why I'm questioning 2 my friends and immediate family are allies 3 I'm not gonna start transition tomorrow I have time to really think about it 4 I never said being trans is a fun/cool/quirky thing and that has nothing to do with how I feel rn and I don't think all my life problems are gonna go away if I do end up transitioning
Why are you gatekeeping being trans. Also, your flair says trans ally, I don't know if that means you are trans and an ally or an ally to trans people, but either way, don't gatekeep. Dysphoria is not a requirement
Every other response says otherwise
Who are you to tell someone if they're trans or not?
Don't bring those bootlickers here. They care far more about appearing transphobes than improving the lives of trans people.
>There are two types of people, truscum and tucute.

These are truscum terms. They define non-dysphoric trans people as tucute and use that to invalidate them. Don't recycle their terms.

But other than that, you're absolutely right. Dysphoria is not necessarily a requirement to be trans, it just happens to be a result of the anxiety we tend to feel around our gender not matching our sex.
Yup, sounds like what I went through. 

Don't rush anything though. It was a solid year of me just looking back on my life and moments in it that, now, I recognize as signs of being trans. So take your time, think, talk to people you can trust, and remember that whatever existing or new label you choose for yourself you are valid.
Fyi the medical definition of gender dysphoria includes wanting to look like or perceived as a gender different than the one assigned at birth. So if you want to be a girl, that's gender dysphoria, and if you want to be trans you're trans.
literally where i’m at rn, it’s all so confusing
Aha, unless you’re multiple genders! I mean in general I think you’re right. But it’s also possible to be bigender or trigender and just get added euphoria from being a different gender, but then want to also go back to the agab or other chosen gender. 

Like for me shaving off my leg hair might give me dysphoria. And I look worse without my beard but somewhat kinda sexy with it. But, it only takes a week for it to grow back, so if I’m gonna try to go out as a female or practice makeup then shaving it off is what I might do. 

I also love my bassy voice capabilities, while also simultaneously being in voice training to add a female voice I can turn on like a switch (which is interesting bc part of voice training is exploring your full vocal range which includes my bassy register and makes me go “wow that sounds pretty good as always 😏😎”)
Well. Among other things:
Genderbend media. Particularly those with forced feminization. Kinda found myself wishing (praying even at times) it happened to me
Adult movies: Often found myself wishing to be an actress in those. And never liked watching those for some reason
Girly clothes: I found myself wishing to wear those, but when I tried crossdressing I found myself... Painfully male.
I was extremely adult fun time averse. Never liked my genitals and in bed someone touching them was an instant turn off for me. 
Never was fond of my body in general. I felt prisoner in it at times and wished I reincarnated as a woman in the next life. Hated sports for this very reason tok, because I hated how my body jiggled.
https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85
Being uncomfortable taking my shirt off at the beach. Unable to imagine myself in my own sexual fantasies. Awkward with crushes because I couldn't imagine myself as I was with them (I realized later). Apathy/neutrality/slight discomfort in situations that expose my body, eg dancing, swimming, undressing in a locker room. Feeling vaguely grimey with grown out facial hair. Male characters in games felt less relatable.
Exactly so if u feel happier as a girl you’re not happy as your birth sex  which is dysphoria
.. exactly and if you’re euphoric as what you identify as you weren’t as happy as what u were before which is dysphoria
Yeah I was on a really bad spiral when I somehow came across that site. It legit saved my life.
Because it's not exactly correct. Yes, lots of trans people experience gender dysphoria, but it's not the defining part of our existence, just a side effect of it. Not only that, but often people don't even realize they are feeling dysphoria but as OP says, they could feel euphoria. You could go your whole life not having any attachment to your agab and assume that's how everyone else feels, or imagine yourself differently from how you are expected to present.

The idea that you *have* to be noticably dysphoric to be trans and that it *has* to entail transitioning are truscum ideologies, and those guys shit on non-transitioning enbies and neopronouns.

Thank you for letting me know
Thank you
Sounds exactly like what I've been going through this past year, and now I got my approval to go on hrt ☺️
I am going through the same thing as well... I'm just scared I might be trying to blame my sad life on my gender. Rn, I have a life many people envy but I'm not happy... I always think ""everything would be better if I was a girl"". Which makes me doubt that I am trans or maybe I want to believe that I'm not maybe because I don't think I have the strength to be trans. I'm just a train wreck
[deleted]
Thanks for sharing :) I can relate to some of what you said.
I can relate to all of these on some level. Thank you
One can be happier presenting in a certain type of way without experiencing dysphoria. 

That's like saying cis men who like to present extremely femininely, and get read as a woman in society, experience gender dysphoria even if they don't and are just happier presenting in a certain way

Congrats
I’m just curios, what if transitioning doesn’t solve that internal problem your experiencing? Where do you go from there after you’ve started hormones? Do you just stop hormones and go back to living like your biological sex?
Hey! Just curious, are those things that you blame on your agab things like:
• “if I was a girl I would’ve been invited and allowed to stay at the sleepovers those times.” •“If I was a girl, they would’ve connected with me in the way I wanted to and we could’ve had deep conversations moreso than we did.” 
•“If I was a girl I would’ve been more mature and made easier connections with my female friends (who were most of my friends) more..” 
•“If I was a girl they would’ve chose to hang out with me more realizing I could’ve handled more of the ‘mature’ stuff like talks about female anatomy that back then I couldn’t handle because of a degree of immaturity and upbringing.” 
•”If I was a girl they would’ve had ‘girl talk’ with me which I had wanted. I wanted to be seen as treated as one of them to some extent, I think, but I do realize now that I didn’t have the maturity to handle the girl talk back then bc of my upbringing.” 

Is it stuff like that? If not what are yours? I feel like it might be a lot of that stuff that I felt though. For the girl talk thing for example, I now realize my religion made my hyper sensitive to any talk about sex so I would freak out if I heard anything about. So looking back obviously they weren’t gonna include me on that. But now that I’m older and don’t hold those same biases I have a female friend where we just openly girl talk and she treats me like one of the girls so long as I want to be treated that way and it’s amazing. The girl talk and just openly talking about periods, or female anatomy, or especially sex talks are just fantastic honestly. Being so open with someone is just so great. 

I hear that supposedly some girls do this with their guy friends but I just don’t know. I’ve never witnessed that taking place and from my experience it just seems unlikely but I suppose it’s possible.

Oh, I have discovered that I do like being seen as “an equal” even though I’m just a guy most of the time. Intellectually and emotionally I might more identify with girls so that’s really cool and a part of why I like that I think. 
But also I do separately like going out as a female and maybe a few other things that denote that it’s not just that self doubt of “how can we be sure this isn’t just wanting to be close to your female friends?” 
Long story short gender is a construct anyway and there are some cis females who do so many guy things, that a guy who would get euphoria from being her might not even realize it bc he thinks he doesn’t do enough “girl” things to “qualify.” So yeah. As my Reddit friend says it’s more important to just do what makes you happy when it comes to this stuff and then find a label later.
Oh, also heads up: if you do want to consider yourself trans then there is such thing as imposter syndrome which is when trans people, no matter how far along they are on their journey, doubt their own “trans-ness.” 

But also just bc you have doubts doesn’t necessarily make you trans. There could be something that fits better. Maybe bigender, trigender, genderfluid, agender, androgynous, transandrogynous, and many many more things that might fit better and not cause panic.

Or perhaps you’re still panicking. If that’s the case then just go slow and do what’s good for your mental health. Don’t go a faster speed than you can handle this shit at. Maybe just focus on if there’s something that makes you happy and trying that. And if you’re trying to not make the world aware then that could be something as simple as a nice panty, a bra or thin trainer-bra thing that gives the feeling of fabric there, maybe painting toenails, or maybe something else entirely. 

Like, for me my supportive friend is who kinda kickstarted my journey further after going out and having an amazing time with them and getting my nails and toes painted. 

Then a few times after that I painted my own nails. Everytime it was a shade of blue. It’s just paint after all. It’s not a commitment to anything. Paint is agender. Both masculine and feminine people wear nail polish, so wearing it didn’t mean anything in particular (unless you want it too) and just let me try something I liked. At the same time, I haven’t repainted my nails since and just do other things. So it’s okay! Move at your own pace, and think about it however makes you most comfortable. It’s okay to slow down the mental train slowly crashing with something you might not feel you can handle at the moment, and maybe instead try to distract yourself by mentally removing gender from some activity or thing and trying that out in the privacy of your own home or room.

Absolutely people should talk to a qualified gender therapist, but not everyone in every place has access to those. Some of those people do have a friend or family member they can speak freely to about what they've been feeling. Even better if they're someone in the LGBT+ community already, be a sounding board for that person.
No problem. There is plenty of smaller things. Like O always hated my deadname (but only in relation to me. Never minded other people having it). Choosing to play as a girl character in games even when that was literally cosmetic. And probably tons of other things I forget.

Thank you so much~
Best of luck in your self discovery! 💜
My plan right now is to try and get more fit eat better eat. To see if that changes anything. Then if I still feel this way I will socially transition and If I like it and it makes me happy ill look into hormones and surgery
That would theoretically be the case. It would likely be obvious that they are making things worse, and by that point, very few changes would occur
Back when I was a kid all of my friends were girls, but as I grew up people start to make fun of me so I started to hang out more with boys. Not that I liked most things they did. After a while I felt so disconnected from them I isolated myself for years only speaking with some who were sincere. Idk I'd feel weird talking about stuff like that if I'm being honest, I don't think there's anything wrong with that though. I feel like if I was a girl my life would be harder, but I'd at least be happier. I wouldn't have isolated myself and wasted my years which I still do to this day, I would have had more friends and I'd know how friends interact with each other. I feel like everytime I interact with my ""sincere friends"" I'm putting on a mask to fit in with them, doing stuff they like, not talking much about what I like. Hearing their problems and trying to help them out, while not sharing anything about mine. I am just so used to hiding stuff that I don't even know who I am. What do I like? What do I want? I just know that I am unhappy and I want it to be over, but I don't know how I can do that because I don't know many things that make me happy. Being a girl is one of them I feel like flying when people think that I'm a girl refer to me as such. I fantasize about being one, having conversations with people, going to school as one, going to work as one. But I can't be trans because that would be so hard for the only people who have supported me through my years, my family. I don't want their eyes looking at me like I'm delusional or sick... It makes me wanna vomit when I imagine myself telling them all this. I'm just a train wreck like I said lol.
yea imposter syndrome sounds accurate to this case, it can apply to anything tho
I know... I just want to believe that it'd be better if I was a girl so that I can justify my feelings that I want to be one as a ""guy"". If that makes sense. I really want to be a girl but I can't accept that I am trans because if I do people I love will be affected from it and imagining how they'd react just makes me feel sick to my stomach. If there's anything I can hold on to that even slightly means that I can't be trans I want to believe it...

Thank you
I think the exercise and eating healthier is a really good start. Good luck in your journey, really hope you find what you’re looking for.
WARNING: POSSIBLE TRIGGER (briefly mention anti lgbtq+ political issues)
Maybe you could do something similar to what I do. Test some of your closest friends by like, bringing up the trans right or lgbtq+ issue. Somethin like “hey, I value your opinion. What do you think about this new law or political movement in my state (or x states like Florida’s don’t say gay bill) to try and restrict people talking about the gays?” Then depending on their response you could ask “yeah. What do you think about trans people?” And maybe if they don’t know many lgbtq+ people and they hit you back with the “well they are hurting people, they are making women feel unsafe in the bathrooms” right-wing talking point that doesn’t actually happen in real life unless it’s a bigot that clocks someone then lightly push back while seemingly being indifferent to their answer and say “but they’re not hurting anyone. Just like a gay person with a gay person doesn’t hurt me, neither does someone with slightly different anatomy shitting in the next stale hurt me. Also, almost all attacks on women are done by cis straight men. A trans person usually isn’t cis and has a good chance to be open minded or fluid (like understanding sexually is fluid as some say) about sexuality so they just wouldn’t fit into that category.”

Idk maybe somethin like that.
Look, my point is that if you’re able to discover that a few of your female friends are very accepting of lgbtq+ and not hidden terfs, then you could slowly start asking to join them (1 on 1 at first) on their female adventures. I started with getting a manicure pedicure. That’s actually something many cis men who are extremely comfortable with themselves do too. I didn’t personally enjoy it as much but that’s also because I have leg hair so the leg scrub wasn’t as cool. But I loved the frosty blue I got. Maybe you could do something like that. Perhaps only get your toes painted though so you can stealth from society and family just so you don’t have to deal with the pressure/fear you’re talking about (although cis men paint their nails too, and more would if society didn’t repress man from accepting “girly” activities). Btw just mentioning the cis men thing bc perhaps it’ll help you feel less weird about it. I was freaking out internally when I got it done so I had to constantly think “nail paint doesn’t have a gender. Paint doesn’t have a gender” just so I could get over the internalized phobia. Now after having done it I could do it a second time much easier. 
I live in the Deep South btw and basically no one at the nail salon cared other than thinking it was really cool to see a dude their with his friend getting nails done. 

Lemme know if any of this advice gave you any ideas or was helpful in any way. Overall I think “testing” some of your girl friends to see if they’re cool would be smart, then slowly asking “I’ve never done this. I want to try it (could even say “bc I think men comfortable enough with themselves to try it are cool and I want to be just like them” bc it would give you a scapegoat as to why you’re doing it if you don’t want to say that you want to be more feminine yet.

Not everyone is in the United States, there are countries where people cannot get trained care at all.

Because, it's one of the things that was constant through my life that made me feel happy. Everytime people referred to me as if I was a girl by accident I'd feel like flying. All those times I secretly dressed up in mom's clothes and looked at myself in the mirror. I hate everything about myself. I never like to see myself in pictures because of how bad I look. I am so shy that I struggle to do even the things that I need to do let alone things that I want to. Because I'm living under a mask that makes me ""acceptable"" for others. I wouldn't even call it living. Hiding all that from everyone has led me to a path of isolation and sadness.

My mum threw out my GC2B binder and didn't bother telling me for over a month.	"My lovely friend ordered me a trans binder from gc2b almost four months ago. I have been binding with common medical bandages for over a year and decided it was time to upgrade - I understood the risks of binding with bandages, and even though I tied them relatively loose, they still dug into my skin in an uncomfortable way to the point where it began to hurt more than it relieved my dysphoria. So, naturally, I began to think I **would** have this binder and I'd finally be able to flatten my chest in a way that did not hurt or have long term side effects.  
After two months, gc2b alerted me that my binder had been lost in the mail, so my friend ordered it again - except this time it did arrive, I got the notification via email that it was in my country for over four weeks, and only today, two months after I ordered it, did my mother bother to tell me she had gone trough my mail and found it.  
So it did get here, I suppose, and I was beyond happy - until she promptly told me she'd thrown it in the trash almost five weeks ago. I'm devastated. This is something I never expected her to do, and is why I wasn't very cautious about where I had the package delivered. My mother and I are usually very close but I feel as if the most basic idea I had of who my mother is has been shattered.   


She got my dad to call me when I left the house to go for a walk and clear my head. She probably expected him to go batshit on me, but he was very worried and concerned, and thought what my mother did was disappointing. He's agreed to buy me one behind her back, and although I'm grateful, it's very difficult to even look my mother in the eyes.   


I'm 17 and finishing the HSC in three terms. This binder was meant to carry me through my last year of high school, and even though my dad is getting me one, I cannot believe my mother would be so careless as to throw away almost $60 AUD and not tell me for 5 weeks.  


As someone who is genderfluid, I was purchasing a binder for the single purpose of feeling more comfortable in my own skin."	"[deleted]
That's a great way to distance herself from her child. If she wants to lose you completely, tell her to keep it up.
Thats medical abuse
[deleted]
She committed a felony afaik. Destruction/theft of mail.
Tell her that you now have the right to destroy or throw out something of hers!

And tell them that they must pay for the loss of property and then apologise to your friend
I'm so sorry your mother did that. I'm glad your father is being supportive but can completely understand why you feel let down by your mother.

(edit typo)
That's just not cool at all.. she had no right to 1. go through your mail, 2. open your mail, 3. throw out your property, 4. not tell you about it for weeks.   


I would at least make it very clear that she owes you $60. She has broken your trust, that damage is done. Now the least she can do is reimburse you.
I would definitely bring up the fact of going through someone else's mail and throwing it aways is illegal, but if you pay rent I recommend shorting her the price of the binder and when she gets angry tell her thats how you feel about the binder and walk away
No loving parent would ever do something like that.
Your father is amazing
So sorry that's happened to you, that is so shitty
that is so fucking horrible. what a waste of money. for a mother to throw something away that not only was expensive but so important to her child is downright disgusting.
That sucks dude
It doesn't matter what the item is or how expensive it was, this is such a blatant violation of trust and boundaries that my immediate thought was ""dead to me""  
Oh my GOD!

People really need more respect for stuff that isn't theirs to begin with!  
I'm scared to just mishandle someone else's properly even if I know I won't damage it, much less make the deliberate decision to discard it!
Sounds exactly like what happened to me. I used bandages, she hid all. I got a binder, she threw it away. My dad bought one behind her back, she found it several times and hid it from me but I started knowing the places she hid them, and we never said anything to each other when we took it back. Extremely toxic and distressing.

It's disrespectful and rude, and I dont know her intentions but try to hide it as best as you can just in case. Your dad seems nice, so maybe ask him to keep an extra eye on it in case she gets her hands on the binder. A binder is so important and the other alternative is destroying your ribs with bandages. You deserve to be comfortable AND safe at the same time
It's yours you bought it. Confront her. Fucking go for it. Explain shit. It was your money and she had no fucking right
Try to talk to her ask her why she did that and explain yourself calmly and clearly that is the best way to figure out why she might have done that and to decide whether she is ok to trust after the fact I hope you feel better and know there are people who support you. much love.
I can't stand for people who are like that, especially for what your mom did!

I give you my best wishes as a cisgender ally who is part of this community!
If laws where you are happen to be anything like the US, the discarding of another's mail even by a parent may be a crime.
As a mom I am so sad that yours did this to you. Is there a way someone else can receive the package and give it to you in person? Or since your dad is supportive maybe he can have it delivered to his workplace so your mom can’t sabotage it? 

I hope things get better at home and your mom comes around and apologizes.
See if the police will do something about it
I've asked her for binders about five times before I asked my friend to mail one to my house - she had said no each time, but never in a way that made me think ""wow she really must be against me doing this"". I'd spoken to her in the past about the risks of binding with bandages, and she always seemed indifferent. I knew she would disagree with me taking it into my own hands but I never expected her to throw reason out the window lmao.   
She did say today that she only did it because she was worried I was damaging my ribs, which is funny considering my method of binding is much more dangerous to my ribs then it would be to use a gc2b binder. Oh well, looks like I'll have to be more careful when my next one arrives. :)
Thank you for your suggestion, I'll give it a go :)
Unfortunately I'm not a legal adult in Australia, and I'm fairly certain it's kind of a whats-mine-is-hers situation until I'm 18. Please correct me if I'm wrong!!
That’s a misdemeanor you’re talking about. In order for it to be a felony larceny or destruction if property, at least in the U.S, the value of the item(s) must be equal to or exceed $1000
I completely agree. Thank you for your comment <3
I know, I'm very grateful. I hadn't even come out to him, so not only was this the first time he'd ever known I wanted to flatten my chest, but he immediately offered to replace the one my mother threw out.
Same here, that's why I was so shocked! I never thought she'd do anything like this, really disappointing.
I hope things are better for you now. I've got a paint desk beside my bed I hide my bandages in, might just make room for my binder in there too. Thank you for your suggestions it means a lot <3
[deleted]
I think it's a bit murky legally, depends on which territory you live in and the terms of any parental separation (which I'm assuming if your dad said he'd get you another binder discreetly)

Depends on how old you are and how much of a legal stink you want to make about it
If a friend bought it for you then in my mind it is their legal property until you received it. She destroyed their property and intercepted their mail intended for you. At the very least it is destruction of their property.

Putting this aside though, I would just sit her down and say something like ""It hurt me deeply to be betrayed by you like that. You know how I identify and you know why I've been binding. You claim you destroyed my property to protect me from hurting my ribs, but I was at greater risk for that when using makeshift bandages. What you destroyed was a high quality, medically designed binder that would have been much safer for me. I will be honest, I have lost respect for you both as a mother and as a person, as well as my trust in you.""

Then maybe give her a copy of the transgender bible or some other reading material to educate herself, and say ""if you really take the time to understand these issues, you'll be disgusted with yourself for acting how you did"".
Good luck to you and I hope your mom comes around <3
Thank you so much and I completely agree. I have no idea how I'm going to forgive her for this, it's really disappointing :( Hopefully things go more swimmingly from now on if I can keep the next one better hidden - and thank you for your suggestion, I'll keep it in mind <3
> Now I don't wanna be rude but that excuse she gave you about ""not wanting you to damage your ribs"" smells like bullshit to me.

Her reason for saying it is probably bullshit, but this is actually a very real danger. There was someone who posted here a few weeks ago whose ribs were completely misshaped and possibly broken from wearing a binder really tight. But, like OP said, they're already using bandages which could be even worse, and their mom didn't seem to care about those.
How you should forgive her is don't. Obviously I don't know the full situation, but based on the little info I have she seems like a shit person who you should stop interacting with when you move out."	s22fcx	trans	589	0.99	2022-01-12 09:39:31

Tips for trans girl- from a trans guy	"I spent much of my teen years being hyper fixated on my appearance and terribly dysphoric about my body, so I made great effort to make myself appear more masculine and strictly avoid certain things. These things eventually became a burden to my everyday life but now that I’m in a much better place and my dysphoria has gotten better I realize that some of these things I was trying to avoid could actually help out a lot of trans girls! So here’s a small list of tips, feel free to add your own!

1. Long hair doesn’t automatically mean feminine- short hair doesn’t automatically mean masculine. If you’re a trans girl still trying to grow out your hair try looking at your face shape and the pixie cuts recommended by hair stylists. Pixie cuts immediately look very feminine and really pretty! (my big mistake was asking for a pixie cut at the hair salon! forcibly feminized!)

2. Accessorize with jewelry- lots of it. Often during the years I looked androgynous people would notice I was wearing earrings or necklaces and that would push them in the feminine direction

3. If you have a lot of body hair and can’t always keep up with shaving, try conditioning your body hair- especially the pubic area. It’ll look and feel softer and feel nice. 

4. Shape your eyebrows- women for some reason tend to have thinner eyebrows- the more angular the more feminine you’ll probably be perceived. Go with your face shape, of course. 

5. You may be surprised- but layering your clothes can help! This is often a tip geared towards trans guys, but if you’re still self conscious about your body shape wearing layers can help hide some things and accentuate others. If you’re not the biggest fan of your legs, try tights and a longer skirt- if you’re not the biggest fan of your shoulders, try to even out your silhouette by accentuating your hips. FITTED pants go a long way, ironically enough skinny jeans have become the standard for cis men (?? idk why??) and they can sometimes be unflattering especially if you’re on the skinnier side because they show the exact shape of your legs. Try pants that fit your waist really well but are just a bit too big in the legs- that way your hips will stand out more and create a more feminine shape- belts help a lot with this. 

6. Tits really don’t matter- I’ve passed as male with and without them. Its more so about how your clothes sit on your body. V necks look more feminine than U necks. If you have broad shoulders try shirts with big sleeves- sweater paws are an instant feminizer. 

7. A little bit of makeup really goes a long way- focus on the eyes a lot. Pigment and darkness around the eyes and eyelashes instantly feminizes the face regardless of everything else in most cases. Try gloss instead of lipstick sometimes. Having nice skin can also help, not to say you have to be acne free, but keeping your skin nice and moisturized helps a lot.  Color correction and soft skin can help diminish or erase a 5 o clock shadow really well. 

8. SMELL GOOD. Experiment with perfume and soap. Boys are stinky. 

9. Hair and nail accessories- clips and pins. There’re cute and can often be cheap. If sitting in a nail salon scares you, try press on nails. Learn your style and aesthetic, brows pinterest, look around your local thrift shop. What’s worse than being dysphoric? Being dysphoric in an unflattering outfit! 

10. Understand that all women look different! Decolonize your beauty standards! I’ve heard “my hands are too big” “my jaw is too strong” too many times! All women look different, and not all women- even cis women- have small chins and feminine hips. Big noses, strong brow bones, and long legs are beautiful too! (plus tall women are hot)

Trans people are resilient and strong by nature. You got this, girls!"	"Oh yea for the budge issue try pants with a waist that are actually a bit too big and use a belt. If the legs are too long cuff them. Your privates will be more hidden because the extra fabric creates a bigger/ longer crotch. Skinny jeans are the worst for this!! Stay away!!
Awesome tips, thanks!  What about jackets in cooler weather?  Any suggestions for them if your shoulders are just a little too broad?  Don’t want to hulk them out before my muscles mass decreases.  Just get larger sizes even if it’s a potato sack at that point?
I'm taking notes 👀
Aww, thank you very much for the tips, you sir are legendary. <3
THANK YOU!!!!
As a trans girl trying to be more feminine some more things I have found which work pre-hrt. However I still don't think I pass for shit.

Long sleeves with puffed/rolled cuffs tend to mask big hands and wrists, as well as make large biceps and forearms less noticeable.

Straps need to be wide, thin straps look highly unflattering on wide shoulders.

For shirts exposing only the waist is not a good idea if you are like me and still have a wide one

Shirts with a seam that goes diagonally from the collarbone to the chest for the sleeve, rather than a straight shoulder seam tends to help break up the squareness of muscular shoulders. So look for rounded shoulders on your clothes.

Even better if it can not have shoulders entirely, but then have sleeves.

Belts are good for cinching your clothes in the right place, but can fall down quite easily.

Wearing a puffy top and something which hugs the body from the underbust to the waist and then widens at the hips makes you appear to have more on your chest than you actually do, artificially slims your waist and widens your hips.

Skirts, funnily enough, look really feminine. They also hide masculine legs and buts + are good for note getting the dreaded bulge. If you feel you can pull one off give it a go, beware most of these lack pockets, perhaps adding a bag as an accessory is good. Take care when choosing them though, I find simplicity is very good, too much texture and it looks garish.

Posture, if you stand like a guy people will look for masculine things about you, look at how women stand and walk, emulate that.

Taking care of your hair and skin will not only feel better but it will make you look more feminine, and uneven complexion and oily, messy hair does not help your image. Brush it often, wash often but not too often. Find out what sort of products you need to get it to a consistency you like.

Volume, in many things can be good. I break up the squareness of my head and face by using a volumizing conditioner. Voluminous clothes can be good for hiding masculine traits in, they bring you towards an androgynous look

If you're super veiny like me then keep cool and stay calm, high heart rate and breathing increases your blood pressure which makes that stand out

Style your hair it into places where it makes your face take the right shape. You can use products for this (I tend not to because I have ridiculously sensitive skin). Be aware of where it parts and how far up it is so stand in front of a mirror and play around until you get something that fits. Asymmetry tends to be helpful. Equally develop a habit where you brush your hair into the right shape when it falls out of shape. I always used to keep my hair out of my face by flicking it back or moving it behind my ears with my thumbs. Touching my hair with my hands got it dirty really quickly, and brushing both sides behind my ears brings it to a quite masculine hairstyle. I've learned where I need to get it so it looks right and I check when I walk around, maintaining how you look is as important as getting there.

Make sure what you are wearing fits you correctly, a small change in the angle, tightness, texture or amount of fabric somewhere can make a huge difference. Play around with that and see what looks good. I suggest learning a little bit of sewing and taking in/ letting out the parts which need that

Color as well as patterns and their business can help. Darker shades tend to make me look more masculine so I avoid them, however dark pants/skirts/dresses with a lighter top tends to make me look more feminine. Busy vs not busy is also something to consider as well as how sharp or angular the patterns you are wearing are, but I haven't found any rules here, just that some look more masculine and some look more feminine so exercise judgement.

Some theory, figure out what parts of you look most feminine and make them show, while using the shape of clothing to hide what doesn't. Cis women have been doing this for a long time, as many of them have bodies which are pretty masculine, there will be a cut, or a technique which will make your body do the right things, we humans are cunning like that.

If you really want, hip inserts and such things exist. I hate the idea of doing that because I want to be as feminine with my clothing off as with it on, but needs must. I just work out that part of my body obsessively.

Not everything here will transfer to everyone, I am tall, thin and leggy, I have long and muscular arms, big hands, and wide shoulders so that's where I focus my energy. Some of what I say here will be counter intuitive for you if your body shape is different.

I wish you all luck on your journeys.
These are some fantastic tips. Thanks, dude! The eyebrows are one that I notice now and then, probably because I have manbrows myself. Those are great clothing tips, too. I can envision exactly the kind of pants of which ~~the legends~~ you speak.

I agree with number ten all the way. My wife has PCOS, yet in spite of all the features she has that are androgynous or masculine, she is unmistakably a woman. She's so self-conscious about them, but I honestly didn't notice until she pointed them out. The human mind weighs what it notices, maked the decision on gender, and just ignores the small inconsistencies it finds irrelevant.
in general, the more effort you put into your appearance the more femme you will appear, and vice versa. That’s the “how can I pass” rule of thumb.
OP, I know you probably wont read this, but this literally caused me to start crying cause I've needed this kind of advice for a long time. It's one of those things it doesnt help now, but one day, when I'm safe, it will. Thank you so much....:')
I love this advice 💕
Bro you're a lifesaver!
The skinny jeans thing, my legs and butt are actually a good shape and I get huge euphoria from seeing them in skinny jeans, the problem is where my belly sits, it rides, I think, too high and makes me look weird. I disguise it with long shirts but I would love to know if there's anything else I can do.
Thank you dude, you’re a godsend 💕
Hello dude!
I love your tips, really a great help for girls like me.
Thanks a lot!
im a trans guy but to all you girls this is good advice
Agree with these. Thank you :)
Good tips. When I tuck with 2 pairs of underwear I don't worry if the tuck is a little loose, I'll def fix it if it's bad but almost nobody is looking down there and even most ppl who do don't notice,even cis-women can have a small 'buldge'
Tysm I'm bookmarking this post
Omg does anyone have any tips to tweeze your eyebrows? I want to make mine look more feminine but dk where to start?
God I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to eyebrows and since I'm stuck at my college, I'm not really in a position to get them done by someone else. I should really get on that when I get home. I feel like I'd like my face better if my eyebrows were cuter. ;-;
Thank you :)
Saving the hell out of this post. Thank you!
Thanks for writing this! This is just the best post!
Great advice dude. I've never paid much attention to the hair style and only length. Accessories definitely go a long way, having a necklace on me helps me pass.
Thank you for all the advice! You are amazing <3
The sacred text
This is going to be my bible lol
Why don't you want guys wearing skinny jeans xd
I wish there was a way to save reddit posts. These are great tips!
Good advice! I am so. Damn. Glad. That high waisted cargo pants, loose baggy jeans, and overalls are the in thing for girls right now. 

Just makes it so much easier to transition when the loose fit hides everything while I’m in the process of transitioning.
whenever you’re too big in one area try to either diminish it or even it out. I’d actually suggest a thinner coat thats longer or the opposite- something like a leather jacket that stops early- those always look really feminine. The best thing to do if u have a wide top half it to try to balance out your bottom half- ur hips and butt. Plus broad shoulders can look really really attractive on a woman especially if she got some nice arms too… big shoulders are definitely not a deal breaker!
Take the sweater paw rule to heart! Find a jacket that ends in a big poofy sleeve and small wrist collar! Bonus points if they have a cute print/color or oversized collar which are also feminine features
Maybe try adding a big circle scarf (knitted) that will break up the lines in that area.
plus you’ll probably be feeling more confident which also helps with passing
Im glad it was able to help some people out! :)
maybe try putting something like a flannel over it and only buttoning up the bottom few and leaving the rest open. The only problem is it might hide ur butt a little bit. you could also just try high waisted pants that cover the bottom half of your belly.
go with the shape of your eye and your face. The start of your eyebrow should be at the start of your eye tear ducts, the highest point should be somewhere in the middle of your pupil. Often if you don’t have the precision to pluck ur eyebrows using a small cheap shaving razor or a brow razor can help a lot. Try to angle the downside of your eyebrow (after the arch) to the angle of your cheekbones so they could almost follow the same line. That might not make any sense lol but if you look at pictures of feminine faces you’ll see what I mean. Keep a lot of references of pretty women with the same face shape as yours. You got this!
I just think they’re ugly. Just my stupid opinion
Between the bell and the three vertical dots in the upper right.
Well does u/infj_mtf have good news for you
Well, I’m not TOO big.  I can wear them but I can’t move too much because it feels like I am stretching them out and will rip them - or at least I’m afraid I will.  Once I lose some muscle mass I think I’ll be good though.  I do like the shorter jackets though, some of them are super cute!
Cool, thanks for the tip!  I hadn’t actually heard of the sweater paw rule before.
Oh. I'm dumb. Thanks!
you’ll look your best in whatever you’re most confident in! These are all tips but none of them are rules. There are things that work for you that won’t work for any other woman. Try out as many jackets as you can!
Oh haha it's not a ""rule"" I was referring to #6 on this list!
Dumb and unaware are different. You were unaware. Happy to help!
Thanks!  I can’t believe you haven’t got more replies, your a cool dude!"	qptmc3	trans	578	1.0	2021-11-09 02:27:31
Is it okay to be trans because I want to?	"Hey, male wanting to be female here, I don’t have dysphoria or anything, is it okay to be trans just because it makes me more comfortable?

Edit: I feel the need to clear things up, I was quite tired when writing this post and completely missed the mark on what I meant, I want to be female because it makes me more comfortable with myself, I am comfortable being a male, and can live my life as a male if I decide too, but I am way more comfortable when I express myself as a trans female, it makes me feel more like, well, me. I hope this clears things up for everyone who commented on this post, and thank you for being honest and using She/Her pronouns :)"	"Dysphoria isn't needed but sometimes you have dysphoria without knowing. When I realized I was trans I had no dysphoria but then realized all the things I didn't like and then got dysphoria...

Edit:
I made this not expecting many people to have the same stuff but woah that's a lot of you..are y'all okay? I hope you are all doing okay because you deserve it :( ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
[removed]
I know you've likely done a lot of thinking on the subject already, but the idea of being more comfortable as a different gender is euphoria or dysphoria depending on how you look at it.

The wanting to be a different gender part is what makes you trans :)
I only realized I was trans about four or five days ago, and I thought I had no dysphoria at all. But what I've realized is dysphoria doesn't necessarily mean crippling hatred of yourself, (as I've never felt that) like crying when you look in a mirror or obsessive shaving. 
It can just be small things, little incongruences that aren't really notable, just quirks about yourself, but definitely not the norm. For example, I never liked going into a pool without a shirt, there was this weird feeling of wrongness around my chest area. At the time, I thought it was because I saw myself at weak and skinny, even though I was the same as my guy friends. Now I know different.

Look back on your experiences, I'm sure you will find some incongruences. 

And what's more important is how you feel being female. That slightly giddy, hot feeling you get when you are doing something affirming is much more important than anything negative towards your male self.
One could argue that feeling more comfortable as female would qualify as dysphoria by in turn being less comfortable as male.

Anyway you don’t need crippling depression or dysphoria to be trans. Plus I started noticing stuff I didn’t feel dysphoric about after I came out
Dysphoria is one of those poorly understood things.

It’s not necessarily a crippling self hatred, and can be as mild as simply wanting to be different or feeling more comfortable a certain way. Or it can be a euphoric feeling when presenting a certain way.

All you need to do in order to be trans, the only requirement there is, is to express that you’re trans. That’s it.
Hello! 

Interesting question! 

No, dysphoria is not at all necessary to be trans! Some people may think that but that's not true. You don't have to suffer to be or feel a certain way. You're you and you alone know how you experience yourself, who you are and what you're most comfortable with. Everyone experiences their gender differently, so everything someone feels is completely individual. 

I hope this could answer your question... 

Have a great day! Best wishes! 😄
I have mixed feelings and I'll share a couple points that I hope you'll consider. 

1) Dysphoria isn't the end all be all of ""being trans"", and you don't necessarily need dysphoria to be trans. Many of us do have it though, and it is manifested and experienced in many different ways. Ranging anywhere from mild discomfort to extreme panic attacks and suicidal ideation. 

2) I personally believe that much like sexuality, being trans is not a choice. It's not something that most people just decide to do for fun or because we ""want to"". If you want to be a woman, that is one indication that you may indeed be trans though. 

3) Being trans is not fun, and transition is a very serious and life altering process. If you begin a physical transition, almost ever aspect of your life and social relationships will certainly change, and there is no guarantee that it will be for the better. 

4) Take anything you read on the internet with a giant grain of salt. At the end of the day, you know who you are and what you want better than anyone else. That being said, I'd highly recommend you see a qualified gender therapist to help you come to a conclusion for yourself.
Yep. Dysphoria is not required. Being more comfortable as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth is the definition.
if you feel like a girl, and you want to be a girl, then as far as i’m concerned ur totally good with being trans.
I once found this blogpost from an other transgirl.
For me this was very enlighting, since i also always experienced it more like, ""i want to be a girl"", than ""i am a girl"". This confused me because of that i was thinking it's only a fetish or something similar.
Truth is, wanting to be a girl, makes you a girl, no matter if you experience yourself as a girl right now or not, or experienceing dysphoria or not.

https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5
""Dysphoria"" and wanting to be trans mean you WANT to be a gender different from the one assigned at birth, so probably yes
Hmm, that’s an onion needing to be unwrapped. 

I guess it depends on how “dysphoria” is defined and reasons why you want to be female? Some definitions of gender dysphoria include “wanting to be a different sex from what you were assigned at birth”. There’s a gender spectrum and you can be wherever you want on the spectrum without justification or reason. Be yourself. 

If you’re doing it just to piss off cishet folks or make fun of transgender people, then perhaps your energy is better placed elsewhere? If your motives are genuine and want to explore your gender or gender roles within society, have fun! 

Please note this is my personal opinion and not representative of anyone else.
The dysphoria Bible actually says that simply wanting to be trans checks enough boxes for you to be trans. You don’t have to have dysphoria in the traditional way, but there are a ton of different ways it presents itself
If it makes you comfortable as you said, then that implies you are less comfortable now, which I would say for myself is definitely a form of mild dysphoria. Wanting to be something is the first step to being something.
You’re gonna get mixed opinions on this but I come from the stance that there is no prerequisite for being trans. Some trans people experience dysphoria,
some don’t. Some are binary and some are nonbinary. If you feel that this is what is right for you and will make you the most happy in your body and life then I encourage you to follow that.
Wanting to be a different gender from your birth is in itself dysphoria, so wanting to be a woman more than a man means that you have dysphoria.

If that makes sense
As you work on transition it helps make the dysphoria more bearable, at least it does for me.  I don’t actually know anyone transitioning that hasn’t also found it difficult, but you keep it up because it feels like there is no other option.  Maybe an indicator for whether it’s right for you if there is no dysphasia, is if it feels like not transitioning is Not even an option.  But I know I am only seeing this from my prospective.  I’d much rather not have dysphasia.
Your validity shouldn't need to be put in question based on how much or how little you suffer.
I’m not the one to tell you whether or not you’re trans- I’d personally recommend a gender therapist to help you figure that out. However, from my own personal research I believe you should have some form of dysphoria to be transgender whether that’s a little or a lot. If you transition without dysphoria you’re more likely to develop dysphoria from the alterations which is kind of shooting yourself in the foot. I’d just be careful and take some time to really decide if this is something you want because it can be very detrimental otherwise. Transitioning is no joke- some of the changes are permanent. So if that’s the route you want to go it’s better to be safe then sorry. As I said before, I strongly recommend a gender therapist or just a therapist in general. Also, dysphoria doesn’t mean you have a constant hatred for yourself, everyone experiences it differently. Just my opinion, I can see it’s a bit different from everyone else’s but just some food for thought.
If you have euphoria then yes but make sure its what you want, you may just be into drag and feminine things or you might be trans or even NB, that's for you to find out but whatever it is be proud if it
Yeah I understand I was just a cross dresser happy doing what I do until I got onto the sub Reddit’s and now I’m so confused with this dysphoria I’m not sure if it was always there I guess it was but it stirred Things up being on here that’s for sure
Just throwing in my two cents, as well: I had literally the same feeling when I realized I might be trans, too. I asked people, Can I be trans just because I like the idea? Am I allowed to be a woman even if I don't feel like I'm trapped in the wrong body or anything?

As others have said, it's totally valid! And in my experience, once I started accepting myself and embracing trans-ness, I started feeling gender euphoria when I was in ""girl mode."" 

Ultimately you don't have to ask permission to be who you want to be! You're valid and worthy of love!
You answered your own question when you asked"" is it ok to be trans just because it makes me more comfortable?"" If it makes you more comfortable then there must be some discomfort to living as the gender you were assigned, that is dysphoria.
It is
Of course!!! ^^
Yeah, basically. To some degree it’s why I intend to transition. Some people get caught up a lot on whether or not people are valid, but that doesn’t matter so much to me, just do what makes you happiest or most comfortable
In the words of The Dysphoria Bible, being trans isn't best quantified through dysphoria. It is best quantified through euphoria. Dysphoria comes in different ways for different people. Not all dysphoria is as simple as ""OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT IN MY PANTS"". Sometimes, dysphoria can just be misconstrued as social awkwardness or being an introvert. Even then, you should try to see how good you feel by trying out she/her pronouns compared to your previous ones. Try to do something feminine, like painting your nails or wearing a skirt or something like that.(Not that transfemmes necessarily need to be feminine, but you get what I mean.)
As another user mentioned as well; I was bullied for being overweight as a young amab. So I always felt my lack of love for my body was born from that. It did certainly contribute. But, my level of confidence in my body has gone from 1/100 to 25/100 since I hatched.

 It's not great, but light years above what it used to be. I never really engaged in self-care before eithier. My body was disgusting so why bother with more than basic hygiene? Now I'm wearing make-up, cleaning, preening, and shaving. It's lots of work; but it *feels* worth it for the first time ever.

 I look back and see all the little things now as well.  Because I didn't have dysphoria before I egged. Things like, "" push button recieved x thing but swap gender"", and my going yes please. Or other such games like that. How I'd play a female avatar in every rpg I played. How I'd watch woman kiss eachother and my heart would ache. But cis kissing was meh at best. How I always wanted to be pretty, and cute. How whenever I got bullied for being more femme, or preferring the company of woman. How I never could understand why being femme was bad. 

 I had no idea why any of this existed, so I didn't have recognizable dysphoria. I owe it to r/traaaaaaaaaaaaans (I never remember how many A's are in the damn sub title lol) for helping me find my eggshell. And other subs like this one for helping me realise I was a woman. I've found a happiness and comfort in my own body I didn't think I would ever have. I'm so excited about my coming changes, and I get so happy when I see hints of the woman I will be. 

The dysphoria is real and recognizable now. But as much as it hurts more acutely now. I also feel better, and get the benefit of euphoria. As cost/benefit calculations go. I feel I've come out well ahead, and it's only going to be better. The road is hardly going to be smooth; but I know for sure it will be worth it.
I thought I wasn't really trans because I only had disphoria around my chest.
And even that I didnt think was so bad.

But then I look back on my childhood, wearing too small bathing suits under my clothes, because it flattened my chest.
Wearing way to many sports bras.
And getting extatically happy when people called me ""sir"" or ""bud.""

I always worried I was just attention seeking, but I never told anyone.

I think if youre constantly thinging about it, doing research, and watching youtubers who've transitioned or teach about it, there's probably more there than just a fleeting interest.

Biggest tip off for me was how I always saw my self as a little boy in all my memories.
Wanting to be a gender that you were not assigned at birth is literally dysphoria
So what has transitioning reduced to? A fashion trend lol
If you want to be female you are. Plain and simple. You don't have to have dysphoria, you don't have to take hormones (although if its what you want you absolutely should), and you don't need srs (see above parentheses). All it takes is the want.
You probably have dysphoria, you just don't realise it. But even if you don't, you're the only one who gets to decide who you are and wether you want to transition or not. Wanting to be a woman just to be a woman is reason enough to transition.
that's exactly what being trans is. dysphoria is a result of that
Absolutely, being trans isn't about suffering. Though as everyone else has said, dysphoria is a sneaky.
Wanting to be a girl is a pretty good sign of being a girl
Honey, not everyone experience dysphoria, it is not a requirement for being trans. If you feel more comfortable as a female than maybe that's what you are? I suggest experimenting and see what works for you, what IS you. Remember that trans isn't just ftm/mtf but also genderfluid, non-binary and all of those who don't feel 100% like their assigned gender.
Ya, I kinda started like this and then realized I had dysphoria about things that I do now and so ya that’s it and I was gonna day more but I forgot what that might be so ya bai
As a trans person, I say it's A-OK! Welcome to the family, sister!
I'm 36yo I did not experience dysphoria in a classic since until after I came out to myself. I was just always uncomfortable with myself without a specific focal point. Keep searching and exploring and go with what feels best. You may find that you lay elsewhere on the gender spectrum, there is far more than 2 options!
yes, its totally okay!, I just became trans today
Ma'am that's dysphoria
Generally speaking, cis people don't ""want"" to be trans. Listen to your instincts.
The most important defining part of being trans is euphoria. If being a female is what truly makes you feel good and comfortable, over being a male, then there you go!
That is ultimately the only requirement. Are you more happy or comfortable as a different gender? Then being trans may be for you. I mean, we couldn't stop you or anything anyway, but I think the vast majority of our minority will accept you with open arms. I know I do! Huuuuug!
Yeh, girl, it's cool
Needing dysphoria is an outdated part of certain medical criteria, also the definition on those is varied sometimes a bit skeechy.

Don't  get convinced  by transmeds they she trans experience  as only pain and shame until you are post op.
I feel completely the same way. My fem side has become overpowering
If the idea that being the opposite gender makes you feel more comfortable, I have some news about your lack of dysphoria. 

But besides that, sure girl.
Yep, it's fine.  You live your best life, OP.  Don't gatekeep yourself.
Yeah
100%! I prefer to identify my transness through my euphoria rather than dysphoria.
Absofuckinglutely
Don't do it. Being trans is a medical thing not something for fun. If you do decide to go through with medical transition with no dysphoria you will cause yourself to have dysphoria
Yes!! Some times people don’t experience gender dysphoria but only experience gender euphoria when presenting as a certain gender, and experiencing gender euphoria is just as good a reason to transition as gender dysphoria!
what... why would u.....???
??
Wanting to be another gender is the definition. some have dysphoria some (I) don't. it dosent matter.
Totally! That was my first step was realizing how you maybe just prefer being a woman. (However if you're like me you'll also suddenly realized a lot of dysphoria). The only thing you need to be trans is to be trans!
Indeed it is ok, I'm exactly like you, I've never been diagnosed or had a strong reason other than I want to be, and I have always dreamed of being a woman.
No
um you need dysphoria to be trans.. stop appropriating trans people. this sounds super fetishy to me.
you definitely do not need dysphoria to be trans! However, I think that a lot of people sometimes live without an awareness of some of their dysphoria until they are ready to come out to themselves. speaking personally, I had a negative relationship with my body for many different reasons throughout middle/high school, but I never thought I could be trans because I didn’t consciously despise my genitalia and I didn’t rly know what being trans was anyways. I only later saw how much friction there was between my physical body and my sense of self, and how much dysphoria that caused me. I needed to self reflect to see it.

only reason I bring up my experience is to advocate that you/others try to reflect on how you have felt about yourself in the past compared to when you think about yourself living as another gender. it’s possible you’ll recognize forms of dysphoria that you never would have noticed earlier.

and if you genuinely dont feel any dysphoria whatsoever, thats completely fine too! the best advice I’ve heard so far was from Arca (famous, successful trans/nb music producer/icon) saying, “just follow the euphoria.”
I think thats all that matters
Please don’t
Some trans people don't have dysphoria, so for me it's the euphoria that counts, if you feel like it'd be better or more comfortable, etc. For you to be in a feminine body, than that may be an euphoria indicator
Thats very normal not everyone whos trans has dysphoria as long as it makes you happy and makes it feel like its more you its ok
You dont need dysphoria to be trans. I didn’t figure out my gender through gender dysphoria i figured it out through gender euphoria. I do have gender dysphoria but it was mainly finding euphoria that drove my transition
[removed]
You might have Dysphoria, without knowing... Read https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb for more information.

And also: Dysphoria is not what makes you trans, it's just one Symptom! Wanting to be trans is pretty much being Trans already...
My dysphoria showed for me when I looked in the mirror, walked away, and couldn’t remember what I looked like. 

My dysmorphia showed when I would try to see myself in my head I’d look like a balloon animal or a stick figure. 

However, I became so numb to those feeling  because that social role was just there and I assumed that how it was.  But If something feels right for you, then lean into you. Only you will know what’s right for you!

(if you don’t know the difference please read up; the knowledge is so useful in understanding[not diagnosing] yourself)
yes its totally okay, I became trans today
Personally I say yes. I'm uncomfortable as a dude, so Id rather be a bad bitch. Fuck it yolo, y'hear?
Okay, first of all, feeling more comfortable as another gender might help you discover that you experienced dysphoria all along and that you were just used to it! 
The answer is: No. U can change your gender expression to be more feminine! Clothes have no gender you know? ^^
But just chose to b trans is not an option! You'd not only be messing with the percentages and by doing so invalidating the whole community but, if u go on hrt, you'll experience dysphoria as, like u described, u are a male wanting to be female.. that's not how it works, sorry.. u either are trans or not.. so I'd say u discover your gender expression and see if you're satisfied by that. If not, u may be trans. Id advice u do some research on the topic and after that talk to an specialist on the subject <3
I wholenheartedly believe cis people do not *want* to be trans. Youll get a few cis people being assholes about it, making attack helicopter jokes and shit like that, sure. But I've never, in my life, seen a cisgender person earnestly say they want to be transgender. Thats like, the number one sign of being trans. ""I wish I was trans.""

If the idea if being transgender makes you more comfortable, I would argue thats textbook dysphoria as well
Don't feel like you're a fake trans, that's a dangerous path to go down. If you want to be a girl and you're male, you're trans
Maybe you could phrase the question differently? Like, would a cis man want to become a woman? Would a cis man feel more comfortable as a woman? I don't think so, no. So you're very likely not a cis man therefor you are trans.
Euphoria > dysphoria
You don't need dysphoria to be trans, if you're more comfortable being female then you're probably female
The best solution is let yourself be free! Don't let homophobes get to you. They're just Hypocrites that have nothing better to do than be toxic with others. Respect The Gays! And people that are good human beings can prove those bastards wrong.  😝🙌
Since transitioning, I've begun to describe my dysphoria before hatching as an insidious nothingness. I didn't know I had it until I started feeling euphoria and I realized that before then I had zero self-esteem and felt completely adrift from my own body.

Post Parent Edit: Yes, I am much better these days! Transitioning has been amazing. <3
yes because my disphoria after some therapy ive realized its apathy, its a strong apathy for how i look and how i treat myself
I've had a similar experience. It's hard to notice when dysphoria is the water you're swimming in. Since I came out to myself now it's much more acute 🙃
mood.
This is pretty much how it's been for me. Looking back, I probably was dealing with the mildest dysphoria for most of my life, but now that I've started experimenting with my gender expression and self identity it's been hitting me super hard, this past week especially.
This is how I felt when I realized I was gender fluid and I’ve been wondering why I haven’t felt feelings of dysphoria before thank you for sharing because that has caused some issues with me thinking that I’m faking it.
Yeah, I feel this. In retrospect I've always been Dysphoric, and just always suppressed it. I can't believe that I never realized before it. That being said: you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans. It's euphoria that's the connecting line between eachother. <3 you all!
Dysphoria is totally needed, but otherwise I agree
Ive only recently starting to realise wanting to be a girl at 3am almost every night isnt normal....took me long enough. Starting to think the fact i hated and still dont like looking at a mirror cause i never liked how i looked. Starting to realise that when i was 12/13 and looked at a mirror and though ""i look like that ughhh"" might have been a sign. Would that be dysphoria or is it normal to not like looking at a mirror.  

Also relating to alot of posts on r/egg_irl both worries me and comforts me....might start to understand this thing.

Could always be a phase but ive fantasised about being a girl,and alwqys chose female characters in games for years......the whole fantasy thing is getting worse,almost every night at this point.
Yeah I would agree 100%
If you don't have dysphoria about your birth gender and don't feel euphoria about living as the opposite gender, I would argue you do need dysphoria to be trans, or else the risk is pretty high starting to feel dysphoria the moment you start transition.
Thank you so much for posting that❤️
Girl is just objectively the best gender, and it shouldn't make me trans to say it! Still cis tho
Thank you so much I could not have said it better everything everything everything just like me
Quite literally my exact same experience.
Thissssss
Well it is if you read the DSM-5 but the DSM-5 is wrong hopefully they'll change it in the next edition
Yeah.

It's not the Olympics.

It's just people trying their best to be happy.
I might be able to be of service. Is it okay if I ask you some questions?
Not really though. I want to be a guy but I don’t have dysphoria so I’m a girl
I think that you don't exactly know how the DSM-V would categorise as gender dysphoria so here is a source for you. Wanting to be another gender is literally a symptom of gender dysphoria

DSM-V gender dysphoria: https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria
Ya
Preach 👏
I agree but it sounds like they are just confused and not intentionally appropriating
You will be lying to yourself and it will cause mental health problems.
You need to sit down. Especially considering youre invalidating thousands of transgender people who started exploring their gender  specifically because they had feelings along the lines of ""I wish I were trans."" This is an EXTREMELY common line of thinking for people just starting to realize they are transgender.
OMG this is so me I thought I was weird because I never really noticed the dysphoria
These are the things that remind me that I'm on the right path. Before awakening I was hollow with a tiny flicker deep inside. I was going through all the proper motion but felt nothing most of the time. I was happy when it was appropriate but nothing felt permanent. After things changed the world was full of color and wonder the idea that I could and should care about myself became real. I suddenly wanted to be a better person because it was integral to me instead of what I am supposed to be doing. I became able to take care of my life and all the important things in it like my SO and my kids. I didn't feel a need for escapism to feel something. I think its interesting that many others experience this as well.
Yeah same. I went through years telling myself (and everyone else) that there’s no way I could be trans because I don’t have dysphoria. Since then I’ve realized that I *absolutely* have dysphoria, I just didn’t know that that’s what it is. Also of course you don’t need dysphoria to be trans which is what really cracked my egg.
It’s like looking into the mirror and not seeing you and not knowing why or who the hell it is. That was me in a nutshell.
That is kidna given though, if you have neither the need to get away from your birth gender, or the need to go to a different gender, it is very risky to transition, due to the risks of wanting to transition back. However I do think that you can try it out (try being trans/experience it, not transition), to see how it feels and maybe you'll start to actually feel the dysphoria or euphoria you need to understand yourself.

Transitioning should be done when you're confident you know who you are, but you can still experiment. You can try the other pronouns, try having some people call you a new name. Just don't make any permanent changes. Keep it temporary until you know

You're welcome :)
Glad to hear it. I've only cracked a few days ago, so I'm not even sure myself lol.
No actually, while DSM-5 does formally list the diagnosis as ""gender dysphoria"", the actual conditions for that diagnosis can apply to someone with no dysphoria and only euphoria of being a gender that does not align with your AGAB. You only need 2 of the listed conditions to be true, and more than 2 of them have nothing to do with negative feelings about your AGAB. It even says in the glossary that not all trans people experience dysphoria. [https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria)

The conditions for diagnosis in children are a totally different matter, now THEY are messed up.
Sure ask away
Oh dear that is not how it works. 

According to the DSM-v :
""gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults as a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least 6 months"" 

Literally If you think that you are an other gender than the one that you were assigned at birth then you are trans.

Edit: I forgot to add a [source](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria)
It sounds to ms like you're a trans man... just sayin
I do know the classification and that gender euphoria is also considered as dysphoria. Im trying to say as a generalization if you only have euphoria or only dysphoria it's a bad idea to go through with medical transition. The ''symptoms'' of being trans includes both euphoria and dysphoria.

Sorry if I wasn't clear enough!
That's different from being trans *because I want to* so kindly no I won't.
[deleted]
my egg cracked pretty recently and one way I know it is real is that I actually feel motivated to take care of myself and my loved ones, instead of being self-destructive and apathetic for like maybe the first time ever
I don't really see the point of trying out a label, when you don't feel dysphoria/europhoria about transition. That said I know there are very different understandings of euphoria in the very least it is some incongruence between your assigned gender and your gender identity.
You've helped me 😊😊😊
It was removed, can you DM it to me?
Oh I was unaware of that thanks National American Asociation of Mental Illness very cool
What things do you think you're dysphoric about, and why?
I’m not a trans man, I’m perfectly comfortable as  a girl. I just wish I was a guy
I think that I should have been more clear as well.

Being Trans in not strictly a ""medical thing"", though we may disagree on that and I get this,but in many cases social transition can be more important than medical transition. This person never said anything about medically transitioning, they simply stated that they ""want to be a girl"" (which is dysphoria as mentioned before), so I don't understand why you make it(as in that specific post, to be as clear as possible) about procedures and hormones. Social transition is completely reversible so I don't see why we shouldn't allow people to experiment with different pronouns, names, clothes ect. and let them decide about hormones and surgeries when they feel ready.
If you cant see how ""i wish"" and ""I want"" both express a desire for something, and how ""Im more comfortable being trans [than I am being cis]"" is a clear sign of dysphoria, I cant help you
I just never knew anything else, really. So it was impossible to tell.
Yeah I was bullied in school for being overweight and I thought that why I hated my body was because I am overweight but actually that's only a small part of my dysphoria
Well, if you try something new, (say you notice something and it feels out of place, there's no distinct euphoria or dysphoria but it feel like something is off), you might learn what that meant, and in doing so, might see all the things that you didn't like about who you were, because sometimes dysphoria gets written off as just disliking something.
When I first noticed odd things about myself, the only reason I realized I'm trans is because I tried something new, I tried demifemale as my gender and She pronouns, and I felt good about it, trying new things, regardless of Dysphoria or euphoria can be beneficial.
And no this isn't an excuse for people to randomly swap genders going ""oh I want to try it"", you have to still have a reason, you have to have that push to start the cogs turning

Edit: I can understand why you feel that way though, if you believe in that, you believe in that. I cannot change your mind, your opinion is valid and you are the one that controls it.

Ofc not medically transitioning doesn't make one less trans. I bring it up because being trans is very much a neurological condition that is treated to relieve (some to all) distress concerning ones gender (Ex. Social and medical transition). Some people can't transition because it's not safe, they can't afford it, don't have the accessibility to, or their waiting for surgeries to advance and that 100% ok. I have dysphoria and euphoria, In order to relieve most of my dysphoria I have to go through medical transition. Social transition is important too however social transition is reversable so that's also why I brought up medical transition as it brings permanent changes and can be more serious in terms of consideration. To me social and medical transition are equally important.
If you can't see how *being trans because I want to be* and *I wish not to be the gender I am* are different I can't help you either, but that doesn't surprise me, coming from someone who spends time on traaa.
This right here.  I just assumed that’s how everyone felt and it was normal to feel emotionally detached from your body.

Ironically one I started to get my proverbial feet wet and started to figure myself out, dysphoria hit me like a sledge hammer.
If the goal is more than having a label trying out is good. I don't really see our need of all those in between gender expressions, like your mentioned demi female. There is probably some room within the nonbinary sphere, for some other terms, but female leaning enby, or what it is may be a bit off.

Dude I’m literally a detransitioner
??? i know plenty of trans people who didn’t feel uncomfortable as their assigned gender, but simply feel more comfortable as a different one. are you really trying to gatekeep reasonings for being trans? you should be the one going to bed.
I mean, yeah there is a lot of gender identities that are extremely similar, I do think that the quantity of them is very confusing and it's understandable if people don't like that or find it confusing, but even a lot of times different genders can be sort of grouped up, it being acceptable to call a person any of them regardless of which they fit. This allows for people to find what exactly fits them, while not needing everyone around them to understand the exact differences.
Gender is extremely complicated, and it's a lot like maths. There's so much detail and implications for gender, that learning it all isn't very possible, and I feel like that needs to be addressed. There's more and more genders being added and thought of, that are too similar to others, to the point where it's a tad ridiculous. Keeping it super simple isn't an option, but at this point it is a tad too complex
Oh. I didn't realize. Sorry

Awe lets start with one and see what happens"	qg2n5r	trans	565	0.98	2021-10-26 09:30:26
De-transition Awareness Day	"Twitter has informed me that today is de-trans awareness day. While I fully support everyone’s gender journey, I can’t help but have some complicated feelings surrounding some of the posts I’m seeing. Many de-transitioners seem to feel like they were pressured to transition from family or healthcare providers, and seem to be advocating for less accessibility to transition resources. Resources like puberty blockers and HRT- resources that would have saved me years of crippling pain and dysphoria if I’d had access to them before t puberty destroyed my body. 

It is estimated that about 8% of people who transition end up detransitioning to some extent. And of those, about 90% do so out of fear for their physical or social safety. 

Just because it wasn’t right for you doesn’t mean that it’s right to deny access to millions of trans youth around the world. 

We all have a right to our gender identities. Don’t let your mistake (their word, not mine) veer you away from allyship or towards transphobia."	"100% agree, fam. I used to lay on my living room floor and cry because E puberty made my body so misshapen.
It’s worse in the UK, with the tories in charge. It’s impossible to get even blockers before 18 without a court case at this stage apparently (I have limited understanding on the matter) because of how de trans people have been depicting the healthcare system. I understand it wasn’t right for them, but they make it difficult for others
I can promise you, most of those posts will be from trolls/people pretending. Nobody is pressured to transition, and in most countries, it's very difficult to even be allowed to transition. It is naught but a way to discredit trans people
Don’t buy into this crud. TERF’s and the right-wing have formed an uncomfortable alliance on this issue, but the nice thing is our president supports us and we have the winds at our backs. We have to press forward and be visible at all levels of society. We can and will do this. 💕
Speaking of what I'd like to be improved would probably be representation of trans people and information about it. I didn't even know Trans people were a thing until I turned 18, so I was already pretty late when I started questioning which in itself took a bunch more years...

If I was explained what they were in a non condescending way when I was like 10, it would probably have changed my life for the better.
I think it can be hard to support people who detransition because of all the fear mongering that comes from conservatives.
Detransition people have been used as an argument to push a transphobic agenda. So when people mention detransition we get weary because most of the time it’s followed by transphobia. This doesn’t make detrans people any less valid.
This shouldn't be a thing.
I usually say it pretty blunt:

Any person who detransitions (for whatever reason it may be) and therefore starts to try and make transitioning an even harder process than it already is for others, is an absolute worthless person, and I also don't necessarily care if they got affected by TERFs (who do love to pile on vulnerable people like this). It's alright to be frustrated at making a wrong decision, but to put the blame on trans people makes this person a scumbag, period.

I rather have 92 people transition somewhat happily (it is already harder than it needs to be) and deal with 8 cis people (who might not be cis anyways but detransitioned for other reasons), if we take the 8% given here, from memory most of the time those numbers are actually lower in the 3% room.
i didnt De transition persay, but i was one of the many who stuffed themselves back in the closet out of fear for their own safety. it kills me every single day i really wish i could be strong enough to just be who i am but ive had too many straight death threats from strangers to ever feel safe tbh. now even when i Know im safe the memories of getting the shit beaten out of me, or getting kicked out of public spaces, or my parents being my angry then I've seen them in my life. idk if ill ever feel comfortable in my own skin. i cant hell but feel had i had access to puberty blockers of some kind this wouldn't be the case but idk. long story short, a little understanding and empathy can really change someone's life
I detransitioned when I was younger and spent a few years as my agab. there were a few different reasons but they didn't hold up. a lot of my life would be way way easier if I had not done it but I also had experiences in that time that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. It was definitely part of the journey but Idk if I'd do it over again. unfortunately the stories that fit the conservative narrative get a lot more attention than those like mine.
I'd be willing to bet just about anything the vast majority of people actually presenting this stance aren't and never have been trans. It's just transphobes posing as ex(?)trans people.
I really like how you framed this cause it's real complex and how it's politicized also further complicates it

. [It does happen but it's mostly not that they aren't trans but because of pressure, but even so some people who do detransition discover they weren't trans, but then politically it's used to defend anti trans laws -> very complicated]

I really learned a lot about de transitioning from Elle Palmer on YouTube. She's part of the 10% of the 8% that de transitioned cause she realized that she wasn't trans. She also addresses these statics and nuances and explicitly states that it's rare to be in her situation and that she still supports trans rights and everything. 
At least from the few videos of her's I watched.

I recommend folx her videos (a little cautiously cause I think the topic in general can give some dysphoricy vibes, for lack of a better term). I really had not much info on this topic outside of how it's weaponized by conservatives
I guess Twitter just meant awareness for a bad example
Now I will always grow facial hair. My voice will always sound too low and distorted to me. Trans men who decide to get top surgery will always have their scars. Just to name a few examples. It really sucks to see people advocating that this is something trans children deserve to go through. It’s too late for me, but it’s not too late for them.
The story is way worse than you know

The person who filed that court case didn't get their hormones until after the age of 16. My understanding is they've essentially slammed the door for all children in Britain

Over something that didn't even happen to them
Yeah the UK is fucked up right now for trans people.

I’m originally from England with a lot of family there and in Northern Ireland, and I don’t feel like it’s safe for me and my family to travel back there any more - which makes me very sad.
>It’s impossible to get even blockers before 18 

But do they even have any purpose at all at that point?
no no, there are genuine detrans people out there.

except, they just like to peddle the myth that ""society forced them to transition"" as a way of excusing the fact that it was probably them who lied to their therapist as a way of getting HRT for some reason that wasn't related to being trans.

obviously it sucks an incredible lot for them and I genuinely feel for them, but I also feel for the trans kids who have to live their lives with a ruined body and with people gaslighting them into being their AGAB, who are probably living the same exact pain and suffering from dysphoria that detransitioners are.

except the only difference is that detransitioners are treated like children who fell off the monkey bars, while trans people are treated like war criminals.
Sorry, I live in America. You’re right. We actually have it okay here. I know it’s hard in other country’s rn but we HAVE to fight for what’s ours. Nobody is going to just give us our rights.
Look, I lurk on the different detrans subreddits, and some of them are honestly people in pain going through a difficult time after transitioning for the wrong reasons. Yes, some detrans people totally flip and become transphobic and that's bad. It is terrible that detransitioners are used as a weapon against trans people, but that doesn't mean we should throw all them under the bus, and deny them the right to call for awareness altogether.

I believe that awareness about detransitioners is important despite the transphobic crap can sometimes accompany it. For one, it's an important thing for people who are questioning to learn about in deciding whether or not transitioning is right for them. And two, some detransitioners are trans allies, and trans people pushing them away will only alienate them from us.

As trans people, detransition should remind us that not everyone questioning their gender is trans and should transition, and that the best way to help those how are questioning is to encourage them to explore everything, and take time to decide what's best for them.
What shouldn't be a thing?
I think some of you are making it more complicated than it is. Isn't it just that some people have gender dysphoria, transition then the dysphoria changes and they realise they don't want to be transitioned, so they detransition? I've been watching some of their videos. None of those said they were pressured by anyone to detransition, only they felt it inside.
One thing I will say if you are a trans man new top surgery techniques have made scars basically invisible just wanted to say because a lot of people might not be aware
That really brightens my future then. I bloody love the conservatives, always focusing on the right things. Like it’s in their nature to be bigots but they could at least wait for the international problem to end first
I was genuinely unaware of it all too, luckily I’m in the most trans friendly area of the place, but I only found out recently that I won’t be able to get HRT for even longer than if I was on a waiting list. I don’t think a lot of people realise how much damage they’re doing
Scotland is pretty chill though if you overlook the blatant human rights violations committed by the SNP government
Puberty continues for a few years after that, especially for facial and body hair growth. But, for the most part, the effects on bone growth, muscle development, and so on are done. It's messed up because if puberty blocking were generally accepted, the risk of transition regret would go down since gendered development would be delayed by some number of years. (In order to ensure proper development after resuming, they can only delay certain effects so long, so which effects are blocked varies.)
Adding on, you have to be on blockers for a year before HRT at least as a minor under the NHS
I completely believe there are people out there who felt something they perceived as pressure to transition, and then detransitioned when they discovered that it wasn't right for them.

I also believe there are people out there who felt transition was right for them, then discovered that it actually wasn't, and have used ""pressure from society, etc"" as a reason for why they transitioned in the first place in order to reduce how much of a mistake they're owning up to.

And finally, I believe the vast majority of people who decide to detransition do so out of a loss of insurance or financial capability to continue their transition, threats to their safety, health and wellbeing, and just overall unhappiness feeling like a persecuted class in society or a combination of all of these reasons.
>society forced them to transition

What society to they live in? A conservative fever dream version of Portland?
Of course there are real detrans people, no doubt. But all research shows that it's very few, and only a tiny tiny part of them do it because they regret it, and not out of outside pressures/circumstances. I'm talking about the people online who peddle detrans stories as a reason as to why no one should be allowed to transition. I'm willing to bet that very very few of them have ever transitioned, let alone detransitioned.
yep, there are plenty of genuine detrans people. and they get preyed on and manipulated by the terfs. chewed up and spat out when they're no longer useful.
De-transition awareness day should not be a thing. It's just an excuse to attack trans rights.
I'm not negating their experience. I'm saying that a whole day devoted to it will do more harm to the community than good (which includes trans people who decide to detransition).
Only for smaller chests, right? Anyways, surgeons in my country won't learn it for years... :/
I’m sorry to hear that. Yeah the wait times are out of control 😩
[deleted]
Yeah, it is one thing to validate the people who did ""de-transition"" and another thing to make a WHOLE DAY dedicated to it.
I think it should be a thing, but it shouldn't be a valid excuse to attack trans rights. It should be a day for people to actually learn or be educated about why people detransition, the stats and how the only solution is to make resources more accessible and easy to experiment with.
it's terf propaganda, nothing more.
It is a bit like ""I prayed the gay away"" day or something...
Which,  is very icky. 
And definitely used as an excuse to attack our rights.
only for small chests yes :/
I just picked a random liberal west coast city for that example. That using and San Francisco would have been a little to cliched for my liking."	m3lwkb	trans	569	0.99	2021-03-12 17:01:49
My spark of hope has left me.	"I’m a trans girl and I don’t know what to do. It’s not even dysphoria, it’s thinking about my future. I’ve never had anyone hate me, period. Now I know people will hate me just for being who I am. Lots of people. I don’t know what to do, I’ve always been optimistic and cheerful, but now I feel like I’m frayed and tired. I can’t stop thinking about how full of hate this world is, it pushes me further and further into the closet. I should never have come out to my friends and brother, it just makes interactions with them tense in case they use my chosen name and pronouns, as I don’t want to have anyone hate me. I don’t have a hateful family, nor do I live in a transphobic area. I’m just very scared my perceptions might be wrong, that my life will fall apart if I come out. I’ve become reclusive, I don’t want anyone to see me, because those who know can’t say my chosen name or pronouns without outing me, and those who don’t know… don’t know. It’s like I just found out the light at the end of the tunnel was fake, like it just flickered out. I’m sorta paranoid as it is, now I feel like people are out to get me for being trans. I’m in such a bad mindset and I don’t know how to escape, I can’t destress, I need to do work. I can’t rest, I need to destress. It’s a constant loop that’s leading me to spiral downwards.
I’m exaggerating my problems for attention, probably. So that someone will find me, someone with no real problems, and forget about the people that have actual problems. I need encouragement…"	"Live. That is what you do. Make one step at a time to be who you are. You will lose people but you will also gain other people. Life will move on and theoretically be better.
When I get like this, and I'm sure there'll be more of us who do, I like to think about a couple of things:

- On the days where I feel like I can't do it for me, I like to think about all the hundreds of thousands of trans people who came before me and the millions that will come after. I like to think of how even just by existing now as my self, it'll be just a little bit easier for the next person after me, and so on and so on, until hopefully no-one will ever worry like I did.

- When I worry about how people will act when I'm out in nice clothes or talking about it with people, I remember that that's completely non-existent transphobia trying to control me. I've made it up, no-one has told me anything, said anything, so why am I letting it control my life? It's easier said than done, but just taking a moment to be like ""Nope, that's just my internalised stuff being a dick"" helps me process it.

- When I get really hung up on all the negative stuff I see on Facebook pages and Reddit posts, I remember that this is something most of those people will never have actually encountered, let alone have had explained to them. When it's a friend, family or even a coworker in front of them, I like to think that for most people (and in my experience so far, everyone) the lightbulb clicks, the hate was pointless, and they realise it's just to make me finally feel truly happy.

- When I feel like it's all in my head and I'm doing it for attention, I like to read about trans stuff. Sometimes fiction, sometimes resources. Helps me reconnect with that feeling of calm and happines, the reason I'm doing it all in the first place, even if I'm not ""doing trans"" like I think I should be right that minute.

I hope some of that resonates with you. It takes a lot of energy to keep positive, but it's worth it! Feel free to reach out if you want to chat!
You say it’s not dysphoria, but it sounds like it is, at least in part. Dysphoria, in concert with Imposter Syndrome will scare the living daylights out of you, sadden you, and fill you with despair. 

If you come out and live your best, most authentic life, you may be surprised just how much your heart lifts.
see a therapist if you’re able. There’s people who will like the real you and if you’re hiding then you’re not meeting them. Remember there’s good as well as bad.
Coming out is one of the hardest things to do, especially without the support of friends and family.

It’s like you’re shedding a layer of skin that you’ve used for so long and gotten used to, and to make matters worse, the new exposed skin is incredibly sensitive and everything touching it  hurts. But as you keep moving forward, that new skin starts to strengthen. You (sadly) get used to the hate and doubt to the point where you can just shrug it off (for the most part anyway).

But that feeling of no shedding that outer layer, while painful, also takes a lot of weight off your shoulder and you begin to feel free for this first time. You no longer have a shameful “secret” anymore, you’re just *you*. It’s a good feeling

Sending you lots of love ❤️
I thought once like you are now. The result was my spending 30 years pretending to be something I wasn’t. The damage that does is impossible to explain but it permeates every aspect of your life. It poisons you. I suppose the question is whether it’s better to deal with enemies from without, or an enemy from within.
I was talking to a door to door salesman yesterday who was trying to lay on a thick layer of FOMO for this “sweet solar panel” deal. 

After making it clear I wasn’t interested, he said he just wanted to make sure I “wouldn’t lose hope”

My reply was “I’m trans, I don’t have hopes. I have cynical pragmatism and goals to complete”

He laughed.

However, I’ve realized hope is largely abused. Most people tend to progress in life when it’s most convenient; they wait for the situation to fall into the most agreeable way to accomplish something.

It is in this waiting that most people “hope” for things.

In my transition, I learned to stop waiting, make it happen, even if it fucks things up. Especially if it fucks things up
I will tell you, people I thought would hate me, have become some of my closest allies. Don't close yourself off to potential friends just because one of them might turn out as an enemy. It happens in life, trans or not. So please just remember that there is always hope, you are not alone, and you are loved!
There has been an uptick in conservatives fussing about trans issues. But they are doing that because they are on the defensive. They know they are losing. They are on the losing side of history.

The rest of the country is moving forward. And trans rights will benefit everyone in society.
living out of spite is the main reason I'm still alive today.
This is a follow-up. Thank you for all your kind words. I’m typically not this sad or anything, it’s just been a lot the last week or two, from me figuring out I was trans to the invasion of Ukraine to Greg Abbot’s… stuff. It just felt like I didn’t matter, that the world was gonna end and nobody would bat an eye at my existence, except to mock me.

But I remembered what me and my friend talked about to each other. If your life doesn’t have a meaning, then why not live it how you want? If you have no future, then enjoy the present, and the future will come and go as you do. I know we’re all stressed right now. I just was focusing on all the strife in the world. My spark of hope didn’t blink out. I just misplaced it. But I’ve gone through that mental junk drawer, and found my misplaced spark, as well as some random song lyrics. I’ve got a lot of opportunities. I love the arts, I love history, I love language… and if I know anything from Wikipedians, it’s that pedants don’t gatekeep based on your immutable aspects. They gatekeep based upon menial knowledge, and I know I got a lot of that. Sure, I’m a trans girl. But if anyone wants to stop me for being me, saying I’m just a man, then I guess I’ll just have to act how men are supposed to act: Strong, tough and not taking crap from anybody. We’ll see if they like me as a man then.

Again, thanks for the kind words and advice. My existence is mine to insult, and if other people do… My friend said that they might learn martial arts to deal with transphobes. Maybe I could ask them for help.
Your fear is understandable. It's so hard when we don't know if people will accept us the way we are. But you know what? We'll never find out unless we try. I'm not saying that it is not a possibility that you might lose a few people but there's another side too. You will finally be able to be yourself, openly and unapologetically. You'll know the people who love and care about you. Until we fight our fears they'll keep chasing us but once we face it we'll be able to see the rainbow. How would we know how bright the day is if we are stuck in the pitch black of night? Do what you like, express whenever you want but always remember, hope can't leave you cause you are hope too. 🌻✨
*hugs*
It's hard being trans, to be honest. The way I started to accept everyone was to just keep moving and find solidarity and friendship with trans people. Please don't give up hope. One day everything will be better.
Honestly, you shouldn’t care. Them not liking you is not a you problem, it’s a them problem that you’re internalizing, and choosing to carry with you. And yes, you may be overwhelmed. But, there is a chosen family out here that will be supportive, uplifting and loving of you for exactly as you are. Do not change yourself for ANYONE. No one else’s approval is either required or desired. Try and navigate social circles that are accepting.
Take each day one at a time and worry only about the stuff you can control. That’s all any of us can do.

At 62 I feel your pain. Being Sophie cost me a 9 year relationship however it was the best 250lbs I ever lost. 

I am alone. Im staying in a motel room. I have no family to speak of. I have two brothers. One doesn't want anything to do with me. I'm a freak of nature and he and his wife hate me because of who I am. My other brother enjoys seeing me homeless and when I have seen him really enjoys saying cruel things things to me and likes the fact that I'm homeless. He married a woman that was our mothers age. She died a month ago and lives alone in a 3 bedroom house that she had when he married her. Before that he lived with our mom. Three times he lived with me when my life was better and owned my home along with the bank. 

He was the thing that wouldn't leave when living with me. He didn't want to work, pay rent or food and now that my life has fallen apart won't let me stay at his place. Partially because to him im a freak and I'm an embarrassment so I work everyday and live in my car mostly. 

They both say our mom wouldn't accepted me but she knew and was excepting of me. My ex wife was accepting and on Halloween 1984 dropped me off at mom's and gave me an hour tl talk to my mom while she waited in the car and then came in the house. In that hour I had a great conversation with my mom. She knew about Sophie before I really knew. She knew I was trying on her clothes when I was a teen and wondered if I was going to come out. She liked the thought of having a daughter. For my birthday I would get a present in front of the family and then another one in private. After she passed and I came out I tried telling both my brothers that she knew but they didn't believe me. 

I have never felt so alone in my life as I do now but I also know that this part of me was never going to go away. Either way I lose. I have to be true to myself. To accommodate my brothers and not be true to myself would be worse than not being me. My regret was not coming out when i was younger but i felt i couldn't. Now Im alone and call myself the old bag lady. Who knows how my life would have turned out if I had transitioned when i was 18 or even 24. Back then I fooled my ex brother in law. He was giving me lines of coke and ran his hand up my leg then told him knock it off. He swore me to secrecy or threatened to beat me up. 

If this is truly how you feel it won't ever go away. Trust me. You should seek out a gender therapist. 

Good luck.
Live your life one step at a time. One foot in front of the other, I'm in a situation where my whole school knows except for my sister, which makes going to school a living hell, but you need to step forward. You need to be optimistic. We're here for you💖
You poor poppet. Listen, you are who you are. That is you, an individual free to love and be loved no matter in what shape or form that love takes. I can’t promise you that everybody will love you or even like you, I only wish I could. But there will be, and I hope it’s lots, who will. You say your family accept you? well that’s a very good start; we all need the love of the family. I’m sure you will find a special person who will love you for who you are not who people think you should be. The important thing, and I stress this most strongly, is that you remain STRONG and RESOLUTE in your own belief of who you are now and where you want to go.
This is anxiety causing you to make assumptions about how others will react. I went through the same thing. I’ll never regret coming out to the world though, but I was so scared before.
You live. You grab life by the balls and pull. If you don't think you're beautiful? MAKE yourself beautiful. People hate on you? Look down on them. Laugh. They're lesser, they're inferior, they can't think for themselves. Be you, achieve your dreams, conquer your own life.
We're all here for you I hope you get out of this mental state someday.😭🏳️‍⚧️
Go see a therapist if there is one in your area. I suggest you try to come out in little baby steps/give hints that you're not cisgender. I wish you the best of luck ❤
I think you’re gonna read this post in a year and just laugh!!! You have a beautiful opportunity to be embraced and accepted I say take it while you can bc not many of us get the option to!!!! Enjoy every ounce of it
Take things a day at a time. The only attitude you control today is your own. Love yourself, and know that you are worthy of love. The tunnel is still there and you may need to look for the light sometimes, but keep your head up. Find your support system (your brother and friends) and you will know you're not alone. You also have support here. Be safe and never give up the light you carry inside.

Heck, this is exactly my typical stance on life. I have some cynical friends, I was doubting that it was a correct. Thank you.
The stuff about the violence was only figurative/just me flexing my confidence. Please do not fight me, I am but a frail lass…
What might these hints be?
?? Why would you say this?/gen
Yeah I have to be reminded of this sometimes. I also struggle with the idea of losing people but recent events have made it obvious that anyone that would leave because of who I am is a person not worth keeping.
Been there... those people aint ya *friends*
Uhhhhh maybe bring up lgbtq-related stuff to someone in a conversation (not sure what else to say 😭😭) That's what I did to give my parents a hint that I'm bisexual. When I decided that I wanna come out, I wrote a story about a teenager coming out as bisexual to his friends and once I showed it to my mom, I guess she finally got the hints and was like, ""Are you trying to tell me something?"" I came clean when she asked me that.
They are just being an asshole, ignore them
Honestly yeah I know my aunt will reject me once she learns, but shes always been envious of our family for a while now.
Heck, I’ve been wanting an excuse to write a comic!
I looked at their history, they are just the typical bigot troll clawing desperately for attention
Well I just gave you one excuse!

After a while you will get thicker skin. It sucks we have to put up with this but if we let it get to us the consequences can be even more damaging. Try to find activities that get you out of the funk when it hits. I take a candle lit bath with soft music.

Had to be checked before I start working and I am fucking broken rn	"Hi 🎂
I just have to vent about it and here is a good place. 
I had to do my pre-work checks (if I am able to work and shit) so I went to the clinic that does all that. 
I will say that cause I guess it is kinda important - it's all in Poland. 
So I still have my dead name and a wrong gender on my ID, right? But my looks are not THAT masculine at this point (I can't be love I am saying that with all the dysphoria I am experiencing). I go in, looking like a fucking princess and like, you know, I start registering. The lady there was nice to me. She reason the card, where I specified I am on HRT and stuff and she goes ""oh sure, every pretty lady can fill this paper"", and gave me the paper. That was heart warming. But everything that happens after, isn't. So I gave her my ID, and the longer she was looking at it and writing down informations, I felt more and more bad. At the end, when I got registered and received all the papers about where do I go and stuff, I start sobbing cause I see all the informations I don't want there to be. Even more I had to fill a card about my health and in Poland you have to fucking cross words on the card that do not match YOUR GENDER, which made me even more sad. 
First doc didn't even stutter to misgender and deadname me. I just say on the fucking chair and literally cried while he was checking me. 
Went out, and went to another doc. She just looked at, at the paper, and with a cold stare in the eyes said ""so is everything okay MISTER"". I was at the fucking edge. I started crying even more. I just went out without a word, taking my papers. The whole one hour walk home I  couldn't stop crying, and even today I am still a fucking mess and can't get this out of me. 
It's not for me. 
The only thing I can think about is just ""I'm so sad I was born like that"". 
W/e. I just had to write it down somewhere and get this shit out of me cause why not. 
I hope you will have a good day at least. My transgender week did not start well. 
🎂🧡🐼"	"Dang sis.. i really hope things'll get better for ya soon and im only a  dum 17 yr old but if ya need to talk to someone i can be here for ya. :<
I am incredibly sorry for this, and I know a strangers comment on reddit probably will not help that much but girl, we are here all for you. Everyone has had experiences like this, some worse and some not that bad but we all understand the struggle and we all support each other. Thank you for sharing even if it was hard to remember the details, but for me it shows inmense strenght and bravery to share experiences such as this one. Don't ever give up Queen <3
Oh fuck that. 

You deserve better, and those stupid fucking doctors will get their karma.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Not fun. But you've got this girl!
Poland is SO backwards about this stuff.  And the government is pushing all the time to make it MORE backwards.

I'm so sorry this is happening to you.
I'm so sorry for that!! You deserve respect, being examined while crying is absolutely NOT OK. Doctors should be more human and empathetic. Sending virtual hugs your way <3
That is no way for professionals to treat a beautiful lady like HoeMia.  They should be ashamed, not you.
All the hugs!
This is the path we must take till we finish our dream.  There are haters and jealous people out there that live to hurt others.  Hang in there and be the proudest and best you can be.  We are your sisters and have cried the tears with you.  Don’t let them make you cry.  Your pillow is for that.  I transitioned in a security setting, dominated by males, and now a blonde girl gives 70 of them orders.   Huggs and be Beautiful.
Girl I feel you 
The place that gets me my hrt deadnames me every time it’s unbelievable.

I really hope your female week goes girly from now on.
And if you ever need to talk (or a place to run away to) I’m here to listen (and about three hours away from Poland)
I don’t even know what to say.

I hope things get better for you.
My heart goes out to you. Every doctor around the world who utters the creed should know first to do no harm and it harms literally nobody to respect one's gender and to recognise they are a valid person no matter what or how convicted they are of their identity. Any doctor who behaves otherwise and fails to treat a person as a person ought not to practice.
That sounds horrible. I can barely handle being misgendered too much, so I can't imagine how that felt. Im so sorry about that
Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened hon. People can really suck sometimes, I'm sorry. If you need to talk to someone, my inbox is open. We're all rooting for you girl!
They tried to take your dignity and they failed. Stay strong.  You know the truth.  You are a beautiful, fucking woman!
Show them my links below. I'm proud, not shy, gay, embarrassed, ashamed, afraid -  no regrets of becoming Trans Woman. Post-op since 2018.

Reading this I just wanted to go psycho and threaten the 2 assholes who misgendered you... I hate this
I am so sorry you had to experience. Although the world is changing, it changes slowly, and there will always be people so consumed by their own hatred and ignorance they will never be able to free themselves. Please think about that. You are freing yourself to be who you know they are. They will probably be trapped in the vile cesspool of their own minds forever. Listen, I know this doesn't help how you feel now, but do not let anyone defeat you. This is YOUR LIFE! It is up to you fight for yourself. I find it helps me when I look at people who try to harm me (over anything) and instead of anger I feel pity for them. It is empowering and liberating. Good luck. :)
Stuff like this infuriates me. They knew exactly what they were doing and how they were hurting you intentionally. Don’t worry about those scum bags they’ll get theirs
Ohh ✨ thank u sm 🧡 I'll remember that for sure 🐼
Thank you for the support 🙈✨
Yes, Poland does not at all seem like a safe place for trans folx. OP, I would seek asylum somewhere else in the EU if you can.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Poland
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT-free_zone
Reminds me of the quote:
“Sometimes people use ‘respect’ to mean ‘treating someone like a person’ and sometimes they use ‘respect’ to mean ‘treating someone like an authority’
“And sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say ‘if you don’t respect me, I won’t respect you’ and they mean ‘if you don’t treat me like an authority I won’t treat you like a person’
“And they think they’re being fair but they’re not and that’s not ok”
From someone on Tumblr
Ur welcome pleaae have a very good day ☺
Poland is an EU country, anyone in Poland can move to any other EU country - no asylum necessary.

The issue is it's expensive to move, it's hard to find meaningful work, you have to leave your family behind, you have to learn a new language etc.

Moving isn't an option for everyone sadly - even if legally allowed at any time and like moving from Alabama to New York as far as legality.

Do you need dysphoria to be trans?	"This is meant to be merely a question, not aimed at anyone in particular. I'd just like to see peoples reasoning for their opinnions, not just ""you're transphobic if you don't think this way"" or ""you're fake if you think that way"". Please, just explain your views respectfully, or don't do it at all"	"I don't know and I actually also don't really care. When someone tells me they're trans I need to respect them and treat them the way they ask me to. If they eventually realize that they were mistaken and aren't trans, they will say it and I need to respect that too. Truth is, that we can't see what's going on inside someone's head and we often have to just trust them on what they are saying.
I think everyone does experience some form of dysphoria, but I don’t think it’s noticeable as that for some people until it goes away and they get euphoria as a replacement. [insert the Allegory of the Cave here]. Euphoria at changes is a better indicator, I think.

Edit: [Someone just posted this Twitter Thread in another post. this is what I mean!](https://mobile.twitter.com/nightlingbug/status/1215716433210105856)
Well, here's the thing, dysphoria is very personal and confusing. If it ever is considered, you can't ignore the fact that someone can be EXTREMELY dysphoric, but not understand it as dysphoria.

If we are doing a thought experiment, saying that the subject 100% doesn't have it, I'd still err on the side of saying no. When I was still in denial, I'd just hardcore disassociate. Knowing what I experienced in that state, I'd argue that positive feelings alone could qualify someone as trans.

It's all quite messy if you try to come up with blanket statements to cover every situation. I find the statement ""dysphoria is required to be trans"" has holes in it, so I have to disagree with it.
Gender is how YOU feel, stop worrying about how other people think of you.  We all suffer from other people's opinions about us and that's OK.  You don't need to put yourself down because somebody else is telling you to act a certain way.  (That's exactly how I lived up until I started embracing my own feelings)  I am now a Fem Man and I am proud AND happy.
Nope. Just like you don't need to be hungry to want food. Everything and everyone is valid
Yes and no.  I think dysphoria is much broader than the debilitating stress and pain it’s often associated with, so there are probably a lot more dysphoric trans people than we know.  I also used to be a transmed so while I’ve separated myself from the ideology, I sometimes have a hard time grasping transness without dysphoria.  That being said I believe a lot of transmed ideas are rooted in pain.  When I started feeling better about my own body I stopped caring about others’.  Whatever the factual answer to the question is, it doesn’t retract everyone’s right for their identity to be respected at face value.  I also agree with everyone here that euphoria is a better indicator than dysphoria.
Not at all. And dysphoria is a catch all phrase which lacks nuance.
No but yes? If someone tells me they're trans I don't question it. If I don't see dysphoria I don't question it at all.

BUT I also assume it is there in some form or another.

Up until the point I started HRT I didn't ever think of myself as someone with dysphoria. That's because our definition of dysphoria (as a culture at large) is incredibly narrow. There are so So SO many things that all of us go through that we just don't think of as dysphoria because we act like dysphoria is an extreme thing--a synonym for heavy trauma. 

It took me lots of therapy to acknowledge that small things like...

--Feeling indifferent towards my body

--Not understanding how people could find me attractive

--Feeling generally out of place in a locker room

--Being sad when I was excluded from girls only events

--A persistent daily rumination of living my life as a different gender from my AGAB...

All that stuff? That's dysphoria. We just don't call it that yet. And I don't know a single trans person who doesn't have some version of that even if they don't think of it as dysphoria.
Not at all. I don’t have any dysphoria. Being non binary makes me feel happy, while being a man is neutral.
[deleted]
I think it depends on how you define gender dysphoria, like if you think it's any gender incongruence then yeah (though some people would say that's just 'being trans' and not gd). If you think gender dysphoria is an extreme dislike of being your agab then definitely you don't need it to be trans.
I asked my gender therapist once what she thought about this and she said that the criteria to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria is to meet 3 of the things listed in the dsm5 and she said there are three of them that are gender euphoria ones. You can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria even if you only experience gender euphoria.
Short answer: No.  
  
Long answer: No. The only thing required to be trans is that you identify as a gender other than the one you're assigned at birth. Dysphoria is not needed for an identity to be valid.
I've wondered that actually. Like if a trans person doesn't experience dysphoria, is It just a vibe/feeling that they have to know they're trans? i wonder how that would feel like. there would be zero discomfort with their own gender, but just a innate desire to be another gender. obv I'm not here to pick a fight, I'm just curious to know what that would feel like and how people would know that they're trans that way
Just a little I think
I don’t understand why anyone would want to transition without at least a little discomfort but ultimately it’s none of my business what people choose to do. I guess as someone who was horribly dysphoric before starting t it’s difficult for me to understand what other motivations or indications someone might have to make them realize that they’re trans.
The most important thing is euphoria, dysphoria is not that important
Nah
Trying to be brief the answer is no imo. You aren’t fake if you don’t have it but are trans.
You must certainly don’t have to have gender dysphoria to be trans. In my own experience I never really had it. There are times where I do feel a little dissatisfied and unhappy but then I just try to think that it’s all part of the journey and that I’m still growing and learning. But don’t let anyone tell you or try to define your Trans identity. Be who you are and don’t feel bad because you are having a different experience than other Trans people.
Absolutely not. While dysphoria is a huge indicator of being trans it is not a requirement. 

And that's not to mention the countless people who experience dysphoria and don't recognize it as such.
I feel that dysphoria should not be viewed as an ""end all be all"". personally, i worried that i was convincing myself i was trans as a teenager. only a few weeks ago, after nearly two years on HRT, i let myself cry in the shower for the first time. that same day was later filled with repressed memories flooding back (in agonizing fashion).

my first time seeing a trans woman was in 5th grade, on a porn site, under the tag of a slur. this was all i really knew until 8th grade when a teacher began her transition. the words from gossiping students were about as one would expect from 2012-ish. unsurprisingly, i ended up with a ton of internalized transphobia. until pretty recently, i believed what i heard about not showing signs. this is coming from a girl who preferred to speak in head voice, shaved her legs until confronted about it, and tried to push parts back into herself in the mirror. 

my point with this is that what even ""is"" dysphoria can be *extremely* muddled for some. i now firmly believe that gender euphoria is THE best indicator that someone is trans for this very reason.
I mean it’s not up to me and i’ll respect anyone who says they’re trans, i just don’t understand how you could be trans without dysphoria. Like, that’s the whole reason you transition, because it feels wrong. Otherwise, there’d be absolutely no reason to go through all the changes. But i do think dysphoria can take a lot of different forms.
https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en

Here be good answers.
I assume your question is... do you need to experience dysphoria to decide that you are going to become trans?

I guess that is a good question. Since trans don't particularly enjoy there birth stuff so they had to have experienced dysphoria to decide they were going to swap. But I would imagine there are probably people out there who were completely happy being a cis male or cis female. Then just decided they would be happier being a trans.

I mean going from your birth gender to trans doesn't always require you to have been unhappy even though it is probably a driving reason for a lot of people.

With that being said I would say no dysphoria is not needed to be trans.

(Assuming I understood your question)
i think dysphoria is a big part of being trans, but i also  think everyone should be able to identify however and with whatever they want. maybe that way of thinking is flawed? as long as they arent someone posing as trans for clout/attention/etc then who really cares?
I don't give a shit. You tell me you're trans, you're trans to me. I don't fucking care. What are your pronouns? I'll fuckin use em. Literally couldn't care less about euphoria or dysphoria or fuckin pissphoria. We're all miserable in our own special ways and I don't fucking care enough to gatekeep people for not being miserable in the same way as me. Fucking stupid. Jesus Christ.
I..like a lot of transgender people had it hard af growing up from a young age and the throughout my teens, Some realise later. some people are lucky an start in their teens or early 20’s but i started in my early to mid 30’s it got so bad I had to just had to start. But then I have seen and read about people that have zero dysphoria and rush into transitioning then later realising oh this is not doing anything and then they end up de transitioning. I feel complete now on hrt and the only dysphoria I get now is my genitals, yes I do feel like you have to have dysphoria to be trans from my experience like I didn’t choose to be this way it’s not a fad.
No. Being trans just means that you don't completely fit with your birth gender. It doesn't always mean that you're going from MtF or FtM. Dysphoria doesn't always mean trans, like how the urge to sleep constantly doesn't always mean depression. Transgender is sort of like a spectrum, considering that gender is also a spectrum, as is male and female. There is no right way to be trans, and there is no right way to be whatever you are. Just live your life to the fullest, preferably without bringing others down
Ok. Idk if i have a hot take on this but.

I honestly think that dysphoria is a HUGE part of our trans experiences. If not for dysphoria i don’t know why you’d want to go through all of the messed up
shit we have to get through just to be happy in our body. That being said, if you truly believe that you will be better off after transitioning and going through all of that process (not driven by needing to escape dysphoria, suicidal thoughts and actions, humiliation) then more power to you. I support you.
I think the act of you saying you’re trans means you subsequently have dysphoria. Wether it’s social, body, or mental dysphoria. If you enjoy your birth gender any less than the current gender you’d like to identify as, you have dysphoria, some people think that means you need to hate yourself to be trans but that doesn’t make sense because there’s plenty of people who have fully transitioned that love themselves. If you think having dysphoria means you hate your body, social image, mind, then no obviously not but gender dysphoria. Maybe people get it confused with dysmorphia, idk why this was ever a question but no, we’re not some exclusive access group that require something to identify the way we want to. It’s not a requirement it’s more like a part of the label. For example, if you play Minecraft you’re a gamer, you don’t need to be a gamer, you just are. If someone says you need to be a gamer to play Minecraft that wouldn’t make sense because Minecraft, is a game. Maybe if someone says a “real gamer” which in this case would be “real dysphoria,” but at that point it’s just their own hyper-fixated definition of a word sure, then, that could be up for debate but it’s not really a point to debate over.
I've always believed that every trans person has dysphoria, it's just some people don't know that dysphoria is what that feeling is. For the longest time I didn't think I had any until one day it clicked that there was a reason I felt strange being called ""young lady.""
I think basically every trans person experiences dysphoria but it's not a requirement. I would say the only requirement is that you enjoy feeling and being perceived as a gender different from the one assigned to you at birth.
No you don’t
To explain further, I figured it out through gender euphoria while cross dressing and ppl telling me they thought I was a cis woman. After that, I realized I had always lived with gender dysphoria but was never able to draw the connection between dysphoria episodes and my gender identity. But yea some people figure out they’re trans through gender euphoria and will never/have never felt dysphoria. If you feel much better being seen as a gender you weren’t born into, you’re trans. If you feel distress about being forced to live in a certain way based on you’re sex assigned at birth you are also trans. I think truscum people are gatekeepy and subject others to the same bigotry that they themselves don’t like being subject to. They also sometimes think trans people who don’t experience dysphoria invalidates their identities. It’s just wack honestly let ppl live
Dysphoria is how many trans people discover they are, but it's not a requirement. All that matters is that a person has the power to self determine the identity that feels best to them.
I believe no! I think you can appreciate your body but still want it to be expressive. Not to knock anyone with dysphoria.
No you dont need dysphoria to be trans, it’s not necessary, some trans people experience it but not all of us
I think the big issue is people don't understand what dysphoria really means. The tropical impression of dysphoria is that you HATE your body and would do anything to be rid of it. That is extreme dysphoria. There is also moderate dysphoria where your not happy with part of your body and would like to change it but that it doesn't cause mental trauma. I.e. non trans people might feel this way if they're over weight. Then there is minor dysphoria where someone might be ok with they're body but at the same time feel that it's not right for them.

 In order to be trans you need to feel one of theses three otherwise why would you change your body?
Imo no, I used to think different but after sitting on the thought for a while I decided it didn’t make sense. Why should a person have to feel uncomfortable in themselves in order to be ‘valid’? I could go much deeper into how gender is a social construct and thus gender dysphoria is only a result of that! 

It’s like; you’ve been eating this one kind of ice cream for all your life and you don’t really mind it, it’s just not your favourite, and then you find out there are many many more flavours you could try; you dislike some off them but eventually you find one that is so much better than the old one and choose to stick with it!

edit: spelling
No. Being trans isn't something that should be gatekept, and the more we try to define what being trans is or isn't, the more exclusive the community becomes. The only ""requirement"" for being trans is: a) being a gender that isn't 100% your agab, and b) identifying with the 'trans' label
Being trans is being unhappy in your current body and wanting to change it into the body of a different gender that's all that's necessary to be trans (to me at least). You may not see how you feel as dysphoria but it probably is
I don't think you need dysphoria, you don't need anything but your own judgement and people should respect your human experience as equally valid no matter what. But like I think it's extremely relevant when discussing this topic to point out that a lot of people experience shitloads of dysphoria and don't realize it or don't attribute it to gender. I don't say that to lend credence to the other side of this but because like, if you are pursuing answers about your own identity, you may only be able to truly see the dysphoria once you've accepted yourself and your subconscious stops repressing it
Absolutely not- dysphoria is not inherently part of the trans experience. The only inherent trans feeling is basically ‘oh, something was wrong, I want to change things about the way I’m existing in relation to gender right now’ or even just ‘I don’t hate things as they are but I would prefer to be this gender’, and then dysphoria is less a natural product of that (although sometimes it is) but society being really shorty about gender roles and beauty standards
Yes.
No. In my book, as long as you'd feel better and be happier if you were another gender/sex, then you can be trans. Most people do have dysphoria, myself included, and hate being their AGAB but it is by no means a prerequisite. It just is more evidence.
I spent a long time trying to work this out. I like expressing myself  in a way that's not aligned with my gender, but I don't have dysphoria, so I'm just a crossdresser, right.

Labelled myself that way for years, lived with as an embarrassing and shameful secret.

I've now realised that actually, I'm lucky. I get the euphoria of a bit of perfume but not the downside of hating my physical sex characteristics.

So I'm trans.
I feel like you don't exactly need it, but I feel like theres people who claim to be trans just because they want to and don't feel actual dysphoria, you either need euphoria or dysphoria to be trans
After reading thru a bunch of these comment threads. I notice 2 problems here, nobody has the same definition of gender dysphoria - how are we even supposed to have a conversation if we are all using slightly (or wildly) different meanings for the word. The second issue seems to be that a lot of people are extrapolating from their experiences and trying to apply that to other people, which makes sense, so much of the trans identity is internal with no good ways to compare with other people, our experiences are truly our own.

I don't think you need to have gender dysphoria to be trans, it is just a good indicator, as well as gender euphoria. These 2 things are just reactions to you being trans, there are other ways for your mind and body to react to your identity. We are complex beings.

If you had asked me a year ago if I had gender dysphoria, I would have said no. However, now that I have experienced euphoria and have something to contrast different feelings with, I have experienced mild dysphoria all my life ~ I have just adapted various ways to avoid feeling it (subconsciously in my case). The way my subconscious handled my dysphoria and hid that I was trans (until it didn't anymore) probably saved my life. Had I come out in my 20s, when I first dealt with anything remotely gender related, I would have been in conversion therapy (trying to be that good xian boy) ~ that experience would probably have lead to an early retirement from life.

Here is what I think makes trans people their gender and not their sex which also applies to this question.   
First of all, gender is a thing. Is it different from sex? Seems like it. I mean what do all of the 0.6 people in the world feel like? What they feel is gender and it's different from sex by definition. it's what all of these people feel. Now if there are 2 things gender and sex, what does society care about? No one really has a reason to care about sex just gender, so trans people are their gender socially not their sex. This also applies to people without dysphoria. It's just basic respect and what people need to care about.
Nope
Euphoria for the opposite is just as valid
Then again I kinda fail in there. I don't have bottom dysphoria but I get intense euphoria just thinking about having a vagina so that's why I want it
I have that Very Same Q???
I would say you don't need dysphoria to be trans. There are a lot of nature vs nurture arguments for why people are trans. Some believe it is entirely biological, others believe it is entirely social, some believe an interaction of both and some choose not to think about it at all because they believe questioning someone's identity is hurtful and demeaning. While I think understanding why is important, I am studying the sciences after all, I very much understand the sentiment behind the last of those options. Your belief in who you are should be enough. Why does anyone else get to define your identity. They can choose not to accept it, but that doesn't change what you are.

The only founded argument against this line of thinking in my mind is the utilitarian argument. A belief that social transition is both fraught with danger and liable to impact an individual's entire life. That if there is not sufficient cause society loses out in this decision overall. That, then, is a misdiagnosis of the problem. Because there the problem lies with society and not the individual, because it is society that makes transition so difficult and enforces arbitrary rules about it to make people question and deny themselves, all of this the legacy of ideals that were out of date before the dark ages.
No. Some people transition because they feel dysphoria regarding their agab. Others transition because they get euphoria from a different gender identity while feeling okay/fine with their agab. You are valid.
No
You dont need gender dysphoria to be trans.  Trans-ness [if that's even a thing] is measured by how much happier one would be with themselves if they would transition.  It is not measured by how uncomfortable one is in their current body.
No. Legally & Scientifically. The DSM-5 and APA officially changed it’s criteria for gender dysphoria = transgender in mid 2018. If you don’t have dysphoria, you can still “legally” be trans (use your preferred bathroom, change name, etc) but any surgeries and procedures will be counted as cosmetic and not covered by insurance.
Depends on your definition of dysphoria
this is a really tough thing to have an opinion about because obviously every trans person's journey is different. The problem with this discussion is that people use dysphoria as a way to gatekeep the trans community, which is horrible. Dysphoria manifests itself in tons of different ways, and that arguably, not identifying with your agab counts as some form of dysphoria. Dysphoria can be hating you body and how you feel in it, it can be not liking how your voice sounds, and it can just be not being comfortable being treated as a male/female. I would say that anyone who identifies as trans has experienced dysphoria in some way, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a requirement. The problem with saying that you don't need dysphoria to be trans is that then people start to compare being transgender to being transracial, or transspecies, which is not the same. So I would say that yes, you do have to have dysphoria to be trans, because if you identify as trans, you have experienced dysphoria in some way shape or form. feel free to debate me in the comments, but please keep things civil. I am also trans, and I do not want to offend anyone, I don't want to gatekeep anyone, and I really really don't want to be seen as a hateful person
nah I don’t think so, being trans is just such a specific experience, I don’t think you need anything to be, you just need to figure it out, and to anyone that will mean a whole array of different things. From knowing it since childhood to looking at a post about it later in life, from massive pains of dysphoria depression self hatred to… I think I wanna be a girl/boy.
there is no one “i’m trans” but there are a myriad of experiences that can come from that same statement
No. Dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans. It’s ok to like your body, it doesn’t invalidate your gender.

A human body is a *human* body. Not a man’s body, not a woman’s body, a human body. Gender neutral, regardless how society has gendered humans.

I used to feel dysphoric on my masc days, being genderfluid I didn’t want to get rid of them, I am still a woman, but after an interesting conversation with my brother I started telling myself that men can have boobs, and that boobs doesn’t make me any less of a man. My gender is *my* gender. Nobody else’s.

Then I just kinda stopped feeling dysphoric.

I don’t want my comment to be taken the wrong way, so I’m just going to make it clear that I know it’s different for everyone. It’s ok to change your body if you want, that’s valid, it’s also ok if you don’t want to change it. Whatever floats your boat. Whatever y’all choose, I support
I think you can identify as trans without dysphoria, no problem at all. Identity is identity. However, if you’re not dysphoric, starting hrt will potentially mess you up mentally and give you dysphoria. In the the latter, there is harm, in the former, there is none. Anyone who wants to gatekeep your identity is probably doing so because they are struggling with their own identity.
There are all different kinds of dysphoria as well. Not every trans person feels it in the same way. For me dysphoria was not allowing myself to feel anything - numbness. There also been a lot of self doubt when it comes to being trans as well that I feel like is not talked about. People think that in order to be trans or seek medical transition you have to be 100% sure of your transness and it just isn’t true. 

I doubted myself for a long time because I thought I didn’t have dysphoria but the more digging and reflecting and reading o did the more I began to realize that not everyone is the exact same. I think we want to pathologize trans identity because its always been a considered as a “disorder” in the medical community. 

Being trans is far from a disorder, it’s an element of diversity of the human experience.  

Today Im celebrating my tranniversary 
I’ve been out as non binary since 2016
Began social transition in 2018 and 11/11/21 marks 2 years on HRT. I’m so thankful I found myself and my truth, I couldn’t see myself living any other way now.
Sorted by controversial and honestly wasn’t as big a shitstorm as I thought it’d be
Nope u don't need it to be trans its just a symptom of being trans not a requirement (not saying being trans is a sickness or smth) some people just feel they'd be happier identifying with a different gender
No. You don’t have to struggle as your AGAB to be happier in a different identity. 

There are so many trans people who just vibe out being their AGAB but when they present, or are perceived as their preferred gender get big big gender feels, why isn’t that just as valid?

Also, the more we put limits on “well this is what it means to be trans, this is what’s required” the more we force these little boxes that make it harder for people who don’t fit it to be happy.

For me, yeah, I’m real fucked up by dysphoria, but I shouldn’t have to explain to my therapist “yes, I hate my gender, I’ve known I’ve hated it for 10 years minimum, I can think about wanting to be a girl since like 1996 at the earliest.”

It’s made easiest for all of us the more we accept that being trans isn’t one size fits all
i dont think u have to have dysphoria to be trans, i think the pursuit of smth that makes you feel more comfortable or happy in ur own body, whether that be medical or social transition is what makes you trans.
The way I see it it doesn’t matter whether they do or don’t have dysphoria I’m going to respect what they say and stick to it to the best of my abilities and if they change their mind down the line and think they’re something else then that’s perfectly fine I will always respect them
Absolutely not. Do you feel euphoria even just thinking about being the opposite gender or thinking about things of the opposite gender? If yes, then you probably are trans. Having no dysphoria will not take that away, if anything trans people wish it wasn't a thing :)
I think most trans individuals experience dysphoria, but I view it as a sliding scale... For example, they could have a 10/10 on body dysphoria, but a 2/10 on social dysphoria and vice versa. When I first came out my dysphoria was fairly low, but as time goes on and circumstances change I've found my dysphoria is getting worse. It fluctuates and that's okay. 

Do you NEED it? I mean if I didn't experience some form of dysphoria I would be cis and/or not transition... In my opinion it's a mixed bag... You NEED some level to cause one to pursue transition (socially and/or medically) but people often forget about euphoria... You could have low, barely there dysphoria but find euphoria is what validates your need to transition (for yourself).
No
Yes. Why transition if you have no opposition to your AGAB?
no
Trans is an identity first. So no I don’t think you need it.
[deleted]
No. Imagine it like this: I’m okay with vanilla ice cream, I don’t hate vanilla ice cream and if I were force to have it for the rest of my life I could handle it. But if I have the option of getting cookies and cream I will choose that because it makes me a lot more happier. 

If I was born in a place where being trans was even more dangerous than here, I could settle with being a girl. But I have the privilege to transition, so I am going to

The only requirement for being trans is not identifying as your assigned gender. :)
Not a hill I'm willing to die on. Definitely not going to go around telling people they aren't trans over it. But I would say a conditional yes. Gender incongruence manifests as dysphoria. Plenty of people don't recognize it or misattribute it, but it seems to always be there. I've talked many trans people that ""didn't have dysphoria"". In every case, what they were struggling with could have been attributed to one form of dysphoria or another, even if they didn't. I could be wrong, there certainly may be trans people out there with no dysphoria, I haven't met them.
Obviously you have some level of dysphoria if you are willing to make drastic surgical and hormonal changes to your body…
Short answer? No. I don't have much dysphoria myself.
Just euphoria, we can't pit trans people against other trans people and act like we know who they are better than they do
So my question as an addition to this is if you don't have obvious dysphoria how do you really know if you're trans? Young people have a huge advantage in that they are allowed to be open and share.... some older people brought up in a time where all of this acceptance and promotion  didn't exist have naturally repressed alot through ""normal cis"" life  programing.... so if the sexual desires weren't up front and undeniable you wouldn't really know wtf you were.. only.that you were different...but not different enough to want to wreak havoc on your life....times have changed. I guess I'm giving a fk less each day as I get older and just want to be happy. Kinda odd that I do want to be labeled but at the same time I kinda do so I know what to call myself, even if it is to myself. Sorry for the long post. I'm many kinds of broken while remaining a functional adult in disguise...
Personally I believe you do need some type of dysphoria to be trans and have a disconnection from your assigned gender at birth because if not then what would be the reasoning for wanting to be trans if you’re comfortable with your sex characteristics the way they are but again that’s my opinion on the topic .
Honestly I think yes but I’m not 100% sure. Because dysphoria manifests in lots of different ways and has a range of intensity. It’s defined as being uncomfortable with your gender assigned at birth, it’s not always hating your body. If someone is like “I’m trans and I don’t have dysphoria” I don’t pick a fight cause it’s really not my place lmao and I don’t want to upset people
I think that yes, because being trans already includes dysphoria. What I mean is that the desire to be another gender is already a sign of dysphoria so everyone that identifies as trans wishes they were another gender and experience some dysphoria
I think you need either dysphoria or euphoria (ideally both; though dysphoria is generally a better indicator). Otherwise, why would you consider yourself trans?
Imo, no. A trans person is just someone who identify as a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth, and you don't need dysphoria to self identify as something.

Idk if this is stupid or not but i sometimes compare it to food. For example, your favorite food is pizza. You don't have to dislike all other dishes for your love of pizza to be valid.

One of the first listed official symptoms of dysphoria is a desire to be your preferred gender. If you don't feel at least that you are NOT TRANS.
Yeah, and I think a lot of people don't notice their dysphoria. I've seen people say ""I'm not dysphoric, I just don't feel like my body is mine."" That's a way of feeling dysphoria. If you're happier bring something else, then there was some part of you that was unhappy with who you were before, and that's dysphoria.
Imo, yes you need it. However, I think where ppl go wrong is that they believe you need crippling Dysphoria all the time for it to be real. Any amount of Dysphoria is still Dysphoria.  Small amounts of social or Dysphoria regarding ur body is still Dysphoria.  Some people probably don't even realize theyre feeling it.  If it wasn't necessary to be tran, then why do people need a diagnosis (at least where I am) to start HRT and get surgery?  And why would you want to transition in the first place? That's my opinion, but to each their own and I'm not gonna fight anyone 😂
[removed]
If your more happy as the other gender go ahead and transition.
Dysphorias just a potential symptom of being trans. Trans is physical not mental, so the mental distress people feel if they have issue with their body that is called  Dysphoria.  And people can experience that in different ways or not at all, depending on who they are and their situation. Obviously distress with your body is common in trans people so it can be a common indicator but it's just in the same way people would cope differently in any other example of a situation.
I don’t think a “man” would go through this if not dysphoric….to some degree…is the person in constant debilitating distress….maybe not.
No. Our identity is not rooted in pain, it's so much more than that.
No. For me, personally, I never thought of gender. It wasn't something that crossed my mind, either because I just distracted myself for years, or because I just had other things to be worried about. But I knew from the moment I was eight that I wasn't a boy. I just spent years reasoning that all those feelings and thoughts of not being a boy were normal for boys. Maybe everyone thought it, you know? But growing up with my family I kept that shit locked behind bedroom doors and felt like ME in girl's clothes, even if I wouldn't change what I did while wearing them. Sometimes I did and I reasoned it was just sexual, but it wouldn't be just sexual if I was also watching TV or just hanging out gaming dressed like a girl, would it? I didn't hate myself because my body was wrong, or because I didn't see me. I knew that was me in the mirror, it was just the hand I was dealt. So, I just carried on, not seeing any of it as strange, until one day I found a word for it. Dug into the word. Then I started to explore it with my partner at the time. Then I went to a therapist to make sure that it was what I thought, been on hormones since and have used Euphoria to gauge it ever since. I may not be the girliest girl out there but tomboys are valid too.
This is maybe a little different from your question OP, but cis people don’t typically worry about not being trans enough. If you’re concerned that you don’t feel enough dysphoria to justify transitioning, you’re probably experiencing imposter syndrome. I think it’s pretty common for trans people to go through the “I’m not trans because I don’t experience debilitating dysphoria” phase. Like some other people commented, I would focus more on euphoria. If you *want* to be trans, you’re probably trans
You do not need dysphoria to be trans. Anyone who says otherwise is a truscum.
Yes, I personally believe you need to have dysphoria to be trans.
No
yes, be it social dysphoria, genital dysphoria, etc, without it, it wouldnt make sense for you to be trans
[deleted]
Nope. Dysphoria happens because of how trans people are treated by society. Remove that and it seems to slowly disappear. Alot of people simply feel euphoria from presenting as their actual gender. Basically, if being a different gender makes you happy, then it's probably because that's what your actual gender is.
No.
Absolutely not. Many people don't feel dysphoria at all. Honestly it's been months since I felt dysphoric last (although I know you mean at feel it at all, you still dont)
In my opinion you don’t need dysphoria to be trans, being trans is having gender euphoria with something besides your assigned gender at birth. Like you might not have any chest dysphoria but binding might give you gender euphoria and I think that’s the more important thing.
no. https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/expert-q-and-a
The way I look at it is a glass of water. If a full glass is euphoria and a mostly empty glass is extreme dysphoria then everyone has a different amount of water. Some people are still relatively dysphoric in comparison to their cis counterparts but not as dysphoric as other trans people. They feel more comfortable with other pronouns but don’t have extreme dysphoria. But also no one owes an explanation. Everyone deserves to be treated respectfully, and if that involves using different pronouns, then a solid effort should be made to refer to someone with preferred pronouns.
No. You do not need dysphoria to be transgender. Being transgender is literally just you consistently, persistently, and insistantly don't identify with your assigned gender at birth. Also, euphoria is a thing, and it's as telling as dysphoria is.

My rule of thumb, though, for interacting with people in society is to treat them how they want to be treated. People will tell you where they're at and who they are and all of that is okay. Experimentation is also ok.

Also, I almost always like to add, just because, that Trans women are women, Trans men are men, non-binary people are valid, and everyone along the gender continuum is valid.
I think the whole dysphoria thing can take a lot away from nb people. Cause what if you're bigender for instance? Your identity might feel more about euphoria from adding in let's say your identity as a woman as well as as a man, since you still feel like a man but you've never been able to embrace your womanhood for a long time. Both might feel right
Changing your gender makes you trans.

You might need dysphoria to get prescribed hormones
All I can say is that being transgendered, doesn't need to be constrained to dysphoria or not. To be trans is whatever you want to be, whatever makes you happy. There are infinite possibilities, find your own path and follow it.
It’s odd how there is peer pressure to conform in a group that has rejected the peer pressure to conform to conventional gender norms. Just ignore them and be yourself. Don’t let anyone tell you who you are or who you should be!
Not at all, me realizing I was trans was more of a foregone conclusion than a realization I had based on pain. People who place dysphoria as a miasma concept they don't actually understand above the varied experiences and feelings trans people have about their own bodies will always fail to understand exactly what it means to be trans, fundamentally. Being trans isn't about being in pain, and the idea that validity can be measured is one that came up as a result of people wanting to reduce our existence to the pain we feel. We don't need to be in pain to be our gender identity.  The dependence on dysphoria as an objective way to determine who's trans and who's not ultimately harms trans people themselves, especially non-white, disabled and/or GNC trans people. Some of the worst discrimination I ever faced was from other trans people who thought dysphoria was the metric by which trans people are judged; I have severe asthma, and I'm nonbinary, and I was constantly attacked by other trans people for not binding, not wearing dull colors and plain outfits and being ok with my body. They constantly deterred me from going on hormones and ""stealing resources from real trans people"" as if it's finite.
Omfgggg fuck off no and just look it up.
Hello person who spends a huge amount of time on truscum!  This isn’t a place to debate the definition of trans, or gatekeeping.  There sort-of isn’t a place for truscum and non-truscum to talk (I think honesttrans is supposed to be but it’s pretty scummy).

This is actually going well so far so I’m not going to report for rule 6, but I’m pretty sure you will break that one before long.
Gender dysphoria is a symptom, it's the distress caused to some one by what ever actually causes wanting to be a different gender, by not being that gender, but like all symptoms it not being there or not being sever enough you notice much (might also be a thing) does not invalidate the root cause being there.

I had chicken pox as child for example, but only had a couple of spots, didn't mean I didn't have chicken pox just because there was basicly no rash. That's the thing with symptoms, there not causes and they may or may not even be there. 

Gender dysphoria can also manifest in multiple different ways from disassociation to out right panic attacks at the sight of your own body.


So... to sum up that waffle, no its dosnt matter, fuck the haters and gatekeepers.
I don’t really have that much dysphoria. I’m ftm and got a binder recently and it kinda fixed all the issues I had. I have really wide hips and a thin waist but I kind of love it and don’t really feel dysphoric about it. The only thing that kinda bothers me besides my chest is my voice, but mostly because I feel like people would misgender me less if my voice was deeper. I’d also love to be taller, but that’s more of a general thing, not a dysphoria thing.

I don’t think I’ll ever take hormones, I just want to get top surgery at some point, which really differs from most other transguys. A lot of my transmasc friends tell me they hate their hips and want to look as straight (as in no curves) as possible, meanwhile I love to show off my figure and wear ‘feminine’ clothing. It doesn’t rwally affect my gender or how I feel as a man.

So no, you don’t need to be dysphoric to be trans. I’m also autistic and have adhd and often don’t connect my real body with my ‘self’, they are split and I often forget what I look like (which sounds crazy, ik but it makes sense to me lol). I genuinely forget I have boobs most of the time and therefore don’t really care that they exist. I think what’s most important is how you feel and how you want to be viewed. I knew I was trans, not because I wanted a flat chest, but because I hated my given name, I couldn’t imagine myself in straight relationship, I wanted to love men in a ‘gay’ way and I felt jealous whenevermy mother referred to my brothers’ as her sons.

Being trans is about so much more than what you look or want to look like.
I only started feeling dysphoria after I realized I was trans so I’d say no, you don’t need dysphoria, but most of the time it’s probably gonna hit you at some point. ❤️[:
I don’t think you need it to be trans because it’s so hard to define and it’s so complex. That being said I believe every trans person experiences gender dysphoria to some degree it’s just a matter of them not realizing it. I mean for a long time i thought my behavior was normal until after researching it and finding out it was dysphoria all along.
no and no. i haven’t felt dysphoria when i came out as agender. i haven’t for awhile before and afterwards (until recently ‘cause i keep getting misgendered and hope the disappearance of my boobs will make it go away). i didn’t have any signs that i’d be trans either but i realized i was agender when i didn’t want to be seen as a woman or man so again, no
This is probably my favorite take so far.
Username doesn't check out, you're more educated then most of the people I talk to
This is literally what I think when I don't really understand something. If they're happy then why stop that happiness? They're figuring theirself out and that's completely okay.
There ARE some that believe ALL trans people have dysphoria, they just don't understand what it is until they're older.

So, No you don't need dysphoria to be Trans. But if you're Trans, you probably wouldn't realize it if you did have dysphoria.
i agree w you. if someone tells me they are trans/they have a different set of preferred pronouns i will respect them. the act of detransitioning or changing your mind is so stigmatized that i think it does way more harm than good. if someone decides that the path they are on isnt right for them, i dont think it should be an issue, yk? its just a part of discovering the identity that suits them best and makes them most comfortable. as long as they dont change identities just for attention/clout/etc then who really cares?
This is exactly how I feel towards things like xenogenders and, to a lesser extent, neopronouns - they’re beyond my understanding, but they don’t hurt anyone, so of course I respect them.
This. Dysphoria is often subtle af. It’s not all “I hate my body and want to kms”. I don’t know how anyone would ever come to the conclusion of “I am not my AGAB” without at least a small amount of even subconscious discomfort about living as their AGAB. I don’t think you “have to be dysphoric” to qualify as trans because being trans just means you’re not entirely your AGAB. But we have adopted such a narrow definition of what dysphoria is. 

I actually had the most dysphoria *after* I came out and started transitioning, because I don’t pass, because I’m too afraid of losing my income to be out at work, because I’m not medically transitioning (yet?), etc. Before that, I was somewhat uncomfortable attempting to be a cis woman, but it was easy as hell. Society heaps a lot of social rewards (jobs, relationships) on people who at least appear to be cis.

It’s really strange that we split hairs over words like dysphoria and incongruence and discomfort. They’re all part of the same thing. And it makes semantic debates like this so pointless and exhausting.
Jesus. That Twitter..... I recognise some of those
I kept reading the thread and was like bro stop calling me out
I disagree. I feel okay as a man, but being non binary is just better.
Wow, I relate to most of those twitter things 😂
>Being vulnerable around strange men is terrifying. You're anxious when you use the public men's room. Changing in a gym locker room is unthinkable. You do not feel ownership of these spaces. You are very concerned about strange men observing you, or your body.

This one hit hard

>You often feel directionless in life. When asked about career goals in High School, you didn't really care about your answer. Even careers centered in your interests seemed kind of intolerable. You struggle to imagine a future for yourself where you are happy or fulfilled.

This one is devastating. The first 32 years of my life kinda felt like I was a ship at sea, going where the wind and waves would wash me. Accepting that I was transgender was for me finally learning how to sail. Now I feel like I'm gloriously sailing into the wind with a particular destination in mind. I'm picking up friends along the way and for the first time they feel like my friends rather than people that I'm friends with.
Oh this is a great synonym, I love this
that's a fair statement. I think the proper answer to this argument is that if you're trans, you have experienced gender dysphoria or have experience gender euphoria when identifying with a different gender. Does that sound correct?
Okay, how does one feel like they're trans? Is it just a vibe or something you know like being gay?
It's not necessarily an innate desire. Some people are comfortable as their AGAB, but feel even MORE comfortable as another gender. Kinda like how you might be comfortable in one bed, but REALLY comfortable in another. There are all kinds of trans people who didn't know they were trans until they felt the euphoria of another gender. Hope that all males sense <3
This is dismissive of those who suffer dysphoria and don’t experience euphoria.
Why?
Yeah something along the lines. Good take tho!
What does dysphoria mean if not being trans??
Yeah, and one of the symptoms that can appear really mild is desire to change gender. I find it kinda funny that people view dysphoria as something they don't want to accept even if they're trans.
Gender dysphoria is probably better described as sex dysphoria, since gender is mostly socialy constructed. 
But I kind of get your point! One question though. What about secondary dysphoria? Isn't that kinda big risk when transitioning without even a tiny dysphoria? I am asking this out of curiosity, not to fight.
This!!! I mentioned this in my comment. The more ""designations of transness"" we put on to the experience of being trans, the more exclusive we make being trans. Like, if I were to say ""you can only be transmasc if you want a flat chest"" would exclude anyone who isn't thin, wether I meant it like that or not. When someone says ""only people with dysphoria are trans"" you exclude the people who haven't recognize their dysphoria as dysphoria (like thinking they're just depressed or lazy or anxious when in reality they're dysphoric) and people who don't have dysphoria and instead have euphoria, or even people who have both and think the dysphoria is just something else (depression, anxiety, etc) and that the euphoria is the thrill of crossdressing or something, and they try to say they aren't trans because euphoria was never mentioned or whatever. You know? 

The more we constrict what defines transness, the more we alienate people who can't recognize or express their existence and feelings
feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong, but wouldn't being unhappy with your current body count as having dysphoria?
This! I don't think you need dysphoria, but I would like to say that sometimes dysphoria is hard to spot or distinguish as dysphoria and not something else like anxiety or depression (see the Twitter thread another user in this comment section mentioned). Some people don't have dysphoria and only have euphoria as well. And I wouldn't be surprised if some people have neither and just *are* trans, or don't know how to express what they do feel. 

Putting such intense and often constricting ""symptoms"" (I can't think of the right word, like hoops to jump through, or designations) onto being trans does nothing but harm, because not everyone can quickly or easily identify how they feel. If someone tells me they're trans, I respect that, no questions asked. Why would I even need to ask questions? It would just put further stress on them about something that's none of my business.
You just described dysphoria though.
why????
Why?
Okay, first off, that's erasing what dysphoria is and those who have it, so please be respectful
Why

This is not something you can google, sad enough. As you might see from these comments, the opinnions are very divided.
I just saw a post lower that said that this is dismissive of people who only experience dysphoria, I want to clarify that I was wrong and any combination or presence of just one or the other is valid
It’s like having a pair of shoes that aren’t really comfortable but they’re also not uncomfortable and some people realize the shoes they were wearing were uncomfortable the whole time once they try a pair of comfy shoes. Essentially you don’t need to be miserable to seek out happiness and if someone’s decided that being trans makes them happy enough to identify with it and deal with the hate trans ppl get then it’s not anyone’s place to tell them otherwise IMO
Just because most trans people have dysphoria doesn't mean you need dysphoria to be trans. You can want to be another gender without feeling uncomfortable as your agab.

Not all dysphoria manifests as ""pain"" some might be just a slight discomfort towards being misgendered, or maybe feeling like the body you have would be better with other sex characteristics. Even the euphoria is caused by (possibly unnoticed) dysphoria.
But many, many GNC ppl do question their gender tho! And nonGNC ppl too! Some people who want to be trans might just have other problems in life and that's okay too
Hello! As i said in the post, no ""this opinnion is wrong"" kind of comments! Truscum are people too, and they have right to an opinnion as well. Also, what do you mean by truscum? Transphobic? Biggoted? The way your comment is worded sounds like you're using it as a slur.
Why?
the audacity and hypocrisy to be trans yet transphobic towards your own community, how does it feel being transmed? Denying and gatekeeping your own identity from people and exactly for what?..  If someone identifies as transgender and without any form of dysphoria they are still trans and that's not YOUR problem. What are you exactly going to do about it too? Misgender them purposefully because they aren't ""real transgenders""?.. I see.. Very valid logic. The amount of hypocrisy I see from transgender people in this comment section is unspeakably fucking cruel.
That is a bad comparison since dysphoria has so many nuances
Social dysphoria is caused by society, body dysphoria is caused by having wrong sex characteristics and has nothing to do with other ppl, but otherwise pretty solid explanation
Why?

Hi! Just because I might hold some truscum views, it does not mean i'm not genuinely open for change in my views OR that I'm here to bully anyone! Also! As you might notice I'm not debating anyone here, you, on the other hand are appearing to be hostile and pretty much insulting me when i have been nothing but respectful towards anyone here! Genuine questions, curiosity and open mindedness is a key to development
I like how it’s called “honest” transgender, as if people in the other subs aren’t already being honest.
Ah of course it wasn't a genuine question. It's probably for screenshots to share and laugh at people who genuinely put time of their day into trying to actually explain.
Yeah, like those truscum people ignore that even if it’s true (honestly I’m not sure) someone may not REALIZE they do.  So claiming someone isn’t trans when they say they don’t have it becomes even doubly stupid as they may actually have it. 

Ugh, and I’ve of them on here claiming everyone had to feel the same way about genitals 🙄
This is kinda why I'd tend to use the word incongruence rather than dysphoria. It feels more subtle to me.
>I actually had the most dysphoria after I came out and started transitioning, because I don’t pass, because I’m too afraid of losing my income to be out at work, because I’m not medically transitioning (yet?), etc. Before that, I was somewhat uncomfortable attempting to be a cis woman, but it was easy as hell. Society heaps a lot of social rewards (jobs, relationships) on people who at least appear to be cis.

Oof I thought I was the only one. I think when I just felt like I was a butch lesbian i felt MOST comfortable with my body. The more I thought about it and got comfortable that I'm trans masc and likely a trans dude, the more I wanted something my body was very far from. Like I like my binder and packer, but it wasn't flat enough and I feel like there's a disconnect needing to move my boobs to see my bulge. I like wearing masc cloths but my hips. I never liked how hairless I was. Never liked my voice. Honestly I would love to get on T right now but I'm so scared of being judged and despite only liking maybe 1 or 2 of my family members I'm afraid of the whole disownership ""bring shame to the family"" thing
I (pre-transition) hit every single one of them. 🥺
Me too. Most of them seem relatable 😂 

Oh my gosh.
That's euphoria
I spent my life feeling wrong, broken, and ugly
[deleted]
For me, it’s a little freeing because I can live my life as who I want to be and not by what others tell me. Everyone has their own experience and feelings throughout this journey. It’s never really been a vibe for, it’s been a feeling. I accepted being gay but had a harder time accepting my Trans identity but once I began to explore and understand, I learned to accept myself and now it’s like knowing I’m gay. It’s apart of me.
Transitioning, and life itself, first begins with you. While is nice to feel validated by your peers, how they feel is not the bottom line.
For me it started with euphoria from doing things associated with my true gender. It took a while to even realize it, and the dysphoria has kind of crept up afterwards. It’s still not nearly as bad as for some people, but it exists. I’d advise you to do whatever feels right and not think too much about it, you’ll figure it out at some point
I never got any dysphoria until I started trying to look the way I wanted to. Then the disconnect of goals vs reality was painful. But until I realized I was trans, I had no issue with anything pretty much, and in fact felt pretty blessed with the body I ended up with. If I was gonna be a guy, I might as well be an attractive one.

How I knew I was trans was a moment when, after nearly a year of deliberation, for a split second I saw myself as a woman in the mirror and got my first hit of euphoria. I realized ""*That's* what I want to see in the mirror every time."" And I'm genuinely in love with the person I see in the mirror now.
The concept of it being just kind of vibes based I feel like probably exists but I feel like it's alien to my trans experience. For a lot of us it is more of a calculation where our reactions to a variety of specific situations and stimuli paint a clear picture of how we want or need to live. 

You can view dysphoria as a sort of  jealousy of a body type  you do not have. It ranges in intensity from crippling obsession to being just kind of a subtle downer whenever you veiw yourself in the mirror or are reminded in conversation that you have sex characteristics you do not want.

However it isn't the only marker on the map. Euphoria, _or finding things that make you happy is enough on it's own_. In the case of sufferers of dysphoria there is usually an intense euphoria element because you eliminate the discomfort while getting a big dose of happy when you suddenly look or feel like you are not ugly to yourself. Between the two feel good and feel bad you get a very clear picture of what  your brain is telling you want out of life.

The reason it is an identity and not a mental illness is because if you were given the opportunity to change and be entirely comfortable in your body or feel happiest in a cis presentation... Well when you have always felt something and it has sculpted a lot of your choices and flavored your likes, dislikes and reactions to all manner of things it kind of is near to the core of what makes you... you. Like if it were changed there is an extreme doubt that you would be actually you anymore. Which is why trans folks tend to change the circumstances around their exterior and their environment to make things more livable than trying to dive inwards and change who they are in their core.
Okay, that's backwards. Trans doesn't always mean you have dysphoria
You just don’t trans is transitioning from one gender to the other so female to male obviously you can still be genderfluid and non binary and some people simply don’t like their gender and change to another
Gender incongruence is defined as “the mismatch an individual feels as a result of the discrepancy experienced between their gender identity and the gender they were assigned at birth.” Would you not define this as dysphoria?
[deleted]
But isn't that uncomfortableness basically dysphoria? Or am I mistaken?
If you’re more comfortable as another gender, doesn’t it mean that you’re less comfortable in your birth gender. Isn’t dysphoria a discomfort linked to your gender?
> all that is required is feeling like you aren’t the gender you were born as

That’s just dysphoria, though, albeit a mild form. Not all dysphoria has to be ‘oh god I hate every masculine/feminine part of my body’; there are varying degrees of dysphoria.
[deleted]
[deleted]
It’s not a slur, they call themselves that. They’re essentially transphobic trans people, they gatekeep folks who don’t experience dysphoria and promote a lot of TERF ideaology. They invalidate feminine trans men and masculine trans women and are often bigoted towards non-binary folks.
Because the reasons that makes trans men men have nothing inherently to do with dysphoria. The reasons trans men are men is because gender is a social construct and the lines between the genders are ultimately arbitrary and don’t have concrete lines. And gender is a deeply internal concept where individuals have to find out what best matches their personality or feelings. So the best way to run a society where everyone feels the most at home with their gender to to apply to only standard for being a gender is to identify with it. Gender dysphoria is just another reason one would have to transition. And asking people to prove they have it to be trans creates a distrust in trans people. So a trans person who actually has dysphoria but couldn’t necessarily prove it, might be very doubtful that they are
Because you don’t. It’s the short answer. It’s that simple, you don’t need to experience dysphoria to be trans. I don’t know if I could explain it, It’s basically a yes or no question. You are valid.
I didn’t bother to look through their profile at first. It certainly changes things…
Suggesting that peoples identity is up for debate is in and of itself a breach of rule 6.
Where is the insult?  I agree you aren’t debating.  I agree that if truscum want to understand more mainstream trans ideas they have to hang out in more mainstream areas.

I also saw this post and immediately thought the poster was truscum, although note that I have not called you truscum or suggested that you are invalid; only that I think your post in and of itself is problematic, although as stated, you aren’t arguing or debating, which is where the bugger issues would come from.

Besides, although it isn’t happening, it would hardly be outside of the truscum playbook to have one person post a mostly innocent discussion point and a totally different person stir the pot.

There is nothing about the need or lack of need of dysphoria that requires discussion.  The very suggestion that this is up for debate is at a minimum problematic, as I’ve stated.
Oh i didn't notice you sooner, sorry! Just because I might hold some transmed views does not mean I'm automaticly some sort of cyberbully! But, yes, this was a genuine question!
Everybody talking about carts and horses these days.
Yeah and that’s totally valid too. I acknowledge there’s a big spectrum of how we come to realize we’re trans and how uncomfortable we felt living as our agab.
I am booked for my first clinic next week. I'm not sure I'm fully female but am also sure I'm not cis male either.

I've resolved to let the chips fall as they may.
Yeah I was disagreeing with the dysphoria part
Not trying to be difficult but the whole “do you need to have dysphoria” argument seems like a semantic argument where people are pointlessly splitting hairs 

Surely what you are describing is dysphoria- the feeling you aren’t your assigned gender. Like, I don’t understand why it’s this big debate.
Ah okay 👌🏻
[deleted]
I'm not really searching for the ""correct"" answer, rather the views of other trans people about the topic
Yeah but I'm saying you don't need to be uncomfortable to want to transition. Just because I like cake more than ice cream doesn't mean I don't like ice cream.

I wish you only the best in your journey. Wherever it takes you, may you find happiness.
Oh yeah, just wanted to clarify I guess. Though in my case, I was like that but then one time I felt so good being a girl that the one time I didn't I just broke down. So I guess I had euphoria first, then dysphoria
Dysphoria is a feeling of intense discomfort caused by your internal sense of gender not matching your body/your assigned gender.

You're thinking of gender incongruence, which is the simple fact that your internal sense of gender differs from the one assigned.

Gender incongruence is true for all trans folks, but we don't all experience dysphoria as a consequence of it.
Why do you feel like a different gender if you don’t have discomfort with your AGAB?
> Being more comfortable doesnt mean im uncomfortable as the gender I was born as.

How do you feel when you are misgendered? Isn’t that feeling gender dysphoria?
But that is dysphoria... If your more comfortable as a female then there must have been some discomfort as a male. It could have been very minor but there was still some.
I meant that this question may not have been entirely in good faith.
Do you think that if someone holds an opinion like ""dysphoria is required"" is inherently saying that non dysphoric ppl are up for debate? Because most people I know with views like that just kind of let's everyone be regardless of wether or not the person fits their criteria. (Not trying to fight or anything! Just a question!!)
I would disagree.  Suggesting providing reasoning is required suggests a need to justify your claim to being trans if you don’t experience dysphoria.
Insert Teal'c ""Indeed"" gif here :)
That makes sense. Thanks for explaining because I've been curious about this too.

So is it right to assume that the reason people started 'advocating' (cant find a better word) for this idea because of the idea that you don't need to be miserable to be trans?

For example, I'm about 5 years into my transition and most of my dysphoria is gone, or less intense than at the start, but I'm obviously still trans?

Or is it more about the fact that you don't need it in the first place?
This makes a lot of sense. i've never heard of the term gender incongruence before but I think that is what I was trying to describe in my comment. Gender dysphoria is just the intense mental and emotional distress caused by gender incongruence, right? Gender incongruence is what makes you trans then, not dysphoria
[deleted]
Hi! This question is completely out of curiosity, and am not going to mock anyone's opinions! So no ill intentions here
Yeah, you don’t need it in the first place
Yes, exactly. Dysphoria is a common consequence of gender incongruence, a symptom we can say. But like many other things not everyone will show the same symptoms or any at all, even though it is the most common occurrence.

Is it normal that i dont want bottom surgery?	"So,um hi
Im trans(ftm) and i dont think ill be getting bottom surgery.
Im really dysphoric when it comes to my chest and feminine body but i dont feel dysphoria towards whats in my pants at all.
Is it normal that i dont feel dysphoric becouse of my bottom parts?i feel like surgery will be too mutch pain and its not needed for me couse iam okay with what i have now and don't think this will change.
I have been questioning if im valid or even really trans becouse of that.
So,is it okay and valid to not want bottom surgery?

(Also tell me if this needs Nsfw warning just in case)"	"i feel the same, i have little to no bottom dysphoria and i don’t see myself getting surgery for it in the future. not every transgender person wants bottom surgery and being okay with your parts doesn’t make you any less trans!
I have a transmasc friend who also has 0 interest in bottom surgery. I’m transfem and I also am not interested in it! You’re normal, my dude.
Hey I feel exactly where your coming from in mtf but don't want any bottom surgeries because it seems like it can cause more troubles than it's worth and I don't want to put my body trough that
Yup! There’s no one way to be trans. You can be trans and have no hormones or surgery, or just have hormones, or just surgery. It’s totally up to you and what feels right 🙂
Hey! I don’t really feel dysphoric about my bottom parts either. Aside from my but I’m not very dysphoric about what’s down there and I think it’s totally normal to not feel dysphoric, don’t feel bad bout yourself if you aren’t. I’m also kind of saying this to reassure myself, but you don’t need to worry!
I'm in the same camp, i do wish i had a vagina but the operation sounds like an absolute hell. 



After reading about it i rather keep my parts :,)
I don't plan on getting bottom surgery either. While I do experience bottom dysphoria I feel that in my particular case it will feel so close yet so far from what I want and it's a pretty big undertaking when I don't know I'll be happy with the results.

You're 100% valid.
Of course. My SiL has no interest in bottom surgery. She's still a woman. Not  everyone wants the same things
Hey I'm also mtf and I also have top dysphoria but not bottom. I don't plan to have bottom surgery but that doesn't make me or you less trans. We are valid even with no dysphoria :)
Everyone feels differently about their bodies. My dysphoria manifests with body hair and lack of breasts. Feels like how people describe phantom limb pain, a dull ache that something should be there.

But zero interest with bottom surgery. Honestly, being ok with that made it take longer to figure my own stuff out. ""I can't be trans, I don't have a problem with the wang, I just want boobs."" Ha! Not exactly a cis thought.

Slight tangent there but point is every person can feel different about their body and that's perfectly ok.
Hey! ftm here, i also feel the same way! I dont have any bottom dysphoria and refuse to get bottom surgery due to the risk factor being way to high; same as my fiancé who wanted to get it but hated how high the risks are. Its your body, dont let others make you feel like you have to do something you dont wanna do (learned from a personal experience)
it’s perfectly normal, i don’t either. but with me it’s more of the fear that it’ll go wrong. maybe if it becomes safer in my lifetime, i’ll get it done. but for now, i’m not dysphoric enough about it to warrant doing anything that could potentially ruin what i already have going on down there
Honestly in my experience as a trans masc, other trans people rarely opt in for bottom surgery, whether it's just because they don't want to and it doesn't give them Dysphoria, or because it's too much trouble. I def don't want bottom surgery and I'm still trans, so don't sweat it. Bottom surgery can be very expensive and the results can vary, so it's totally reasonable to not want it.
That's absolutely okay and normal! Nothing wrong with it. Personally, mine fluctuates and I have no idea if I want bottom surgery or not. But I do have my whole life to decide.
i think a lot of us feel this way, especially with the way current medicine is not... exactly perfect. even if it was, though, i still wouldn't care what's in my pants
Thanks to everyone who left comments under this post and shared their personal expiriences.
I needed to hear all of that)
Love from to to all of you<3
Bottom surgery damages lots of nerves.   I wouldn't want to damage the nerves in that area.
Yeah, lots of people don't bottom surgery
It is normal, you are prefectly valid. I do feel genital dysphoria but i'm not going to get bottom surgery as i feel that the kind of results you get vs. pain you have to go throuh ratio is not good enough for me. Maybe in the future, if surgery is more advanced? Anyways, your case is normal.
Absolutely. It's super common :)
Everyone's experience of being trans, while aligning with others in parts, is unique to them, and there are all manner of reasons why people might want or not want any kind of surgery, particularly bottom surgery. We all have different relationships with our bodies and dysphoria.

Personally, I'm MtF and my biggest dysphoria is the hair on my arms and hands, and I only plan to have hormones (which I just got referred for!) and to continue with hair removal. I feel very nonchalant about downstairs and don't plan on any surgery. Admittedly, my health conditions also are a factor in this, and if I could click my fingers and have my idealised form it would be very different to my own and much more like most cis women, but that's just not in the cards or paramount for me.

It's all an individual journey about being as happy and comfortable in yourself that you can be, and only you can say what that is. Love and solidarity ❤️🖤
Many trans people feel that way! There are many reasons to explain that (one being that genitalias are generally hidden behind clothes, but there are so many other reasons). As a non-binary masc-leaning person, I don't feel dysphoric at all towards my genitalias while my chest makes me very dysphoric. There is no ""right way"" to be trans, or to feel dysphoria, and not feeling it towards some aspects of your body doesn't make you less valid as a trans guy! You're a man, no matter what your genitalias (which only concern you!) look like. Take care!
Absolutely normal! Im MtF, and am not on HRT nor want bottom surgery. I did consider it, and then I realized it would be of no benefit to me. I have zero wish to be penetrated, so that's why I have not, and no plans to.
In my mind, the whole point of transition care is to help improve a persons well being and comfort with themselves. If a person doesn’t want some aspect of transition available to trans people, they shouldn’t get it! Getting something done that they don’t want would harm their well being and would be counterproductive to the goal!

The medial and mental health systems in many places don’t demand total conformity to cisgender and heterosexual norms anymore. It was hurting people to do that, and many people recognize that now.
MtF here, I also don't really want bottom surgery, I kinda enjoy what I have down there personally, I don't get super dysphoric over it.. Bottom surgery honestly kinda scares me, but I'm glad that it's there for the people who need/want it.
I’m amab and I feel very similar. Just gotta follow your feelings I guess
Hello, it's totally normal. This was on my mind for a very long time And my own country kinda decided for me. I dont want to have bottom surgery cuz in my country the results are so bad. It's problematic and they can't even make it to look like a penis. At the end of the surgeries Down there, you are left with piece of your arm flesh stitch to your croach. You can Stand to pee, if you want to do anything else with it, it won't work. Never. Not worth it at all. It's irony that right in the next country they do one of the best bottom surgeries in the world, but sadly it's expensive (and the surgeries in my country are free.)

Tho I kinda like my growth, So I'll probably keep it this way.
In my opinion the instant you realize ""hm I don't really jive with my assigned gender"" you're trans. Physical, medical, and social transition are to make YOU more comfortable in YOUR body. You could change absolutely nothing and still be trans. It's all about what would help you feel most like yourself
Hey, MTF here. 

I have no issue with mine and have no intentions of having bottom surgery. Doesn’t makes you any less trans. For me, my dysphoria comes from my lack of chest so I suppose getting my boobs done is as much of a gender confirmation surgery as having bottom surgery
no one but you gets to decide what your genitals should have done to them, if anything. you are no less your gender becuase you have certain body parts.
I feel the same
It's not abnormal at all. I don't plan on getting bottom surgery either. Would it be nice to have a penis? Yeah, but right now medical technology isn't where I want it to be. So, seeing as my bottom dysphoria isn't bad, I don't plan on getting bottom surgery.
I think i won't be getting neither top or bottom surgery tbh. I actually don't like it if hormones make my chest too big, im just gonna bind if that happens
Yes
I don't want it ethier
most people dont get bottom surgery
Yes. You are valid.
 Im pretty sure it's normal to not wanna change your private parts, especially considering thst it's like 400k to do that. It's also alright to want to change em
I don't want it either. I have bottom dysphoria but I think t could possibly help that and using devices to help like stops and stuff. Bottom surgery is really difficult and painful and so many things can go wrong that I don't want it. Plus I'm a bottom and not into anal lol.
It's absolutely ok. My girlfriend doesn't even plan to go on hormones. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. Anyone who says other wise is a trans medicalist and they're a piece of crap.
Same tbh
Yes it is normal and you are Valid. I am Mtf and for years I was made to feel invalid for not having bottom surgery. Now I'm in my twenties I know who I am and what I need to do to feel valid and comfortable with myself. It comes down to you and how you feel. You are so valid what ever journey you choose to take 🙌💕
I dont want bottom surgery. I'm ace so it doesn't really matter to me what organs I have down there. I prefer female partners for reasons other than sexual attraction, but I understand that my partners may not be ace and I want to make them happy. I may not get pleasure from intercourse, but I do get a different kind of pleasure from causing my partner to feel pleasure.

I fully support all of my sisters and brothers that do want surgery. 

Love and be kind to to yourself.
Totes normal
you don’t need to want bottom surgery or such to be trans! you can be trans and not have any dysphoria at all! you are really trans, and it is normal :)
Here are my thoughts on the subject.

Focus on what makes you feel better. If your chest makes you dysphoric, focus on that, if it's your voice, focus on that, if it's body hair, focus on that. If what's between your legs doesn't make you dysphoric..... then why worry about it? There are other things ACTIVELY BOTHERING YOU, get those taken care of first. 

Maybe, MAAAAYBE once everything else is addressed, some hidden, small dysphoria you couldn't feel before because the other things were overshadowing it will come up. THEN you can worry about it. Or maybe you'll feel wonderful in your body without any bottom surgery. I mean... could you imagine? BEING HAPPY?! Enjoying having both amazing breasts and a cock? If that's what makes you happy, then I say GO FOR IT! We shouldn't be so worried about NOT being unhappy.
Don't worry about it, I'm the same. I feel like bottom surgery will cause me more discomfort with that area than to leave it as it is. My opinion about it is that it's just there, it doesn't defy my gender
Nah actually I heard a lot of trans men don't get bottom surgery for a whole range of different reasons. And also, you are who you are no matter what your body has, does or will look like. Don't let anyone tell you you need a dick to be a man cos that simply isn't true
Completely normal. If anything I'd say spending all that money and going through all that pain when you weren't dysphoric over it in the first place is weird lmao
Back in the day people would call trans who makes bottom surgery “mentally ill” and the norm was just to be “trans” now its the other way around… when can we accept that being a woman isn’t define whats between your legs PERIOD .. nobody needs to know ur business down there except 1 person. So 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
it's probably because dysphoria often comes from how you want to be perceived by other people and because people don't often see your parts then you would have less dysphoria. you may decide later on that you might want bottom surgery or you might not and both are fine
If it doesn't matter to you, what's the big deal? Transition is about making yourself more comfortable with your body, go the length you want to go and don't go where you don't want to.
Same here (ftm), I have never wanted bottom surgery and Im glad Im not alone on that.
yes, absolutely! you don’t have to be dysphoric about quite literally anything to “qualify” as trans, and many trans people don’t have issues with their genitals. it’s also just, a really intense and generally expensive surgery that makes a lot of people pause or worried- doesn’t make them less valid either, so why would you be?
I’m a AFAB, still questioning what label is most appropriate but I don’t get particularly bad chest dysphoria-some days I choose to bind and get Euphoria but it’s not a necessity for me. However, I get really bad bottom half dysphoria, it’s grim, it’s horrible and I hate it. It’s totally normal and ok to feel none/some/loads of dysphoria about certain things and not others. Having surgery is a personal choice we all get to make (if we are lucky enough to be in a situation that permits it) and if that’s not right for you, you do not have to go down that path. Absolutely still valid 🙂
A lot of trans people (mtf and ftm) don't get bottom surgery. Its perfectly normal and valid. the cost can be a huge factor. but also, in some cases the transition can be purely social and still be valid
Perfectly normal. A healthy fraction of the trans folks I know are non-op.
Friend you are very valid. Ever one's experience is different and what ever makes you feel comfortable in your body is right for you 🖤
100% normal 

I am going to be getting bottom surgery and while I may not “get it” when it comes to trans folks not wanting bottom surgery, I understand that I have my own experiences and desires— others do too and that’s cool.
Even though I'm planning on going on HRT and fully transitioning that way, I still don't like the concept of bottom surgery. Things down there are fine the way they are. It's entirely normal, as surgery is expensive, very final, and can result in complications. It's not right for everyone, it's all a matter of choice.
I’m pretty sure a majority of trans men don’t get bottom surgery actually, so you’re good (and for all the other reasons as well)
I’m also trans masc and don’t want it… I don’t have any dysphoria there so test it is normal
I'm happy with my genitals atm, my feelings might change in the future but that's ok. We're still trans because we aren't living as our agabs.
That's totally fine. There isn't a list of things you need to do. Just do what you want to, to make you happier in your body. 

I do not want body surgery at all.. sounds gross tbh, but I pack sometimes.
Perfectly valid, and normal as heck.

When I started my transition, mtf, I didn't want it either.  Realised that genitals don't play a large part in perception of gender.

I however, had never really felt extremely dysphoric, moreso an underlying level that was just there constantly.

After I worked through some of the other areas of transition I started to realise that my downstairs might need some renovations as well.  At first it was a mild kind of ""meh, I wouldn't be bothered if it was different"", to now feeling odd when I see and touch my own junk.

Whatever happens for you, whether you go for bottom surgery, whether you socially transition, whether you take hormones, whether you change your name legally etc, none of that stops you from being trans.  Being trans is identifying at other than your gender assigned at birth.  That makes yours transness valid.  Medical options, social changes, legal changes etc don't validate your transness, these are treatment options to address your gender dysphoria.  

You are valid, and valued, and perfectly normal!

Take care my dude, much love to you.
It’s normal
Absolutely normal and valid. I’m not distressed by my junk, but if I could change it easily then I probably would. However, bottom surgery is a complex series of surgeries and a lot can potentially go wrong. It’s simply not worth it to me- I don’t like hospitals or needles or anything like that and I don’t think I’d ever willingly have any major surgery, which really sucks because- like you- my chest dysphoria is pretty bad but I don’t think I could go through top surgery. Luckily my chest is small, but still
I started my transition not even considering bottom surgery as an option, it's been like 8 years and now I'm kinda starting to consider it. Time can often make a confusing decision clear. But to answer your question yes it's totally normal.
I'm ftm, around 10 years on t and I don't want bottom surgery either. Honestly I love what the hormones alone have done. I absolutely want top surgery still. It doesn't make you any less valid, I'd consider myself fortunate to not have bad bottom dysphoria.
In the most literal sense of the word, it isn't ""Normal"", meaning that less than 50% of trans people feel like you do. However, ""Not normal"" is not ""Icorrect"" or ""Invalid"". A significant number of people feel that way, and it's 100% valid!

In short, it's completely fine.
Completely normal. People have different dysphoria responses to different things. 

For example, I have little dysphoria surrounding my chest, and bind mostly so I can pass better. But I have awful dysphoria about my genitals. Even still, I'm a little iffy about getting bottom surgery. It's a lot, a lot of time, multiple times going under the knife, skin grafts, etc. Trans people aren't a monolith, and if you're not really dysphoric about your lower half, good on you dude! Doesn't make you any less of a man.
Its fine, you do whats best for you, ans wjat makes you happy, bottom surgery isn't a must, nor is even transitioning, as long as you're happy
I'm similar. I actually like my genitals enough that going on HRT scares me a bit. I really don't want to lose form or function
I’m mtf and I don’t feel any bottom dysphoria either. Not all of us really want/need it but do whatever makes you comfortable and you are a handsome man even without a penis.
For me it’s more like I get dysphoric in different ways, like how (trigger warning!!) I don’t think it would ever look the same with current options, like I wish that I didn’t have to pump it up, I wish I could feel it. I won’t get bottom surgery since I feel like that’s a final step that could make me sadder at the realisation that I’ll never be where I want to. I may get it in the future if surgery options get better (specifically around sensation and looks.)
i have zero bottom dysphoria and am an aspiring Ken Doll-to-be
i know a lot of people who feel that way. i don’t think it’s incompatible with being trans. i used to have super bad bottom dysphoria but since transitioning i don’t really anymore. i’m just not into the idea for a multitude of reasons and think it would be more trouble than it’s worth. i would only really want to get bottom surgery for the convenience of having testicles to replace hrt and not having awkward situations and confusion from cis people, i don’t plan on getting it right now because i’m dissatisfied with the current surgical methods and it’s not possible to have gonads yet
Ftm here, I don't plan on getting bottom surgery at all.
my thought process towards it has always been “if someone magically offers it to me for free i’d take it but i’m not sure if i would otherwise” because like my bottom dysphoria is there but not horrible
Both wanting and not wanting surgery down there is valid.  From my personal experience, I had emergency room surgery down there when I was a teenager and yes it does hurt but when the stitches come out it heals up.  I think it took a few months for me to be able to forget about it.  

I don’t have any pain 15 yrs later and I’m happy with it.  Me being an awkward teen it was hard to explain to my partner when they got in bed with me why I didn’t like being touched down there.  Only kissing. Bless their heart they thought I didn’t find them attractive, but we actually still chat from time to time online lol.
Tldr; Absolutely normal. I also don't see myself ever wanting surgery. You are valid. 

So really the only issue I have with my penis is the general shape/visibility through women's clothing and that can be a huge safety problem when I'm stealth. I live in a swing state (US) where some parts are straight up transphobic and hate crimes against trans people have happened and other parts are very accepting and there's no problems, when I'm in a hate crime part I don't want anyone to know I have a penis. 

But that's purely safety, on a personal level? I'm largely indifferent. My wife and I got together before I realized I'm trans and I'm comfortable with the ways we have sex (which mostly, but not exclusively, involves me topping). In theory I would absolutely love to have a vagina, but the routes of getting there aren't for me.

 I've had other surgeries non-trans related and I know that I don't follow after care plans or therapy or long term care and that's not a part of my body that I want to have health issues in because I don't do something that I should do (dilate for example). So for me, bottom surgery is a no (for many many reasons, but this is getting to be way too long of a comment). 

You are valid OP and it is completely normal. Lots of women want bottom surgery, many don't, and whatever your reasons are for either are completely valid and don't make you any less of a man.

Edit: poor reading comprehension on my part sorry. Thought you said mtf. My dude if you don't want a penis, you don't need a penis. Having a penis doesn't make you a man (source: I have a penis and I am not a man).
Yeah! Perfectly normal! You don't have to get bottom surgery to be trans!
yeah as an afab trans enby the only dysphoria i have with my bottom shit is my periods and having kids. im ok w the rest of it. strangely enough i despise my boobs ahaha
I want bottom surgery but at the same time i don't. I think its normal to want or not want it, some people want it, while others don't
You don't need to have or want any type of surgery to be considered trans. You do what is most comfortable for you!
I cant speak for mtf, but this is really normal for ftms in my experience. Im ftm, and do have bottom dysphoria. Ive considered getting bottom surgery, but after researching the options currently available, I'm probably not going to as i don't find any of them ideal and worry they may cause new, different dysphoria bc of the sacrifices I'd have to make for my sex life. Additionally, the change Ive seem *ahem* down there due to just being on testosterone has already started to relieve some dysphoria.

None of my ftm friends want bottom surgery. Some because they already like what they've got, some because they don't like the options available, and some bc they dont really care about their gents one way or the other, so spending the time and money to schedule, have, and recover from surgery is unappealing.
However you wanna be is how you wanna be. Anyone who judges you for that is a dork. Good luck homeskillet
Oh, same. I feel that way too. I am mainly dysphoric about my chest and curves. I've heard other transmen opt out of bottom surgery, too.
That's totally normal! There's different levels of dysphoria people can have, you don't have to have the most severe levels
I have the exact same feelings! Oh my God someone like me :O

The chest is awful to look at, but I'd rather keep my bottom??? I know I'll never use it (ace things ahaha) but I don't mind having it. I think it's because I know that I won't use it, but anyone can automatically assume my ""gender"" with my chest.
I'm bottom surgery undecided, but I'm not really that dysphoric about my downstairs mixup either. Lack of bottom dysphoria is a lot more common than I thought coming into this.
I feel the same way! It's totally okay and valid to not want bottom surgery :)
I think really neat things happen to vaginas and penises as you transition without the necessity for surgery. Taking viagra before you fall asleep at night will help keep penile tissue used to expanding, the shaft will become wet like a vagina and will smell like one too. All the sensory areas change. Clits grow and become more sensitive and are SO much fun to play with! The pheromone change is huge. I've always hated my ""man"" smell"" and knowing that it will go away as I transition makes me so happy! You are valid!! Never think am I trans if I don't think a certain way! If you want to be trans, you are and are valid!!
Totally fine! Same here, not bothered if I don't have a dick. It would be nice to have one right? But maybe if the surgery gets better. You are fine buddy!
it’s totally normal! i do have bottom dysphoria and i have no plans for getting bottom surgery. lots of people don’t have bottom dysphoria, and/or don’t want surgery for lots of reasons! there’s no one way to be trans <3

edited for clarity bc it didn’t make sense the first time lmao
I mean sone trans people don’t even feel the need to transition at all. It’s totally up to u
hi, i’m transfemme and i personally have no interest in bottom surgery! i personally don’t get any dysphoria from what i’ve got downstairs and have no plans to alter it! sometimes i wish i didn’t have it purely because tucking can be so uncomfortable while also being necessary sometimes, but that’s the extent of it for me. my downstairs neighbours are gonna be my downstairs neighbours for the rest of my life!
Absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting bottom surgery, my friend! I’m in the same boat — I’ve had top surgery and I’ll likely have a hysterectomy at some point, but I’ve never personally felt inclined towards having a penis. However you choose to present and transition is your business and yours alone; no one else can tell you what you are or aren’t when it comes to your gender identity. You’re valid as hell and in no way alone.
Some guys want to keep what they've got. It's not weird at all. You just do what makes you comfortable.
Kinda same, as a questioning non-binary amab I have no bottom dysphoria, but I've always just thought having a vagina would be dope
I wouldn’t worry about “normal” - how you feel is valid though. Nothing to worry about or feel the need to change.
Same here
Glad to see im not alone feeling that way:)
[removed]
In some countries you need to legally change your gender before getting bottom surgery. And for that I think you need to be on hrt. So that way is not always possible, but other than that  I fully agree.
Exactly- i think sometimes people forget about the reality of having major surgery on such a sensitive and functional part of the body
Much love to you too
The OP is ftm
Same but opposite. Im not questioning my gender, definitely non-binary. No bottom dysphoria.  Always just thought having a penis would be dope tho
You are not alone a lot of others feel the same way
Wym? Surgeries have risks, yes, but they’re not unsafe. Don’t spread misinformation about surgeries just because you’re not interested in them
It does depend on the country (in the UK, for example, you can get a gender recognition certificate without any medical treatment. Not sure of the requirements for surgeries though) but in those where it’s possible, if someone does it that way it’s still valid, even if it’s not an option everywhere
Officially, here, in my country you need to get approval to get hormones (you need to wait for ONE year after the first appointment at doctor's office). Than, after another ONE year you can get approval for surgery. To get both documents is very hard. But always exist ""other clinics"", where you will pay money and get any surgery you want. Although, you cannot change your gender in your passport without official approval xDD
Woops. I misread that part. In my defense, it is way past my bed time.
[removed]
Surgeries are indeed risky. 

Surgeries are not always successful. 

You're using that word wrong and citing wikipedia lol.
That is not what transmedicalism means. Try reading your ""source"" - it gives the definition in the first line and it is not this.
**[Transmedicalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedicalism)** 
 
 >Transmedicalism is broadly defined as the belief that being transgender is contingent upon experiencing gender dysphoria or wanting medical treatment to transition. Transmedicalists believe that individuals who identify as transgender but who do not experience gender dysphoria or have no desire to undergo a medical transition—through methods such as sex reassignment surgery or hormone replacement therapy—are not genuinely transgender. They may also exclude those whose gender is non-binary from being trans. Transmedicalists are sometimes referred to as truscum, a term coined on Tumblr meaning true transsexual scum, which they have in turn reappropriated.

Congratulations on the great work!!! You reserve everything bit of it!
Awesome! Thanks for being an inspiration to others.
You look so fantastic!! I love your get-up!
beautiful transformation!! so happy for you
Congratulations! I'm so proud of you. I wouldn't even know you were trans if I met you in real life, you look so much like a cis woman!
That’s probably one of the best translations I’ve ever seen
Heck yeah! Keep up the good work!
That’s awesome 😎
Great transformation. Truely amazing.
Damn.... Bombshell
Looking good can't wait to see more of you
This actually made my jaw drop! Holy moly girl you look AMAZING ! You’ve done so good holy oh my GOLLY!!! :’0000 You are so cool ??!! 

Ok ok serious time, The amount of determination and strength it takes to transform your life and body like that in such a short amount of time is incredible. Absolutely incredible. You are inspiring!!
My god how is this possible you are stunning!
Wow, that's an incredible transformation in such a short time & congrats on the weight loss also. You're killing it 💖
So proud of you!
Wow your hairline, your stomach, everything. Looking good girl!
You look amazing! But be careful with keto! My mom is losing all her hair from keto!
Wow, thanks for all the kind feedback everyone! I really appreciate it!
Lately I don't leave the house without a wig. I badly need a human hair wig but I have a collection of 4 synthetic wigs atm. 2 I've enjoyed quite a bit and one I haven't tried out yet. Wigs are expensive but it helps SO MUCH!
Such a nice thing to say! Thank you!
Wow, thank you very much!! 😊
Do you want a human hair wig?  Cause I have one and will never use it again.  Happy to give it a home with one of my trans sisters.
Have you tried hair regrowth stuff like finasteride (propecia) or minoxidil (rogaine)? It seems to work really well in conjunction with HRT. I had some pretty advanced hair loss pre-transition too, but now pretty much all of my hair is regrowing. It still looks uneven on the top, but that is just a matter of letting it grow out. Naturally, YMMV, but it's still worth a look.
[deleted]
I did the finesteride at one point but I've been curious to try minoxidil. Im gonna talk to my doctor about it tomorrow. I've been also thinking of looking into a derma roller.
Good luck. Keep in mind that if you start you'll need to do it for the rest of your life though, but at least it'll be your real hair (provided it grows back).
Minoxidil is over the counter. You can just go buy it at the store and start using it. I usually get the generic stuff from Costco since Rogaine is really expensive."	bwxnfx	trans	519	0.99	2019-06-05 02:49:07
Trans girls, if you could take a pill that would erase your gender dysphoria, would you take it? (Read details)	"So basically this pill would basically blue pill you into an existence before questioning your gender or realizing you were trans. It would also take away your desire to be female, and make you effectively a cis man. Therefore you wouldn’t end up transitioning and would be happy as a cis man. Would you take the pill?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qwktb7)"	"Affirmation already treats my dysphoria, and this pill idea would mean ego death to me. This is who I am. I'd love to be a cis woman, and I'd take a pill for that in a heartbeat but that's an equally impossible concept and would also erase my wisdom, character and being as a trans woman. Again, THIS is who I am.
Why is this only towards mtf?
Why should I take a pill, that stopped me from being me?

This pill is just messing with my innerself.
Taking the pill would absolutely result in a better, easier life. But like, the thought of doing that carries with it the most deep, crushing sadness :( I've finally started to accept and love myself again and thinking about just taking a pill to go back to the way I thought I used to be is literally making me cry. I'll admit I really didn't expect to feel this way. I don't think I could take the pill, no.

OP, I appreciate you asking this question if for no other reason than because it's making me realize that I love who I am. Finally.
In order for my gender dysphoria to go away, it would have to make me a woman, not a,man.

I already have that, only I use an injectable form.
Do i dislike to be trans? yes. 
Do i wish my dysphoria would not be present? yes.
Do i want that my life would be different than i am living it now? absolutely no.

To all those downsides which are around, while being trans, i am really happy to be myself and live my life as me. i have a great life as it is and i grew alot onto the fact im trans in a personal way. overcoming the situations which are trans related and overcome emotional situations helping me to deal way more easy with day to day problems, in fact i was worried all the time for all kind of reasons, being trans kinda cured that. It's like grabbing life by the balls and showing who's boss.

Some people do not make it easy for you cause they don't know it better or are simply afraid of something they don't understand or are just total a-holes but it's not about them.

Life is about you and how you experience it. It should not be determined by others.

So yeah being trans showed me that you mostly don't need some people you think you need and you are more independent than you think. Also it showed me that there are in fact a lot of nice people on this earth even they are less common than the people which are just bad.

I think it's an experience which not a lot of people can make cause they don't have the desire to life the other gender cause they are fine with the gender they assigned with at birth.

So form a standpoint of life, it makes your life more interesting than most peoples lifes are and looking at a live  which might was difficult but worth in the end is all what counts for me.
That's the kind of pill transphobes wants instead  of hrt
(why only trans girls? genuine question lol, i think this poll works in both ways...)
i know i’m among the few who said i would and as much as i want to be a woman, i also just want one day where i don’t wake up and having a morning cry because of my body or voice, ya know?
If I didn't have gender dysphoria I wouldn't care about still being a dude. Ez yes
This is an interesting question of how much of your own identity would you sacrifice for your own ease. Alternatives would be: would you change your race to one that has privilege (eg white English)? Would you change your life goals (eg from loving art to loving accounting; a job that pays better and is easier to succeed in)? How much of what makes you, you, are you willing to give up in order to be treated better by society and live a more stress free life?

(Sorry this question gave me an existential crisis lol)
Why is this towards trans women only? I'm ftm, should i not interact or what /:
OP, just a heads up that this is a general trans sub and trans men and NB people are here as well. For future reference please don't make this sort of post that could apply to everyone specific to trans women, or otherwise put it on r/MtF etc.
No, that would be a lobotomy.
No thats a fate worse than death. I tried being a macho cis guy for 34 years busting my butt every day trying and eventually found out I didn’t even pass for macho once so yeah no thanks ive had a denial pill before. It didn’t do me any good.
How come this only applies to trans women…
Ok, I'm a trans man, but no. Just no.

I'm not taking some magic pill that claims to ""cure"" dysphoria without transition. The only way that would be possible would involve disassembling my brain completely, killing me, and building a new person of a different gender out of my remains. I'd be dead.

Dysphoria is not something that exists on its own. Dysphoria is the mindfuck that comes from having aspects of one's body/life that are inappropriate to one's gender. So there are only two ways this mindfuck can be resolved - either change those aspects of one's body/life to match one's gender, or change one's gender so that one is happy and comfortable as one's assigned sex.

The former option is transition. Bring one's body and life into alignment with one's gender, and the mindfuck is alleviated. And this treatment is incredibly effective. When able to transition young, and spared abuse and discrimination, trans people are as psychologically healthy as the general public.

The latter option is to attempt ""conversion therapy"", and is an actively abusive, worthless, futile train wreck. These attempts were the default medical response to trans people for decades. Every conceivable method was tried including drugs, talk therapy, classical conditioning, electroshock, etc., and they never worked. These attempts left nothing but a wake of ruined lives and suicides.

And it looks like these attempts were doomed to failure because one's gender is literally hard-coded. We don't know exactly how gender is encoded the brain, but it does appear to be both neurologically based and congenital - literally built into the physical structures of the brain that form during gestation.

No therapy, drug, or anything else is going to change these physical structures of the brain. That would require disassembling one's brain on the cellular level, and using its component parts to build a new brain of a different gender. Not only is this so far beyond anything currently medically possible that it might as well be magic, it's also suicide/murder. It destroys the brain, kills the original person, then builds a new person out of their remains. The original person is as dead as if they'd just been shot in the head.
I don't think most of you understood the question...
Is there a reason it’s only for trans girls or can others answer too? There’s no option for us besides results.
No.  There are numerous reasons I psychologically identify with women and do not with men. That's the cause of my dysphoria. I would not wish to change those things about myself.  No blue pill for me, thanks.
I’m surprised so few people are saying yes tbh. At this point I don’t care if I’m a cis woman or a cis man, I just don’t want to deal with this shit anymore
For the morality I'm morally neutral, since the person after the pill will be happy and I will cease to exist.

But given that I have to choose in this state of being trans, I'd assume not since it's part of my identity now. Year into realising you're trans and it's kinda growing on me.


Of course if I had a pill to make me a cis woman, I'd take it in a heartbeat
I'd rather die than take any kind of pill like that. Literally would be identity death to take it.
What the hell is up with these questions lately? What’s the point? There isn’t a pill and there won’t ever be a pill. It’s so self deprecating to think this way
this is like those stories about curing the X-Gene

i would rather sever my own head with a grapefruit spoon
Just thinking about it gives me the chills. Imagining I would be glad to be a man sounds more like a nightmare to me 😅 (no offense to anyone who identifies as male!)
 just suppressing who you are then with a pjll, which j tried to do for years with opiates. But most def no. I would not. I accept myself as trans and live myself and understand who I am beyond what a magic pill could offer me in that regard. It would have to make me a cis woman to remove my gender dysphoria.
Id be sorely tempted. One pill and suddenly Im happy with beinf in the body I am? No dysphoria, not uncomfortable feelings and no long and painful road to change? Hell yeah that sounds amazing...

But its still a lie and its still erasing who I really am, I guess. Being Trans is hard, and upsetting, but its who we are and its an integral part of what makes us into us. So its worth it.

Besides, since coming out, being female is real for me, so it would just be mentally transitioning to match my outsides... which spunds awful.

So yeah, tempting at first. Id have probably said yes when I was 11 and this all first started, but absolutely not now, no.
I didn't respond to the poll since im ftm, but ill go agaisnt the grain of salt of most comments and : Yes. I would take the pill.
Being trans is nothing but a medical condition to me. Im transitioning since it's the only cure for how I feel. If i could feel better in my skin as is, aka becoming a cis girl, i would. Because theres nothing wrong with my body as is. Just my brain doesn't fit it. If i could save myself trilions of surgery, daily hormone taking, transphobia and my parents hating my ass, i fckin would. Of course, i would a lot more rather be a cis man. But i guess i wouldn't feel that way without dysphoria ahaha
No way, I don't want to be someone I'm not. I'm a woman, not a man and I have *zero* desire to be a man. Transition solves my dysphoria and allows me to live authentically so it is a preferable option even if it is harder.
Iread that wrong I accidentally put yes, but like no.
If there would have been a magic pill, no side effects whatsoever, maybe I would have taken it.
I have suffered a lot because of dysphoria a great deal and it still affects me...

But I am also proud of the progress I made transitioning, overcoming obstacles.
And most importantly, I am happy with being the woman I've become.

So it's a difficult question, but also highly hypothetical.

I am strongly opposed to any kind of conversion therapy, because they do not work at all and cause a lot of harm.
Internalized transphobia is tough.
id rather be a cis female... don't know why id ever go back to before when i thought i was a cis male. transition isn't ideal (mostly because of the hate and systems in place to keep us from fully achieving our transition goals) but its still waaay better then being something im not
 No, I don’t want to erase my identity. 

But I would take an instant transition pill
NO and the very notion of this would probably cause every transphobe out there to invalidate my identity.  The only reason I am trans is because I'm a woman and the doc said I wasn't.  This is suggesting the doctor would be right.   


 Who would I even be then?  Would I be a trans man then?  I'm a woman, so this would basically be a pill to turn me into a man.  There are amab boys who after sustaining genital injuries were made to be girls.  An example is David Reimer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer)  He was a man even when he was told not to be.  How is he not trans?    


This is basically a pill to force people to be transgender, not make them cis.  This very notion sickens me.  People are who they are, and no amount of medication or surgery will change that.
I'm a woman, why would I want a pill that makes me tolerate being a man? Why would I want a pill that would give me a lobotomy?
Absolutely not.  I wouldn't exist anymore.
I’d have to think about it cause I know who I am right now and I mean I would only do it if I could be a cis girl I think.
Lol I already take a pill that helps with my dysphoria, it’s called E! :p
If it meant I had to live as my AGAB, then no. If I could be the woman I'm supposed to be after, then yes.
Oof , I didn’t read the description lol I change my answer to a firm NO , honestly I just want the dysphoria to stop or at least subside for longer periods of time . not to be tricked into playing boy again ...
Trans and proud forever🏳️‍⚧️❤️
I used to feel a lot of dysphoria, but after transitioning and defeating my depression I barely feel anything at all. I am very confident and fulfilled in myself.

We need to stop treating being trans as a curse and more like just another aspect of ourselves.
 I'd only take the pill that makes me cis girl😁
I'd stop being me then. And I like me. And I already am taking a pill that treats my gender dysphoria, it's called estrogen.
I'm a transgender woman. My dysphoria is about how I feel about my body and how society treats me, not about being I'm trans.

I don't desire to be a cisgender woman. If I was cis I'd still probably have dysphoria because my identity isn't 100% female. People want to pass and I understand that. I want acceptance for who I am.

I don't want to be cisgender man either because I like the person my experiences have made me. My dysphoria isn't my identity and to eliminate who I am to eliminate dysphoria is too harsh and extreme. It would be the end my existence so another person could be happy and sad. Sad with different problems that they would wish a blue pill would also eliminate.

I am who I am, for all the faults and flaws. I like who I am and I hope everyone can find joy in themselves too. Acceptance is more powerful then my dysphoria.
Ok this frustrates me because the title is not the same as what you describe in the body of the post. Dysphoria is not an essential part of the trans experience, you can identify and present however you want and it is just as valid whether you have dysphoria or not. Dysphoria is a feeling, it comes and goes and might not be something that some people experience at all, it is not the defining trait of a trans experience. 

So, would I take a pill to erase dysphoria? Sure. Would I get rid of my own trans identity? Hell no.
This is applicable to trans men too btw…
Even if I were cis, I would still be autistic and ADHD, and I still would have grown up with an emotionally toxic mother. I still would have had to face all the same challenges, just I would have had a slightly lighter burden. I’m proud of what I have accomplished in spite of all the detractors I have faced in life, and if I do have bottom surgery I will keep the scars because I am proud to be transgender 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💫. 

Would I take an instant transformation to a physically female body? In a heartbeat. I would still call myself transgender. I was assigned male at birth, but I was never a male; I’ve always been a tomboy. I have no interest in being a cis male.
No, cause I learned so much on the way I went. 

If I wouldn't I probably would be the douche I was before, watching anti SJW Videos and thinking that the many problems of women would be non-existent...
All I see is HAPPY so, I mean who can turn down a happy life?
You know, years ago I wished I could just be cis, even if it meant I was a cis man, as long as I was comfortable with myself. I would definitely have said yes back then. But now that I'm actually transitioning, and people are starting to treat me the way I want them to, I don't think I would anymore. For the first time in a long time I'm actually hopeful and excited for my future.
I really don’t like the idea of medically erasing part of myself, whether it’s my gender or my autism. I don’t think we should mess with people’s minds and identities like that.
No. I discovered I want to be a trans girl and it makes me so happy, I can't even remember what being cis felt like anymore🥰🥰
I know who I am, and while pretending would be easy, and my time thinking I was just a very feminine twink was incredibly fun, there are things intrinsic to being me that I can't change. What would removing dysphoria do? Would it stop me from wanting curves? Would it make me not mind my voice? While I don't owe femininity to ANYONE, would my lack of effort make things any easier for me? Its a quick fix to a systemic problem we have, and we have an obligations to future generations to do what we can do build a better future. Heros like fucking Marsha P Johnson died for others fighting this struggle, and we've made great strides thanks to their efforts. If we stick it out, and are heard, real change can happen
I'd rather push the button than take the pill. But cis straight males have it so easy... Plus I never was a bigot, and fighting from a position of privilege does more than what I can do right now.
I met my gf a year into my transition. Wouldn't be with her if I didn't transition. So no, I won't take this pill
such a good question, I really hope my answer changes as I move further along my transition
I’d have to think but probably not as it’s made me a better person
Yes. A lot of people are saying that something like that would be horrible but honestly I don't care what gender I am I just want this shit to go away. I don't even want to be trans but being a girl is the only thing making me feel happy. I wish I could be happy as a guy or be a cis girl.
Why would I do that

I'm a woman, not a man
Hell no. I would never get rid of my transness. I love who I am now, I hated who I was before. I’m finally happy. And I’m going to chase happiness from now on.
Frick i hit 'yes' before I read the clarification text! 

Iiuuuhhhh , ,, undo! Undo!!
No, besides just being a woman, I really *want* to be a woman
So I answered “Yes” before reading the details of this. I thought it meant just the discomfort that comes from dysphoria not my identity as a trans person
I’m a trans man and at this point in my life no. I’m in a happy gay relationship and living as a man has made me happy. Going back to being a girl would kinda be a fuckin disaster lol.
I see a lot of these posts around, and every single one gets more towards the no that the previous one. 

I have a question, does this pill remove all the time you spent questioning from your mind? If so does this not erase a huge amount of your identity. Who are you without your experiences?

We are who we are, our journeys define us and make us both stronger and more ourselves. I'll take the pill that changes my body into a cis-woman's but only if I retained my memories from before Otherwise I would be taking a pill that made me into a different person. The world is better having us than not having us.

Now that I've accepted myself the thought of being a cis man fills me with revulsion. Being myself is hard but that doesn't mean I don't love who I am. 

Those of us who say yes almost certainly are saying yes because they have less ability to transition than those of us who say no. This is fine, but it is worth realizing that the problem here is not being trans, but the world making it impossible to be trans without great pain.
I already take a blue pill to treat my dysphoria. It’s called Estradiol.
Would it stop dysphoria by making my body match my gender identity? 
Cause I'd rather change my body than my identity
Terf island will really make you wish you were one of the cissies
Dysphoria does it make you trans
I'm confused by people who would say no? The whole point is your personality doesn't really change based on what gender you are. My personality isn't based on my transness. It is a unique thing I go through, but it doesn't affect the way I behave or who I am particularly. I would rather be cis no matter what gender I was. I am a trans man though, so the idea of being a cis man does make me feel somewhat upset because I'm already finding the socialisation that men go through quite constrictive. I can understand why anyone wouldn't want to be a man and why people would prefer to be women. The socialisation of women is generally closer to the natural urges all people have to be close with others and have a sense of individuality imo, having lived through both
No, being male is icky and I don't want to want to be it.
Waaaait!! I didn’t read the description. I didn’t mean say yes. I say no I say noooooo! I wanna recouuuunt! 😭😭😭
[deleted]
Objectively speaking I think being a female is better than being male. You can be creative with makeup, so many more clothing options. Done successfully the female body is a work of art IMO. So I’d rather be a female with dysphoria than a male without any dysphoria.
Oops I accidentally clicked on the answer before reading the conditions. I thought it would just complete the process
Would I be able to be a cis man without the patriarchal and homo/transphobia and racism that usually comes with being a cis man? If I can’t, then hard pass on the blue pill. If I don’t have the patriarch thinking after taking the blue pill, then maybe. I’d rather take a pill that makes me a cis woman, without the patriarch thinking of course.
i thought you meant hrt before i answered lol so one yes it's actually a no
I do, they contain Oestradiol
If I could be a cis girl taking the pill yes, if a cis man then no
That would take me back to being 3 years old? That's when I first knew.

Would it undo my past? Because if it didn't, there would be no use and I would not take the pill. If it did, it would put me back at 3 years old. And I don't know if I would want to go through childhood as a boy again.
Yes I believe I would’ve for years.  Perhaps I would still be married, living with my children.  
But that’s done.  
Now?  I don’t know.  Navigating the world as a coming out 48 yr old trans woman is scary as fuck.
I am already taking the pills that are slowly erasing my dysphoria, so I’d rather kindly refuse 😉
I didn't read the details °^°
I'm not sure. Being trans does introduce a lot of difficulty into my life, and there are a lot of negatives. The reason I'm transitioning is because I am currently happier this way. If I could take something that would just make me happy as who I was, I would at least consider it.
Putting aside all the nitpicking and philosophy and overanalyzing, this question essentially just becomes ""would you rather be trans or cis"". I love who I am and there are many many positive things that have come from realizing that I am trans, but I was 30 before I realized that and would sure as heck like to reclaim those years of confused, hopeless, dysphoric suffering.
Being trapped in a tomb of mutating, degrading flesh forever without even knowing I should scream is about the worst fate I can imagine.
Honestly, I’d have to think about it. I’d probably say yes AT THIS POINT IN TIME due to the fact that dysphoria has been a bitch these past few weeks. But I’m sure I’ll grow into the idea of it eventually.
Long comment but whats important is that the community has given me the courage to be myself. Seeing you post your selfies capturing how beautiful and happy y'all are has done a lot for me 

CW:brief mention chances of violence 

If I was offered it when my egg cracked I would've taken it. Ngl I was kinda pissed to figure out find out I'm trans...angry and scared I was. My first thoughts were I can't afford that, being woman is scary, difficult, and dangerous along with I'd get unwanted attention if I pass and even worse if I don't. My odds of being assaulted or killed would sky rocket. I tried to talk myself out of it by telling myself ""I don't mind being a man, it's fine. It's just like a job, it's just what I do to get by"". After I said that out loud I started balling because that was the moment I cracked and realized I was in denial.
I'm a happier person today. I wish I would've cracked sooner but I forgive myself because most of my life was fighting for survival and didn't have a chance to have a relationship with myself and look inward. I figured I'd try things out and if I feel comfortable then keep going if not then at least I can say I'm courageous and confident enough to go out on a limb. I haven't started hrt yet but the three months I've been out have been positive overall and I've never felt so strong in my life. My ex said it takes a whole lot of manhood to be a woman, if I had to be a boy before a woman then I'd do it all again.
While I’m not a trans girl, i don’t think I’d take a pill. While it would be nice to not have to experience gender dysphoria, taking a pill that makes me happy in my agab would effectively change me as a person. I mean I couldn’t tell you who’d I be if it weren’t for the experiences I’ve encountered and gone through. Each part of my identity makes me who I am and while painful at times, I wouldn’t change that.
Before reading the description, I immediately thought “yes”, because in my mind the pill would erase my dysphoria by making me a girl… 
It’s telling how hesitant I was after reading the details
Not to sound cold, but this has the same vibe as the people trying to find a “cure” for autism. Being trans and being none-binary-with-left-girl has shaped so much of my life that I can’t imagine that version of me as “me”. This is a part of me whether it causes strife or not.
This reminds me of all the people who think autism needs to be ""cured"". Like...it's a fundamental part of who I am as a person and how I both view and contribute to the world (both being autistic and trans)
Taking that away even for my own supposed comfort means I'm not the person I was intended to be, if that makes sense.
Shit I didn't realize what it meant! I clicked yes, but I want to be a female!! Shit!!
Honestly, I would. Sure, I'd never be ""complete"" but, this whole thing is really expensive, and as someone who is, let's say financially challenged, it's pretty damn depressing knowing I can never afford the treatment I need. So right now I'm just stuck as someone I don't want to be with no way out. 

Not to mention the hate I get from people here. It's just small things, a word or a scoff, maybe a weird look. I still dress male but if I ever mention how I feel, well a lot of people in my area don't care for us, you know what I mean? I don't feel like I fit in. I wish I did, so I could be confident. I wish I liked cars and football and other ""guy"" things, but I don't, and it alienates me a lot from neighbours
I pick ""have to think"" but really i mean ""only if i gave up and wanted an easy way out (not ded)""
In a heartbeat. Being Catholic, I’m walking a very fine line by completely medicalizing my being trans.
Yes I would take it. I spent decades repressing my identity and trying everything I could to accept masculinity, including taking anabolic steroids for several years, and attempting suicide when I realized I'd destroyed my body even further to no avail. I wish desperately that there was a cure that didn't involve the hardship of transitioning, and I'll still never have the body I want.   

That said, this is my answer at 30 after a lifetime of suffering. I don't wish this pill existed, I wish I had been loved an accepted as a child and I wish I had the opportunity to transition at a young age.
I pressed yes before reading the full thing ):
I clicked yes before reading and now I wish I could change my answer
I guess I’d probably take it, since the whole point of transitioning is for being happy with myself… which I would be if I took the pill.

Would I be happier as a cis man? Dunno, doesn’t really happen to me…
No, because that only “solves” a part of it. I still have to be a man put up with a bunch of bullshit from other men about how to man correctly. So I go back to being depressed, super angry, and not measuring up.

This wouldn’t “fix” things for me, it’d break me more.
Yes. I would.

Transitioning has devastated a lot of aspects of my life. It'd be far easier if i could've just been happy as a cis male.
I said I'll have to think about it because 1) what does this do for bigender or gender fluid people? Do they simply lose the desire to change genders but still can do it if they arbitrarily decide to? 

2) from the comments, its pretty clear a lot of people consider their dysphoria to be the driver of their transition, and that without the discomfort of being their AGAB, they wouldn't want to transition. And that's probably true for a lot of people, but I think discomfort as your AGAB and comfort as your true gender are two separate things that aren't necessarily related, so this question gets complicated for those who think they would still transition even without dysphoria. For me, I would probably not take the pill,  but that's because in order to be comfortable as a man, I'd have to suddenly start being able to fit into guy spaces in a way that fundamentally changes my personality.  If this is a magic pill that doesn't change my personality but erases the dysphoria, though, then I might take it, but still want to transition anyways because there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a different gender regardless of whether you have dysphoria or not.
Well, cis men live considerably easier lifes than mtf trans women. It would have to do wonders because I really hated living the masculine gender, but if it's magic it might be an interesting idea. Probably would have taken it while transitioning and right after... Nowadays I think I am happy with my life as it is.
Yeah I would definitely take it I transitioned to get rid of my dysphoria
I'd rather have a pill that would make me a cis woman, but if my dysphoria would disappear with no other symptoms I'd take it.
im not defined by my gender so. yes. if this is a way to solve a huge part of my problems. 
for most off my life I wanted to ignore these problems so if it would be possible I would

 but since my gender is directly wired to everything else. it's kinda like destroying the things I am defined by in the process.

so if a term tries to use this just know it's like mindcontrol slavery
I’m happy this way, I don’t want to be a man, Even if I could be hypnotised or forget about it, it’s not me.
Would love to know stats of people in a follow up like. Like:

Have you started your transition?

How do you feel your transition is going?

At what stage in your transition do you feel you are?

(Obvi we can't gather that but interesting to see how all yes/no participants would break down).
If i took that pill, for me it would mean that i'm erasing myself. So even if i was *living happy as a cis man* after taking the pill, it would be a shallow existence where im not me. I'm a woman, and at least my experience is not that i had a desire to be one, because i already am and always have been
Ugh, what about trans men.


Also, taking a pill to enable one to live a lie does not seem appealing at all.
The results of this poll indicate one thing to me: for most, being trans isn’t the problem, it’s the fact that we live in a world where we’re not fully accepted and allowed to explore ourselves that’s the problem.
Definitely not, I was a shit kind of person when I tried to be my AMAB gender, so taking a pill like that would make me that again.
Oh shit i meant no rip my +1 to yes without reading the full context rip the results are skewed +1 to no pls. UwU
Fuck, I did yes by mistake. NO, I WANT TO BE A GIRL, GODDAMN IT.
I'll be completely honest, if I were a cis man I think I'd still wind up being a femboy. Its too nice being cute, haha
wait shoot I misread I meant no
Just curious, why is this specifically targeted towards only trans women and not trans men?
I wanna be a girl because I am a girl, but also, girls > boys
I am not a trans girl so can't answer on that one. But I am a transguy. Tbh in my opinion what I experience isn't gender dysphoria but just wanting to live as a fellow cisguy. I am not a cisguy unfortunately but if I have the body of it I would feel complete. I would buy everything necessary for the beard shit. And the perfect description of me is just a guy with a feminine voice
Wow, I voted no fully expecting to be the outlier. This made me so happy :)

Edit: didn’t read the full post when I wrote this.
It's hard to say because I'm still pre hrt. Maybe I would be happier post transition than if I didn't have dysphoria
Without voting yet, on one hand I’d like to take the pill. Live a more average life, have kids the natural way, not live with the crippling pain that comes with Dysphoria, and even though my transition’s on its way it might be nice to not have to. But. Who would I be if I wasn’t? Being trans isn’t just one small bit of me, my gender has informed and changed so many choices throughout my life; depression, euphoria, wanting to be seen a certain way and celebrating the moments where I was. It’s affected my behaviors, envy and mannerisms, if suddenly I took a pill to change my mental identity I’m not sure I’d still even be me, so many experiences would be all-but erased, and I’d have to spend so much time rediscovering the unrecognizable person I’d become.

But even with that, part of me is tempted to just say that yes, I’d take a pill to not hate how I look, to not hate the sound of my voice and the lack of certain physicalities, even if it cost me a part of myself, just for the sake of having a life I know my family would prefer me to have.

That said. If there was a full-female transformation on the table, I’d take that in preference any day. But if this miracle pill did come out to change who I was, I’m ashamed to say I might take it just to alleviate some of the suffering of the past, and suffering yet to come.

If that answer makes anyone upset, well, thanks for reading it anyways. I just like to write my thoughts out, ‘cause it’s easier than talking for me.
I would rather not stay a cis man, it's funny dysphoria defending itself from being erased but yea
I voted wrong accidentally...
i don't want to be a man but i want to be cisgender, but not a man
Didnt read the full question and put yes I ment too put no
I answered no, essentially because I am  me because of lifelong dysphoria. It’s not just part of me it is me. I will often think poor me “why can’t I just be a gay man”, but if you offered me a way to stay a cis man I would never do it. That thought of wishing I could be a cis man is so much rarer than wishing I was a cis women. I probably would have answered this question differently a couple of months ago especially before I started my transition and I was looking for any way out. But now that I’ve done some real steps to transition. I never want to go back I am already happier. So /op just know that most of us have asked ourselves this exact question. It’s okay to have doubts but we are who we are and we have always been here.
I MEANT NO
I probably would have said yes in the past when I was distressed and wanted it to all go away and to just fit in. I certainly did wish it many times over my life.

I’ve done a lot of learning about myself and I feel happier now that I am moving towards what I need. I don’t want to erase what I have now. I can’t imagine going back to that. I know my experience has been with me for a very long time even if I refused to see it or couldn’t explain it at the time. I’m really not sure what being cisgender would mean for my internal life and what it would feel like.

I would now fear that such a pill would lock me in a deep depersonalization and not really fix anything or worse like rewriting my personality and memories from the core.
nah I kinda like being who I am
I'm sorry but most of people saying no here just sound like privileged assholes
All my life i felt like something was missing. People around me were confident: they were friendly with each other, they had a strong sense of self, they even flirted confidently. For me, it was like my foundation was made of foam: i had nothing solid to fall back on.

All signs pointed toward something i either didn’t know about, or was forbidden from accessing due to my religious upbringing. But through years of hard, painful questioning, i undid my internalized transphobia, learned about different perspectives, and finally, FINALLY, embraced a foundation for me to base everything in my life on. And it’s written in Yellow, White, Purple, and Black.

I’m never going back.
my Dysphoria and struggle with being trans both made me who I am and also brought me closer to my three friends and now roommates. No I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t be me without it, as much as it hurts.
I would literally prefer this. Like, what I'm doing now isn't bad, I don't hate myself for being trans, but being cis would just be easier overall.

Unfortunately this kind of magic medicine doesn't exist, despite what conservatives will make you wanna think haha
I don't like being trans but I want to be a cis woman far more than I don't want to be trans. I'd never take a pill to go back to being a cis man but give me a pill to be a cis woman and I'll gobble that up yesterday.
this pill would take away dysphoria but wouldn’t change your gender, yeah?
not having dysphoria and not recognizing you’re trans wouldn’t change the fact you’re trans. i cant imagine anyone being able to be truly happy when their mind and body are incongruent, and this pill doesn’t change that it simply helps you cope. now lets say this pill can in fact change my gender, well i wouldn’t want that either. i wouldn’t want to sacrifice my whole personality to not have dysphoria. put it simply, i care more about my mind than my body, and i would rather change my body to match my mind not vice versa. i want a sex change not a gender change. but going to back to how this magic pill is worded, WOULD NOT WANT THAT. it doesn’t cure any problems. i used to smoke weed to ignore my dysphoria and this seems like the same idea, you are turning off the gender dysphoria pain sensors but you are not removing the pain. antidepressants dont cure depression they help you manage it. i dont want to manage the pain of being trans i want to make being trans not painful. in a society where being trans is embraced, i dont see any of us experiencing the same level of pain that we currently experience. imagine a world where people embraced you for transitioning and not passing yet. so much pain comes from people being weird towards people that are “in between sexes”. trans people are treated well when people cant tell theyre trans, and we need to make it so that we love and embrace people who cant pass either.
These questions are so toxic and need to stop. This question was used in the 90s and 00s to gatekeep transitioning. If you didn't answer right they could refuse us treatment.
Why keep bringing them back knowing they were used against so many of us for so long
I'd be doing a disservice to myself not to see this through after everything I've gone through to get here.
I didn’t read it and chose the wrong option ;~;
Fem-normative af, this is a server for all trans people.
Honestly... no. Without my current identity, I wouldn't have made ""Wake Up and Start!"" I Wouldn't have looked into LGBTQ+ topics, wouldn't have met some of the most wonderful people I ever talked to, and wouldn't have had the drive to do anything or work on my other issues at once. 

While I wish I was born female, I don't think I would have been happy if only this issue was removed.
No, and I’d spend the rest of my life terrified that someone would try to slip that pill to me in my food or drinks to make me a guy if it existed. This med is nightmare fuel for me. This new person who’d open their eyes after taking the pill would be a weird stranger with some of my memories and probably all sorts of different opinions, thoughts and emotions, essentially a different person.

Would I want to have been born a cis woman, absolutely. I don’t like the struggles we go through, I don’t think many people would choose to willingly face discrimination or anxiety or the terror of stepping out of your comfort the first time you come out to ask for help. But I sure as heck think all of that is miles and miles better than living as a guy ever was, trying to fit in and being miserable and sad about not being like the other girls around me. Being a girl, cis or trans, is so much better and comfier for me, and I’m plenty happy living my life as a woman.
In a heart beat. No hesitation. I hate being trapped between two worlds. I'll never ever pass. And i was never happy after puberty. I hate existing. You're goddamn right I'd take something to make me less fucked up. Every day is a struggle just to be alive.
No thanks
This is an interesting question, but I desire to be a woman so badly that I wouldn’t want to do anything that made me a man, even if it took away the pain associated with being AMAB.
I'd love to eradicate dysphoria but I much prefer the way where I don't entirely eradicate who I am. I can't ever see myself living blissfully as a man.
You really can't get an answer to this question. People who say no are still influenced by their lived experience. Those who said yes understand that there IS a root issue with the brain and so not having to treat it (transitioning is typically the most effective treatment) would mean you would have basically been a completely different person.
If you asked me when I was still trying to figure myself out then yeah but now after coming out and seeing life can be better than what it was. Absolutely not
I think if the universe wanted me to be like the average norm I would be. But I’m not. I’m unique and different for a reason. There are days where it’s hard definitely, many times I cry. I want to be beautiful and feminine so much and I’m chasing that. Taking a pill that would kill that I feel would kill a true part of myself that I wouldn’t want to lose.
No.... dysphoria sucks but being a cis man also sucks
Like, legit, if I could just take a pill to switch my emotions on as a man? Down in one. But then my philosophy is that I’m the thing that experiences things - as long as those are good things I don’t feel super attached to my identity.

Which is where being trans suuuuuperrr sucks, because it means giving up so many of the “good” things I’ve just naturally been given.

Unfortunately, as a dude I only appreciate these “good” things on an academic level. You give me the connection I feel as a girl and I’ll bite your hand off.
I mean, not now that I’m years into transition and all, but a decade or more ago, hell yeah
Shit I voted before I read lmao can’t change my answer
If it would remove dysphoria and make me happy, I would do it since even though now it seems awful to me I would be a whole diff. person technically. I'm okay with that, anything to stop the mental anguish. I've lost view of souls and this and that over so much time, just want to live happy as much as I can in what I see to be a very cruel world. Though I would prefer something to completely transform my body into what I wish it was.


It might just be because I feel like it's impossible from this viewpoint, but sometimes I wonder if transitioning would be worth it. There's so much I know I'll lose and I worry it won't be enough either. Eh
Living a lie isn't worth it.
I am who I am I wouldn't change anything and if I could I'd probably transition sooner. The journey of a trans person is far from easy for most but I think most would also agree that's what makes it so much more worth it. 

Love who you are folks, you are valid!

-Eevee 😘💜
Me: Full of doubt over whether transition is right for me.

Also me: I feel like I don't want the pill to make me content as I am, because being a girl seems like such a positively better thing to me.
i already take a blue pill that eases my dyphoria, its called estradiol
Why just trans girls lol
only real thing that's disphoric to me is any hair not on my head, other than that I'm fine
Honestly yes. The way I'm interpreting this is that I wouldn't have MY specific dysphoria, which is more focused on social expectations rather than my body. so my personality and presentation wouldn't change I would just be okay with people labeling my as a cis woman. 

I would still have cis woman problems but in my experience I think I'm gonna have to deal misogyny forever since my actual ideal body is more androgynous, even tho I'd still like to be seen as a dude. 

I think I would just end up being really butch and that's fine. I'd probably still get at least a breast reduction, tho.
Since im a trans guy this would solve my dysphoria problem by making me a cis male
If you could have a pill to completely change how your brain works and make you into someone else, would you do it? My brain has always been like this, I'm just shaping my body around that. I'd rather the rest of the world didn't recognize me than not recognize myself. *shrug*
i didn’t read the add on and i’m not a trans girl but i wanted to answer anyway 

 i would like it if my dysphoria went away and i could live as an agender person but not being agender would be boring lmao
My dysphoria has become part of my life story, and i wouldn't want to erase my past like that. I understand i would become happy with being a cis male and would no longer want to be a woman.... but that would be losing who i really am. I am a woman, no matter what, it is just who i am.
Of course I would take it! I’m not trans because I want to be a woman, I’m trans because I need to be me. If there’s a pill that lets me do that and gets rid of this dysphoria, I’ll take it for sure!
I would take it and have all the privilege and benefits of being a cis person.  Would be a huge weight off my mind.
No being a man sucks, i hate it, i'm literally treated like trash for no real reason other than i have a dick, facial hair is a bitch to shave, i love smooth legs, i'm not good at taking anal, and i don't like having a dick, no way i'm taking that
Life would be definitely easier if i take the pill, but, i would lose a lot. I mean, I'm just starting and i met a lot of people, made a lot of things that i thought i wouldn't do and i feel so much better. Idk if i would sacrifice my personal growth for a easier life.
I don’t get dysphoria so I can’t comment
Eat pill, lose dysphasia, stay male? Yup.
I'm happily a trans women. I domt want to go back to being a cis male. Sur ei could of lived a life and been in a manner content. Bit it still would of just been existing.

I domt want to be a cis female either. Being born one would of taken as much out of it as staying male would of been. I would of been stuck with *something* missing.

 I don't want a vagina, I don't want to bear children. I just want to be exactly who I'm becoming. This has all been a journey and it's about more than just the destination. I'm content on my path and every step of the way has been an *experience*
Even though it can be really difficult sometimes, being trans is a part of me. A part that has and will continue to shape me as a person and as an individual

I don't think I could ever really bring myself to press reset...
I love living as a woman (Tans Woman). I selected no bc after living as a female, I couldn’t imagine being happier or more satisfied with life. The idea now as living happily as a man is unsettling… weird to write this. I cherish womanhood and wouldn’t return to the maleverse for a million dollars.
Absolutely- easiest answer ever. I don’t think I really want to make my life a hell of a lot harder than I needs to be. With that being said I am who I am and I think I’m pretty neat so like I’m cool with being trans too.
Were I not already on HRT, I probably would take it. But it’s a bit late for that, now. Not that I’m all too sad about missing out on a opportunity present only in some sort of fantastic hypothetical.
I misclicked; I meant to say no. Honestly as much as it sucks, dysphoria shaped my true identity, if I think about it.
I see this question like every week and the answer is no 100%. Dysphoria sucks but at that point the line between being “returned to normality” and essentially character suicide is nonexistent. That would Not be the same person and I probably wouldn’t like that person
A life of no emotion is worse than one with bad emotions
A friend asked me about this once, I thought about it but I feel like giving up my gender identity just to stop the dysphoria would be giving up a big part of who I am.
I’d rather deal with the struggle of transition than be a man, even under the circumstances you describe, so no I wouldn’t take the pill, I’ll stick to my estrogen ones thanks
Of course not
I'd prefer to take a pill that changes my sex to cis female tbh.

I would feel too weird about not having dysphoria/incongruent identity because I've felt that way and been aware of why I felt that way for most of my life since childhood. 

And throughout most of my childhood and teenage years I was in denial about it and I constantly tried to reaffirm to myself and others that I was a cis man, because I was met with so much negativity and hostility for any feminine expression, so I just behaved the way I was told to and I felt dead inside, I felt like who I was as a person had eroded and I was just repeating some programmed responsese, if that's what this pill has to offer; I'm not taking it.

It's an unpleasant thing, especially on bad days, but it was also the frame for every experience I've had in my life, I wouldn't feel like myself if it suddenly disappeared. To a lesser extent I feel the same way about having autism.
Ego death is such a good description for all those tropes with mind erasers or time travel.


Yey they are alive , but Its useless if they dont remember themselves.



This is me. The trans person. I am not the cis guy that would appear in my place.
This. I thought for so long that I was just a guy who knew better than to be sexist. And I was OK at it, not great. I thought all guys were gender envious, and I was just better at controlling it. Without this, would I have been a bad person? Would I have been just another sexist pig dude?

I'd rather not risk it.
Well said. Our journey is a part of who we fucking are.
Trans woman here, not sure why! I think it's dum to limit this poll personally, there's no real reason to not include every trans person
We the shadow people are already here at the party and aren't invited to the games. Can we atleast get cake?
All these trans men exploiting the poorly worded magic pill to become cis men.

Well done, total king shit.
I know I’m actually kinda surprised how many say yes.
I agree with you! However I pressed yes first because I misunderstood the message, then after checking the post, I saw the description. How regretful.
I would deffo press no if I got to change my answer.
This was really touching and made me feel better about myself. Thank you sis. <3
Glad I could help 😊
I don’t understand how a better, easier life could possibly lead to sadness. That’s the ideal life.
I mean if it would make you a cis man it would mean no dysphoria
[deleted]
Yeah cause they think it's a mental problem, but it's a physical problem. Only matching your body to your brain helps
Wouldn't it be better to take this kind of pill and be happy with your body right away than going through years of hrt and most likely a surgery?
Most likely because somebody asked this question on r/mtf yesterday and the person who posted this version of the question didn’t think to change it at all
Same...
Idk I agree, I don’t get why this isn’t a more popular opinion, especially for people pre-transition like me

I mean being trans isn’t a central part of my personality, it’s just a trait I’m forced to live with and to have an easy way out of the constant misery would be nice, not like I’d disappear as a person, I’d still be able to do everything I do now but not lose my family in the process and be happy with myself 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
You will get there one day through transitioning too.
But you also wouldn’t get to be a girl like you want to be right?
>loving accounting

It's funny that i loved accounting and studied it at one of the best universities in the world but gave up a possible career in that to move to the other side of the world so i could transition and be who i really am
Yeah a lot of this sub seems to be centric/leaning towards MtF for some reason idk 🤷 

I hit “results” bc I’m on the non-binary spectrum and neither transfem (I’m afab so that’s impossible) nor transmasc (more intrafeminine and somewhat Transneutral). I was gonna say, why not transmasc and Transneutral folks in this survey?
I'm sorry you guys get treated like this sometimes
I might be wrong, but I think I saw a similar post yesterday either here or on another subreddit, might be the same person, not sure. Not sure the need to ask it twice right after the other.
I just hit results. We may not be included in this one, but the results are still pretty interesting!
They don’t allow polls
Bruh you obviously don't know what lobotomy is then
How is it worse than death? You just wouldn't have an issue with being a man with no dysphoria
This. This is exactly how I feel. Ever read one of those books/stories where they go through some magical change that also changes their personality? Yeah, death of a character IMO. It's honestly scary to think about that and how it would effect me.

Now if said pill just transformed my body in such a way that made it align with my mind, I don't see why not. I never see that question get asked alongside this question, it's always one or the other, and it's sad to me.
So what if the pill made it so you still were exactly who you are now, but you had no social dysphoria. Meaning, you could be transitioning and get the surgery and do the T, but you would be genuinely ok with people still addressing you as a woman. I think I would want that pill, bc I would still be me, but it would reduce a lot of day to day stress. 

To be fair, I am non-binary and gender has lost its meaning
Right? The post literally says ""you'd be happy as a cis man."" It's a hypothetical question, realism doesn't apply. All these people saying ""It's worse than death"" are confusing
Thanks, I am not the only one. I don't understand, what's the point of being myself if I am always unhappy to be myself and living in the body I was born with? If I could be ok with being a man, life would be soooo much easier m I would be a burden for my gf and child, I would have better job opportunities in the long run and I wouldn't need to live in constant fear of being called a man when I try to present female. Of course if I could chose I would be a cis woman, but better be a cis man than the piece of shit that I feel I am.
What's so wrong with wanting to be cis and not have to deal with this shit?
Lots like it as a ""fun what if""
I agree. These questions posed like we are “sick” or something is “wrong” with being trans is just draining. Yes I have some other mental illness but they are completely a separate case from the fact that im trans. There is nothing wrong with being trans. Its other people that are the problem
Ohhh can I be Kitty Pryde?
[removed]
That Reimer case seems to prove gender identity is more then a social construct right? It seems to be the best evidence there is a biological basis, correct me if I’m wrong.
I mean cis = no dysphoria so yeah
How is that icky?
Bruh
I say no because then I wouldn't be me anymore, and that scares me. I don't want to die.
Yes, \*hands you some cake\*
I saw the results, and I’m surprised by that too.

Though I just saw that this is a general trans group, and the question is written just for women, so men answering it would probably be like “yeah, sure, I’ll be a cis man”, Which could account for it
I said yes bc I barely want to live. I just want to be happy. Transitioning isn’t easy for everyone, and dysphoria can be crippling for many. I’d rather change who I am without ever knowing than keep living in agony. Even in the matrix I sided with the dude who kept eating his ‘fake’ steak. Sorry if this is disappointing, but reality often is. Being in the wrong body sucks so bad that I’d rather just not feel it.
It's not that
It's that i would rather not deal with the hate that comes with transition. 

Being a cis man is simple, and the privilege is pretty good too sadly.

Anyway, people saying yes probably are pre hrt people
I honestly didnt read the description at first and would have voted yes thinking ""makes me a cis woman, right? Yeah id probably take that pill"" so I think the results are skewed somewhat
I misunderstood the message, I might not be the only one not reading the posts detailed description. Sucks that I can't change the answer.
I have a wife. That basically explains my answer.
I said yes before i read the rest of the post ;-;
Sorry for wanting to be happy with my body lmao
That's really great :) I'm glad
To clarify - no, I wouldn't be sad after taking the pill. Presumably this hypothetical cure for dysphoria would indeed get rid of all my dysphoria and I'd be happy. But the decision to take the pill would be extremely hard, and even the thought of willfully deleting a part of what makes me, me, is really saddening.
yep dislike being trans cause it has alot of uncomfy situations in it, i cant deny the fact that if i would be straight or simply gay it would be alot easier, you can dislike for how you feel but you can do the best out of it and in terms of doing best out of it can lead to a pleasant time. you can dislike certain aspects of you but still get good things out of it. it aint all just good or bad so yeah 😊.
No, it really wouldn't. I'd never change who I am for anything in the world. If I weren't a trans woman I would be so fundamentally different that I wouldn't be myself any longer. As much as being trans can be a pain it also brings a lot of pleasure too! It's bittersweet in my opinion. I would probably not have all the wonderful friends I do today if I weren't a trans woman so ya no thanks, fuck that! I am me and being me is beautiful :3
I feel that it's a lobotomy type of option. Basically taking away what makes you, you.
That’s the way I see it too, but we’re outliers.
I made the post on /r/MtF. FYI I didn’t make this post. This isn’t my throwaway.
Yeah but the pill would be an easy way
I wouldn't want to be a girl if I took the pill. I'd rather be happy than put in and deal with what it takes to transition because in the end on both sides it's just to be happy
I made the post on /r/MtF. This post here isn’t me.
I see, but you can still avoid making it gender specific when this is something that relates to people of all genders.
Bruh…it would erase my core being just like a lobotomy would. That is a fate worse than death from my point of view.
Is it impossible for you to understand that some people love the way they are and the life they have? It's fine if you would change yourself like that but not everyone would do so and to some of us it really would be like dying
Its not just id be a man with no dysphoria. For it to work it’d have to change me into a completely different person for me to not have dysphoria. Also im intersex so there’s another problematic component as well. Getting rid of my dysphoria will not solve anything. It wont just turn me into a cis man. If anything that pill would just make me a trans woman with no dysphoria. Thats all.
Yea, a magic transition pill would basically just be a faster and easier version of what we've got now.

But it's always a magic pill that ""cures"" dysphoria without transition, because this question is almost always coming from cis people who think that dysphoria is a mental illness that exists on its own and can be eliminated while leaving the person themselves healthy and happy as their AGAB.

And it's almost always presented as being a better option because they imagine that this is *less* invasive than transition. That this is the equivalent of taking anti-depressants or something.
I don't think it would still be you if it changed a core part of your identity. Like yeah, being trans is awful, but I'm not a man, and if a pill changed that then I'm not sure I would still be the same person, which I think is the main reason that so many people would be opposed to it.
cis for my gender? sure that's probably fine so long as it doesn't alter my mind. But the description is for a pill that erases your trans identity and every experience/thing tied to it to force you to be the gender you were assigned. Me as a person is a compilation of everything I have experienced and done, my personality, my gender, my sexuality, etc. Erasing any of that, you might as well be erasing me and replacing me with a generic robot. I'd rather be dead than have someone walking around parading as fake me.
you can be whatever you want, sweetheart

i am gonna be that Morlock that turned into a dinner table
[removed]
Maybe I'm wrong but I see it as we can't change people's gender through surgery, why GCS is better than SRS as a term.  He was a man just as I'm a woman.
I just meant, I just personally don't like it at all. Ut just sucks, idk.
You would be you just not trans anymore so just kinda a different version of you
Lol thanks 🙂. I took the party metaphor to far and now I actually do want cake 😅
I think the trans men would have picked assuming they would be turned into cis girls. The people who said yes probably just wish they weren't trans. I've had the thoughts myself. If I took such a pill, I wouldn't be who the me I am now would want me to be, but the pain would be gone. I could live a life without the issues of being trans. It's definitely not out of the question.
I did specify for trans girls, and they could have just hit the results option?
I mean, yeah. I’m faced with the prospect of transitioning in my 30s and… this might just be the pain of the white male privilege leaving the body but going from being default-moderately-attractive to trans-woman while only really getting the benefits of being out in really confined spaces… I remember why I backed away from transition the last two times.

Ironically things would be better if I’d gone with it in my twenties. I wasn’t ready though.
lmaoo I really hope you’re right. I said yes pre hrt, I want nothing more than for my feelings about this to change as I transition.
I have a wife too and I don't understand what you're saying because that didn't really factor into my response.
I’d gladly take the pill every day and twice on Sundays
Same here! Life would be so much easier if I could just feel ok in my body. I never would have struggled withthe frustration of people treating me as my assigned gender instead of me. But at the same time, I just wouldn't be who I am if I weren't trans. My brain tells me what my gender really is, would I actually be me if my brain wasn't the same as who I am today? Idk trans experiences are a struggle of changing your body to match who you are inside. This pill scenario kinda just deletes a big part of who I am inside to match your body. Idk if that makes sense but damn this helped me sort out some of my stressed thoughts
I didn’t assume that, I assumed that somebody took the basis of your post and wanted to express it to a larger userbase. But they didn’t bother modifying the question at all to account for other types of trans people.
But you wouldn’t get all the benefits you want through getting to be a woman 🤔
If we're talking about lobotomy then yes... but we're not
Yep. YEP. Honestly this is the perfect response.
Nah I'd rather be happy than suffer for the rest of my life. I have no attachment to the general idea of ""me""
By contrary I'd say who you are as a person is to do with your likes and personality. You could be a cis guy who likes feminine things if your a trans girl for example. Completely comfortable with the look it brings.
Dinner tables are cool af though
It does suck for us due to dysphoria yeah but without it we wouldn't have an issue with it
Transman. I chose “results” because the question clearly stated it wasn’t for us.

Honestly I’m surprised at all the “no” responses. I’d take a pill that made me a cis woman in a heartbeat. Being trans is virtually my *only* struggle. I could still be an ally to my friends and family. I could still support trans folk. But at least my parents would fucking love me
I'm transitioning in my thirties (ftm though) and two close mtf friends are also transitioning in their thirties. It's definitely not *easy* but it's way better than pretending to be your assigned-at-birth gender. It feels a little bit like I lived my whole life in two dimensions and finally found my way into three-dimensional space.
Straight wife.
I’m glad it didn’t for you, but many people lose their long time partners.
But they wouldn't be benefits anymore...
i get what you’re saying but i don’t necessarily want benefits, i just want to be happy
Relax, it's an analogy not a direct comparison. The point is that you would be fundamentally changed to a drastic degree and that is undeniably true. Not everyone is going to say that they want to do that because a lot of us do love ourselves and our lives as they are
I'm not sure I understand. Trans girls are distinctly different from cis guys who are feminine because they're girls and cis guys are not. Gender has nothing to do with whether you are feminine or masculine - they are distinct parts of the self.
┬──┬ ¯\_(ツ)

Early on after I figured out I was trans, I'd probably have picked the ""yes"" option because I desperately just wanted to do what the people I loved wanted me to.  Everything I did was for others, I was a made up person.  I didn't express who I was to anyone except close friends.

But I eventually got to a place where I realized it was important to work on my own happiness too.  That transition was only about me and does not hurt anyone else.  Anyone hurt by it is hurt because I'm willing to be myself rather than pretend to be someone I'm not.  They don't love *me*, they love their idea of me.

And honestly, my life is exactly what I always dreamed it would be.  I love getting to wake up every day in my body & have the relationships I do.

Like you, my parents aren't exactly accepting, but I think they'll come around at some point.
Don’t you want to be a man though? like if I had something that was my main desire for my whole life growing up, and I could take a pill that would remove that desire, I don’t think I would because I’d never get to experience the benefits of fulfilling that desire.
I mean... That’s basically how I feel. Identifying as female means I suddenly have a whole person inside me. I’ve learned to survive by identifying as an engineer rather than a person, and it’s tempting to go back to that.

Only right now everything is battling social norms. I just emailed a beauty parlor to say “I currently present as male and also have eyebrows that look like two warring caterpillars, any chance you can help?”. The combined stress of battling internalised transphobia and anxiety over externalised transphobia is breaking, and I’m not in a position to get much validation.

Not to mention my house mate who used to be supporting, but then I made the mistake of trying to communicate healthily about my emotions while setting a boundary, picked a bad time and now they’ve decided that along with all other women I also am a hell spawn and they’re refusing to talk to me. It’s the sort of thing that if you were emotionally healthy I’d hope you’d sleep on it and then pick it up later and sort out what went on. But I’m not confident they’re capable of that. I’m stuck in this place for another six months.

I was pleasantly numb before. Now I feel occasionally spots of reality… but everything else is tearing at my soul. Maybe things will get better. I don’t seem to have a choice to go back.

… sorry, emotional dumping
Exactly
Yep, this. I know a hypothetical pill isn’t a literal icepick in the brain, but to me, the effect would be the same— the death of me as I am, and I emphatically don’t want that.
I know that. But it would be easier.
It’s nice that you’re happy in your situation but the truth is that being cis is *easier*, objectively. Even if it’s not better for everyone.
I was saying I’d take being cis *anything*, even if that means being a woman. It would just be easier.

Though, honestly? If I was born a cis man, there’s a fair chance I’d be a misogynistic POS because if I hadn’t lived as a woman I don’t think I’d have questioned the garbage I was fed as a kid. So that’s *one* pro to being trans—I have experience to back up my empathy.
Ugh that sounds very horrible. Early transition is rough rough rough. It *does* get a lot easier as time goes by. If there are any groups for trans people in your area, that could be a good source of support. Thinking of you!!!
Yah, I could never and would never change myself to take away any of the pain I've received. Life will always bring suffering no matter what path you walk so it would only change the way in which I receive it which to me is pointless. The joy that my transition has brought me is more than worth the suffering endured, life may bring suffering but it also brings plenty of other great experiences as well! All of them are valuable in their own way
I agree that it's certainly easier.  But I think the other piece is that for many of us, choosing the ""yes"" option feels like choosing death, but in a way that nobody would morn us or even recognize that we're gone.
That is true. Maybe it’s silly of me, but I expect trans men to be less dipshit-y on average thanks to that.
Exactly. I am who I am because of my journey, and I’ve made my peace with the trans part of me after decades and am now thriving and happy. I’d change some aspects of my journey if I could, but I would not avoid it by altering who I am as a person in my core to be happy in my AGAB. I like who I have become!"	qwktb7	trans	502	0.93	2021-11-18 07:53:43
Any advice for a trans girl considering military service?	"I am 18 and currently in college, I have not transitioned past asking to be called by they/them (and a preferred name w/ some friends). I have been diagnosed by my therapist w/ gender dysphoria, and am currently trying to get ahold of HRT.

I've heard some things about military enlistment continuing HRT treatments and it would help very much to have free college. That said I am going to finish my associates at my community college (I just got enrolled so it's gonna take another about 2 years) and then go to a University. Does anyone know what boot camp is like for trans ppl, and wether or not it's a good option?
(I live in Nevada)"	"I'm a veteran who just got out last year, don't fucking enlist. 

Don't believe anything the recruiter tells you, they're just trying to make a quota and will tell you anything to get to sign. 

I was in the air force, which is much less ""rah-rah military woooo"" than the other branches and it was still absolutely awful.
Well, from what I understand the military turns away anyone regularly taking any type medication. In general the US Military is very unfriendly to any LGBT people. Not just the military itself and it's rules but also other people serving.
I'm still unpacking the trauma from my military service, and I never even saw combat. Strongly recommend against enlisting.
Don't do it. The military sucks. Your better off getting into debt with student loans
My dad's a Vietnam vet and I liked his advice that the military is awful. He used to tell my brothers growing up that if the draft ever came, he'd take us to Canada.
100% don’t do it.
Don't.
Don’t join the extremely anti-LGBT military, of a country that has an extremely fast growing anti-trans sentiment, and could literally be losing its democracy within the next two years.
Life on hard mode x 3
Please never join the military, worst case scenario you end up like Lavena johnson by the hands of some hateful jarhead
Are you out of your mind? There are a million reasons not to become cannon fodder/cheap labor for the us government,not counting the rampant bigotry that proliferates the us military. Don’t believe whats the ads/recruiters say. You will regret joining by the end of your term.
You should look into other options first. As a veteran I can tell you the culture in the military is not a safe one for us. There's a company called Mos that offers free financial aid assistance. You get a personal advisor that helps you navigate the best ways to stay out of debt when paying for college.
As a defence force kid, do not go to the military. It is very brainwashing and extremely dangerous. It is not worth anything at all. So easy to come out with permanent, disabling injuries even during training. I don’t care if you just want to go the minimum amount of time to achieve your goals, do not. Please don’t take the brainwashing lightly either. It is so bad that I would honestly disown my siblings if they went to the military. As a trans person, it won’t be safe for you to enlist.
As someone who is getting out of the military. Don’t do it
Don't.
As someone who comes from a military family and briefly considered doing this for the same reasons, except transmasc, I cannot advise you enough to NOT do this. Sure, military pays for college, but there’s stipulations around it that a recruiter isn’t going to be upfront about. If you don’t have a gender marker change before enlisting, I think there’s a high probability you’ll be grouped with men in bootcamp, regardless of whether or not you’re on hormones or socially transitioning. I’d also assume any transphobia you face is going to go largely ignored if you report it because other forms of discrimination do. This really does not seem like a good idea to me.

Edit: Also, the military makes you jump through hoops for medical stuff. After boot camp, you’ll probably be reassigned to a military psychologist who typically don’t care about mental illness and may make a medical transitioning process harder. I’ve also heard that transition surgeries lately have not been covered by military health insurance because they’re counted as cosmetic.
So hear me out dont
Coming from a military family... don't. DO NOT. the military SUCKS
Even i you were cis, you shouldn't join the military, and because you're trans you absolutely should not under any circumstances join the military. 

There's a great podcast called ""what a hell of a way to die"" that's by two leftist veterans who talk about what's wrong with the military and why you shouldn't join it. They're very trans-friendly, and have several episodes about queer people in the military.
Don't
Yeah don’t do it.
maybe consider community college? it’s at least a cheaper option without having to join the military if that turns out to not be a viable option. wishing you the best <3

edit: didn’t read closely enough 😅
Step 1: don't do it
I'm a veteran and I was enlisted during ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"". The military likes to say its LGBTQ friendly these days, but you'd be a fool to believe it. Some of my friends eventually admitted to being gay so they would get kicked out or they ended up as another suicide. The military messed me up for a long time. Eventually I was able to deprogram most of their brainwashing with a good therapist. I type this with all the love and concern I can summon. Don't go in the military. It's not safe physically or mentally.

Because this can happen again.
You don’t get free college. They give you money towards college for reserves, money for completing college if you go in as enlisted, and if you start as an officer then you just get much better pay. 

Don’t trust recruiters, and your transition will be quite halted for a while. The military is extremely disorganized and would make it much harder to transition medically. 

You are far better off getting your degree and using school resources to find the best paying job you are qualified for and can get.
The US military is a moralless anti-lgbtq, anti-immigrant machine. I wouldn't. They are the part of the establishment that most despises us. I really wouldn't join.
stop considering military service
From what I have heard from friends that have had military experience, the culture is really not LGBT friendly. Sure there are exceptions but I got the impression a lot of people they interacted with were caricatures of toxic masculinity and quite bigoted. 

No matter what the official policies are, it's hard to get around the interpersonal culture if that's not conducive to being trans. Personally, I would not ever consider military service even before I started transitioning and that goes doubly so now that I'm trans.
Yeah, DON'T DO IT!  Sorry but unless you are willing to take part in a social experiment that the military does not want to be involved in, don't do it!  I am a retired Air Force Master Sgt and while it is a good opportunity for some, trans girls are not likely to find a safe and fulfilling career.

advice: don’t. i saw you’re talking to a recruiter. they’re paid to enlist people. talk to vets and family of vets. if my parent never joined i wouldn’t have this trauma.
Fucking don’t, there is no reason to voluntarily enter what is fundamentally a meat grinder rigged to exploit those who serve
Dont
Dont
Don't fucking do it. The military is fucked. Go work for Kroger. They have transition insurance
Don't enlist.
Don't fucking do it is my advice. Even if you don't get picked on for being trans. Sexual violence is rampant in the military
Do not enlist. Just don’t. Listen to the people on here. There is nothing for you in the military.
I mean if you want free college and your medical transition taken care of you could just move to a country eith universal healthcare. The best part is: you won't be in the military. 

Before you consider the military for these reasons you should consider moving to a European country with what you want (free university/college and well, universal healthcare)
not an organization you want to be in, forces you to do things that are super unethical, IE imperialism. people around the world do not like the military. they will also treat you like shit if you’re lgbt
Don't do it.
Please don’t! I know that it seems enticing, but military service is not worth the damage it can cause to you and others (thinking of what the military is and does). Also, your ability to ‘transition’ is dependent on the role you are assigned and your superiors. Ultimately, your ‘transition’ only works if it works for your unit. Try other options first (you’re already getting your associates). 

Also, I want to say that I understand that it’s easier said than done and the military can provide you the pathways you need in order to access comprehensive medical care- but there are many contingencies to consider.
Many companies offer tuition reimbursement nowadays for entry level job positions.  Much better path than military in my opinion. When you get the degree you’ll be first in line for a promotion as companies investing in their employees want to promote from within and get the benefit of the education they invested in. 

You can get 5-6 years of full time income + part time school without having to go to war.
My advice?

Don't.
getting college tuition paid for isn't worth the lifelong trauma that results from participation in a war machine that wants to train you to shoot brown people for oil companies.
Don't do it. Joining the military is a despicable act that only contributes to the pain of marginalised people all over the world
Cis girl here :) I know nothing but this : 
Please don’t join the army
Don’t. Don’t enlist. The military is a sham, and every veteran I meet who isn’t a conservative hated their service (might enjoy their compatriots and some of the people they meet, but HATED their time in the military)
trans girl who was in the army national guard (united states). don’t. seriously.

i tell cis people that if they think they want to and will benefit from the college tuition assist and job skills then yes. i tell every trans person to stay the hell away from the military.

i enlisted before i had bottom surgery, and after Biden repealed the trump era bans. i still had to process as male, train with males, shower and bunk with males and have male battle buddies. i had exactly zero protections. i passed VERY well at the time and looked like a woman who was, for some inexplicable reason, doing everything with male soldiers. i would get yelled at for ‘fraternizing’ because drill sergeants correctly assumed i was a woman, but didn’t know i was trans and the DoD was making me do this. i couldn’t acknowledge that i was trans, so i simply never confirmed or denied my gender identity. that worked for awhile, and i got LOTS of stares from everyone in my platoon.

then while doing night hygiene, a male soldier did something they shouldn’t have done to me. i did not come forward because of how i correctly assumed the military justice system would fuck everything up. that is a trauma i live with, that affects my everyday ability to function. i cannot be around men alone anymore in private spaces, i cannot do a lot of things without having panic attacks and tremors.

your recruiters will lie to you, they will act like your friend and applaud you for being a part of the 1%, and make you feel like you’re making the best choice in the world, they will tell you to come to them with any problems and they will help you. they are lying. do some recruiters take pride in their work and care about the people they sign on? sure. but as a trans person, the moment you tell them about a trans problem you will be left in the dark, maybe sent up the chain of command or to a chaplain. in my case what happened when i finally did come forward when it was too late was i got a bunch of phone calls from my squad leader, to my captain, and a master sergeant who all said how what happened was “not the policy of the United States Army, or the National Guard” and didn’t even think about how military policy was exactly how i got assaulted in the first place.

you cannot continue HRT through initial entry training, which for my MOS was 26 weeks, now, my recruiter was shift as fuck and might have suggested or might not have suggested using the military policy of Drill Sergeants not being allowed to touch religious texts, and may or may not have suggested hiding my hormones in them, and may or may not have suggested switching to patches to make it easier. so maybe you find a way, if you get caught, congrats, you’re now a felon, are dishonorably discharged and are gonna have a really hard time with college, a job and life in general, even IF you’re able to get 26 weeks of hormones. having done the math, that is both MAD EXPENSIVE and takes up a ton of space. not to mention the mental toll of literally smuggling drugs onto a military base 

go to college, work a decent paying job that gives you the insurance to get all of those surgeries, maybe the company you work for will even foot the bill, and many do these days (and yes, your recruiters will lie and say the military will cover bottom surgery with TriCare, it won’t, TriCare is shitty insurance that doesn’t cover any trans healthcare, even hormones). do not join the military, seriously. ESPECIALLY if you haven’t changed your name, everything will just get stuck in mud for months if you enlist because you’ll have to keep up the act of being your assigned sex at birth, it isn’t worth it
it is a terrible idea, at best you will not be respected and at worst you will be another statistic. a community college degree will leave you in the 4-5 figure debt, not 6-7. unless you have no other option, the military should be the last option
I did JROTC for two years and was planning on enlisting in the navy when I graduated, mostly for free college. Then I found a college I loved, they didn’t have an ROTC program but they offered me a LOT of financial aid and I chose them over enlistment. A few months into college, came out as non-binary/pan because I had a great support group that opened my eyes from the repression I’d had in high school. Years later and my former JROTC friends who did enlist are finishing up their terms, all miserable, all have regretted it, all unhappy in shitty jobs, all have horrible traumas and injuries JUST from training. And every single one of them is now a homophobic, transphobic, conservative racist who voted for trump. I cannot express to you the amount of brainwashing and SA that happens in the military. It is definitely NOT a safe space for trans people. I would be terrified 24/7 of being physically attacked for my identities. I feel SO grateful that I never enlisted and instead that I went somewhere safe where I could discover my identities. There are so many options for affordable college, and probably lots of college aid out there specifically for trans youth. Please please please don’t put your life in danger
Ignoring the potential dangers of deployment due to *current events*, you also have the dangers of being a trans woman constantly surrounded by a group of people that has in the past murdered others for less. This is going to sound crazy, and I am being slightly hyperbolic, but I would bet good money that the odds of you being killed by in a “training accident” or “suicide” is higher than the odds of you dying on the front lines.
As a veteran… maybe don’t? I didn’t know anything when I enlisted and maybe things are different now, but my time in the military was miserable. Even though I wasn’t aware I was trans and I didn’t know I was bi at the time, I merely wasn’t manly enough for the boys club and as a “man” was excluded from the girls… so I was mostly ostracized for my time in the military and it was awful.

There were two types of people in the military, those who joined for the benefits and those who joined for the toys. The former might respect you, but the latter is only going to do the bare minimum to not get in trouble… or just straight up bully you and intimidate you into not doing anything about it.
already seen a few people say this but i'll say it anyway: don't. don't do it. do not enlist. 0/10 terrible idea
i’m a trans woman in the military, don’t do it. there’s so many hoops to jump through, and the job itself is mentally draining. i got my diagnosis in jan 2021, got hrt in dec 2021, and i still have not gotten the paperwork back to present in my preferred gender yet. overall, i think it’s not worth it, and if i knew i was trans before i joined the military i probably wouldn’t have ended up joining
As a veteran that’s trans i would say the fact that your here to get advice about weather you should. Im here to tell you don’t. The 80k, towards college 😂 hon that doesn’t even get you a bachelor’s degree, out wars are literally there to protect common interests big oil and oppress black and brown people abroad there is a third world war happening right now. I implore you to choose a different path.
You'd be better off asking in spaces specifically meant for trans military members or veterans. General trans spaces are usually filled with misinformation about being in the military while trans. 

SPARTA is an advocacy organization for trans military members and has all of the current guidance listed on their website: [https://spartapride.org/](https://spartapride.org/) . They also run Facebook groups and answer questions. 

In general, your experience will differ depending on branch. The best branch for trans people is the Air Force, followed by the Navy, then the Army, then the Marines. I personally would not recommend joining the Army or Marines as a trans person. There's just too many bigots and you'll have a bad experience. 

Recruiters have a very wide knowledge base but not a very deep one, which is to say, it's very unlikely they'll have actual information about what your experience will be like. And unfortunately recruiters are known for blatantly lying to people, so even if they sound knowledgeable, I'd double check what they have to say. The other thing to know is that....sometimes the military just doesn't follow regulation and there's nothing you can do about it, particularly during boot camp times. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if you or any other trans woman were housed in the male quarters and treated as a male during boot camp. And once you're there, there's nobody to complain to. That doesn't mean it'll be like that during all of your service, but during boot camp you're treated as a recruit and your ability to lodge a complaint like a normal human being is basically taken away. 

Free college in the military isn't totally free, just FYI. (The following information is for using the GI Bill, if you're going reserves, doing ROTC, or joining as an officer it'll be a different deal) Your tuition is paid in full for a public college in any state you're considered a resident of. Sometimes, out-of-state or private colleges will match GI Bill contributions through the Yellow Ribbon program so you don't end up with loans. And many states offer residency to veterans as an incentive to go to school there, but you will want to research that to make sure the state you're looking at does. Your board is covered during school months, prorated if you're only in school for part of the month (so for example, you get a partial payment in December because of holidays). That can make keeping an apartment very difficult as you basically have to be committed to working a lot while going to school. Working at the university over summer in exchange for free board, or being able to stay with someone on breaks, or taking summer classes can help you bridge that gap but it's definitely not a fun logistical puzzle. Bottom line, again just do your research so you're not blindsided when the payout isn't quite as comprehensive as expected.
Have always hated how the military uses free school as a tactic :( school should be free no matter what but that’s just my opinion
There is a sub for trans military r/transalute.  I’d recommend going there.   I’m sure people’s opinions differ, but their direct experience is probably more up your street.
I think of military service similar to prostitution: if it is your free choice and you want to do it, that's perfectly fine and I support you, but I hate that people have been forced into it or do it because they have no other choice, and I find that part of it very wrong. So much potential abuse for so little gain. It's basically another way of selling your body and many are doing it not out of their own volition but out of necessity.
I thought of the military as a last ditch effort to reclaim my “man-liness” 

Thank goodness i didn’t do that.
Military’s often value traditional things in most countries, they being domineering, strong men who are physically capable. It’s a very macho environment that will put you down about lgbt stuff if you’re open about it *generally/stereotypically*. Up to u though, keep in mind recruiters are known for being untruthful about realistic expectations for the military.
Don't. Don't be a servant of Amerikkan imperialism
Amazon will pay for your college to and there a lot more accepting then the military. U get to stay around your friends and everything to
[deleted]
I am a retired Army officer.  I will not try to persuade or discourage service.    I will offer a few thoughts.

1. Don't listen to any advice from anyone who hasn't served themselves.
2. Ignore advice from anyone who served more than 3 years ago.  The military changes quickly, their advice will be out dated.  
3. People experiences depend on the units they served in and their MOS.  Infantry folks in the 82nd have as different experience from support guys in Germany as Marines in San Diego have from Air Force in Utah.  
4. The US military is truly an all volunteer force--the decision to serve is totally your own.  Recruiters have a job to do, they put people in the military, and they are under huge pressure to make their mission.  Listen to them knowing this about them.  
5. There are many different aspects to the military.  Active, Reserve, National Guard--each has advantages and disadvantages.  Often the Guard has the best options for people who want to attend a state college.  Look into those options carefully.
6. Finally, military service can be very rewarding or it can be awful.  It depends on your attitude and what you were hoping to get out of the service.  Go in with open eyes and keep them on what you want to achieve while you are there.

Good luck!
So, I'm not out out(only a few at work know)yet because I'm currently in the fun limbo of having a diagnosis, but waiting to get seen in order to be approved for HRT.

I think it's important to do as much research and talk to as many people who are or were in the branch(and career field)you want to join as you can before you make your decision.

As far as being trans in the military, it will probably come down to your branch culture, but mainly your squadron and unit. However, there are regs in place as far as discrimination that will protect you from transphobic types.

Just try to make the best choice you can for you.
I'm about to do it myself but I have no other choice If I want this then I am going to be fighting tooth and nail for it I leave for basic in 8 days. I am national guard so not active but...

Being poor and In Alabama with limited income options isn't going to set me up for the long road...

This little egg has put it all into the basket.

All or nothing
Ok so based on over all happiness it’s probably not worth it but depends on your situation. I’m currently in the Army as enlisted but also seeking possible Hormones/ beginning “egg cracking”. The problem are if your are Non-binary like me most military’s do not believe you exist. You will have to to change the genders they give which may work for you. They will help with hormones and surgery’s but it’s slow and your command can say no as well. Or if it’s deployment related it’s a hard no. The safest are I found for a solder to work in was medical since you work with Civ and Soldier’s who tend to be open minded but it’s a gambled (I lost that gamble sadly) there is a lot more information that goes more in-depth but it’s more or less based you choices and what you want. My recommendation if you really need to or want to join do Air Force. As a Officer with a degree never go enlisted. If you have any questions feel free to ask!

- best advice there are so many better ways then the military it’s a lot of extra cost for only a chance to begin transition.
I don't remember the percentage but it was fairly large. Somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of military veterans are seeking transition at the VA and everything is covered I was shocked when I heard from a retired navy officer that was the statistic given to her. Almost everything for transition is covered by the VA. Currently they are required to accommodate you and of course they keep trying to change that back to what it was before. Who knows the world keeps changing maybe trans military service will become the norm someday soon.
I was in the military but not while I was out unfortunately. It’s a mixed bag, I met very amazing human beings and I am passionate about our country because I believe individual liberty is a key component to our existence. While I was in there was a ban on trans people but as far as I know you can be trans and serve now thanks to Biden. I would do some research though. It is rough. But I would recommend it. It’s a privilege to serve and I think it’s important for future generations of trans people to see that they’re capable of serving and worthy of doing so. I value every second I spent in uniform, it shaped who I am, and if you think you can handle it you should join. You would be a role model for others and an advocate of this community. While uniformity is necessary in military culture I found that diversity is equally important and deeply appreciated members of the LGBTQ+ community who served openly. Their individualIty to me embodies the essence of the true values of liberty and freedom. If you want to DM don’t hesitate, I’ve been out for just over a year so it hasn’t been too long for me since I left.
My partner is a healthcare professional in the VA. Please take what I'm about to say with several grains of salt because gender affirming care is not her field and neither she nor I are now or have ever been in the military. 

From what she has told me, gender affirming care through the VA is shockingly thorough, up to and including HRT, therapy, and (I think) even gender affirming surgery. Obviously do your own research but it might be worth trying to figure out if getting your gender affirming care through the VA is a viable option, and whether you can do it while you're active duty or if you need to wait until you're out.
If you are joining guard or reserve, it is likely a slice of people in your community,  so where you live has a lot to do with it.  Having served more than 30 years,  I can tell you it is not what others here are saying. It used to be but not anymore. We have trans and women in the infantry,  if anyone treats them any different or hazes/discriminates, there are usually pretty career ending consequences. I say serve with honor.
If you were to join, I would recommend the Air Force or Space Force, as opposed to the Marines or Army.  I’m not super familiar with the Navy, but they seemed chill.

AF/SF aren’t terrible if you land an office type job, and it can give you good work experience if you can pick up a job that aligns with your career goals.  I was active duty, and the guard guys I deployed with didn’t know how to do their jobs, but it does pay for your degree, so if that’s your objective, it’ll get done.  

Overall… it’s not bad, if you are careful about branch and job.  I would seriously avoid stuff that is stereotypically masculine, because there tends to be more toxic masculine behavior to be found there.  Jobs like finance, personnel, etc have pretty chill people as far as lgbt stuff goes, from my experience.
I’m a brat, and they outright refused to give me estrogen, and I don’t even want to think about what doing labs with them would be like. Don’t do it.
Don't sell your body to a murderous regime that doesn't care about you, that's my advice. Chase your dreams without selling your soul to get there quicker. There are three types of people who join the US military: nationalist right wingers, desperately poor people who will be just as poor when they're discharged again, and people who don't understand what they're enlisting for.
Don't do it. Don't become a professional mass murderer
bro its literally mandatory in my country, you're lucky enough to have a choice how can you go ahead and enlist? lmao dont do it.
I wouldn't suggest military as an option, my sisters a navy chief and she says its not worth it anymore. I'm considering to go into a redneck career field (linemen) but I'm well aware I will get harassed, I'm a transman. But if you do decide to go in a few things to have a strong mindset, and know what you are gonna do.
Coming from someone who was in a similar situation, I feel like I can provide a more in-depth perspective.

I was in Navy/Marine Corps ROTC during my first three years at college, and was able to get the scholarship for them to pay for some of my school. I came out as a trans guy about a year ago to my unit. Long story short, after going through 9 months of medical transition, I realized that both my peers in the program and the unit staff were not very accepting or supportive of my transition. They were even still misgendering me almost a year after I came out. I realized that I would hate to be trapped in a career for four years with a bunch of people that would constantly act weird around me, so I recently quit and will probably have to pay back a large sum of money to the government.

I’ve heard a lot of more positive news from the Air Force, like how they have the most trans pilots and such, so if you’re set on the military I’d probably check them out first! If I were to ever pursue a military career again, that would be the branch I’d check out.

As for another potential trans ban in the military, I was able to talk to a sergeant in the Marine Corps about his experience transitioning before the trans ban was repealed by Biden. After he went through boot camp, he started on T without letting medical people know, and basically they were trying to find evidence that he was trans so they could kick him out. They were actually about to when Biden repealed the ban, so he got saved in the end! I imagine that if you’re out while serving, or even if medical knows you’re medically transitioning and there’s another ban, you would definitely be at risk.

Of course, this is just my experience/thoughts, hope it helps!
The amount of harassment, abuse, and rape story's I've heard from women, members of the LGBT community, and racial minorities was enough to turn me away. 

I have a cis friend who is bi but straight passing and he said he didn't feel safe telling anyone in his air force basic training dorm that he was bi.
OP, the military is full of very conservative people, and it is not all just the perks the recruiter tells you. A recruiter asked me if I wanted to join and I mentioned that I had an unaliving attempt which would automatically make me unable to enlist and he told me to lie about it or just omit the truth. The same can be said for people with autism and other illnesses or disorders. The free school is nice, but it comes with strings attached- you would become government property. If you live in the US, you can apply with the federal student aid association to absolve you of any federal student loans you take out, and depending on your income, this could be 10k in loans or possibly more. And after your service is up, if you suffer from any trauma resulting from it, you have to fight with the VA to get help. Please consider this, OP.
I know joining would sound nice to get everything paid off, or you want to help the people but trust legit everyone in the comments. Don’t. Especially if your lgbt. Most guys who join are homophobes. I’ve heard so many horror stories of that stuff happening. A recruiter is there to recruit you, there going to tell you it’s all fine! And it’s all amazing with a accepting environment! But it’s not. Deal with the college debts, the military will literally ruin you.
I joined the Marines in 2012. Personally, I loved it, and am now using up to 9 years of college tuition paid for after my service. The big factor is, I joined before I knew I was trans. Didn't even find out trans men existed until after I got out, and looking back, there was plenty of dysphoria that I ignored, buried, or mislabeled while I was in.   
As a trans girl, you would likely hate it much, much more than a trans guy who served. It's hyper-masculine, to the point where even most women serving are expected to display masculine traits. The majority of people you will be working with will be masculine guys. And, I could be wrong, but I think you would go to male bootcamp. That means showing and peeing and shitting and changing with no privacy with a bunch of guys for months. I did the same with girls when I went to bootcamp. At least 3 have since come out as trans guys like I did, but there are less trans women in the military. 

I knew dozens upon dozens of masculine, or lesbian, or bi, or ace, or any combination of those traits of women while serving. I only knew of one openly gay man. I know of a few people I served with who came out as trans men. I don't personally know any trans women. So, it will likely be crazy hard. Whether or not you can continue transitioning, you will still be expected to perform masculinity regardless of gender. You will be physically pushed often, will need to step up as a confident leader even when you don't feel capable. It can be awesome, or awful, and is usually a combination of the two. If it is worth it is only something you can decide. Don't ask recruiters for this advice. Ask vets and active service who aren't recruiters for their experiences so you can do your own research and come to your own conclusions. 

If free education is the only factor making you consider this, then don't. Even McDonald's will pay for their employees to get college education. There are plenty of ways around the paywall that don't involve military service. But if you do want to serve, you have to be ready for the cons as well as the pros. Best of luck.
I'm going with everyone else here. Don't. I served early 2000's I'm the don't ask don't tell era. Just homophobia everywhere in the air force and my unit was essentially run by evangelical christians. It did pay for college but I paid for it with significant hearing loss, bad knees and PTSD. Was not worth it
Work at Trans welcoming companies like Starbucks 🙂 if I could go back, I would’ve enlisted in the Navy’s Top Gun or Seal programs. In the Air Force, some people attempted suicide during basic training, and they were cis straight. In the entire squadron, there was one flamboyant airman, and he was seen as a weirdo for being LGBT. I’m not sure if the “don’t ask don’t tell” policy is still in place, but this was back in 2007. I would do it, but expect it to be the hardest thing you’ll ever do. $60,000 for college, which you can get a job and invest that money instead. The VA home loan, which I’m about to use to buy a house. Tons of veteran benefits, traveling the world, being stationed just about anywhere you want. But there’s pros and cons 🫡
Hello!  US Military veteran of 5 years here!  Don't join if you're trans.  Do not.  Just don't.  The recruiter will lie to you in every way possible to get you to join because that's literally their job.  I worked with every branch and had a couple LGBTQ people in my platoon and they were universally picked on, hated, or treated like aliens.  It sucks, but the military is still a culture of rape, violence, and misogyny.  Homophobia and especially transphobia was a rampant problem when I was in.  Please do not do this.
I was gonna do military service but honestly between the culture and politics that are there in pretty much any military it’s maybe just not a good time

Sucks to hear but that’s the shitty part of it
Recruiters are dirty liars. Don’t trust them one bit. Disabled vet here. Not worth it and you’re contributing to the military industrial complex that exists solely to create profit from blood.
Don’t.
If your goal is to be dehumanized, destroyed, abandoned, and then forgotten about after your government does those things to you then, sure. You will also have to become one of the most evil people on the planet to prevent dishonorable discharge.   


If you want a good, happy life, absolutely not.
no offense, but you'd have to force me at gunpoint to enlist. no fucking way am I signing up for the imperialist army. fuck that shit. oh I get free college, but I have to live with the fact that I directly contributed to brutalizing and murdering brown people in west asia. fuck. that.
The military is incredibly predatory. Racist, sexist, all of that. Remember when that servicewoman was SA’d and then unalived by other soldiers here in this country and it was never investigated? Please don’t risk it.
You can get better pay, better benefits, and better working conditions at most military contractors. More employers are subsidizing their employees' education now than at any point in the past twenty years or so at least.
Whenever I think of enlistment, I think of a TikTok I saw of a guy going around his fellow marines asking what they’d say to their recruiter if they met them now. 

Nearly all of them said “fuck you.”
I dunno why youd be willing to kill innocent people for HRT. Just get it normaly like everyone else.
Just don’t
literally don’t. don’t support the largest terrorist organization in the world. don’t support the bombing of civilian targets. murdering people is not the answer to affording transition.
In my country (Iran) military service is mandatory and I'm trying my best to get into another country sooner so I can avoid getting drafted (as I literally get panic attacks and dysphoria since it's mandatory for ""men"" and I don't have enough safety to come out as trans in Iran atm), I never understood why would anyone want to be *volunteer* to participate in one tbh.
DON'T
Yeah, don’t. Consider a different path, if you can. I don’t see the military being safe. I was never in the military, but my father was, and it wasn’t so much fun…
My only advice would be don't

Literally never heard anyone I know who was in say anything good about it and that's mostly cishet men who are gonna have the easiest time, nevermind a trans woman
Dont
In my experience in the military even the lgb are transphobic.
From what I've heard- they don't even accept Trans people in the military, which I find kinda weird not gonna lie

Also looking through the comments- kinda surprised they're so Anti-LGBTQ, kinda ironic since ""freedom fighters"" and whatnot, but would explain why they don't accept Trans people

This is my response though at least- even though this was probably already answered but hey, might as well give a bit of help
Army here. Still stuck. 

Whatever you do - DO NOT ENLIST
Don’t join the military.
What country are you in? I think that's going to make a big difference.
I wouldn’t enlist
Trans friend got out with a less than honorable discharge. Not so much about the treatment as just being a shitty job. My advice would be to avoid it because once you enlist best case scenario they let you do the woman’s Boot Camp and the female drill sergeants will be brutal. Worst case you have to do it with the men and you will be missed gendered constantly.
Don't go military please, its not worth it in the slightest
I’m sorry but fuck the military.
I’ve been out of the Marines for 11 years and there’s absolutely no fucking way I’d have gone in if  had I the strength and courage to live authentically. Also you’re gonna be treated as whatever your sex identifier is on your driver’s license. There’s many many options for getting HRT and education paid for by an employer that doesn’t subject you to the kind of abuse and toxicity that you’ll experience in the military
Don’t the military has a toxic culture. Chelsea Manning was harassed and assaulted to the point she leaked a boat load of files to get back at them and then got tortured for it.
Don't
Here's my advice:

Don't. 

The military is objectively the worst career choice someone can have. There's easier ways of getting HRT and tuition help than putting your life on the line for a government that doesn't want us to exist.
(TW Suicide) If you’ve spoken to a recruiter they have lied to you. They will tell you absolutely ANYTHING to get you to enlist, once you’re in, you BELONG to the government. They are under absolutely no obligation to give you anything. My recruiter lied directly to my face on multiple occasions and I even saw someone in boot camp actually learn that they had lied to them and their girlfriend’s son wouldn’t be getting health insurance like he had been promised. He threatened to sue while the Instructors were actively screaming at him to shut the fuck up and get back into formation. He dropped out that day and I never saw him again. The military is absolutely not friendly towards anyone or anything that does not fit their warfighter aesthetic and if you join, and don’t fit that look or lifestyle I’ve seen people driven to suicide. I’ve WATCHED someone literally Jump to their death from the flight deck to a concrete floating barge while on watch in Hong Kong. The military is not for everyone, it wasn’t for me and I did it for 4 years
BUT NON-BINARY PPL AREN'T CURRENTLY ALLOWED IN US MILITARY :( They only allow men and women or people in the process of proceeding to man or woman. ONLY TWO GENDERS EXIST TO THE US MILITARY despite what trans-pandering politicians might tout. On the brighter side, it's sort of in the works, potentially.

When non-binary ppl are truly accepted throughout all of civilization, only then will we have made the grandest stride in the history of the human societal condition.

I think given your post you have time to explore your options.  It also seems that your impetus for potentially joining is payment of your Bachelors degree and HRT. Depending on your major your Bachelors could be funded through scholarships and working in your field with possibly some loans. Consider the 4-year school you go to as well and whether or not grad school is necessary for your end goal, it isnt always (dont believe the hype). HRT could be funded through school based insurance and then insurance through a job following school. So there are other options than the military.  Seek out a gender counselor and also an employment counselor at your school who can put you in touch with resources to explore all of your options so you can make the best decision for you. Though your time will go faster than you realize right now, you have a good year to lay out some solid plans with back ups.
Stay away 6 years AD AF
Please reconsider, as someone who was the first openly trans person at the meps in my state after the whole 2018 banning of trans people. It was awful and they would only make things way way worse it is in no way a solution.
Don’t join the empire’s defence force lol.
lots of lgbt, tranz, and women in general are abused and even killed in the military.
Don’t do it, you’ll be signing up for hell on earth to play into our sick country’s delusions of patriotic duty.
I was offered an IT position in a systems support battalion out of my state, they were willing to start me almost immediately after I graduated from college and pay really well. I considered it for a while, and I didn't feel safe at all taking any position in the army so I turned them down. I personally wouldn't consider it any further, talk to the financial office at your school and consider other options.
DO NOT FUCKING DO IT - THEY WILL MURDER YOU AND COVER IT UP LIKE THEY DO TO COUNTLESS OTHER LGBTQIA2S+ PEOPLE!!!
Don’t go into the military at all. That’s my advice. They don’t give a shit about your pronouns or gender identity, trust. All of the armed forces are predatory institutions
Don’t do it, it you want free education go to Europe!
It is morally wrong to join the military. We are at a place in this country where we already need people to be willing to defy actual laws that mandate they report trans students so that their families can be torn apart. If you can’t stand up to economic pressure to join the machine bringing oppression and murder to others around the globe, how do you expect anyone to stand with us?
Don’t. That’s my advice. Once you’re in they own tou
35m here. Wish I'd had the INTELLIGENCE not to join in the first place. Don't do it. Any rando civilian job pays better and accomplishes more.
the us military is evil institution. read up on the iraq war, radiation and cancer in fallujah, unconditional surrender and the atomic bombs, agent orange and civilian death toll to combatant ratios in our wars.
If you still want to enlist you also may want to know that h want be able to access any medication for 2-4 weeks you’ll be in boot camp. Thats the cold truth, unfortunately. I have ibs and there’s a possibility I wouldn’t be able to take the medication 💊 i need for it. So yeah…
Don’t?
yeah, best advice is DON'T
Transgender AMAB cypriots crying
Don't.
Navy Vet here kicked when being trans was definitely not okay for being trans (egg cracked when I was already in) imma advise don't do it considering my brother got back and advised the same thing of don't as did my sister who's still in. QOL sucks way worse than when we enlisted as a family and it's not getting better according to her
No college degree is worth joining the Blow Up Brown Kids Machine. Regardless of whether you're cis or trans, nobody should join the military.
I know you're too young to have heard about stop-lossing, and I didn't see anyone else mention it. You will never be done with the military. At some point, they changed how the contracts work, and if you enlist they can summon you with minimal notice to deploy. It happened during the invasion of Iraq. Guys who were in their '40s and were in the first gulf war got told to drop everything and report for duty in three weeks. Failure to do so was considered desertion. 

Imagine 20 years from now being instructed to leave whatever family, career, or life you have to fight in the next war.
AD AF

You're going to get differing views that vary drastically. For me it's been fine, but I very much want out. But my experience has been overall positive, even amongst my peers, leadership, civillians, policy, support etc. But I'm also in an office.

I would echo what others are saying here. Probably best to avoid enlisting.
There seem to be many comments saying that you shouldn't join the military for free college because it's a tool of oppression, or because the military is evil. While I will state that I share the opinion that you shouldn't join the military, it's for other reasons.

Military life is incredibly difficult. And it becomes more so when you return home. Many would advise against it if you were cis. But joining as a trans soldier, would make things very complicated for you. There are new rules put in place to support you but there will still be a lot of hate. From your brothers and sisters in arms, to foreign citizens and refugees.

Any military is a necessary evil. The U.S. military has messed up a lot. So have other nations military forces. But those who serve are not often directly responsible for these mistakes. It is their commanders who hold the blame. Not all, not even most active service veterans are bad people, and hating them based solely on one's opinions of the establishment is wrong.

That last paragraph is aimed at the commenters not OP
i promise starbucks + the associated healthcare is a better option. if starbucks becomes too much, you can put in your 2 weeks and move on with your life. military is something you can't walk away from like that.
Ya, don't fucking go to the military. Now is the worst time ever to ever join them. Stay away from them and pick something else. You'll thank me later
Don’t join the military, it’s not very girlboss at all. It’ll fuck you up for life.
I was in the Corps. I say don't do it.
As a lot of people have said, it's probably best to find a better way to serve your country. The military traumatizes cis-het people all the time, I don't want to know what happens to queer people. 

Look into non-combatant groups. NGOs or charities might have a better environment. There are even outreach programs that help queer people in foreign countries. There's lots you can do!
Trans and at the Air Force Academy rn if you want any info
don’t join the military
AF as well, AD for 12 years, stay far away.
I second this. Don’t do it
To be fair, while the Air Force is less rah-rah it's also ~~headquartered~~ heavily taught and influenced by the academy in one of the most fundamentalist Christian cities in America - Colorado Springs, where Focus on the Family is headquartered.

Not to say I disagree with you - I think it would be crazy to jump into the military when it looks like our rights may be taken away (including the right to serve in the military) in a few months.
I loved my time in the AF...7 yrs spec ops and as tedious and traumatizing as basic training was, and horribly deadly my deployments,  I developed more character in those 7 yrs, than in any other such span. Would recommend Space Force now if someone wanted to join.

BUT NON-BINARY PPL AREN'T CURRENTLY ALLOWED IN US MILITARY :(  They only allow men and women or people in the process of proceeding to man or woman. ONLY TWO GENDERS EXIST TO US MILITARY
Thoughts on other uniformed service corps that aren't military? Like the NOAA corps and such
I got out a while ago. Dont go. 

I wont even lie. Basic was fun AF. But thats where it stops. Those ""benefits"" they talk about SUCK. Their GI Bill? Sucks. Pay? Sucks. 

Theres nothing actually positive you get out of the military, its all a lie. I dont know a single person whos gotten out in the last 20y who would do it again. No one. Im from a military town, 30% of the people who graduated with me joined the service in the 5y after we graduated HS and NO ONE is still enlisted to this day. 

Being trans, the military gives even less of a shit about you.
Yeah military is getting better for queer people but not for GENDER-queer people stay away at all costs
Ah, alright. I'll have to ask about that, I've got an appointment w/ a recruiter next thurs. Thank you for telling me 😁. Maybe what I heard was wrong or circumstantial...

The military being transphobic and anit-LGBTQ is a big part of why I'm really not that interested tbh.
Rather than getting indebted, I'd apply for scholarship, and if that doesn't work, go to community college. As a last resort, I'd say move to a country with free education and less transphobia. But that is easier said than done.
Of course it sucks but do you blame someone entering into a system that forces them down this road or the designers of it? This person doesn’t want debt and wants a career. Our system is barbaric but sometimes the choice is necessary. If you have arguments about safety within the army like demanding not going to fort Bragg or another that’s a more valid argument but I’m not seeing you make one like that
>I would honestly disown my siblings if they went to the military.

What's with all the extreme hate and prejudice and threats of psychological/relational abuse by forcing your will on your siblings under penalty of permanent abandonment? 

Why in the hell would you ever disown someone for being brainwashed (indoctrinated), especially in something that can profoundly produce noble character when accompanied by perseverance and proper self-investment? Every communication-capable human being experiences an indoctrination in every new social group with which they become routinely exposed. This is fundamental to psycho-social human behavior.

This type of rhetoric utterly infuriates me to the core, because it is not only incredibly self-centered, naive, ignorant, and bigoted, abusive, intolerant, manipulative, hateful, and inhumane (ironically?), but it BRINGS DISCREDIT UPON OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY, epitomizing hypocrisy in the very attitudes and actions that transgender ppl risk their lives and even die fighting to change! 

I was abandoned by my family, church, friends--truly everyone in my life in my home state where I live, AND THIS FOR TRANSITIONING, because of the same ideology that they share with you (socially persecute those who are different or misunderstood, or with whom you disagree, etc. (more specifically and especially, when they do something *contrary to your imposition of your will in their life*)

**Please consider loving your siblings actively,** ***unless they abuse you*****, no matter how different they are from you or how different their path might become from yours. And all the more so, if we are to maintain integrity and credibility in asking and hoping or expecting for others to treat us in kind**

\- Spectre Sweetheart
I'm already going to community college, I'm getting an associates, but I can't get a bachelors in my major at my community college so I have to transfer to a uni...

Thank you <3
I was going to do the 2 days of monthly service following the bootcamp. While in school I would not be in active duty constantly...

How would something like this affect trans people currently in service? Revoke all of their benefits and have them kicked out?
*sigh*

This.

I wanted to go in out of high school, but knew it'd be hard being closeted.

Back then it was seeming like progressive policies were winning; i.e. 'Don't say gay' repealed, couple openly gay military peeps being vocal, etc.

In the decade since then, they've done nothing but culturally and socially say 'fuck you' to girls like us, and the hatred/homophobia/transphobia is commonplace.

They're looking for cogs that look like, talk like, and act like bland non-descriptive bodies.

You're worth so much more than that, love. ♡
Actively in the navy now and in a training command but my experience has been pretty much the same even now. People are just shitty.
wait they do??
I’m a veteran.  I was gay, serving during don’t ask don’t tell.  I was got out in 2000, and transitioned last year.
The army was tough, but it was one of the best experiences of my life. 
If you’ve never served, refrain from speaking for those of us who have.
Thank you very much 👍
Prostitutes provide an actual service and also don’t murder people
The comparison breaks down when you consider the fact that sex work generally gives workers agency, is accessible, and, unless you're trafficked (which, let's be real, considering a branch of an industry that does forced labor an equal part of that industry is unfair), you can walk away from it.
Huh?
Everything is not covered by the va . Mental health, HRT , prosthetics, some hair removal, is covered. Surgery’s (ffs,grs) not sure about FTM mastectomies, are not covered.
Let’s fucking hope not
Thank you, I will definitely be researching this more. 😁
How dare you try to defile an innocent civilian by sending them to die for no reason
In the us we have socialized education, medicine, and job-opportunities via the military. It isn't a terrible option to joing for the benefits considering the crippling expense that those are for most people.

With that said, this post is three months old and I already didn't plan on it after checking more info on it.
Could you speculate on our rights being taken away and possible provide sources? I'm not discrediting you I'm just saying people said their rights were being taken away when they were asked to put a piece of cloth on their face, so I take it with a grain of salt these days.
This isn’t exactly true. You have to have either a M or F gender marker, but we are explicitly allowed to use they/them pronouns in email signature block, and there’s nothing to prevent someone from being out as non-binary, provided you are okay with the dress and appearance standards of your official gender marker.
I have no personal experience with these, sorry friend.
Keep in mind a recruiter gets paid to recruit you, not to be upfront about the negatives.
You're recruiter will not be honest with you. They are payed to sell the military and are very good at letting you make the wrong conclusions without outright lying.
Recruiters LIE. Listen to LGBTQ+ soldiers, not recruiters. Plus in the military you're likely to be denied if you admit you're trans or take HRT. The recruiter will probably tell you to lie to. Honestly, don't do it if you want to transition.
Don’t believe anything the recruiter tells you. They will lie and tell you literally anything if they think it’ll get you to join the military. It’s what they get paid to do, and it’s all they’ll do.
The military is extremely good at lying to you to get you to join and forcing you to deal with the truth after you get in. I repeat they will lie like crazy to get you in, and once you are in you will be forced to do what they tell you and that's the end of it!
Don’t ask the recruiter, their job is to tell you what you want to hear. Ask other people who have been enlisted.
That all depends on the thousands of people you might come across between now and the time you make it to your unit. I implore you to choose a better career path.
There’s a lot of bad info here. Being trans is currently protected in the military so if people discriminate against you they can get in trouble. They may struggle with that but that’s the rule. 

The real issue is that you can’t join if you started transitioning and aren’t “stable” in your gender for at least 18 months. 

If you join before you start HRT then normally you can’t start HRT during your first enlistment.
nobody's blaming the person entering the system, just trying to warn one more victim away.
those arguments are exactly the ones that lead to the conclusion of ""the military sucks""
1. I’m not even in the US so my military experience is way more different than your experience. There’s no risk of being drafted, no recruiters come to your highschool and try and convince you to join, there’s no free college. The only benefits are good pay and other job opportunities

2. All of my siblings have been at the receiving end of what the military does to people, jesus we all have a restraining order against my own father because of it. They know how bad it is, they know what the results are and they know what it’s like to not know if someone’s coming home or not. If they CHOSE to go to the defence force, even after all of this, after all the psychological damage it’s already done and the amount of therapy we all now have to go through, I would feel so betrayed honestly. I would feel broken-hearted. Knowing that the cycle would just continue. 

And another thing, we’re all autistic. There’s no way we would be able to psychologically recover from just the training.

You don’t know me and you don’t know any of my experience of what I had to go through. I’ve been disowned before and I’ve disowned others before. I know how it all goes down, and I know I won’t do it unless I deem absolutely necessary for my self preservation. You think I want to possibly disown my own siblings one day? I feel like a second parent to those kids. I was just showing the extremities of how the military affects you, that I would consider disowning family members because of it. That’s how bad it is. So don’t come and tell me how I’m psychologically abusive and exactly like bigoted transphobes for wanting to protect my family. You won’t ever get it, because you were indoctrinated into the military too. It’s why you’re getting so defensive and attacking me for it.
ah i see that’s great! i hope everything works out for you no matter what route you go:)
I would think so. A ban is a ban. Probably get slapped with an unfit for service and a discharge. With an overwhelmingly conservative majority on the SC and an unstable political landscape with the midterm coming next week. Be very careful.
They can do whatever they want to you while you are on drill weekends, and if they kick you out, you'd have to pay back every dime they spent on your education.
Far far far far worse that than, you'd be on the hook for education payments, you could be looking at jail time, you could literally be looking at far far far worse from under the table too, as you will have signed your life away to people who won't view you as a person for being trans but also because you literally signed your life away like a tool to be used and thrown away after it's no longer useful.   


There are not many worse decisions you could make in life. Is the paycheck really that much more appealing than just flipping some burgers? Not putting as many targets on yourself in front of people with live ammunition.
Kicked out or outright banned from HRT under threat of prison. They can do what they want once you enlist, including deny you medications.
Yeah, gotta work 6 months first and have an average of 24 hours a week. They offer 100k of transgender surgery stuff including covering cosmetic stuff
And what about the other veterans in this thread who agree with what I said? 
Also, non military people can have opinions on the military lol. Especially in America where the military affects much of our lives.
She should hear from all sides.
We’ll have to disagree on this one, I believe everyone is allowed an opinion on the military. 

You can have your opinion, you are arguing under mine and saying I shouldn’t have one.
I would also definitely encourage you to consider why this entire thread is people saying don't do it and look up what a ""sunk cost fallacy"" is before going to that sub.
Response to a deleted post
I meant the opportunity to if someone wanted to not a requirement lol
I dare because you are talking out your butt, and know nothing about service to one's country. It is a privilege to  serve, more trans people of good character will make it easier for future generations. Participation adds credibility to an otherwise uninformed opinion shaped by refusing to hear anyone that doesn't already agree with you.

If you want to know whether to join the military or not,  ask a veteran or service member.  Not anyone on this sub.
Good luck!
They're probably referring to our increasingly conservative supreme court and it's mission to overturn every liberal legal decision ever made in an effort to fast track us back to the 1800s
That's fair.

Republicans are passing increasingly strong anti-trans laws, mostly but not entirely aimed at children.  That includes banning HRT or even puberty blockers, banning them from school sports, requiring schools to use not use preferred names, blocking people from talking about LGBT people at school, requiring schools to out children to their parents, and I think more.

There's also been at least one attempt to keep people from changing their IDs and birth certificates, and there have been noises (but no bills afaik) about banning HRT for adults in some areas.  In addition, Trump banned trans people from the military by canceling an executive order that allowed it - Biden's reversed that, but any trans person that joins the military should know that their ability to serve is, for now, subject to change based on who the President is.

In addition, Justice Thomas' concurrence in the Roe reversal explicitly called out some of the laws that protect LGBT people, and cases are probably headed to the SC soon that may subvert our right to marriage and our right to hold jobs.

VOTE.
Sure, and guidance has changed so much already since 2016, and continues to develop, and in so far as transitioning to a non-binary socially presented expression, such as legally (gender marker, etc.) or medically transitioning to a non-binary physical appearance or attempting to aesthetically express anything other than stereotypical (and highly precise and highly standardized)  military male and female dress and appearance regulations, well, it's all ""unauthorized"", not simply ""not authorized"" (two military terms with very different meanings (""Not ok; don't do it else face disciplinary consequences"" and  ""sure go ahead, but you best be able to articulate sound reasoning if questioned on the matter/keyword to scan for when looking for a loophole in tech data processes--definition varies based on time served and maturity level"", respectively.

So I don't see it practicably allowed apart from an insulting token gesture of ""well you can use they/them, but ya still gotta go around presenting binary.
This 100 million percent!  Do NOT trust anything a recruiter tells you, even if they are willing to put it into writing.  There is always a clause in every person's enlistment papers, saying ""or as military service needs dictate"" (or something to that effect... It's been 40 years since I enlisted).  This means they can do anything with you they like once they have you!!!
I was in the uscg and this ^
Raping women is also not allowed in the military. It‘s still a daily occurrence.


OP do not join unless you would otherwise starve.
Ummm and if someone tries to mug you just say no. They can’t legally take your items without your consent 🙄 /s
Victim of the military? News flash — we’re all victims of the USA’s capitalist policies and the militarization of the country. Whether you’re in it or not. You think the militarization ends at the military? Where did the cops get all of their dangerous toys? Are there gonna be awful people in the military that hate trans people? Sure but take a look inside the country. It’s not any better and more trans people with military training will be a benefit to trans people so when things get bad they can help protect their fellow trans people.

The shortsightedness of this thread is embarrassing. Yes, they use you. Every part of our society is based around using you because that’s what capitalism is but you can also use them back. I live in the dumbest timeline
No shit but if you’re telling someone, “don’t. You’re better off with student loans — they may just prefer to not have student loans”
I’m autistic too and went through some very rigorous US military training, mostly about 20 years ago. Based on the life I’ve led before and after that training, I have to conclude that it’s helped my life enormously, despite the traumatizing nature of it. And while I did find the training quite traumatizing, I believe I excelled because it wasn’t nearly as bad as other non-military traumas I’ve faced, both before and after service.

The trauma and suffering we persevere through leads to character development in all walks of life. Inability to persevere is another thing altogether.

My dad was also military and struggled to even be in my life growing up, and my family blamed him of course, his military, his drinking, whatever they wanted. As an adult who’s broken free from parental indoctrination (mostly mother but also stepdad), well after my dads death 15 years ago, I now understand he was not so much to blame: My mother drove him off with her craziness and I understand how he felt no path to fight against her narcissism. I joined the military in order to get away from her abuse and abuse-enabling myself, as well as to find reparenting and family.
that is very good to know, thank you
Let them speak for themselves.  

Would you want non-trans people speaking in place of you about your experience?
You aren’t offering yours, you’re pushing a ‘collective’ opinion of ‘every veteran you meet who isn’t X’.  Stop speaking for all your fictitious veteran friends.
I know what you meant, I just hope people don’t want to
Too bad for you I am a veteran and YOUR the one talking out your ass. The military is a horrible place for LGBTQ+ peeps, PERIOD.
Yeah I was saying when trump put three justices in the SC that it was practically trump's own republican deep state. You say that and it sounds outlandish but that's what it is.
Thanks for the response I will check these out
I remember my recruiter telling others to lie before going to MEPs too. Stuff like not mentioning asthma, or any other medical condition/disorder that could potentially disqualify them. If it's documented, you can't get away with lying. If it isn't, you can get in trouble for it later, but the recruiter won't when it's found out.

Edit: left out a word
(dis)Trust but Verify
I am the only one on this thread who shared the actual DOD policy. Laws prevent mugging even though there are still some people who get mugged. The DOD policy has done a ton to educate soldiers about trans people and will do a lot to protect trans people in the military even if some trans people still experience discrimination. And laws against mugging and discrimination mean that the people who still choose to do those illegal things will often be punished.
""Were all victims of the USA's capitalist policies and the militarization of the country""

I agree that's why I want less or none of it.
then get military training without the fucking military. we shouldn't need to rely on the shitty government that would kill us all in a heartbeat.
The posters whole point is to pay for college. If they wana go to college then go there, don't become a soldier which is something different all together
That is not the same thing at all, one is a job and ever present part of American foreign and domestic policy. And especially our spending on social safety nets. 

The other is an identity, intrinsic to people and who they are.
That’s a fair point. 
Noted. 
They still shouldn’t join the military lmao
The worst part is, this very true and almost everyone does it as well. Hell even acne cream can potentially disqualify you.
You know what happens when you get to receiving? More than 50% of those people who have lied during MEPS have either been eaten by their guilt and spill or their caught and either way this can lead to you getting booted. Its usually a chapter 11 seperation which means you CAN get back in but you still get seperated, sent home unpaid to start all over again.
If we just ban discrimination it will effectively prevent threat of discrimination or retaliation for reporting discrimination! /s
Me too but you can’t get there from here by wishing it away. That’s how fascism goes unopposed
No shit but who are you gonna get that military training from — for free? Are you even thinking this through? Not everyone is willing to do that and the poster may not be in an area that can arrange that so easily.

Get military training from a place that will pay you and teach you and you get your lessons from for free — me

But they may kill you — you

I said that but also take a look around. Most of them will even if you’re not in the military — me

Go someplace else for it — you

Where will you be able to ensure you’ll get that same training for free? — me

Literally I’m arguing with stupid people
Their post says, “considering military service.” Are you all daft?
Let the vets speak for themselves.  
It’s not a difficult thing and not a big ask.
Discrimination is banned. Threat of discrimination is banned. Retaliation for reporting discrimination is banned. I’m trying to explain the actual policy to you and instead of learning something or asking questions you are treating me like I made a policy that you disagree with even though you don’t understand the actual policy.
Telling someone that they shouldn't join up with the fascist death machine is ""trying to wish it away???"" Do you really want to prove something to me or are you just that desperate to be sure that you're right and I'm wrong?

There is no ""working within the system"" to change it and serving as fascism's billy club is NOT a good way to build the skills neccesary to overthrow fascism. That's just pure fantasy.
Are you okay? Do you need someone to vent to? Its valid to be angry at a system that continues to oppress, but I worry about how the anger seems to be affecting you.  I know it's not my place, but hopefully you're doing well.
Dipshit I KNOW the policy. Discrimination STILL happens. You think I don’t know what you’re trying to say? You’re disregarding my replies entirely.
So how long did it take for fascists to remove abortion rights in this country? 49 years. Remind me again was it through the legal system or did they overthrow it?

Yeah, you can. It’s just morons like everyone that disagrees with me that thinks it cannot be done
You have no arguments so you resort to concern trolling.

I’m talking to imbeciles apparently. To the OP, if you wanna go to the military to get training and have free college and not end up with student loans — go. It may be dangerous if you never have to get sent out to the battlefield and obviously will if you do but living in America is dangerous too whether you’re trans or not. Some may forget that we have mass shootings every day in this country and you may have even not bothered the person committing the violence. If you don’t, don’t. Just be aware of the bases they send you to because they’re not all safe like fort Bragg has plenty of soldiers turning up dead by their very own and nothing is done about it"	yldobe	trans	499	0.93	2022-11-03 20:21:24
Does the name Luka read more masculine or feminine to you? Be honest ❤️	"Thank you !

EDIT:

I am MTF and my birth name is Luca which in my country is STRICTLY male so I am considering wether to just change it to Luka which could be just a slight change and a bit more androgynous because changing to a hyper feminine name feels strange right now, but I haven’t started HRT so it could also be because of that. So I was thinking that even if it read more masculine it could give Hunter Schafer vibes but it obviously is weird when you introduce yourself and you dont pass yet. Like yesterday night I was at a party and had full face of make up on and with my trans sister and just based on the name i got misgendered which obviously gave me dysphoria."	"Masculine for me
As a french person it sounds masc. Maybe because of [this song](https://youtu.be/VZt7J0iaUD0)
i think it seems more masculine
Luka is a serbian or slavic strictly male name. i think it is a variation of the name ""Lucas"". Obviously if you live in the US practically every name can be considered gender neutral, but where I live if you are a woman named Luka it would be considered odd and wouldn't help you pass
Masculine, I'd say. I know a guy named that.
Masculine
I've seen it used with both. As a girl example: the vocaloid luka
It sounds feminine to me but that’s probably because of the Vocaloid.
Luka Luka Night Fever!
I don’t know I see it as both.
I think Luka is an androgynous name honestly, it's been used in many videogames by characters that are either male or female. Luka is in Chrono Trigger a game from the 90s i think and that character is female.

Its just a name that sounds very androgynous and can make people think of both male and female characters, people, etc..
Sounds in the middle to me tbh

~Alyssa
Masc imo, but I know to many guys named Luca / Luka so that's prob why
Masc for me personally
It definitely seems masc to me
Huh. I'd have genuinely thought feminine.
There's Luka Megurine the Vocaloid! She's super feminine!
Femenine for me but only because of my years of Vocaloid fangirling
masc
Luka is feminine to me. Friend of mine (who was a woman) in uni was called that.
Fem
For me its very feminine, because I know a girl named luca, but for my family it seems rather masc.
Luka has always been fem to me
androgynous
I know several men and women named Luka !
I definitely see your struggle to change the name, and I know the feeling. FtM but my name was supposedly once an all male name until some lady in the 50’s made it popular and now it’s almost solely a girls name. I haven’t had the confidence to fully come out or use a fully masculine chosen name 24/7… idk what’s holding me back so much. 

But if it’s causing you dysphoria, it might be worth getting out of your comfort zone and try out more feminine name versions. Sadly, my name won’t be perceived as nb or male, no matter what the name’s history used to be. And sadly it seems, your name won’t likely be seen as nb or female. I definitely want you to be happy and confident. But it seems the lesser of two evils, just in my opinion, would be finding relief from the impending dysphoria and misgendering.
I've known one boy called Luca and one girl called Luka so this pretty much fits with my understanding of the name.
What about the name Lucina? I don’t think it’s too hyper fem or anything and it’s much, MUCH less masculine sounding than Luka. I was also thinking Lucy could be a name if you wanted something somewhat similar. However, I think Lucy is relatively hyper feminine. I hope this helps! 💜
Fem to me. It’s like Luke is masc and Luka is fem.
For me it really doesn’t sound masculine cause of Megurine Luka, also there was a pretty famous female singer called Luca here, i think changing the C to a K is already enough to make it sound feminine but maybe it’s different depending on the country you are, just make sure you are comfortable with it and it’s fine!
I would assume masculine, but if a fem person used it I probably wouldn't think it was weird or anything.
IMHO, of the few masc leaning names ending in -a, Luka is one of them. At least where I live. Sasha, Jona, Luca, Ilya, Ezra, Nicola... The spelling doesn't change it much, although it does read slightly more feminine, I think it would sway people towards misgendering you.
pretty gender neutral honestly but slightly more masculine (i will be honest it's bc i think of Luca, the movie, first and foremost)

also i live in the US if that cultural context is important
tbh it's feminine to me because I knew a girl named Alluka, which is pretty similar.
It's masc. You could change it slightly, and keep the core but change it, for example, Lucca or Lucia.
Luka feels more like Luke and Luca feels more like Lucy. I don't know if that helps..
On one hand every name ending with ""a"" sounds feminine to me due to my native language, on the other hand it's pretty similar to Luke (probably the same name, different language, right?) I could see it being feminine and masculine depending on context
Hey! I'm FTM and for a long time I was in the fence between Luka and another variation of the name that sounded more masc to me. Eventually choose the more ""masc"" version because is a popular name in my country so I'll get less raised eyebrows with it being more ""cisnormative"", but I still like Luka a lot because it sounds a bit more andoginous to me (which I like), and also cooler. So I might be biased because I like that name a lot, but for my viewpoint Luka is a perfectly andoginous name, both for femme and masc individuals. If you like it, I'd say go for it and experiment to see if it fits? Best of luck <3
Masculine to me it's one of the most common male names where I live
Both
Sounds masc to me
Yeah, I would say masc, it's not the most masc vibe name, but still
Masc for me
Luka seems more masc to me, I’d recommend Lucy, perhaps?
Definitely masculine but only because I’m a Mavericks fan.
Masc but it could also be read as androgynous
girl do what feels good to you! who cares how it sounds if you like it go for it babe. I have always loved the name luca and for a girl it would honestly be soooo cute. it’s giving hunter schaefer vibes and i love it lol
I've seen it used both masc and fem but to me it's more reminscint of masc
i’ve only ever really heard it used in a masculine way tbh
Luka (with a k) is a generally masculine name where I live.

Edit: Looked it up and there are 3811 people marked as male with that name where I live and under 32 marked female in the name database.
I see it as a more masculine name, but that's probably cuz I know two guys called Luka and no girls
I think adding a k does make it more androgynous, not as much feminine.
Luca is the italian version to the name Luke, which is a male name

The name Luka is somewhat remembered as a ""feminine"" name because of that one singer, but that is incorrect
It's a very masc name
I think it sounds cute and androgynous personally!
I have a swedish friend named Luka who's male, so I'm biased to say masc
It sounds more androgynous than with a c, I think if you don't want to be hyper feminine yet then it's a good choice ^^
Andro, more femme than Tyler, but slightly more masc than Alex
It sounds masculine to my francophone ears. The female equivalent would be Lucia or Lucie
Masculine
Honestly just very androgynous, I think I actually know equal amounts of boys, girls AND enbys with this name
Luca seems more feminine to me than Luka . But you’ve lived with Luca and probably associated it with people addressing you as Luca and a boy

Edit; typo
more masc for me, why don’t you try lucia? i think it’s rlly pretty
Feminine or androgynous
[deleted]
I think it SOUNDS more masculine but if I met a girl name luka I wouldn’t question it I thinks it’s cool.
I've had it used in both feminine and masculine contexts so it's neutral
Dutch person here, sounds masculine to me. hope that helps!
Andro to me
Masculine as well. You could try Lucy/Luci?
I'm amab and my name is Luka. But in Germany where I live I legally have to have a second name that is clearly gendered. So at least officially Luka is a gender neutral name at least where I live. But I have never actually seen a woman with the name Luka but I wouldn't be surprised if I met one.
It's a boys name in every use I've heard it. But I'm sure you could swing either way.
i see it as feminine mainly because of Megurine Luka (vocaloid) and i see Luca as more masc
Okay so for me Luka is female, but Luca is def male   


I only know women with a k and only men with a c ... which is super weird because I guess in my language most people will assume it's a c and thus male ... thinking of it ... I think I only know trans women who are named Luka ...  


Like I read Luka and thought 100% female, male didn't even cross my mind until I read your edit and realised it's close to Luca  
Interesting indeed ... never thought about it
Masculine
Masc for me.
Depending on how you write it Luka a bit more masc,
Luca is more feminine
Kinda reminds me on the name Laika, so I was thinking fem
I see it as masculine. I also immediately think of Final Fantasy X when I hear that name lol
It's masculine to me.
Gender neutral to me
I assumed it was a feminine name, but I feel like the movie Luca will probably make a lot of people think of it as masc. Idk I've never seen my dead name or chosen name in media so I don't know how annoying that could be.
I always thought it was a girls name, despite the fact that I have an Italian friend whose name is Luca.
As someone from a slavic country, I've only ever heard that name used for males, so to me that is a distinctly masculine name.
i probably would've thought it was only feminine but after the disney movie Luca it also sounds masculine i guess, idk it feels like a pretty gender neutral name
I know someone who is non-binary and they changed there name to Luca. So maybe it's kinda neutral. Also I'm sure my Luca is about to transition to female. So there's that as well.
Either way it's a really nice name.
It definitely is more masculine in society, but a friend I knew from high school named her *daughter* Luca! So gender norms be damned!
Masculine
Only Luca I know is a girl so yeah
As a portuguese native speaker sounds masculine, but it depends of where you live
I always have the nickname Nate, when I'm transitioning, to don't cause much trouble with presenting myself I changed slightly my nick name to Naty, that sounds more feminine, my little tip to you, if you want to change but don't be hyper feminine on your name, use the nickname Lu, that can be a short for so many androginous, masculine or feminine names that no one will know or judge
It's more gender neutral, in my opinion. I mean, if you gave the name to a boy it would do the same as If you gave it to a girl. If you think it fits you personally, I don't see a problem with having the name

Besides, who's going to give you shit for having a name, a transphobe? What do they know, not science that's for sure.
Masc
Lucia? Is not hyper femme? Or luci (short for lucifer? Cuz ik many  enby/trans peeps who pick..edgy? Weird but in a good way? names as they transition)
I assumed fem but I guess that's the language difference.
My best friend is named Luka and she‘s very feminine to me :D
masculine
Masc
I know a girl named Luca and a guy named Luka, so I personality see Luca as more feminine and Luka as more masculine, but ig it just depends on the place 🤷
Masc af.
With a K= male (more similar to Luke)

With a C= female (more similar to Lucy)
One of my friends went from Luca to Lyka, tho cuz she used Luca for a while anyway it's ingrained as fem in my brain now lol
Masc
I strongly associate it as being feminine, because of Megurine Luka and because it ends in -a.
I see it as neutral. But Lucca with 2 Cs will 100% make me think of the character from chrono trigger every time.
Masculine
Male. My friend recently had a boy and named him Luca!
Masc
a more feminine male name if that makes sense
Femme to me
sounds fem to me tbh
US here, never heard that name before, and honestly it seems pretty androgynous to me, like 50/50... only similar comparison I know is Luke
In Europe, it's definitely a masculine name
Very masc, could be feminine but far more masc than fem in my opinion
Feminine for me but it is androgynous
Masculine
Masc, luka is a masculine name in finland
I changed my name from rick to Rikki and while I  did it because it made it easier for a lot of reasons I think it contributed to misgendering from people who new me before transitioning. In hindsight I wish I had gone with something different to change the association.
It does sound masculine to me also.
Masculine, mostly because it’s my uncles nickname (his name is Gianluca)
I know that Luka is usually more masculine but I honestly feel like it could be either masculine or feminine
To me as an American it sounds kinda gender neutral but I’d perceive Lucia or Lucy as a lot more femme personally
Masc for me
Reads femme to me idk something about the “k”
I would never hear the name Luca and think of a girl
to me specifically it seems more feminine, that might just be cause i have a female friend named Luka, but i do think it depends on what area your in for how people perceive it
Seams male to me
sounds more masc imo, but if you didn't want much change, lucia is an option? although that is a bit more feminine than androgynous if that's currently an issue
More gender neutral tbh
I'm American and before reading these comments I assumed it was the feminine version of Luke.
Luka looks masculine, but where are you from?
it does seem a bit masculine to me, but i’m kinda seeing some feminine side to the name as well
Masculine
I would hear/read that as a masculine name. Maybe you could go with a feminine variation like Lucia or Lucretia.
American - sounds androgynous
wierdly it feels androynous to me...
as a Spanish I attribute it to a masculine name but I think it would fit beautifully to a woman too
Doesn’t sound like a gendered name to me.
Luka reads as being on the feminine side to me personally. Luca feels more masculine. Though tbh they both seem a bit androgynous
I've always seen it as more fem, but looking at the other comments it seems like I'm in the minority.
Everyone's saying masc but I say fem, I grew up with a girl named Luka (whether it was spelled that or 'Luca' I don't actually know).
masc
I think its pretty androgynous
I think it's androgynous
Masc because my birthname is luca with a s
Bc of stein's gate ive always read it as feminine
Masc
Masc because of luka magnotta tbh
It think that Luka is a masc name
I’d read it masc.
Ironically with the K more than with C, as the C could be short for Lucia?
Androgynous, personally, but if I had to choose I'd say Masc
Were i live its a gender neutral name like Alex for exemple (trough to me it was always more femenin for me. well untill the movie Luca came out..)
Feminine to me, but that’s cause the only Luka I know is AFAB NB and femme presenting
I’m from the US but when I first heard it I thought femme
I know a man named Luka but it sounds fem
Depending on the country your from, going from Luca to Lucia can in many languages be be leaning to male or female depending on pronunciation.
Have you ever considered the name Harper? It's more often a girl's name but it isn't uncommon to see people of any gender with it.
I usually read it as masculine myself, just because it makes me think of Luka Couffaine from Miraculous Ladybug (and honestly, he's a pretty androgynous leaning male character: definitely gives me andro and bi vibes). I do think that Luka could potentially be used in a more feminine/androgynous way (much like Charlie is, or Hayden). 

In the end though, I think it matters more to how the name makes you feel c: if you like it, and it makes you happy, then go for it. Try it out for a bit, see how it goes c: there is nothing wrong with you changing it later; there is not obligation to stick with the first name you use when transitioning. I know I went through several names before landing on the one I have now Cx
To me it reads as masculine still. Only feminine thing I thought of was Megurine Luka the vocaloid lmao
Luka sounds more masculine to me. (sorry)
Masculine
Definitely masculine
Luka is definitely masc. maybe lucoa like the dragon from miss Kobayashis dragon maid. She’s really cute 😭
Masculine 100% i would say
Welllllll since my god character is an all sex all gender creature, being made from stars and born from a spectacle of cosmic mating, named Lucanyct, I find it very gender neutral. 

Since there's this movie named Luca, people may associate it with slight more masculinity but, eh, his roundness isn't something hardcore masculine heh. 

The only Luka I actual remember, is from Miraculous, and, well, eh, I mean, he's a man but, nyeh, name doesn't really scream boyman at me. 

So, I see Luka and Luca as gender neutral. 
Btw are these the same name just different spellings or?
my dumb ass hears the name luka and immediately thinks of luka megurine
i personally think the name is feminine, but probably because that character is super feminine
A more androgynous or feminine version of luke
Lucia
As a canadian it's completely gender neutral. I know two girls named Luca, and one boy named luka with a k, so to me at least it's more feminine but overall gender neutral
definitely masc, sorry sweetheart
It’s more like luka can be both
I personally think that this name sounds more masculine
I think it's similar to Lukas which is a masc name so i think it leans in the same way
[deleted]
Feminine to me
I love the vocaloid Luka, and despite actually liking the name as someone ftm I couldn’t use it because it feels too feminine to me. I honestly think it’s gender neutral, leans masc or fem by how you spell it
Femme
Luka with a k feels more masc
Masculine, I personally think hanging your name to Lucy would be more fitting, but it's up to you!
I’m Italian so Luca (with the C) is a masculine name, but Luka (with the K) I don’t really know (and yes I read the edit after lmao)
I only know the name Luka from the cis masc character on ER from the early 2000s, but I’m old, so idk how most ppl would hear it today.
Makes me thing of the (female) vocaloid Luka.
I know a couple of females called Luka, but it is a more male name.
luka is actually a word that means hand/arm in a language I speak, I'm incapable of assigning a gender to it :(
Luka could go either way for me. On a woman it comes off as a “cool tomboyish name,” but not strictly male or misgendering.
More feminine def
The only Luka I know is a cis woman from a lab I used to work at!
Wait I thought this song was about a girl named Luka 😂😂
I was so scared of it being a rickroll
Bonjour. Vive la France. Vive le général. *grand sourire* Au revoir.
Yes great example
This was where my head was at, I've never met anyone with this name but the girl in Crono Trigger had a similar, or phonetically identical name, though I'm pretty sure it was spelt Lucca.
[deleted]
Same
Okay that’s what I was saying, Luka sounds so beautiful and androgynous to me
Same
Thank you for this heartfelt answer ❤️❤️❤️ I will think it through and really consider it. Thank you x1000000
Thank you for the suggestions ❤️❤️
Thank you angel ❤️
Feel like its also more femme than Blake imo
True ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Italy ❤️
Hahaahhaah
The problem with these passing names is that yes they do the job but they are kind of… boring, i cant explain it. They arent exciting to me. For me an androgynous name is more exciting something like… Grey or Hunter or Blake for a girl is way way more cool and exciting yk
Lol
[Luka (song) [wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_(song))

*«few years ago, I used to see this group of children playing in front of my building, and there was one of them, whose name was Luka, who seemed a little bit distinctive from the other children. I always remembered his name, and I always remembered his face, and I didn't know much about him, but he just seemed set apart from these other children that I would see playing. And his character is what I based the song Luka on. In the song, the boy Luka is an abused child—in real life I don't think he was. I think he was just different.»*
Same. Never saw the video before now. So to me Luka was always a feminine name.
Hey miss chapeau!
>the girl in Crono Trigger had a similar, or phonetically identical name, though I'm pretty sure it was spelt Lucca.

Yeah, I thought of her too. It's also spelled Lucca in the sequel, so I'm pretty sure that's the official spelling.

That version feels more feminine to me than with the ""k,"" but I'm not sure if that's just because of the games.
It is spelled Lucca in Chrono Trigger, but there was a female character named Luka in Secret of Mana as well.
Yeah, lucca is how i believe its spelled or maybe it depends on the version you play because I think i've seen it worded both ways in CT 🤔

Whether its spelled Luka or Lucca, either iteration sounds and looks androgynous to me.
thanks!
I agree with Hawaian shirts guy, if your name gets you misgendered now, it's probably worth changing. Are you from Italy (here Luca is masc)?

I chose my name in part bc I associated it with a girl who isn't incredibly feminine (contrast with names from flowers). I wanted a name that was ""feminine but not girly"", if that makes sense. Maybe you could do the same. Keep spinning, girl :)
Anytime. xx
Its a pretty name
ANCHE IO
Good luck to you
Thanks for this. 😁
while the name came from her own experience, part of the reason she kept the name was that it could be the name of a boy or a girl, so it was more ""universal""

and yes, until i saw the video, i thought it was a girl's name too

interestingly, watching the video now, with the parts where her face seems to go back and forth in time... and how she acts out the pain, its almost as if Luka was her as a child... almost makes it like a trans story
Yes im from Italy ❤️
Sicilia?
Beccata!

All'inizio, quando pensavo ai nomi, Viola suonava bene. Ma mi dava... come dire, l'immagine di una femminilità troppo vestitino e sala da ballo. Invece Sofia mi faceva pensare a una bibliotecaria vestita sobria e occhialuta (come me). Naturalmente, le persone che conosciamo influenzano la nostra visione dei nomi. Ti confesso che fa ancora strano chiamarmi con un nome femminile, ma usarlo online aiuta molto a normalizzarlo (anche se non sono ancora certa sia il nome giusto).
SI!
Concordo totalmente!! Buffo perchè se fossi nata femmina i miei mi avrebbero chiamata Sofia! Ma personalmente a me i nomi troppo tradizionali italiani non mi piacciono in generale, ho bisogno di qualcosa con un po di edge. Il mio look è molto hyper-fem e vorrei che il mio nome fosse più androgino, ricercato
Una delle mie migliori amiche è di Palermo
Già, purtroppo i nomi neutri in italiano sono pochi, quindi bisogna cercare fuori. [Questa](https://www.nomix.it/nomi-unisex.php) è una lista carina di nomi androgini (alcuni non funzionano, tipo Simone sarà ambiguo in inglese ma in italiano è decisamente maschile). Personalmente trovo che i nomi della mitologia celtica e anglosassone siano carini, soprattutto Morgan e Mildred (forse i miei nomi nb preferiti). Poi, ovviamente, c'è [Tiamat](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/s3lqxm/it_gets_better/) ;)

A message to those who worries they are a 'transtrender'	"Do you remember that first time you looked at yourself as another gender on FaceApp and felt all warm and fuzzy inside? Do you remember the time you got called ""mate""/love"" by someone in the store and it felt wrong? **CIS PEOPLE DO NOT. I REPEAT DO NOT. EXPERIENCE THIS.** They hate the idea of being seen as any other gender, they WANT to be seen as their gender. They would never feel euphoria over being a woman. They could be gender-fluid, but that's not cis. So even if your euphoria isn't as strong in one moment, that doesn't invalidate the times it was.

And, another thing: **DYSPHORIA DISGUISES ITSELF AS OTHER CONDITIONS.** Did you ever feel suicidal and had no idea why? Did you ever depersonalize from your body and feel like it didn't need taking care of? No wonder. It can mask very well as other things but that doesn't change the facts.

Hey, It's normal to feel doubt, to feel like your invading, to feel like you're not the ""real"" version of the gender you're starting to identify as, and the worst part is that the anxiety of being the other gender can often feel like dysphoria, because dysphoria feels uncomfortable and anxious, but that doesn't mean you're actually experiencing dysphoria, you could just be feeling anxious and scared to show people your real self! It's confusing, I know, and if you're still not sure, you can ""soft-transition"" in a way which is completely reversible, until you become more certain.

Take your time, there's no rush, some times you may feel like you want to buy everything and do everything typical of your gender, and other times you'll question yourself and pull back. That's normal, it's an experience, and it's scary, but a cis person would not feel euphoric about being the other gender, and certainly would not feel put off by acting in a way typical of their assigned gender. You're valid, and i love you xo

EDIT: As /u/kidunfolded has pointed out, it's completely valid if it ends up you are cis! don't force yourself into any box or label that's what i'm trying to say here!"	"When it comes to doubts the thing I keep coming back to is this: CIS people don’t worry that they’re wrong.
I have known (or at least had a strong suspicion) for awhile, but the first time a stranger called me boss as a greeting I was so euphoric I rode that high for the rest of the night
I think it’s important to remember that ‘transtrender’ is a term made up by transphobes to make us all sound like we’re weak minded at best and mentally ill at worst. The word was made up by people who hate us and want us eradicated from society. It’s bullshit. Don’t let it get to you.
Thanks for this post, saved for dark times. So validating.
Yeah, honestly I had one of those moments that kinda solidified it for me. I came out as questioning leaning heavily towards mtf and basically, she and I were talking and she offered to do my makeup and eyebrows and like we're gonna go get piercings together and she's even gonna let me try on a dress of hers. I had the biggest fucking grin on my face at 2 am and at that moment I kinda had no way to rationalize it
Yes to all of this except Faceapp. That shit creeped me out lmao. Uncanny valley 😖
yeah this totally makes sense. but I'd be careful of the narrative that ""cis people don't question their gender,"" because they're just not true. it's toxic and misleading to tell a cis person who is questioning their gender that the simple act of questioning means they're trans. sometimes people just question and come to the conclusion they're still cis. and that's okay. not that you're making that narrative! just something important and something I see a lot
I really needed to hear this thank you.😊 well read i guess lol
well i had the doubt... went to therapy  and I have gender disphoria... now I am on baby steps.
What is ""soft transitioning?"" I'm terrified of making a big decision and regretting it
How to know if you're a ""trans tender"".
You aren't, this is just an invented problem by people like Blair white.
I have been in a lot of doubt recently because I am still “discovering” myself. So excited to finally  talk to a therapist next week. I think it might help justify my feelings.
Thank you for this! I've been going through a lot of doubt as of late and been feeling really down on myself. Its definitely a long process and a large part of me wishes I wasn't afraid to explore this earlier in life. It would've saved a lot of heartache.

That being said the more comfortable I get with myself the better and less chaotic I feel. I'm finally on my way to finding peace and it's all because of amazing people like you OP that I even get the chance to.
Omg thank u so much for this!! There are times when I'm really scared to say who I am in public but this have me the confidence I need!! Thanks so much!!
I must confess I sometimes, over the years, thought maybe it's just my way of dealing with being with another guy, then I realize I have no problem having a boyfriend anymore but I have a big grin when someone calls me madam from behind because of my long hair.
It's one of those ""time to look into the next move"" moments, that convince me I'm doing the right thing, and that being depressed is NOT a normal state of being.
Only took 45 years to actually do anything but hey I'll only human, mostly.
idk if it's a good idea to like, try to put so much stock in the notion of dysphoria (or even suffering in general). the idea of dysphoria is a necessary medicalization of our condition which does not benefit us.

the truth is that gender is a social contrivance, one that causes us misery to adhere to, at least as we're commanded to. i think trying to chart out whether or not dysphoria is ""disguised"" as something else is admitting that it actually isn't dysphoria in the first place. it's an attempt to try to expand this one category across all experiences and that just won't work.

simply put, people can change their gender for any reason, and they don't need to experience medically-legitimate suffering in order to justify the change. even if they're not uncomfortable with their assigned gender but would prefer a different one, that's valid.

otherwise, great post.
I am crying. Thank u
> Do you remember the time you got called ""mate""/love"" by someone in the store and it felt wrong?

I'm oddly pleased to see that I'm not the only one who sees ""mate"" as gendered

fuck

This week on: Depression or Dysphoria?
cis people wouldnt start a reddit account off of their main to stalk trans reddits and explore their identity

oh fuck...
 So is it normal to have any of some sort of fantasy to be the other sex? Because do cis people not really think about being the other gender? And there is this scary thought ""is this a just phase?"" Because I really want to be the other gender but there is always that thought that I might regret it when i'm older like later in my twenties.
>DYSPHORIA DISGUISES ITSELF AS OTHER CONDITIONS.

I've had anxiety symptoms for about a year and i never knew why, until about a month ago

Which coincidently was when i started to accept myself for who i am

&#x200B;

Still learning so much, but i know myself pretty well, and am proud of who i am.

&#x200B;

and the whole doubts thing, i get doubts quite a lot so seeing this post was quite reassuring :)
I was having doubts but somebody sent me this post and I did some reflection. To say the least I’ve definitely had some obvious signs such as literally cross dressing when I was younger and I could get away with it, idk if this confirms anything but ima try to get my hands on femme clothing and just see where that takes me
This is going to help so many people. Actually it has helped me when you stated that being anxious about being the opposite gender doesn’t mean that you’re not trans it just means you could be scared. I’ve been feeling a lot of anxiety about becoming a boy and I’ve been linking it with the fact that I’m scared to show my family who I am. Thank you friend
Im still scared and confuzzled, lads
Cis people don't spend time on this sub relating to the content.
exactly!!!
Yes, we do. All the time. Then we move on.
YESS!! and that's the moments we live for!!
YES! YES! AND YES! Though on the flip side, don't ever feel pressured to fit yourself into a label just because you once thought you were that, no one deserves to put that much pressure on themselves  😘
Who puts themselves through the agony of coming out trans for the sake of being trendy? No one! People are coming out more because we actually feel safe. If id have felt safe in 1996, I'd have been wearing dresses in pre school!
No problem, and this was a little self-validating for myself too, so if you ever wanna vent just message me personally and i'll listen xo
Love those moments!! Like where its so hard to sleep because you're so excited to wake up the next day and present as your true gender, its so special. Being trans is always betrayed as being a really horrible thing in the media but there's so many happy moments like that so I just can't relate 😭
Haha that's fine too! Just because you don't experience everything I typed out that doesn't make you any less valid either 💗💗
same i really just didn’t like how i looked lmao
Okay sooo, i totally see where you're coming from!! but i also think that we should still include those who are questioning because well, two reasons primarily: a. thats what the Q in LGBTQ+ stands for, and b. they are still going to be facing issues which we face. i mean if you're questioning your gender that means you're going to be tackling with understanding dysphoria/euphoria and what gender actually *means.* I understand what you mean though, i'm gonna be more careful in the future i think.
Making changes to your gender identity and appearance that dont require a big commitment so you can see and experiment with what youre comfortable with. They can be things like getting a new hairstyle, wearing the clothes of your gender occasionally, changing your name on the internet, etc.
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
hahah, depression is also a symptom of dysphoria so it could be both, but if you relate to other symptoms it's very likely dysphoria.
From what I'm aware, this is not normal behaviour for cis people. But I don't know. My advice is to use FaceApp to see how you luck as the opposite sex, see how it makes you feel if you were to be seen like that everyday. Also expiriment with wigs and women's clothing. If it makes you feel really good inside, chances are you're trans. but, that still won't stop that nagging feeling, it'll only suppress it. good luck xx
That's where you're wrong! 
  
I check Egg_IRL every day for new relatable content and I'm cis as hell! 
  
Checkmate. 
  
Wait. 
  
Oh god.
uh... \*looks both ways\*
Around this time, 96-99 my mum asked me one night if I wanted to be a girl (there were some signs) ... I said no, chances are if things were more like today and I felt the rest of my family to be accepting my answer might have been different.
for real though. those who think transitioning is trendy.... have no freakin' idea how scary it is, and just how much privilege as a *human* you lose.

the best quote i've read on a subreddit regarding this is... we spend so much of our time and money transitioning into the bottom of the social hierarchy.

trendy... lmfao.
Internalized homophobia to a degree. In our culture feminine for a male is synonymous with being gay. And yeahhhhh culture sorta teaches us to avoid being marginalized if possibly. It’s like in the back of our minds. I know that sex and gender are completely different but yeah I dunno. Would we have so many people transitioning if we just lived in a society that wasn’t so vindictive towards men expressing femininity? I feel like once your trans you have more permission to do what you want. I’m certainly not cis, but does that mean I need HRT? I’m kinda okay with being in the middle when I want and passing as a soft male most the time. As long as I can mostly pass when I choose to express and dress.
mmhmm I totally agree! questioning people are valid and belong with us! their problems are our problems. my point was just, it's okay if those people stop questioning because they've arrived at the conclusion that they're cis/straight. we shouldn't make the case that a ""true cis person"" wouldn't question their gender, and that doing so makes you trans. glad you agree with me!
Ah ok, thanks!
Ok thx for the assurance. Now all I gotta do is not get caught by my mom.
haha same... errr... shit.
That could very well be it for you. However, it's important not to dismiss the trans experience as internalized homophobia, as it could give phobes a weapon to dismiss how we feel and who we are. If you are okay without HRT, there's no rush to. You can go as far as you feel you want to, and assign yourself any label/pronoun you want. good luck xxxx
ohh okay yeah I might edit my post, u make good points :)
cool! nice talking to you friend :)"	m6mzw3	trans	493	0.99	2021-03-16 23:55:33
Can I be trans without massive mental problems?	"hey \^\^

***I have the following problem after my last therapy session:***

My therapist doesn't wanna write my indication letter *(I'm from Germany, so I need this to legally get on hrt)* herself but rather wants me to get a second opinion by another therapist. As a reason she stated that my problem wasn't that of other trans people she had as patients and that she's unsure I'm even trans and not just a feminine guy.

Her usual patients are apparently very mentally unstable and can't keep a job or anything because of mental problems and I seem to be fine. I got a good job, moved into a new flat and got a fairly healthy social life. I have some dysphoria but it's not a life controlling amount, some days I can't get anything done because of it but most days I'm fine.

***She also said that I seem to have more of a social problem rather than the usual body problem.***

I'm okay with my body apart from my crotch and chest area, according to my friends I can pass pretty well with makeup, fake boobs and tucking. I've been voice training for about a half a year now and my voice is not that far away from passing too. I seem to have naturally low testosterone so I got pretty lucky with genetics here.

I get massive dysphoria though when I go through the trouble of doing my makeup, finding clothes that look good on me, styling my wig and then still getting misgendered and deadnamed by my friends. It isn't as bad when I'm boymoding.

So did I just get lucky with my genetics or am I faking being trans because that's more socially accepted than feminine boys?"	"A cardinal rule of appropriate therapy is that the therapist not insist on their interpretation of reality versus the patient. That is improper use of clinical authority. Your therapist is bullying you into questioning reality: this is gaslighting. Terminate the relationship. Also, remember, therapists can have anxiety too. **A practitioner's own anxiety is usually the root of a refused letter, not a conviction about you or the truthfulness of your trans identity.** You are welcome to ask your therapist: ""I am confused. What is the threat that is preventing you from writing this letter for me?"" (ask in a calm, curious, playful, and polite tone and politely excuse yourself from the exchange if you feel yourself growing angry or losing control or if she starts gaslighting you: ""Thank you for the information/your opinion"" is a good stock response, and you can repeat it until she backs down). **Do not apologize or say sorry during this exchange!** See what she says and how she reacts! This person is a paid service provider, not an unquestionable god and if she can't handle that question skillfully then...ummmm...not to be reductionist but she may be a suboptimal or substandard therapist. I have met many professionals who are doctoral level (PsyD, PhD, MD) who are suboptimal, especially behind closed doors. **Do not blame yourself or start questioning yourself, people are generally self-motivated.** Good luck!
Hey there! Im so sorry, you should definetly seek another therapist because your current one is heavily transphobic.

An Indikation for hormones in germany can be issued in the first session, there are no requirements. Among therapists who actually know their stuff its more of a formality than anything else, YOU decide whether or not your trans and what you want to do with your body
You don't need dysphoria or to want to change your body to be trans, your therapist is very ignorant. A feminine boy will still want to be a boy, usually with strong certainty
there are a lot of us in stable jobs, in good living conditions :) 

&#x200B;

change your therapist.

&#x200B;

(Plus the indikation letter is not a legal thing, more a thing, that doctors want to be save for regress, technically all doctors can prescribe HRT on private base (except dentists))
Why be a feminine boy unless you WANTto be one? If you were marooned on an island  with only you for ever,  what would you like to be?
Nah, you're trans if you want to be.

Gender is arbitrary, there is no medical approach that'll work 100% of the time. The fact that you would seek out HRT in the first place or even try to pass as a woman ever is good enough reason for me to believe you're trans.
So, people are very complex, and a therapist should understand that. Its certianly not uncommon for trans people to have mental health issues, however it is not necessarily a requirement, and the severity levels vary. I myself am trans, and have some pretty complicated mental health issues, but I go to school, in the summer I keep a job, and while I struggle to do these things and go about daily life, I find myself having the ability to still do them. In a similar vein, therapists have doubted my depression because of the reasons I have listed. 

But people do not fit into models, and while these models can be useful for diagnosis purposes, they should never be absolute. You and your journey is valid, no matter what. However that does not help much in your situation. I don't know much about German trans laws, but I do know that getting a second therapists opinion has been nothing but beneficial to me for other mental health reasons.
Yes you can. If your therapist thinks you need serious mental problems in order to be trans, you should get a new one.
Wait, what? Do you have to be mentally ill to be trans? That sounds a little transfobic, in my opinion.
That’s ridiculous. If you yourself are concerned about actually being trans that’s one thing that you should be checking out Yourself! Not something that a doctor tells you. I also know many people here in America who have or had terrible dysphoria, body and social, who were able to keep a brave face and be functional despite their struggle. It’s absurd to say that you can’t be trans because your life hasn’t been torn apart.
Yeah you can be trans without massive mental problems.

To be fair I didn’t think I had problems until I started peeling away maladaptive coping mechanisms…
Not all trans people are going to experience being trans the same way. If a therapist doesn’t understand that they should not be involved in gender affirming care.
There is no set requirement to be anyone. Be the person you want to be. It’s unfortunate that most people can’t be who they are, but don’t tear yourself down. Build yourself up and help others build their own confidence as we all need someone who is willing to reassure the truth. You matter, you’re a beautiful person, and you’re supported in this lovely community. Live by the sage words of Mister Rogers “won’t you be my neighbor?”
Yes. Most mental issues that trans people experience are tied to their experience with how others treat them in base of how they perceive them.
wow thats just, straight up terrible transphobia... wow
Sounds like your therapist is just a little ignorant. Yes, you can be trans without massive mental problems. In fact most of the time they prefer you to be some measure of mentally stable when you start HRT.
I wonder how many more years this fucking gatekeeper mentality will be in place. I think anyone that can show they are mentally stable and properly informed as they make the decision to change their gender it should be allowed to receive care affirming their desired gender. It's sad that this therapist seems to indicate you have to be on the brink of suicide or unable to conduct day-to-day life unless you had affirming care in order to move forward. All that does is put stress on people that happen to be fortunate enough to be managing OK (for the time being) until they are able to begin gender affirming steps.
I'm in America so not sure if this is super helpful, but the APA specifically recommends against the kind of gatekeeping your therapist is doing. This is called transmedicalism and the quote from the APA speaking against this ideology is,""TGNC identities can be healthy and self-affirming and are not inherently pathological"". Gender dysphoria is a pathology and is therefore not inherent to being transgender.
This is bull:
She still follow the Benjamin scall that is outdated on scientific publications.

For an history on trans classification:

[here](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)

(I know it take the DSM as an example (damn AmeriKan) but the international science consensus go in the same way).

To be simple: you don't have to be textbook dysphoric to be trans, mild or no symptoms are enough if you identify differently as your AGAB: you are trans, period.
not all trans people are the same. your therapist cannot hold a view of ""all trans people are unstable because they are trans"" because it is not true.

edit: typo
Es tut mir mega Leid für dich. Ein Tip hätte ich da für dich selbst ""nicht spezialisierte"" Therapeuten können dir eine Indikation ausschreiben lassen. Das habe ich bei meiner damaligen Therepeuten gefragt ""für einen Freund"". Vorallem in einem Umkreis von 100km müssten welche da sein. (Aber guck das sie dementsprechend nicht konservativ eingestellt sind bzgl deiner Indentität)
Ich selber bin erst am 1. Schritt ein Überweisung zu bekommen von meinem HA für einen Psychotherapeuten. Und ich hab auch diese Angst die du teilst nicht eine Indikation zu bekommen und das noch länger hinauszuzögern. 

Ps. I saved this post and Ill translate it later because Im not at Home right now
I’m just gonna say trust your gut, it knows you better than yourself. I don’t have any serious mental illness and I started my HRT while graduating from university and I landed a great job. My point is that being trans is not related to sever mental Illness and being a failure and unemployed. Follow your gut, you won’t be disappointed!
You absolutely can. I am so sick of this medical gatekeeping. Someone needs to tell these doctors that it's not the 70s any more. 

There's this narrative that only the deeply broken would be trans; only someone profoundly warped in the mind would choose this horrific life. It's transphobic bullshit. People aren't emotionally unhealthy because they're trans, they're emotionally unhealthy because the world treats them like garbage for being trans. The more trans people receive support from society at large, the fewer traumatized trans people there will be. 

Your doctor is working from outdated information, and clearly has some biases to overcome if they're going to be treating trans patients. If they wait for dysphoria to destroy your life before they offer treatment, then what's the point of the damn treatment? You have dysphoria. That's enough. 

As to whether you might just be a feminine guy,

         ""I'm okay with my body apart from my crotch and.          
         chest area""

 If you were just a feminine guy, you probably wouldn't feel that way. 

I'm sorry this antiquated nonsense is standing in your way. Hopefully your second opinion will be less hidebound and you can get that letter signed. 

Good luck! 💕
Your therapist is a dummkopf. Get estradiol and spiro from the internet.
She is transphobic and gatekeeping.

She doesn't have your best interest at heart, she wants you to be so distressed by dysphoria that you can't function in the world, before she will say that you are trans.

She got into her line of work to hurt people and keep functioning trans people from being able to access appropriate medical care.
I had a similar situation to you. I got 2 therapists, worked out great in the long run. I think you’re trans. And your therapist could just be new and inexperienced or something? Or she’s just stubborn
This whole ""more socially accepted than feminine boys"" angle is pure fucking cancer. Neither is socially accepted to any extent that makes ""more"" or ""less"" carry any weight, and it's literally always people who are gonna hate you either way saying, ""I'd rather call you a f____t than a t____y""

Doesn't really help your situation but this is what goes through my head every time I have this ""alternative"" presented to me by ""well-meaning but critical"" people. It's just not even close to a valid argument and if I heard it from a therapist I'd be reporting her ass to the oversight board for wasting my precious therapy time.
I had a good job and a nice car and had my shit together when I transitioned. The correlation between trans and being unstable seems kinda bigoted.
You dont need dysphoria or some kind of trauma. As long as you have a genuine want to be a gender other than your originally assigned one your trans
Hi I also live in Germany. I moved to Germany last year and I started therapy as soon as I had insurance.
I also have no mental health issues at all. I’ve never been depressed or had any anxiety or other common mental health issues allot of trans people experience.
My therapist had no problem writing my indication, I think you should just look for a different therapist.
Also if you just want to get a “Gutachten” done anyways, it will be beneficial for your “Namens- und Personenstandsänderung” if you plan on doing that. You are required to have 2 of those. I know they are currently talking about changing it to where you don’t need them anymore, but it will probably take a while for it to pass.
If by chance we live in the same area, I could give you my therapist’s information. 
Also if you are wanting to start HRT it sounds to me that you are sure about you being transgender. You should never have to “prove” to you therapist that you are trans, that’s just wrong on so many levels.
One of the biggest differences between something that is and isn’t a mental disorder in the DSM, is that the condition must cause distress and persist more than six weeks I believe.

Let’s reframe this through the lens of homosexuality. Someone who likes the same sex and doesn’t struggle wouldn’t have a disorder but would still be gay. Another person who likes the same sex but struggles massively with it because of societal values possibly would have a disorder. Both people are still gay, Just as two trans people one who struggles and one who doesn’t are both still trans. 

Its up to you to decide if your truly trans and if transitioning is a journey you want to go on :) hell i would even argue that your would still be trans and valid even if you never transitioned.
Yeah, crippling inability to function is definately not a requirement to be trans.

We're people like anybody else.
Don't question who you are because others don't want to accept you ❤️
Actually sometimes its the other way around, and they wont recoginize your transness bc you have other issues and they think that maybe they are causing your bad feelings. I feel like you cant win if someone else gets to decide if your trans or not.
That therapy is supposed to be assessing you for gender dysphoria which as a trans person you do have so that is very strange. Is it possible for you to get a second opinion from a different therapist?
Yes, you can. Get a new therapist.
I've struggled a lot in my life and being trans is only a small fraction of that struggle. I have ADHD, bipolar, massive amounts trauma and PTSD, anxiety, etc. Since transitioning my social anxiety and general discomfort with myself and my body have all but disappeared. It didn't magically erase everything, but it made dealing with the other shit much more manageable.

Transitioning should always be measured by how you feel about yourself after rather than how you feel before. If that doctor looked at me she may think I'm not really trans because I no longer hate myself and I'm much laxer with my identity and pronouns than I was when I first transitioned. In reality I've just reached a point where I hardly think about being trans anymore, and if I do it's not as this unbearable medical condition.

Now it's pretty much just one my traits. Y'know, _I like pizza, coffee, and I'm trans._ Honestly I wish I'd felt that way from the start. Being trans doesn't need to be debilitating for you to want to transition.
I am trans and I don’t have any mental illnesses
I’m like you where I don’t have very many mental problems and i can totally handle myself, but trust me, I am definitely trans.
Yes.

Source: me. It's a noted overlap (though I suspect this is in part trans peoples' willingness to self-examine and see mental issues as well) but there's no requirement.
Dysphoria is different for everyone some people don't even realize they have it as they have other issues that need adressed as well, such as depression and anxiety that may have been caused by dysphoria or may not be.

So the awnser is yes. If you plan to start hrt you should definitely think it over though, decide if you want to do this and if you turn out to be wrong, do you feel you could handle it.
I think getting a second opinion is the best thing to do. Therapists are just people too so maybe shes not sure what's the right thing to do in your case.
Ok, so I’m from Germany myself and no you don’t need to be a complete mental wreck to be trans, of course.
You seem to have a fair amount of problems/dysphoria regardless and it is, even though others might be worse of than you, still not something to be overlooked.
I’m fairly new to all of this (about 1,5 years now) but I experienced something similar with a Klinik I went to.
So I went there because I also have my fair share of mental problems and they didn’t really accept me as trans because apparently I didn’t conformed to the guidelines they have(?).
So maybe it’s that, again I’m not that far yet and haven’t been at the point of getting an indication letter.
It sucks though, only because you feel better than the other patients that you get written of as “not trans” even though you have dysphoria, at least from what I can gather, and when you ask yourself if you’re faking something you most likely aren’t.
So, I know this wasn’t that helpful, but I hope I could help a little bit.
The therapist problem is made worse by the fact that a lot of trans people fear being prevented from transitioning, and tailor the experiences they share with therapists in order to get through the gatekeeping process. So when someone like you comes by, who is very much within the typical variation of experience that trans people have, but doesn't try to conform, they can get worried.
So i went without help for my mental health issues for way to long because i had good grades and was doing okay. I finally got help after completely breaking down and being suicidal for 2 years. After getting help i realized how much i was suffering before.

I am doing so much better now and that is what allowed me to realize that i am a trans men. I could survive living as a women somehow but i learned form my last experience.**You don´t need to suffer in order to earn your identity or to prove you actually have a problem.** I knew i was not fine before my environment knew and i should have trusted myself to know myself better than other people.

I think everyone is different and you seem to have some advantages that her other patients might not have had like an supportive friends.

Also when my parents misgendered me before coming out it was okay but afterwards it made me feel horrible. Luckily they have adjusted by now and use my new name and pronouns.

Also faking is something you do on purpose and you know when you do it. You could be wrong about your identity, but that is something you know better than anyone else. Is being feminine the only thing you care about when it comes to being trans? Would you be fine with your agab if you could be feminine?
It’s time to be forward to your therapist.Tell them you find it insulting that they called you a femboy and this will be the last session unless they write you a letter for hrt. “ you’ve wasted my money and my time that I could have actually used to get real help for my gender dysphoria”
She's sadly a bit uninformed. There's ALL kinda of ways to be trans. Some doesn't function at at all, while some function very well. Your therapist SHOULD know this. It's like someone says ""all people with autism is the same way"". Simply NO.
See, this is \*exactly\* the problem with treating gender dysphoria as a mental disease.

Apparently, you're not ""crazy"" enough to warrant therapy, never mind what \*you\* want.

But what if you were a cis woman, and didn't feel woman enough because, in your opinion, your breasts are too small? Then no one would argue ""Well, see, your breasts aren't small enough to warrant surgery"". No one would say ""Nope, no breast augmentation for you, you look fine! You're so pretty already!"".

Or what if you're a man and are balding and feel less of a man because of that? No one would say, ""See, you're not bald enough to get treatment"". No one would stop you from getting hair implants.

Or suppose you're a man and had a problem getting erections. Would anyone say ""Sure, but do you really need them anyway? You're not married and don't have a girlfriend, so why do you want erections?"" and bar you from getting Viagra?

So why is it OK for a doctor to go ""I don't think you're suffering enough, so I'm going to withhold treatment from you"" when you're trans?

So yeah, find another doctor, ASAP.
Weird the therapist knows what's wrong with your body than you do

How did they get that technology?

Are they gods?

 There are some people that shouldn't be medical professionals because they refuse to listen to the patients and think they know what's best without listening to what the problem is

Find a new therapist
Maybe it’s better to think of socially and medically transitioning as a choice one makes rather than a fixed “identity” ie something you “are” or “aren’t”. I would be deeply skeptical of those who tell you your therapist is bad for you for not encouraging transition. A therapist is there to help you determine what is true for you and decide with you what the best course of action for supporting your health. Transition isn’t “free”. There are social, mental, physical risks and costs associated with it and it’s NOT a panacea for your suffering. It makes sense for a therapist to help you turn over every stone in your psyche before encouraging transition. Be understanding of that. Beware of those telling you what to do or how to think because they’re trying to justify how they’re living their lives.
Yall are giving OP good advice and stuff and im just sitting here like 'Well that son of a dick face people can be metally stable""
My therapist specializes on trans people and she was the only one in a 100km radius from me that didn't have a year or longer waiting time.

I had my first session about a year ago while I was still questioning, so I got there in order to find out if I'm trans. Maybe she still has that image of my in her head instead of my current self.

She said I needed to do 12 therapy sessions and get the indication letter otherwise the endocrinologist will be able to deny me hrt.
From what i heard it usually takes 6 months to get the indication.

But i agree this therapist does not seem to be good. Her arguments reminds of the things people with adhd hear when they have good grades or can keep a job. It is weird how some therapist don´t realize that not everyone has to be exactly the same.
This might seem a bit self serving I'm sorry, but I'm also German and have genuinely no clue where and how to get to hrt, should I look for therapists 'specialized' in lgbt problems, does any therapist theoreticaly work? I looked some stuff up but couldn't really find what I'm looking for ;-;
Anyways, have a great day :)
I'm not really in a position where I can change my therapist without waiting another one or two years for hrt because the waiting times for therapists here are a year at minimum.

She said I needed 12 therapy sessions and the indication letter or the endocrinologist could deny me from getting hrt.
>Why be a feminine boy unless you WANT to be one?

I don't know, because my therapist says she sees me more as a femboy than a girl.

>If you were marooned on an island with only you for ever, what would you like to be?

A girl.
The problem with getting a second therapists opinion is that the spaces for therapists to be able to get paid by insurance companies is limited and the number of spaces haven't been changed in like 15 years.

So almost everyone looking for therapy has to wait a year or longer to get accepted by the limited number of therapists who can accept insurance parents.
Not her exact wording, but it was kind of what my therapist meant when comparing me to other patients of hers while doubting my transness
>If you yourself are concerned about actually being trans that’s one thing that you should be checking out Yourself!

I was when I started the therapy a year ago. Right now tho I'm pretty sure that this is the right way for me.
I mean I have dysphoria, I'm just very good at hiding it and staying sane at the same time.

But I wonder how long I can keep this up..
Maybe I've overreacted a little in the title  
Her exact wording was more like ""You seem fine in life, usually my patients have other problems next to being trans, you seem to have more of a social problem than one with your body, so I'm not sure and I'd like to get a second opinion""
>There's this narrative that only the deeply broken would be trans; only someone profoundly warped in the mind would choose this horrific life. 

From what I've heard from my therapist it's not a thought up narrative of hers but her experience with trans people so far, and she's specialized on gender identity problems

>I'm sorry this antiquated nonsense is standing in your way. Hopefully your second opinion will be less hidebound and you can get that letter signed.

thanks \^-\^   
I'm mostly scared that the second opinion will also deem me not trans and I'll have to go through yearlong waiting times for hrt while testosterone keeps on destroying my body.
Uhm, where would I get that?

Don't I still need to get my hormonal values monitored by a medical professional for my own safety?

And don't I have to do one year of ""official hrt"" to be eligible for srs?
>And your therapist could just be new and inexperienced or something?

She's supposed to be specialized on gender problems. 

My guess is that she's unsure because I've been with her for a year and I started therapy when I was still just questioning.
If only I could relay that want to my therapist.
Sometimes I feel like you can never win, like ever.

But yea our current system is pretty shit
I'm currently trying to but waiting lists are long in Germany.
>Is being feminine the only thing you care about when it comes to being trans? Would you be fine with your agab if you could be feminine?

I wanna be feminine, I wanna be treated like a girl by others, I wanna be called by a feminine name and she/her pronouns, I want my penis gone, I wanna have boobs of my own, I want basically every side effect hrt would give me (less muscles, softer skin, more emotions).
>Tell them you find it insulting that they called you a femboy

She didn't call me a femboy straightforward it was more like ""I think you might be more comfortable as a feminine guy rather than a trans woman""

>“ you’ve wasted my money and my time that I could have actually used to get real help for my gender dysphoria”

Atleast it was free for me because of insurance. But I won't be able to ever get the time back.
I mean just because someone ""specializes"" sadly doesn't make them trans friendly. Its so sad that there are so few spots and the wait times are so long.

The fact that she is lying to your face is what worries me. The endocrinologist will not deny your indication with 1 or 100 sessions, they barely look at the thing. I know that since I got my indication after 30 minutes in my first session. I also know that since I study psychology and work towards becoming a gender therapist myself. The indikation can be issued by everybody without any requirements, it basically just says: ""Ey yo im a therapist and this person is trans"". And clearly your therapist doesn't think youre trans, which makes her uber transphobic. It doesn't matter what she thinks, this is just about how you feel

Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful
Yea, I think we now know why she was the only one in a 100km radius who doesn't have a lot of patients. 

Saying you have to have an inability to keep a job to be trans is just ... insane.
>100km

Have you had any luck outside that radius? Seems like a pretty restrictive distance, although I admit being from a semi-rural area of USA may skew my sense of distance a bit.
Darf ich fragen, wo du bist? UKM, also Münster oder wo anders? Denn es gibt echt recht viele Therapeuten die sich darauf spezialisieren und nicht nur von den Unikliniken sind.
Yes that is true, but that is not because of some medical or legal precedent. There is no requirement for an indication, and if your therapist refuses to give you one its not because they can't, its because they dont want to. 

And the reason they don't want to usually is because they have some old, transphobic views and simply don't believe their patient is trans when they tell them they are. Just like OPs therapist, whose even lying directly into their face
hey \^\^  
I found therapists close to me by talking to the [dgti](https://dgti.org/) counselor closest to me, I wrote an email to her and we made an appointment for her to tell me what I need to do and which therapists close to me work with trans people.
the endo can deny it on any reason he wants :) A good endo takes the indication and give you HRT. And a bad endo, that makes up rules, you should leave immideatly because the chances of getting wrong hrt are enourmos
Then you’re a girl, because why eff else would you choose to be a girl if you had to be stuck on an island by yourself? I think some therapists try the “feminine guy” bit because they know full on transitioning is probably the most difficult thing you will ever do. There are more dangerous things, and more heroic things, but with the amount of time and persistence transitions takes, few can compare. Maybe a moon rocket trip or something. Just getting rid of the beard is a five year ordeal. The “feminine” guy could maybe be persuaded to cross dress on the week ends, or wear a pink shirt and some little earrings (I dunno)…

I’m Older, granted, but I went in with the assumption I’d never fully pass, and I would not have sex with anyone ever again. And that I might live alone with my dogs for the rest of my life. I still did it. I am not suggesting that as anyone’s criteria, but keep in mind that that prospect is possible. I’m enjoying my life right now, I like my clothes, they are always clean and look nice. I am always clean, witH good hygiene, I don’t leave the house without my hair groomed, a bit of makeup and perfume. I feel better about being in groups of people even if I don’t pass. My way of interacting with people suits my gender now. Best wishes, R
Ah, well that's hella shitty. I'm honestly not sure what your options are, maybe there are organizations that help with that stuff? Other then that, I just wish you good luck.
Than it’s completely up to you! Don’t allow someone else to dictate what you want or need.
I donno. Different for everyone. I sincerely was doing fine until I wasn’t. Had to muck around in some scary mental health problems and sort myself out, deal with trauma I didn’t even know existed, honestly took the pandemic and shut down for me to slow down long enough to not disassociate through existence to notice the problems.
Blood values can get monitored by any medical professional, my family doctor is doing this in my case, also there are free labs you can go and let you blood check there.
no, look into the BGA (Begutachtungsrichtlinien des Medizinischen Dienstes der Krankenkassen), for SRS in Germany you only need 12 therapy sessions in at least 6 months, 1 year of being out in daily life (what counts as this is decided only by your therapist as they confirm that)

&#x200B;

Look in r/germantrans there is a post with all conditions pinned
Overseas pharmacies like AllDayChemist and InHousePharmacy. You skip the page where it asks for your prescription, and they look the other way. Sublingual estradiol tablets and spironolactone are what I get from my doctor here in the US. 50 spiro twice a day, 2mg thrice a day. The first few months were 2mg/day, the next few months were 4mg/day. Most of my dosage was decided by feeling. Your body knows when the estro is working, and when it's time to adjust dosage. Also, lab work can be done anywhere for any reason.
I don't know if you would be rejected for SRS over unofficial HRT, but I'd be mad as hell if they refused. Your therapist is an absolute jackass.
Your therapist is old and backward as well as transphobic, I'd complain to the governing body of therapists that she is not suitable for trans patients as well as transphobic and working from outdated standards
Yea, I feel like transgender therapy should be to aid the person, not to judge if they can transition. Who are they to stop a person from changing their own body. Such a thing inevitably becomes a political thing as well. (makes you dependent on the view of the random psychologist that you end up with, or whatever the definitions are that have been made)
They’re long in the US too but yeah I think getting a new therapist would be a good idea. And to let them know right away on the first day that you’re there to talk about gender dysphoria
i know some feminine guys and this is not something i have heard from them ever.

What you are describing sounds like you are a woman/girl and want others to recognize that and your body to reflect that.
Just tell her to give you the letter, that you feel insulted by her insinuating that you're not a girl and that you will be making a complaint against her
>Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful

I mean what else am I supposed to do? She predicted I might get hrt by January if the second opinion has time for the indication until then.

In December, when I searched for therapists in a 100km radius to me, the next-shortest waiting time would've been until mid 2023.

If I need to wait another 2 years for hrt, I can't guarantee I'll still be stable enough to not off myself
>Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful

Depending on what version of the DSM she's using, ""clinically significant distress"" can be listed an exclusionary criteria...it's an issue I've run up against.

Which honestly I think is bullshit; just because dysphoria isn't interrupting basic executive function doesn't mean it's not a problem for the person...
It's rather because she has no waiting list an I called her at the right time

She didn't say that trans people couldn't hold a job but she rather said that I'm suprisingly stable in comparison to other trans patients of hers.
I just didn't know how to word it better in English.
Koblenz, hatte bis jetzt Therapeuten angefragt bis Trier und Bonn
This is huge, tysm! :D
Well, my house doctor is now over an hour away from me since I moved and I heard that finding a new doctor is really difficult because they're terribly overrun and don't like taking new patients.

Also it involves calling people >\~< Because most of this fucking country hasn't discovered emails yet.
Despite seeing a doctor for HRT, I am still very likely to get an estrogen-sensitive cancer in 20-30 years based on my genes. I still chose the estrogen. A life with an unbalanced endocrine system is a half-life. A life without estrogen is how Karens are born. Without estrogen, us women metamorphose into unrecognizable lycanthropic mawbeasts from hell.
Yea, I got to this one unsure of myself to explore my gender.  
Maybe she still sees me like that and is unsure because of that
I don't really feel like a feminine guy either. I'd rather just have myself replaced by a girl.

Plus I need to be deemed trans for half the things I listed like hrt or srs.  
If I didn't need to be trans for that I couldn't care less about the label people gave me.
Yea i don't know its a tough situation im so sorry. Its completly up to you how you handle this, shes taking away your dignity but i think if you get HRT in the end i guess who cares.

I am just worried, shes clearly not trustable so like who knows what happens in january even with a ""second opininon"". Have you tried just getting an appointment with a psychiatrist without going into permanent therapy there? When its just a one time thing they can sometimes give you some time much earlier than the waitlists. Also if its only a one or two time thing you can look much further away than your usual search radius
I would classify a desire to transition that is so strong that denial of transition gives you suicidal thoughts as definitly and obviously ""distressed enough"". If your therapist is aware of this and still feels like you're not ""trans enough"" just because you're able to function most of the time, that therapist is either stupid or - more likely - just a bad person and worse therapist. Like, come on. From what you've said you've allready started socially transitioning, that's not a cis person thing to do, wtf to that therapist.

I don't know your exact situation, obviously, but I would try to impress on her how much hrt means to you and you deserve to get it one last time (it sucks that this is necessary, but so it goes). If that doesn't work, drop that therapist like a hot potato and try again with someone else. Also sucks, but again, so it goes.

Research the actual laws for hrt (I get that this is super hard, there is barely any good, current information out there, but I think many people in this comment thread are allready sharing accurate information). I can only compare to how it is in Austria, and here you can get hrt pretty quickly, _especially_ if you're allready socially transitioning.

Good luck <3
Have a look at the list of therapists on the website Transmann e.V. (despite the name, it's not just for trans men). Some of them do remote appointments, I got my Indikationsschreiben about a week after emailing a therapist (making it clear I only wanted the Indikation, not ongoing therapy) from that list. It was a single 30 minute zoom call after which I had the indikation. I'm not sure what it's like if you're in a different state from the therapist, but you may have some luck looking near large cities, like Berlin.
Being so dysphoric you'd want to off yourself isn't enough for her to see you're under stress?
Just for the record, statements like “I won’t be stable in 2 years without hrt” and “there are ‘only’ some days where dysphoria is incapacitating” don’t strike me as particularly light dysphoria. Not that it’s strictly needed to transition anyways.
well yes ofc theres still alot of transphobia in the diagnostic manuals, but thats why someone labelled a ""trans specialist"" should know better. I could forgive this if it was just some uneducated therapist who just looked up gender dysphoria for the first time, but not someone who gets trans clients referred directly to them. Disgraceful
Utter billshit that is. None of my trans friends here have any major problems that would keep them out of work or school?

And the reason you got in quickly is that she sucks and loses patients all the time. So obviously new spots open up every week if she‘s this bad at her job.


The fuck? Whether you have other psychological conditions is completely irrelevant as to your gender dysphoria.


And you clearly list dysphoria caused by your body anyway.


And you don‘t even need bloody dysphoria to be trans in the first place.


That‘s such an outdated backwards gatekeeping bullshit she‘s spouting.


Try finding a Gyn etc prescribing hormones via private prescription in the meantime and start looking for s therapist that‘s fit to practice afterwards.


It‘s utter bullshit she‘s placed in front of you.


Also theres is the Germantrans subreddit as well :)
googling for labs? I can only give you the adress from one in Bochum, but no clue, where you live.
>Despite seeing a doctor for HRT, I am still very likely to get an estrogen-sensitive cancer in 20-30 years based on my genes. I still chose the estrogen.

Same. For some time now I said I'd rather die to cancer as a 35yo woman than to old age as a 70yo man.
>Have you tried just getting an appointment with a psychiatrist without going into permanent therapy there?

Don't I need to still do 12 sessions of therapy for the endocrinologist first?  
And isn't it better to still have a therapist who's there for you after you started hrt?
>From what you've said you've allready started socially transitioning, that's not a cis person thing to do, wtf to that therapist.

Well, I've been out everywhere except work for some months now. And that only because I want to wait for hrt before outing myself at work. The only reason I don't girlmode daily is because doing my makeup to the point of actually passing takes far too long and wigs are kinda uncomfortable.

>Research the actual laws for hrt (I get that this is super hard, there is barely any good, current information out there, but I think many people in this comment thread are allready sharing accurate information). I can only compare to how it is in Austria, and here you can get hrt pretty quickly, especially if you're allready socially transitioning.

I've been told by my therapist and by the dgti representative that I needed to do 12 mandatory therapy sessions and depending on the endo I might need to do a year of openly living as a woman without hrt.

Also therapists slots to be able to bill insurance companies are limited and the number has been the same for like 15 years. Which is why the wait times are so horrendously long
No, it's fine  
I just wanted to complain that I have to get on the phone and call people
Absolute Queen.
Like i said, the 12 sessions of therapy thing is a lie. If you want 12 sessions to feel comfortable with everything thats completly fine and up to you, but you are not required to do that.

  
The Endo just wants the indication letter, and that letter can be written at any point, by anyone with a degree working in the field of psychology. I made an appointment two weeks before, got my indication in one hour, and went to the endocrinologist the same day. You are being medically gatekept and gaslighted

&#x200B;

>  
\>And isn't it better to still have a therapist who's there for you after you started hrt?<  


I think thats up to you and at what point in your life and transition you are. Having a therapist thats there for you is always a plus, but only if they are on your side
My doctor just referred me to an endocrinologist because my testosterone levels were so low and estrogen was so high. Apparently it’s to do with my pituitary gland, but I’ve always known I’m trans since I was around 6/7 years old
Oh geez. I'm sorry that really sucks. I guess my advice of insisting harder with your current therapist still stands though. Good luck <3 you'll get there
So you're telling me I could've been on hrt for the last year?  
I'm gonna go to the toilet at work now, cry my eyes out, and then go back to acting like it doesn't phase me.
>but I’ve always known I’m trans since I was around 6/7 years old

Me too but I never knew how to read the signs
Nooooo don't 😢!! That time isn't wasted, on the contrary, i think if you talk to a therapist/psychiatrist who isn't transphobic the way you described your identity to us here, i have no doubt youll get your indication and hrt in no time. I still got super lucky, but thats because our system is fucked up and rigged. I just want you to know that what youre experiencing is def not proper procedure

Okay heres what you do: Don't ditch your therapist right away, but just give as many psychiatrists on [https://queermed-deutschland.de/](https://queermed-deutschland.de/) (if you have trouble navigating the website just ask) a ring as you can, describe your situation and just say that after youve been in therapy already for a while, you want an indication. Dont make a big deal out of it. One of them will give you an appointment.

Im sorry youre hurting, but i cant stand transphobic therapists acting like they have authority over you. You deserve so much better, everything will be fine❤️❤️
Neither did I, until I went to secondary school, and began wondering I would rather sit around with the girls and play when I was in my infant and junior schools. But you try to just shrug it off thinking it’s normal right? If you hang out with the girls one of them might get to like you. Then I realised it’s not just a girl meets boy thing but hang on, somethings not quite right! I couldn’t wait to get home from school and go get my sisters underwear out and put it on then to my mum’s drawer to get her forms, but after leaving school I fought and fought the girly thing, buried it deep inside but every now and then it would raise it’s ugly head and I’de be back to square one. I now have 3 divorces under my belt and my dysphoria is stronger than it’s ever been, every day I get up to have to get dressed up, problem is I’m still closeted. Went to the doctor and spoke to about my inabilities and he just referred me to an endocrinologist saying my pituitary gland is showing as producing more oestrogen than testosterone. We’ll see what happens on October 3rd and my appointment!
>Nooooo don't 😢!! That time isn't wasted

Let's be real with ourselves, like the last 20 years of my life were wasted, but there's nothing I can realistically do about it so it's fine I guess.

>Okay heres what you do: Don't ditch your therapist right away, but just give as many psychiatrists on https://queermed-deutschland.de/ (if you have trouble navigating the website just ask) a ring as you can, describe your situation and just say that after youve been in therapy already for a while, you want an indication. Dont make a big deal out of it. One of them will give you an appointment.

But calling up people is bad enough as it is >\~<. Only the thought of having to call someone makes my palms sweat. And then there's these terrible office hours most therapists have which make them basically unreachable without taking a day of work.

I fear that the endocrinologist my therapist recommended to me might be one of the bad ones. But they're the only one I can find for Rheinland-Pfalz on the site you sent.

You think I'm good or should I rather try ones further away from me?
>But calling up people is bad enough as it is >\~<

Yea i feel that, i mean I couldnt do that either i legit had to go get my mom to make calls since i was out of mental energy after maybe two. If you got someone close to you that wants to help that could be handy! But yeah phone is torture i wish there was a different way. Just emalis and writing takes too long or you never get a response
Maybe you could ask a friend or someone you trust to make those calls for you?   


And yeah, it must be really frustrating that after all this time you've been lied to and could have progressed much sooner than you though. The thing is, now that you know better, you actually CAN progress earlier than what you thought earlier, and that is a positive, right?
I get you on the whole phone phobia thing, it’s why I didn’t make a doctors appointment for like 6 months🫠
Give this one a shot first, you never know! And if that one doesn't work out then try others. You can even make appointment with other ones in advance and cancel if the first one turns out fine to speed up the process
I don't think I can progress any earlier than right now. I have the earliest free appointment with the endocrinologist already. I just need to get an indication until december
How would I tell if that one's good?  
I don't know anything about hormones, he could tell me anything lol
Ohje also ich hab daheim in Rheinland-Pfalz ( da komm ich auch her kleine Welt, aber eher bei Landau) auch niemanden gefunden damals. Bin dann immer nach München gefahren extra für die HRT, bei Medicover.

Es ist zwar echt unnötig und nervtötend, aber HRT ist ne Riesen Sache für dich und deinen Körper, deshalb nur zu Experten, und nur zu Leuten die transpositiv eingestellt sind. Kein Risiko eingehen und lieber ein paar Stunden fahrt und dann ist man aber in guten Händen. Da muss man am Anfang 4 Mal im Jahr hin, später 2 und dann 1 mal im Jahr das geht klar
und ich häng das hiernochmal als Kommentar hintendran, wie erkenne ich ob Endo/Arzt gut oder schlecht ist für mich als Trans Person ohne mich medizinisch auskennen zu müssen:

Green Flags:

* Sie gendern dich korrekt, oder bemühen sich zumindest darum, benutzen deinen chosen Name selbst wenn deine Dokumente noch nicht geändert sind.
* Sie gehen auf deine Bedürfnisse ein. Das bedeutet wenn du Kommentare zb zu deiner Hormondosis hast werden diese ernst genommen anstatt dass man einfach abgefertigt wird. Im Zweifelsfall kannst du immer Hormonwerte auf Reddit posten und schauen, der Hivemind hier hat mehr Ahnung und deckt auf wenn dein Endo dir nicht die richtige Dosis verschreibt
* Termine drehen sich um dein Anliegen nicht um deine Identität, das bedeutet ein Besuch beim Endo sieht zb so aus: Kurze Besprechung, Ziele festlegen bzw schauen wie man sich grade fühlt -> Blutabnehmen -> Nächster Termin machen und tschüss. 20 Minuten maximal

Wenn da in der Mitte ein Verhör eingebaut wird ob du dir auch wirklich ""sicher"" bist oder fragen als wärst du vor Gericht, dann sind wir bei den Red Flags

Red Flags:

* Invasive Fragen. Dazu gehören Fragen zu deiner Sexualität,  sexuelle Praktiken, Sexuelle Vergangenheit, deine Identität, deine Kindheit, Trauma etc. Größte Red Flag von allen.
* Gatekeeping, also das verlangen von überflüssigen ""Beweisen"", Indikation ist zumindest bei der HRT das absolute Maximum, wenn Worte wie ""Alltagstest"" oder dergleichen kommen sofort gehen. Und uns anderen Bescheid sagen
>Ohje also ich hab daheim in Rheinland-Pfalz ( da komm ich auch her kleine Welt, aber eher bei Landau) auch niemanden gefunden damals. Bin dann immer nach München gefahren extra für die HRT, bei Medicover.

Meinst du Ich sollte es dann in RLP versuchen oder eher jemand hier Empfohlenen aufsuchen?

Vielleicht kommt ja das 49€ Monatsticket, dann wäre die Fahrt zwar immernoch nervig aber wenigstens nicht mehr allzu teuer."	xc8ecz	trans	484	0.95	2022-09-12 09:39:16
I’m a transmasc who prefers fem clothing	"Edit: Woah I wasn’t expecting this to blow up :o
Thank you so much everyone! Everyone’s been so nice and supportive, and it’s so cool hearing about other people who relate! 

bit of a vent? But I need to get these feelings out somewhere

Okok, so I’m a transmasc demiboy. (I’m 16) while I don’t identify as a girl, and do experience dysphoria- weirdly feminine clothing does not make me dysphoric? In fact they make me really happy, and makes me feel confident. Imo guys clothing is really boring 

I know I’m valid, however people have invalidated my gender identity. It also sucks having to constantly explain myself to people- usually the older generation. However I do understand that usually it’s not out of malice, and they just don’t understand. So I’m happy to help educate people 

I used to wear fem clothing when I identified as non-binary, however people only saw me as a girl because of it, and that made me feel really dysphoric. So I decided it wasn’t worth it

However once I’m deep into T, and have a deeper voice/facial hair- and pass more as a dude, I think I’m gonna wear fem clothing again. With a pronoun pin ofc, to let people know I’m a dude 

I just wish clothing wasn’t gendered. imo clothing doesn’t have gender, but unfortunately the majority doesn’t see it this way.

Anyway, sorry for the longish post. Just needed to get these thoughts down somewhere"	"Assigning clothes to gender is fucking stupid to begin with. Lemme wear a dress mom
Feminine transmascs are valid and I will kick anyone who says otherwise. What clothes we like don't invalidate our genders. I don't wear makeup and that doesn't make me any less of a woman.
I am trans masc and I can love wearing feminine things! 
I sew and I’m going into fashion school and I still say that wearing a ball gown is a pure form of joy no matter your gender!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!
Fair enough man. I want to get like a variety of jackets and shirts that have my pronouns in big letters on the front and back because I'm being forced to go boy mode rn and won't be able to even start HRT until I'm away from my parents so I want something to make it very clear from a distance I'm not a man when I get the chance to start being myself even though when I do I won't pass yet
[removed]
I'm a transmasc femboy lol there's no problem with liking ""fem"" clothes they are only clothes there's no need to gender them. Have fun !
Yh, people are just jealous that fem clothes are the best clothes
We definitely exist man. And we have so many things against us. I’ve been struggling with this a lot recently
You don't owe anyone masculinity, I am also a transmasc person who mostly wears ""male"" clothes because I do find it exhausting to explain and I do lack the confidence to wear more fem clothes. But your boy just wants to wear cute skirts with a cute crop top and masc cloths doesn't offer that. Keep being you. Dress how you like! You should not have to sacrifice your comfort for other people's ignorance. Keep slaying ✨️
Presentation is not gender.

A man in a dress *is still a man*. Trans men are men. Trans men in dresses are still men.

Good on you for presenting in a way that pleases you! My trans son has reached the point where he’s decided he likes wearing skirts and dresses from time to time, and his comment was “I’m not rethinking my gender, I’m just rethinking my sense of style”
Fellow transmasc demiboy here! Yeah, fem clothes are awesome, and I have similar anxieties about getting misgendered. One thing I'm trying to tell myself is that whatever I wear is manly by default because I am a man. And since I'm not fully binary anyway, does it really matter? (It does, I know, but I hope this helps.)
I feel this 100%. The more I pass as a man, the more I want to explore my fem side. Gender is dumb, people should be able to wear whatever they want.
Trans guy here. I feel kinda similarly toward clothing. Masc clothing makes me very euphoric, but fem clothing can make me super confident too since I know I’m hot af. I’m leaning more toward masc clothes until I can get on T but think I’ll be more comfy going back to dressing a little more femininely once I’m more through my transition. Not only are you valid but you’re not alone either. Glad you have somewhere to get these thoughts down. Keep being you
honestly feminine clothing has way more choices and styles than masculine clothing and almost always looks good

but im biased bc i wanna be a girl
I feel pretty much the exact same I miss wearing fem clothing but the knowledge that I would never be seen as what I feel inside when wearing those clothes makes me really dysphoric too, I feel seen and understood ;w;
Trans-man here, I feel this so much. I wish I were bigger framed and more visibly masculine so I could were makeup and cutesy things without it guaranteeing that I would be IDed as female
Hey! I’m in the same boat as you. I like dressing fem, but it automatically pins a gender to me that I don’t like. The clothes don’t make me dysphoric, but the perception everyone has of me in them does. I’m also transmasc, but non-binary, basically a they/them femboy. I’m pre-T, so everything about my body is female. I hate it. I’m also 30, and a parent, which really doesn’t help because I’m instantly labeled as “mom”. I’m not. To my son, I’m Maddy.

Inanimate objects being gendered is so dumb.
This makes me so happy to read cause I struggle with the exact same thing I’m agender nb afab and the amount of times I have to argue with my family that wearing a dress is not a gendered thing makes me so tired they get in my head sometimes. Also how easily I get misgendered when I DO wear a dress esp cause I have a long mullet rn and it’s the first time I don’t have a buzz cut or short short hair so it’s like just a big fat real life lesson on how gender perception is so exhausting
>Imo guys clothing are really boring

Truth. as a transfemme, I can confirm guy clothes are boring AF
Im 26, and pre T. But same. But some random person on tiktik said something that I related to alot. They said : I'm masculine in the way a poptart is a ravioli. I like that. I like masc and fem alt clothes, with makeup. But I'm not a she/her person. Im they/he.(starting to lean to Trans man but I'm not in a situation where I can live openly or transition.)
Fair enough! You should check out r/ftmfemininity
Clothes are literally pieces of fabric, what defines your gender is yourself <3
I'm trans aswell fem clothes do make me uncomfortable but I think it as a femboy although I am a femboy although clothes are clothes I wish my family understood that I wanna be a boy
Also a fellow femme trans masc! I still on the occasion wear dresses and makeup but have told everyone around me that I’m doing drag or to think about it in a  make rock start wearing a dress way. It really helped it click for a lot of people around me! 
Mens fashion can be very boring, but alternative mens fashion is fun! I’m a punk rocker so it’s still easy for me to dress cool in a masculine way.
Top surgery is my most exciting part, I can wear dresses, low cut tops and blouses again! So sick of high neck and flavourless boy clothes. I love colour and patterns and pretty material and I'm so glad you have a strong understanding of how that doesn't affect identity.
I'm also a transmasc Demi-boy and even though I prefer men's clothes women's clothes are good too sometimes! 

You be your fem safe fam!

See I’m transmasc they/he but I mostly wear fem clothes. I say my gender is goth because I’m a goth and whenever I’m fully dressed up is when I feel the most euphoric. I attribute it to the fact that even the men of goth dress femininely/androgenously and are still men. Genders weird. But ur fine,dude
I understand your frustration. It's idiotic how pieces of fabric we use to cover ourselves is gendered - You should be free to wear whatever you wish.
My Mom does daycare I overheard one day there was something involving a tutu on TV I think and one of the boys she babysits asked what it was and when she explained it's for ballet (in her very conservative view of ballet) he said ""I wanna do that"" and she immediately said ""you're a boy"" and it pissed me off but since I'm financially dependent on her rn and I am an adult (it's fucking hard to move without a car) I couldn't say anything because idk if she'll kick me out or what if she realizes I'm not the cishet conservative Christian boy she thinks I am
Exactlyyyy dresses are so pretty! :o
66YO cis woman and men tee shirts are for me so I  don't get gendering clothes either.
Yeah, I might do the same with putting my pronouns on a jacket. But I wish you the best with getting away from your parents, and starting hrt :]
It soooo is. Clothes are literally just pieces of fabric?? Like?
Yeah exactly!

Also, I recommend checking out r/FTMfemininity. It definitely helps my confidence a bit; if they can do it, I can, too! :)
Oh neat! It’s always cool seeing another fellow demi. But yeah thanks! That does help :>
Yeah! I wish everyone thought this way :<
🥲
Thanks
Will do! I didn’t even know that subreddit existed :o
Demibois unite!
Stay strong, we'll build a safe world for us :)

Am I valid?	"Well, weird question I guess. I read a lot here about gender dysphoria, wanting to take hormones so badly and all...
But I don't really feel that way. I don't have gender dysphoria. I wear a binder because I want to be viewed as male on the streets from random people. But when I home, I don't mind my breast. I get euphoria when I hear someone calling me by my prefered name, when my mother calls me her son and all. I think I would like some effects from T, but not all so I don't think I wanna take it. So, am I still a valid Transman? I still had the common early sign as child, and I found a gender goal for me (which i think I can achieve without hormones or operation). I guess I am looking for some love right now."	"Yes. Of course you're valid. Our processes and ways are our own. There's not a single way of doing this. Dysphoria have a tendency to come and go. And, some feel it less and some more. Everyone just as valid ❤️
Yep, you are.
Yeah, you're fine.

The terminology is there for us to use to describe what we are, not as a mold for us to try to fit into.

Gender expression is a hugely varied thing that I don't think is the same for any two people, so by definition, anything you choose to call yourself will never be quite accurate.

Enjoy the expression that makes you happy and don't worry about fitting into anybody's idea of that a Transman or anything else is. 

Including your own!
Yup, absolutely valid. You are in control of your transition. Hormones are not required to transition.
Yooou areeee muthafuckiiing valiiiid
Of course you are valid. Dysphoria and Euphoria are signs of not being cis, but they're not requirements. Medically transitioning is also not a requirement to being trans, and while some folks are very happy with medical transition some choose not to, or to microdose.

Have you explored non-binary genders, such as nonbinary, demi-guy, gender fluid, or agender? Some trans folks identify with those gender identities, which can lead to wanting a mixture of expressions and body parts typically associated with male or female, or dysphoria/euphoria not reacting consistently to misgendering one way or the other.
I think a very important thing to keep in mind is that not only is gender dysphoria not required to be trans, but that it’s very common to not recognise gender dysphoria even when you _do_ experience it. 

Have you checked out the [gender dysphoria bible?](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) It discusses this in much more detail, different types of dysphoria, how it can go unnoticed, and how you’re still trans without it. A lot of the explicit examples it uses are more applicable to trans women or transfems, but as a transmasc person I still found it very applicable to my own experiences.
Try not to think that being trans is all about dysphoria and negativity, becuase it's also about the things that make you euphoric and proud, the things that keep you going. 

You *are* valid, and nothing you or anyone does can ever change that.

(I definitely stole that from somewhere but I have no clue where, so don't @ me)
hey i think that’s a pretty common experience!! i’ve read of so many people who seek similar results from hrt while doing my own research on E for myself :)))))
I once heard somebody say that, in their opinion, gender euphoria might be a stronger sign of being trans than gender dysphoria.

<3
You don’t have to have dysphoria to be trans, but if you read the criteria for Dysphoria in the DMS-5, you fit it. You just don’t have the discomfort part
Of course you are! I'm a transfem and I don't mind my.. area.. when I'm at home
Of course you're valid, dude.
Yall is valid
Yea your valid
Plenty of people don’t feel dysphoria. Besides you said you feel euphoria when someone uses your preferred name, there is very little that is more validating than that.
of course, it’s the euphoria that counts
cis male ally here, I'd say you're as much of a boy as i am

so yes, you're a very valid guy
yes your valid
You will always be valid, and that a fact. Don’t let anyone say you aren’t.
Dysphoria is a commonality in trans people, but it is NOT a requirement. You are valid. 💖
you are valid alot of us experience different things so you are valid
yes
Of course your valid! Not everybody has to experience crippling gender dysphoria and depression and whatnot. Sometimes people are just comfortable with their bodies the way it is! That’s perfectly okay! You are 100% valid don’t let anybody tell you different 😊💕
Yes you are still valid
Valid💜
Heck yeah! Valid and honestly I'm so happy for you! Transness is about joy, euphoria, a collective experience of coming to know who we truly are. Trans pain and dysphoria often get centred in conversations either led by or directed towards cis people who don't get why us having rights would be nice, but that's definitely not the entirety or even the biggest aspect of the trans experience as a whole
Of course you're valid. There are many people who are trans, but they feel comfortable in their bodies. Either because they weren't raised around strict gender stereotypes or just because. Being comfortable enough to not bind your chest around family is actually a good thing and it doesn't make you any less trans. If not wanting to take HRT makes you a fake trans person, we'd basically be enforcing trans stereotypes. 💀 There's no wrong or right way to be trans. If you say you're trans, you're trans. No one can invalidate you. Gender is a construct. I hope you have a great day! <3
A term often used in our community is Your mileage may vary. Granted, that's used mostly in term of hormonal changes, but I'd like to apply that here. You have no need to get any operations or take hormones to be valid. Your breasts do not make you any less of a man, and your lack of gender dysphoria in some situations does not make you any less trans. Even if you ""didn't have any signs"", the fact that you want to be seen as a man, and feel happy and comfortable when you are means that you are, in fact, a man
Ur so valid bro. Everyone's experience seems to be unique in that they all decide what feels best to them and makes them happy. My wife doesn't wanna do everything either she says.  But she seems sure in knowing what she wants medically speaking anyways. Everything else is still in the air. You decide. You're still a trans man 💙
Kinda same here. I don't have any obvious gender dysphoria-- I don't hate my penis and I do kinda like my muscles. That to be said, I do want to be a woman, I feel euphoric when people call me 'miss', and I feel completely like myself when I wear feminine clothes.

This is all completely normal. You're completely valid. There is no such thing as a 'hard bar' to be trans. Perhaps you're somewhere between a transman and a non-binary person. But it's all normal. No need to be stressed.
Absolutely!! Everyone’s goals, transition, and feelings are different, you’re experience is valid and valuable!!!
Absolutely! I had a pretty similar problem with my identity. Gender euphoria is just as valid! It's on a spectrum anyways so whatever makes you comfortable is what you are no matter what :)
i feel the exact same way!! it’s good to know there are people out there that feel the same as i do
I feel like it would be wrong to base someone’s view of their gender on weather or not they feel bad about the body they were born with and not on how they like to be called and such so I think you and the people with similar problems are completely valid! :)
Yes. You are valid!
ive heard that being trans isnt necessary about dysphoria but more about euphoria
You are absolutely valid
You are 100% valid.. i really dislike this community sometimes because of the sheer amount of people who make it sounds like you need to be suffering in order to be trans. Its true that a lot of us are suffering but it doesn't mean we should push others to feel like they need to suffer too :/
ofc you’re valid. you don’t need top surgery or hormones to validate you. plus there’s plenty of trans guys that can’t get those things bc of medical reasons, and they’re valid too!!
Yes. 👑🌈🐐
You're valid as whatever you are.
You are valid. No question.
You're entirely valid. People like to say ""you aren't valid unless hormones and operations"". They miss the whole gender is a social construct thing by a mile. You are you. No matter how you look. No matter what sexual organs you have or however your body stores fat. You are human. You are a man.
You are always valid, never think the oposite, actually is kinda Cool that you dont have to suffer that
I'll be honest, I had the exact same questions as you, not long ago. You're valid, regardless of how dysphoria presents or if it does at all. Some people don't get anywhere near the same level of dysphoria as others, that doesn't make them any less trans or any less valid. What matters is what feels right for you - your pronouns, your name, how you identify - not what feels wrong. 

You're 100% valid :)

(I hope I worded that okay-)
If it feels better is just a valid reason as it feeling bad imho
Yes sir your valid.
Hello Mikael, there is nothing wrong with you and you are completely valid. Stand strong and love yourself
Totally valid
Do you identify as literally anything but cis, yes, so you are a valid trans individual, and for those of you who read that and got disappointed, you shouldn’t be, you probably just haven’t realized you’re trans yet
Gender dysphoria isn’t caused by being trans, It’s caused by society, so by no means is it needed in order to be valid.
Yes. No matter what luv, *you are valid.* Whatever that means personally to you *you are valid.*
Thank you all for the love, feeling much better about myself! 💛☺
Yes this is what I wish it was for all, not being trans cause dysphoria, but being trans because of euphoria.
Yes. (No, I didn't read anything aside from the title)
Of course! First of all, I definitely realized I have dysphoria way after I realized that I am trans, and it’s increasing every day- plus you don’t have to habe dysphoria to be trans and don’t let the truscum teach you otherwise
You don’t need to have dysphoria to be trans. There is no quota of suffering necessary to be trans. This is a common stumbling block almost every trans person I knew had to overcome. In the initial phases, we fear that we’re trodding on sacred ground, that being trans is reserved for a holy select few who meet highly specific criteria. 

But the truth is the best metric we have for if you’re a guy, is if you want to be guy. If you want to be a guy, you’re a guy. 

The truth is you can do whatever you want, and if anyone doesn’t like it, they can go to hell.
Ofc, you are valid you don’t need dysphoria to be trans for instance I’m ftm but some times I feel “ok” in some more feminine clothing and some times I feel extremely dysphoric but you don’t need it to be trans
Validity is something you give yourself when you just do what you do and you don’t need to explain it to anyone and the world can be damned. The journey is more important than the destination :)
You’re totally fine.  Everyone has different experiences with their gender and how they express it.  There isn’t just one way to be trans, do what makes you comfortable.  You are definitely a man!
Yes

Next question
Gender dysphoria isn't a standalone thing. Euphoria is, by my understanding, the other side of the same coin as dysphoria. Just because you don't experience dysphoria or at least not enough to notice, doesn't mean you're not trans. If you experience euphoria that's reason enough to transition (which can also just be socially, medical transition isn't a required goal or anything like that!).
So of course you're valid! I'm happy for you that you don't experience the dysphoria side, though I get that a lack of struggle can give you imposter syndrome and such and can thus make things hard sometimes.. there's no need to worry about this, though. If it makes you happy and doesn't harm anyone, you can do whatever you want.
Yes of course ☺️
ahort answer: YES
Yes of course you are valid!! You are yourself!! Don’t let anyone to make you someone else! If you identify as trans welcome if not you count with our support anyway! Cause trand at the end struggles to be themselves and we will support any authentic person we meet! We will cherish them and support them. So yes I don’t care if you have dysphoria or not, or how long or far you want to go on the path of self discovery, cause we are all lost on the infinite sea of infinite human experiences. Be happy, be yourself!!! Lots of love!! Btw i will love to know your choosen name!!
Yes, you don't need dysphoria to be trans!
Gender dysphoria is a spectrum you don't have to have a violent reaction to be trans *imo*
There is not a single person on this earth who isn't valid as whatever they wish to identify as, so yes, stranger, you are valid :))
HELL YEAH YOU ARE VALID.

I get why you maybe dont fell like you aren't. Since a lot of us trans dude have disphoria for parts of our body that are mostly seen by women, e.G. Breasts. 

But being fine with them is all OK. Really theres nothing wrong with being comfortable in your body, and i admire you for it lol.
Yes you’re valid!

Also about the wanting some but not all the effects of T, I would recommend looking into microdosing. It may be able to give you some desired effects without a complete transformation but it would require some research. But it’s completely up to you.
Yes, totally!

I feel very similar to you. I don't have a lot of dysphoria and most of it comes from me wanting to pass on the street but not when I'm at home in front of the mirror. Gender Euphoria on the other hand is much bigger for me and when someone random like the bus driver uses the right pronouns, it just feels good. That's all that matters. What you feel most comfortable with and what makes you happy. :) 

<3
YES. You’re still valid!
dysphoria is not the requirement to being trans, neither is euphoria. the requirement to being trans is simply being trans; if your gender feels a different way than what society assigns to you after your body, then you're trans.

how that feels to each of us is different; some experience dysphoria, some only euphoria, some both, and sometimes it's just the awareness that the way things currently are isn't right, and ofc there's probably more emotions to it

you're absolutely valid
Maby you are Gender Fluid
I can understand how you feel (even though am going the other way to you.  It does feel like gatekeeping with the old ""you must feel this way and do this to be trans"" but there isnt no right way. Only your way ^_^
Just based on the title: yes.
I'm genuinely confused. You say you don't have gender dysphoria, but then proceed to say you feel euphoria from use of your name and want to be viewed as a man. Is that not gender dysphoria, or did you actually mean body dysphoria?
I’ve noticed over the years that a lot of people experience dysphoria when noticing they can’t  or don’t currently experience euphoria from a certain thing. I myself don’t experience a lot of dysphoria either, until I compare my current experience with how good my existence would be with this very specific thing being completely different. For example, people call me by my name now which has become normal for me, but I can feel dysphoric when I notice people using my deadname despite them knowing better. But you’re also very valid when you don’t experience such feelings of course.
Wasn't me but I agree 100%
To be fair, euphoria and dysphoria seem to be two sides of the same coin - at least for me lol.
Euphoria is what made it make sense for me.
I feel the same way
Not to say transness doesn't involve a degree of pain, trauma and dysphoria for a lot of us (myself included). But it's genuinely a delight to see trans people living for the joy of it more than the pain. It gives me hope and fuels my somewhat tired soul <3
I also was conflicted in the beginning, because I had to wear many dresses and skirts as a kid, and I didn't mind it, but when people saw me as a boy and called me ""niño"" or ""young man"" I felt very happy and I loved those moments. Although, they were quickly taken away by my mother correcting them. I don't wear dresses as much, because gender stereotypes still do very much exist, and wearing a dress would cause very much invalidation, but I would like to wear dresses or skirts once I feel more comfortable with myself. I'm working on myself and not worrying about what people see me as. Guys can wear dresses and still be guys. Nonbinary people can wear dresses and still be nonbinary.
I mean this is all super common in trans women tbh.
Louder!
Good thought but I don't really think so, I can only imagine myself as a man, maybe demiboy, I am not sure between transman and demiboy yet
.Yes same. I don’t have much dysphoria, but I have some very strong gender euphoria."	u8k7k7	trans	482	0.95	2022-04-21 10:12:45
Help finding trans friendly tv	"Please don’t suggest a tv show that you aren’t certain is safe.

Sorry in advance for ranting, but

I’m honestly really sick and tired of having no safe cartoons or comfort tv anymore. I keep encountering the most transphobic jokes on every tv show I try to watch.

I can’t find any adult show that feels safe to watch. I’m really tired of turning to entertainment for a distraction from my dysphoria to find that the show is the thing triggering the most pain.

So much adult tv from the usa is incredibly homophobic and severely more blatant about its transphobia. So many cartoons I used to enjoy before my egg cracked became immediately unsafe. Of course Family Guy was never really funny, American Dad isn’t much better, Seth is lazy and hateful in a lot of his comedy. I can’t even watch Impractical Jokers anymore because every episode includes some transphobic joke.

But I’ve been really craving a good cartoon/comedy, so I thought, Bob’s Burgers, family friendly, right? Then I watch, “Sheesh! Cab, Bob?”. Imo very transphobic. Which is a shame because this show felt pretty safe for the queer community to me. That episode, to me, really frames cross dressers as trans people, has them all be sex workers, and then makes a lot of low blows against them. The whole episode filled me with dysphoria, and I feel especially disappointed in this show.

I guess Big Mouth has been pretty safe, and their episode dedicated to creating a trans character was fine, but that’s some of the best rep we get in adult cartoons, and that really disappoints me.

I went to children’s cartoons, but most shows I found that appeal to adults in some way too had some issue with them, even “progressive” cartoons like Gumball. It’s like every cis creator feels a compulsive urge to tell our story for us and do it in a way that harms our community and I don’t get it and I’m so sick of it.

Even a show like Euphoria, which I wouldn’t really call comfort tv, one of the only mainstream sources of trans representation in entertainment, I found to be quite harmful at times. And that’s after enjoying the show and even growing to love Jules as a character. I just didn’t love her as a representative of our community, more so I hated how cis men constantly used her to escape their own queerness, as if loving her proved their gayness. 

Every show I watch feels harmful.

tl;dr:

I feel exhausted and defeated just trying to find a comfort show that won’t make me feel like shit. I know there have to be several out there, but this search has me giving up.

If y’all would share any safe tv shows or movies or even games you’ve found, I would love that so much, and I think many would appreciate seeing several safe titles for trans audiences in one place. 

Thank you all for reading or just giving me this space to vent about one of the most frustrating aspects of this journey for me. Love all of you 🖤"	"Some excellent queer shows off the top of my head:

She Ra: The princesses of power, Arcane (Netflix), What we do in the shadows, Our flag means death (Hulu)

Arcane is the only one without specific trans rep as far as I know, but all of them do queer stuff really well. The two from Hulu are made by Taika Waititi, who is phenomenal with good queer stuff imo. Anything he's majorly involved in is gonna be great in that regard. Our flag means death has realistic gays, enbies and charming comedy.
She-ra and the Owl House are very queer inclusive.
“our flag means death” has a non binary character and there’s no jokes made about them, all the characters are pretty much accepting of them immediately and it’s also a really funny and great show in general. it’s in HBO max if you have it
Bob's Burgers in later seasons is honestly really trans friendly. Marshmallow, one of the trans women, is only ever referred to with she/her pronouns, and in one episode Bob even corrects Linda for calling her handsome by saying ""Marshmallow's not handsome she's beautiful."" Personally, I don't think the episode was meant to paint the trans community as gross crossdressers, but it's completely fine if you still feel that way about the show. Honestly that episode came out around 2013, and I think that's about as inclusive as they were allowed to be without being censored.

I recommend watching Our Flag Means Death. Queer friendly show with multiple gay protagonists and a nonbinary character.
The Owl House, the creator had to fight for including LGBT rep and I'd say its the darkest thing Disney has to offer since Gravity Falls, cause it gets very dark at times, especially season 2
Schitts Creek is a nice fun series imo and the creator is a gay man  has nice lgbt representation without making a big point of characters being gay
ODAAT (one day at a time) not trans centric but elena's wlw partner is nonbinary :) 

it's a very good show (cancelled by netflix, typical) focused on a cuba to america immigrated family just living their lives. many of the subplots (i think that's what youd call it?) are focused on elena's coming out as lesbian and dating her nonbinary partner syd. theyre super cute and i think it's done pretty well
Magnus archives is a good podcast, also helluva boss is a good show
Solar Opposites is a great show. I'm a trans man and I love it. If you look up ""the pupa"" then you've seen what is my newest obsession. The show is great and it has a great homoerotic subplot.
heartstopper came out on netflix yesterday, I watched it and it immediately became a comfort show for me. had some serious themes but overall very wholesome, i loved it so much. it has all kinds of lgbtq+ rep and its really well done
**Brooklyn 99** is an amazing police procedural comedy.  It actually shits on *Ace Ventura* for being transphobic at one point so I'm sure the writers were generally sensitive about trans issues and not putting triggering material.

Similarly, **The Good Place** is amazing and very queer positive.  It's from the same showrunner so it has a lot of shared writers.  I also love **Parks and Recreation** but I wouldn't be shocked if it made a man-in-a-dress joke at some point.  I feel similar about **Community**, it was extremely avante garde and the main character's fragile sense of masculinity is a common thing joked about so I wouldn't be shocked if it has similar even though I can't think of examples.  Still, it's a queer-positive show.  It *does* have a character who's homophobic, but the show also has the other characters shitting on him for it, so it makes a clear message that prejudice is wrong.

If you want to break out of comedy, **The Haunting of Hill House** is a horror series with queer representation and is IMO a masterclass of writing and filmography.  I've seen it three times and keep picking out more stuff.  If you like science fiction, **The Mandalorian** and **The Book of Boba Fett** are both incredible and don't require much prior knowledge of Star Wars canon, except that Boba Fett was eaten by the Sarlacc in *Return of the Jedi* (watch both seasons of **The Mandalorian** first though, the series' plots are intertwined so this matters).
If you're into anime I really recommend zombieland saga. It's pretty funny and light hearted for the most part. Also has one of the main characters is canonically trans (MTF) . Their backstory episode where they're revealed as trans is fucking saaadddd though have tissues ready, but I thought it was extremely well done all around.
Sense8 is my comfort show, it has a trans main character played by a trans woman and is directed by the Wachowskis
Umbrella Academy (Netflix) is a show I haven't seen talked about yet, but it's very good and deals with many sexualities and even tackles homophobia and racism in the second season really well.

And given that Elliot Page came out as trans between season 2 and the upcoming season 3 they already announced that Elliot's formerly presenting as female, Vanya will be transitioning to Viktor.
Once Upon a time is also a good series. Can be kind of heavy but nothing offensive. Plus has very natural representation of gay characters
Perhaps “shezow” might suit you. And there are an increasing amount of drama and documentary style pieces on the ABC, being the Australian Broadcasting Commission…

Hope this helps.
Star Trek Discovery is *very* LGBT-friendly.  It's the first Trek series with an openly gay couple, the first with an openly non-binary character, and there's even a trans character as well!  A number of the cast members are also LGBT too!

Now if you like anime, there's Hourou Musuko/Wandering Son, Bloom Into You, Adachi & Shimamura, and Citrus (though that one is a bit.....well, I'll let you find that out).  There's also Carole & Tuesday, which isn't considered to be LGBT (that I know of), but it's obvious that the two main characters, Carole and Tuesday, have feelings for each other.
Invincible is pretty good, even if it is quite gory at times. For live action, Doom Patrol, the Flash, and Supergirl are good at having queer representation, with Supergirl having a trans woman as a main character in later seasons. Shameless is also very good representation IMO, again with trans characters coming in later seasons. Before that, it did have some moments of transphobia, but once a trans character is introduced, that ignorance/assumptions are challenged head on, and you see the other characters grow as they learn more. 

There's probably more, but those are the ones I can think of now that I haven't seen mentioned yet in terms of representation. Though honestly, it's probably much easier to find comfort shows that don't have representation, but also don't have homophobia/transphobia. There are many more of those than shows with good representation out there.
It's not exclusively trans, but the CW supergirl show has a character named dreamer who is confirmed trans and has an entire episode about her in season 3 or 4, and the show in and of itself is LGBTQ friendly
>I guess Big Mouth has been pretty safe, and their episode dedicated to creating a trans character was fine, but that’s some of the best rep we get in adult cartoons, and that really disappoints me.

Oh, **Bob's Burgers**!  I'm not aware of any trans-specific characters (as in MtF/FtM), but there's a lot of queer representation and a large number of recurring characters who are gender non-conforming.
Hi. I have no suggestions for shows specifically however I do know something that might help. This [website](https://www.doesthedogdie.com) is called ‘Does the Dog Die?’ and it’s essentially got trigger warnings for many categories for many many TV shows, movies, books etc. 

There are tho transphobia-specific categories they use which are listed (taken directly from the website) below:

- There are ""Man in a dress"" jokes
A general category for jokes that involve men dressing/acting in traditionally feminine ways or being gnc (gender non-conforming) being used as a joke or for shock value. Not to be confused with transmisogyny, or calling trans women men in dresses.

- Someone is misgendered


Other categories you may find useful are:

- Someone speaks hate speech 

- There are homophobic slurs 

- An LGBT person dies 

I hope this helps!

Edit: Link didn’t work
craig of the creek, it’s really cute and has a nice story with great characters, it’s arguably the most progressive show to release on cartoon network
I haven't seen anybody mention Umbrella Academy here yet. The writers wrote one of the main characters to be trans after the actor came out.
helluva boss has an r slur drop once in the pilot but it's never heard again and it's pretty darn queer. it's on youtube as it's a webtoon. 

the owl house and she-ra are also fancy, 100% recommend both.

Here are some that I haven't watched but have enough evidence to assume confidently are safe:

I think our flag means death is also cool, though I haven't watch it it has singlehandedly captivated every single one of my queer tumblr mutuals, which tells me that it's safe.

I started watching arcane but got side tracked but this show has thoroughly consumed my trans friends so I assume it's safe, too. 

hazbin hotel, same universe as helluva boss, will be airing soon I suppose, and it's most likely also gonna be safe

eta: the pilot of helluva boss specifically can be a bit harsh and the humor in general is extra mean sometimes. If you want comfort, I definitelly recommend the owl house or shera more
Check out ""She-Ra and the princesses of power."" It's on Netflix
I think you should leace is good for some absurdist sketch comedy.
brooklyn nine nine! it’s a hilarious show and although it doesn’t include any trans characters, it’s a very “woke” show, no transphobic jokes and anytime an LGBTQ+ issue is mentioned in the show it’s dealt with very respectfully while still remaining comedic! i think you would love it.
The best trans friendly show is Pose. Nothing else comes close :)
First Day is a show centred around a young transgirl in school. Saw it on TV and liked it, [so heres the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDTONcPd19Y) I don't know if its only avaliable in australia though..
First Day! It’s an Australian series about a trans girl starting high school. Most accurate depiction of a trans character I have ever seen. Helps that the actress (Evie MacDonald) is trans!
Haven’t really found any trans stuff but queer shows I like:
She Ra: The princesses of power, The Owl House, Infinity Train (Stan) and Hilda

A queer game I enjoy is ‘Life is Strange - True Color’s’
Star Trek Discovery has EXCELLENT LGBT+ representation. a handful of the main characters are apart of the community and the show keeps on top of each characters pronouns very well.
Pose is literally about the ball scenes of the 80s, and has the most transgender cast of any show as of today. Definitely not a comedy though and touches on some sensitive issues.
Heartstopper, not the main character but friends with the main characters and not once did she get dead named or misgendered while in the show
Our Flag Means Death was mentioned a bunch but I definitely liked that they rolled with the NB character without making it a big deal. Pose is great of course, but it does deal directly with a lot of issues that might be triggering.
Heartstopper just launched on Netflix the other day and I binged it earlier today. It's got references to transphobia and has some scenes with homophobia, but overall it's a super wholesome and adorable show where everyone is hella queer. I strongly recommend it!
Star Trek: The Next Generation was exploring topics such as gender identity before it was cool.

A diverse cast, and really ahead of its time.

Star Trek: Discovery has two characters that show up later on, one being trans, and the other being a NB.
The Owl House is one of my favorite TV shows, and its a great show with lots of representation. I've also heard She-Ra and the Princess of Power is good. She-Ra has ended, but the Owl House still has a little bit of Season 2 left (episodes come out every Saturday, and my new favorite came out this Saturday) and a Season 3 planned made up of three special episodes. I haven't watched She-Ra yet, but plan to soon and have been in the community on social media for some time. Both shows have pretty good fandoms.

As for representation in the Owl House, you have a few gay couples (Luz and Amity, Willow Park's parents) a non-binary character (Raine Whispers) and a character with no confirmed gender yet, but the confirmed pronouns he/they (The Collector)

You also have The Legend of Korra. People say it's not that great, and it's not as great as the original Avatar series, but it's really not as bad as people say, and the main character is bi, even though it's not really talked about that much. The community for Avatar and Korra is pretty great tho, and I would recommend.

All in all, would definitely recommend the Owl House and the Avatar series. Again, have not watched She-Ra yet, but people speak of it so highly that it's probably worth watching.
Legends of Tomorrow
I'm gonna recommend a classic and go with Revolutionary Girl Utena, that show is like sailor moon on crack with the queerness turned even higher
Star Trek Discovery (later seasons have a non-binary human character using they/them who comes out and everyone supports especially their gay mentor figures)

Just skip the whole first season. (My opinion: I didn't watch it at all and started with season 2 and enjoyed it.)

It can be dark at times but honestly doesn't require knowledge of previous Star Trek stuff (I don't think, I never watched the original series which is the timeline of the second season of Discovery)

Of course, Owl House, She-Ra, Steven Universe are also ones I recommend
the owl house is a very queer inclusive cartoon, i like it because it clearly presents lgbt characters but the fact that they are lgbt isnt a big deal, its just the way they are, like real people
The Owl house is honestly really good, once you get later into season 1, and season 2 is even better, so that's my recommendation. It has a nonbinary character but there's no direct callout of it, just treated as normal
Please watch Schitt’s Creek. It’s amazing on so many levels. It has a lot of inclusiveness and treats “difference” as if it’s completely normal. I love it so so much.
Heartstopper and Our Flag Means Death. Both shows have prominent trans characters, doesn't define them by their transness but still celebrates it and is good rep!!
The Owl House, without spoiling there's key characters that are queer and there's nonbinary representation. There's also She-Ra and Steven Universe.

There's ones that aren't necessarily trans representation but show queer relationships, like Adventure time and Kipo.
star trek discovery handled it pretty well IMO, probably not perfect but definitely many many leagues ahead of most other stuff out there. they had a gay couple, a nonbinary person, and a trans masc character, all of which were usually played very naturally without shoving it in anyones face too much. 

so far stargate SG1 has been pretty good if u want something more disconnected from the subject entirely. Its pretty old and more action oriented so it seems to be more or less oblivious of those type of issues. im only up to season 4 so far tho, so take that with a grain of salt.


Big bang theory is a hard pass, blatant transphobia less than 5 minutes into the first episode. not to mention it's really annoying. (like seriously, never have i ever been so immediately put off by a show before i watched BBT)
>Big Mouth

About this (just as a tangent). The first time I watched the episodes with the trans character I just thought ""neat"". I re-watched it after coming out as non-binary and oh my it hit a lot harder at that point.
I bet someone has already said it but The Owl House. They even have a [canonically trans character](https://theowlhouse.fandom.com/wiki/Raine_Whispers).
Haven’t seen anyone else mention it, but I personally love the Netflix show 3%. It’s Brazilian so originally in Portuguese. The trans representation isn’t overt but there’s a casually trans fem character in the later seasons and there’s a beautiful performance by trans Brazilian artist Liniker. Also a couple times there’s just casually but definitely intentionally a trans flag visible in the background of a shot. I dig it :)
She-Ra is THE queer show imho. You will love it
The 1990’s moomin cartoon. There’s nothing explicitly queer in it, but it’s just a really comforting show
Our Flag Means Death has a nonbinary character, who is played by a nonbinary actor, Vico Ortiz. It's beautiful.

Good Omens is pretty good. There's a nonbinary character there too. And they're making a second season.

Umbrella Academy has Elliot Page in it, and apparently after he came out as trans they have decided to make his character transgender in the next season!

I really like The Old Guard. Not really anything transgender going on, but there's plenty of gay power couples fighting bad guys with swords.
this might not be the best honey but. I think you need to grow some thicker skin. Reality hurts whether you're trans or not. 

I think doing this will be better and healthier on you in the long run rather than sequestering the shows that make you feel uncomfortable.
[removed]
euphoria ?
I recommend Glee and She-Ra: the princess of power. Both of these have absolutely amazing LGBT representation.
euphoria!!!
Pose! It's a really good show with a good representation of the trouble that Trans folks had in the 80's and 90's new York city ball scene. Well, that's a terrible explanation, I'm bad at explaining stuff, so here is a link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7562112/

It's got quite a lot of Trans actors in it and it's just a good TV show. Should be on HBO max for you Americans i believe, it's on Crave in Canada
pose, we are who we are, genera+ion... those are the best recommendations I can think off the top of my head
I would help but I only watch Japanese tokusatsu which the only things I can think of off the top of my head where they actually bring up lgbtq+ is Naki from Kamen rider Zero-one identifying as non-binary. Also the donut seller from KR Wizard. And Oren Pierre from KR Gaim.
Overall, nothing transphobic or non-lgbtq+ in tokusatsu.
Pose!  The protagonista are trans and by the last two seasons most episodes were written and/or directed by trans folks.  It does have some difficult moments also moments of pure joy. 

There is a documentary about Miss Major called “Major” that I also highly recommend.
I've always liked Infinity Train on Hulu. There are multiple queer-coded characters in the show. There is one character in particular who is a strong allegory for transitioning/trans identity
One piece has great trans representation, albeit like 900 episodes in
owlHouse
Have you seen twin peaks? I know, it’s a cis actor playing as a trans woman, but it’s a show from 1990, it was already controversial enough to have a trans character that isn’t ridiculed or the butt it the joke, nobody would have aired a series with a trans woman in the cast. 

It’s still on of the best representations of a trans woman!! 
I won’t spoil you, but from the very first moment you meet this character you know she’s trans, and everyone accepts her as a woman. And there’s absolutely no reason for her to be trans, this could be a completely cis character, or even a man, and it wouldn’t change a thing. There’s was no necessity to put her! Still David lynch decided to put a trans character because he could.
another vote for she ra, and also i'd recommended dickinson, and star vs the forces of evil
Ok so not a show but a great spooky podcast is ""hello from the hallowoods""


The setting is uh... complicated to say the least but I reccomend you try an episode or 2 to see if you like the spooky queer stuff!


It has many, many queer characters, is made by a queer host and a really cool spooky vibe that reminds me of autumn and makes me feel safe and comforted (though that's probably just because I have a thing for autumn and Halloween and find them really comforting)


Other than that though ""I am not ok with this""

The soundtrack is amazing and it's a really good short show that I enjoyed every second of thoroughly, it has some sexuality exploration and stuff and is queer friendly (though there is homophobia but, like, villainous homopobia where its clearly shown as shitty and wrong) it doesn't have any trans characters though but I can't not recommend this to anyone


Ok last edit this time probably but Steven universe is really fun and has an awesome vibe to it, especially in the later seasons and oh my god all of the music (not just the songs) is amazing and I fucking love it, it's one of my favourite shows ever and my god are some of the plot points and stuff emotional
One of my go-tos for LGBTQ tv suggestions is The Owl House
i mean 911 lone star has a trans character who is also trans themself(i think)
Money heist! Or la casa de papel is its official name. It features a trans woman, and a couple of homosexual men. It also has a lot of fascists being killed and shit. Don’t watch if you’re sensitive to violence or robberies or anything like that. I hope this helps!
I love “ somebody somewhere”. On hbo.  There’s lots of queer ppl as characters and they do a really good job not being transphobic, gl!
Jules is played by a trans actor as well .
Well i just finished Heartstopper today so that was the first thing that came to mine however, they don't really bring up that the trans character is trans as well as she's not the main character
The good place is the best show I've ever seen
I’m surprised nobody mentioned Pose(even though I wouldn’t exactly call it comfort TV) by Ryan Murphy. It’s about the ballroom scene in NYC in the late 80’s-early 90’s. The show had the biggest ensemble of trans characters, and they’re all played by trans actresses. It gets a little intense at times but overall I highly recommend it.
If you're looking for an adult cartoon that's LGBT positive, I'd go with Arcane. Very serious story, and kinda made in the style of anime to some degree.

Edit: It's on Netflix's as an original.
Steven universe

She-Ra

Pose

That's all the shows I can think of unfortunately 😋
If it wasn’t mentioned and you’re the right age try Sense8. TW for some serious stuff but great representation and some truly affirmative depictions of queer and trans characters. 

Like I said TW for serious content but if you’re of age to watch mature a Netflix show give it a shot and fast forward like I do when I need to.
I dig infinity train as a show that deals with trans themes respectfully and in an interesting way in the second season, even if the studio made the creators present a char they intended to be trans as cis. Ultimately it still means a lot to me, and all of those elements still shone thru to me. I also really love steven universe, and have to agree with all the people saying owl house!
Not an LGBTQ show or anything, but I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson is an amazing sketch comedy show thqt also has a trans actor at a few points too
I'm going to recommend Pose every time I see a post like this because I don't see it enough. It's on Hulu, has fantastic transfem and gay representation, tells wonderful and meaningful stories. Goes into found family themes, what it actually means to be a mother, how living with AIDS doesn't have to be a life sentence, etc.
I really like Steven Universe and Craig of the Creek (can watch both on STAN)I haven’t seen many shows that have out lgbtq characters but I agree with you say ngl.. after some research Danger & Eggs, OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes, The Loud House, The Dragon Prince, Ready Jet Go!, Twelve Forever and MLP have the most lgbtq characters in them. Hope this helps! :D
[deleted]
SENSE8
Sense 8 is frankly one of the most beautiful lgbtq+ inclusive shows I've ever seen. One of the main characters is a trans woman and while there is some mild transphobia from her mom, it's short lived as she escapes that household.
The OA on netflix has a transmasc character that is done well I think, plus the show itself is pretty phenomenal. The first episode is slow but I promise its worth it
I also really enjoyed Sense-8 which has both gay and trans representation in it! 😊
Try Rick and Morty if you're looking for a trans friendly comedy.
Not a show, but a movie. 

The Danish Girl (Netflix) 

To sum it up, The Danish Girl is about Lili and her experience going from male to female in the early 1920's. I will let you know that this movie, as it's set in an early time period, does not have many comforting characters to Lili. There are showcases of treating Lili being transgender (which is a word never used, due to the time period) as a mental disorder, as well as nudity. As horrible as the other people are in this movie, it is such a beautiful one, and it is based on a true story. It shows the real struggles of being transgender and finding oneself, especially in that time period, and the end is lovely.
Heartstopper launched on Netflix a couple days ago - it's fantastic. It does howwever contain some homophobia, directed against the gay protagonist, who is also the victim of some on-screen SA (1 fairly short scene, with repercussions).
Dafne and The Rest on HBO Max is one of the best trans shows I have ever seen. It is Spanish though, so subs, but it's written, produced and directed by a trans woman. Very funny, but also truthful and touching. Loved it.
As long as you like cop shows, Brooklyn 99 is incredibly inclusive and their captain is a black gay man. Plus it's fucking hilarious and me and all my trans friends watch it when we smoke weed.
I don’t recall any particular queerphobia in *The Good Place*. In fact, the main character flirts with sapphic desire from time to time.
For cartoons people haven't mentioned yet: Kipo and the age of wonderbeasts (more aimed at kids) and Q-force.
You might not find it ""comfort tv"" because there is some violence/heavy topics but DC's legends of tomorrow is really great. It's one of my favorite shows. There's tons of queer rep (unfortunately no trans people tho that I can remember) however there is a gender fluid character
how do we feel about sex ed? it’s my absolute favorite and i think the trans representation (nb characters in S2) is really nicely done
Sex Education on Netflix has lots of queer representation, enby, and next season a trans ""power couple""
**Our flag means death** is a great show about queer pirates. It's not a cartoon and doesn't have transfem rep so far, but multiple gay couples and a nonbinary character are important characters. All of those queer characters are well-written and their queerness is prominent in the story, but still never their most important struggle or only defining character treat.
Thank you very much! I will definitely be checking out all of these. I really appreciate you giving me a safe creator to look out for, too!
Don't forget Steven universe!
Arcane and what we do in the shadows are both incredible
Came here to say this
They did joke about it really well. I busted out laughing when the Swede asked if Jim wasn’t going to be Jim anymore, could he be Jim.
This show is honestly so good about not making jokes about characters innate characteristics. There is a main character with a lisp, not a single joke about it.
100% agree with your bobs burger explanation. I think bobs burgers is one of my favorite shows because it’s safe and inclusive but also genuinely funny and light hearted.
Agreed, later season bobs burgers is definitely queer-friendly but the first couple episodes are definitely yikes. Like, the one op mentioned does a bit where it zooms in on the trans womens' stubble and they joke about having penises and stuff. Love that show but always skip that episode lol

Side note I headcanon Gene as trans and it makes the show even more fun to watch
I didn’t even realize marshmallow was trans wtf
I can only agree with your recommendation of Our Flag Means Death.
owl house fans how we feeling after hollow mind
yes! schitts creek >>
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/gdcmhvLaNUs)
Norman Lear is a legend for a reason.
This show always made me a bit uncomfortable with the portrayal of the one Jewish character but it's still a really important show to me because it was the first time I saw a coming out scene handled with respect
I'm sorry for coming off as rude, but how can a woman be lesbian, and love a non-binary person? Isn't that invalidating for their non-binary partner? Wouldn't she be pansexual? Isn't lesbian a term that falls under the sapphic umbrella?
It's really fun and silly. Then you get the dramatic Wall side plot.
was just about to say this!!! i love trans characters like elle who just get to be happy
i came here to suggest this show as well. just as a warning to those who aren’t familiar, it deals with homophobia pretty explicitly and transphobia to a far lesser extent. it doesn’t get violent, but it doesn’t shy away from those topics. it’s a fantastic show and i would agree it is so wholesome and the rep is done very thoughtfully, but i’d imagine it could be triggering for some
It’s also a webcomic, for any people more interested in reading
Community is by far my favorite show but there are definitely some ""man in a dress"" type jokes. The jokes themselves aren't actually inherently transphobic, but I can see how it could definitely prove dysphoric for some.
Was gonna say B99!!! They also have an openly gay and openly bi character in it!
I loved the good place !!! And Brooklyn 99
If we're talking anime, Houseki no Kuni is also a good one. Literally all but 2 of the named characters (plus a third one who... might not be? Not sure yet) in the series are non-binary.

It's... hard to explain.
Once upon a time isn't *offensive* by any means, but definitely keep in mind before watching this show you'll probably have a heck of a headache trying to keep the family tree sorted out in your head lol
Queer representation aside, how is the series as a whole? I've heard conflicting reviews
I adore shezow!
TIL what ABC means in tv world
I vaguely remember this show
Plus that was from their first season and the show has been on over a decade at this point.
Yes!
The Owl House actually does have a non-binary character, Raine Whispers!
OFMD is my new favourite show by far. I'm kinda obsessed with how queer it is.
>You also have The Legend of Korra. People say it's not that great, and it's not as great as the original Avatar series, but it's really not as bad as people say, and the main character is bi, even though it's not really talked about that much. The community for Avatar and Korra is pretty great tho, and I would recommend.

I will always recommend The Legend of Korra. The Bryke had to fight tooth and nail just to get Korrasami to hold hands in 2014.
That's the best part about it. Too many shows make their queer character such a big deal. In The Owl House, queer is simply normal. No one makes a big deal of it, all of the queer characters are just living their lives as normal people in The Boiling Isles and no one has a problem with it, just as it should be in real life.

&#x200B;

Its one thing for a show to have a queer character. Its another thing for a show to present queerness as normal and I think this is the better direction to go, and The Owl House just does it so darn right.
>Steven Universe

Just an interesting side note, Stevonnie is technically agender/non-binary, and the creator of the show (Rebecca Sugar) is also non-binary I believe.
Honestly, it’s fine that you are not so bothered by representation issues, but representation matters to a lot of people. I appreciate that you mean to be helpful, but I disagree that the solution to harmful tv is to grow a thicker skin to hatred. If people accept our media as trash then it won’t get better. Telling someone experiencing dysphoria to grow a thicker skin doesn’t sound like a healthier option to me than advocating for change. I won’t be watching tv that makes fun of my community and makes me feel like shit, but thanks for the advice.
I always thought that was the case, but growing a thicker skin incorrectly implies that you’re just fortifying yourself. What it really means in the way that we use the phrase is fundamentally changing the standards that you personally hold media to by partially numbing yourself to slights against your community. I get that this works for some people but I should be able to watch a show or movie without having my identity insulted by some idiot staying afloat with overused biases. 

Sorry for the rant I guess
i have such thick skin that i dont get bothered by transphobia as much as i should be (i don’t actually have thick skin im just weird)
South Park? Really I mean it’s not trans friendly at all
I second the recommendations of She-Ra and Steven Universe, both include proud lesbian relationships, (some of which are loving, healthy, and just generally adorable... Spinerella and Netossa, anyone? Loving wifeys) and Steven Universe even has a lesbian wedding in a plot important episode so no one could censor it out. xD

SU-F also includes a non-binary human character, which is always great to see.

I haven't properly watched Infinity Train, but I am aware of Lake, who starts out being seen as female and... appears to have a character development journey towards becoming either a trans man or a nonbinary individual, and I saw enough to feel touched by the compassion of the portrayal.
Arcane hasn’t confirmed anything explicitly, but the writers have made it really clear that they intended for Caitlyn and Vi to be gay for each other and that they’re just slow burning the fuck out of it.

Which checks out since season 2 just got confirmed!
And Infinity Train!
WE ARE THE CRYSTAL GEMS
Yeah The Owl House has a non binary character and is just a really damn good show!
that was so good 😭
yes! as a disabled person im so used to jokes in shows about peoples disabilities and stuff, i was super pleasantly surprised about the lack of jokes about stuff like that. such a breath of fresh air
Omg, me too. Gene has *biiiiiiig* egg vibes
oof
Currently dying. Knew it was coming but it hit hard lol
A lot of things
One of the most beautiful scenes in all of television <3
wait who was the one jewish character? i dont remember that
lesbian means non-men loving non-men, not strictly women loving women! i understand your confusion though, saying ”wlw partner is non-binary” is basically saying that the non-binary person in question is a woman loving woman. but my point is that the term lesbian includes non-binary folk.
Wall side, just kills me with its brilliance...
[deleted]
Lol yes the family tree is wack in this show
Its funny I didnt even know about it until getting with my boyfriend who loves it and so we watched it together, so idk what issues people take with it but I really enjoy it. Has lots of likeable characters and interesting storyline. Fun to see the ways they twist around these already familiar characters into something new
The American ver is American Broadcasting Company I believe
I'm not the original commenter, but I really appreciate your response. It's kind of like queer bars. I *can* go to a regular bar and be totally fine. But there is so much value in going to a bar who acknowledges you as a valid person without having to wade through mountains of bigotry.
i honestly dont see it as hatred :/ it's jokes. they're comedies. It makes fun of everything and everybody. Including us. Thats inclusion in my eyes, not hate. Family guy has kept quagmires trans parent in as a character and is taken more seriously i feel than when she was first introduced. Thats representation. in American dad steve seriously questions his gender identity in one episode. 

I hope i haven't upset. Shows i don't believe I've seen transphobia in (but you and i probably have different definitions) are Archer, rick and morty, the new star wars shows like mando, and killing eve. Some comedy there, some drama, some sci fi depending on what you're into.
yeah actually. I have thick skin and am numb to the abattoir trucks. But with ""transphobia"" i have a much different conceptualisation and so it's not like my thick skin has anything to do with enjoying south park or family guy. I liked these shows before my transition and continue to like them now.
Kinda, agree, but the thing with southpark imo is that they just dont spare anyone. I do have to admit that the whole Mr Garrison parts in the early season and then later 2 episodes were bad. But recently it has gotten a lot better if you ask me :0
I mean they more than clearly are. What confirmation do you want lol
We’ll always save the dayyyyy

And if you think we can’t…
yeah owl house is great and it will be safe for your sexuality and identity but if watch that show your emotions in general will be in terrible danger
>Dean Pelton is one of my favourite characters, lol. He's a walking egg imo..

Somehow when I speculated that **Community** *may* have ""man in a dress"" humor, I completely forgot about Dean Pelton.

IMO, Dean Pelton knows exactly who he is.  This comes out from time to time.  He's intentionally coy, not in denial or confused.
That freaking American dad episode where Steve questions his gender with that roller derby group actually helped me realise I was trans, because it said that trans people could be gay too. Absolutely amazing episode if you ask me xD
I really disagree about the ""It isn't hate because it is a joke"" jokes based only on we existing are really dangerous, jokes that portrait us as criminals, sluts or sick aren't jokes.
When you make a joke about a group that has no representation, esp when the show itself doesn’t have it, that becomes how people think about us. These jokes are the jokes some peoples families make about them behind their backs. Some of these jokes/ “representation” are just downright transphobia
I just feel like it should be ok to get pissed when something seems like pointless transphobia. The expectation shouldn’t be to lower your standards for creators of media because it’s normal for them to say some of this shit.
Which is interesting coming from Seth MacFarlane, because Family Guy has been suuuuper trans/homophobic forever.
THANK YOU. 

Also super glad it helped you figure stuff out 🤗
it makes fun of everything tho, not like its a targeted hate campaign. How did any program i mention portray us as any of those things? :/
i JUST gave an example about how family guy DOES have representation tho... how is quagmires dad turned mom born of transphobia?. It shows her as a recurring character going about her life. She gets with a guy (brian) at a bar/hotel, and they have a great time, but there after hes ashamed to be seen with her. How is that anything but going through trans issues, i know I've had that before, guys wanting to meet in secluded areas and things. I no longer tolerate that kinda asshole. It goes about these things the only way a childish cartoon comedy thats only on for 20 minutes can :/
i like how pointless transphobia implies that some transphobia has a point xD but ye. creators are gonna create what they want. I just don't think family guy or American dad is transphobic. If they are they're also anti-semitic, racist (against every race), sexist, homophobic, celebrity slandering, obesity shaming, etc. 

its a stupid silly cartoon with a time traveling baby and an alcoholic aging dog. non of it should be consumed as if it's serious.
I mean idk. They are just fucking with everyone and making jokes at every ones expense (just like southpark). Stuff like that never bothers me."	uagykc	trans	477	0.96	2022-04-23 22:55:01

Don't think random strangers calling you a good girl is going to help your dysphoria, just being real here 

Clarifying that I completely support lgbtq, as this comment might suggest otherwise, but cmon, wtf is this, just seems like some karmawhoring

"Not ""feeling trans"" during my childhood"	"I hear from a lot of trans people in the media that they knew they were suppose to be the opposite gender as long as they can remember and since they were a child.

However I don't feel like that's how it is for me. I was fine with being a boy in my childhood (Im MTF). I would play with both girls and boys and both ""girl"" and ""boy"" things. But I never wanted to identify as a girl or anything. 

I didn't start wishing to be a girl until I was 13 when puberty kicked in. Even then it was very subtle and took until I was 21 to really feel the full effects of gender dysphoria and seek help for it. 

Is this normal for trans people? Curious to hear what others go through."	"It might be even more normal than always knowing. Just that nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. And then, once you figure it out, bam!

The DSM 5 only requires persistent feelings over six months as an adult for a diagnosis. The mental health community recognizes that these feelings do not need to have been always present.
Everyone is different! There is no “right” way to be trans and everyone has their own story. You are welcome and valid no matter how long it’s been ❤️
Yeah, absolutely.  It's common enough that some people suggest figuring it out during puberty should be a diagnostic criteria.  Plus, many of us don't figure it out until later.  I figured out I *wanted* to be a girl right around my 13th birthday and figured out I was trans when I was 20.  I can absolutely point to earlier signs but it wasn't until well into my transition that I remembered them and they were subtle.  And I really enjoyed boyhood, even *through* high school.  You're not out of the ordinary for it, don't worry.
I’m not binary trans, but I am trans by definition and I didn’t realize until I was 28 for what it’s worth. I’m still realizing that there were signs from when I was a kid but I ignored them. And a lot of it could of been chalked up to be nothing more than being a “tomboy” so I never really thought much about it until I was much older. It wasn’t until I had a best friend who was FTM that I learned more about dysphoria/euphoria that I realized I had similar experiences and saw them for what they were. It actually turns out I’m agender. You could check out the “dysphoria bible” online and see if anything resonates with you, but honestly I feel like the fact that you’re questioning your gender at all could itself be an indicator that you’re somewhere under the trans umbrella. Most cis people never even think about these things. Good luck to you in your journey mo matter where it may lead you.
most young children wanna please there parents so they want to be what there parents want or think they want. So weather they realize it or not they prolly suppressed feelings of dysphoria
YO ME TOO
I basically started feeling dysphoria when my friend's voices started to change and mine didnt
when i was a child i liked boy and girl things (mostly boys but i still liked dressing up as princesses and stuff) and look at me now lmao
I posted this a little while ago, might help https://eevie.ro/posts/2022-01-01-always-knew.html
I’m the same way. I didn’t have much feeling of being trans when I was young but I had situations for example when I once kept steeling my sisters clothes and would wear them when everyone was sleeping. I also once painted my nails again when  everyone is sleeping. But as others have said there was a feeling something wasn’t right. I could never put my finger on it and at times I would just stare at myself in the mirror and just be uncomfortable like something was missing or not right. At times I would often get gender envy or that certain body parts just didn’t feel right. I could list dozens of things I experienced over the years but was too afraid to speak about it. I’m 35 trans femme  non  binary. I started spiro about 6 weeks ago and feel great. I’m waiting for HRT and hoping to start it soon. 

It seemed to have come suddenly but thinking back I always suppressed my feelings thinking I was mentally ill. Finding the community  online and local support groups helped me come to terms with it
Well I didn’t know I was trans when I was a kid. I didn’t know what being transgender even meant until I was like 14-15. I just always knew SOMETHING was off, I wasn’t comfortable, I wasn’t ME. Everyone is different, you found yourself, that’s all that matters :)
I didn't I was depressed through my teens tho
It is valid. Everyone experience different. Some knew it from the early childhood. Others after they discover the trans community and learn more about it. Or they grew the feeling in later years. Redlecting on life, learn what they want and how feelings like body dysphoria never got away, no matter what they tried. It gives a lot of ways how to learn it and everyone is valid
I didn’t feel trans through my childhood, but I definitely felt like I was “not like other girls” in a way. It took me a while to pin down that feeling as dysphoria, and that I felt more like a “them” than a “her” or even a “him”
I’m non-binary, I didn’t really start questioning my gender until I was 8, and not seriously until I was 12. I was always kind of uncomfortable with my genitals but it wasn’t until the gender norms started being more rigidly enforced that being a boy became a problem, and then puberty was a nightmare. Still it wasn’t until my 30s that I figured things out.
Girl, I started wanting to be one at 14

Dont worry we all find out at different ages

Its completely normal to not know for a while, or no immediately, its different for different people
Late onset gender dysphoria is a thing. This is how it happened for me. I spent my life from birth to 18-19 before I started having consistent gender dysphoria to a point where I thought ""I want to be the opposite gender"". Up until then, I was totally fine with my AGAB. 

I grew up as a cub/Boy Scout and went all the way through to getting my Eagle. I was always the normal good boy son, just kept my other activities like smoking/drinking hidden ofc. Spent a lot of college getting gender envy but not really thinking I was trans, not until this year when I finally cracked the egg and came out to my wife and friends. 

You're still valid, even if you didn't ""feel trans"" as a child, because not everyone does :)
This just clicked for me yesterday--I've never felt like I needed to be a girl, but after reading about gender dysphoria suddenly all those years of feeling wrong, being unhappy, unable to be comfortable finally made sense. (and I mean, the couple years of wishing I was cuter and smaller, and trying women's clothes and hygiene stuff too, lol)
This is exactly how I was. I didn't start questioning my identity until I was 16. I was always a very tomboyish girl but I never thought about it until then. When I started experimenting with it it felt more comfortable.
Don't hear to the media , there is an incommensurate percentage that you felt trans during childhood but you didn't have enough knowledge about trans related topics to even identify what being ""trans"" is . Is during adolescence that your body releases high amounts of the hormone that your brain doesn't need resulting in a hormonal imbalance that triggers dysphoria, and dysphoria manifests itself in different ways for every person , the most common are : derealization, strong dislike towards secundary sexual characteristic that are the result of the opposite sex hormone and despersonalization.
If it helps, I (mtf) didn't start realizing until about 15, when I met my friend who really kinda opened me up to that stuff. And then there's a whole other spiral, but I came out as trans at around 17.
I didn't feel as a boy as a kid, but didn't think that much a bit it, in puberty I was okay with being a boy and since about 5 years I absolutely hate being just a boy ( non binary or trans fem feels way better). So yeah, everyone has a different time :)
I always had day dreams of being a girl but I never knew I was trans, I mean everyone thinks differently how are you meant to “think right” lol
It’s perfect normal. I’ve had it this way too. Growing up I was quite boyish (albeit autistic), and I never even once questioned my gender until I was 17. I came out a month later and dysphoria hit me like a truck. And looking back, I can’t see many “signs”, especially before my teenage years. And that’s perfectly fine. If you wanna be a girl now, be a girl now. Everyone changes, so it’s fine to only grow to want to now.
This kinda stuff depends on the individual, for some people it'll be since they're infants, for others it'll start during puberty and for some it'll be well into adulthood, for me it started at the same age as you and that doesnt make any of us be less trans
I displayed some signs as a young child but as life ramped up, it was kinda pushed to the wayside. There was always a feeling like something wasn’t right, off in some way but I didn’t know what till I was 18. Sometimes it just takes a long time to realize and deconstruct those feelings. Nobodies experience is completely the same but I wouldn’t say you are an unusual case.
same for me, just the other way round (ftm). only started feeling strange about gender shit at 12/13, and it wasn’t like “oh, i want to be a boy” or “i hate being a girl”. more like a feeling of isolation from all my peers, girl or boy. most media only focuses on one trans experience, and labels it as universal, leaving others who don’t relate feeling alone in their own community, or “less trans”. such bs. more than one way of being a cis girl, more than one way of being a trans girl.
I never started to feel gender dysphoria until puberty too, so you're not the only one. I think part of it was that my parents never really taught strict gender roles in my childhood and let me do whatever. But when I started getting older, those gender roles were expected of me, and so I started feeling dysphoria. 

I think the always knowing part is a sort of hindsight bias. You look back on your life in a new way and go, ""Oh! that's what that was, so I always knew,"" though some people do genuinely know, hence trans kids. Overall, these sort of experiences don't define whether you are trans or not.
I saw signs in my early twenties , some signs in my teens, but all in all I ignored these until almost 30. So pretty sure it's different for everyone.
I didn’t start to suspect I was trans til I was 19-20. But a huge part of that is because I had a very unsupportive family so I heavily repressed.
Right here now (14) I was fine being male but now I’m like seriously questioning.
I didn’t know I wanted to be a boy or masc even when I had my first period at 12 and cried over it. I didn’t cry cause I thought I was a boy or should’ve been, more so I cried because “well this confirms what my mum and every female as told me, I have to be a “woman” for the rest of my life now”. It was more feeling stuck in an expectation for me.

I was also comfortable being a “girl” in my childhood, cause I was just being me not considering gender and gender expectations until puberty when suddenly people were putting pressures like marriage, pregnancy, kids etc onto me. 

Obviously everyone realises or experiences things at different times when it comes to gender and being trans, I still didn’t accept I was NB/trans masc until I was 21 too. Now I look back on my early teenage years with an “oh that makes way more sense now why I had x reaction”.

It’s perfectly normal and I know plenty of trans people who don’t necessarily regret their childhood at all, again, everyone’s experience is different tho
This is normal, during my childhood a only had 2 things that pointed to me being trans, the hatred I've always felt for my name, using a gender neutral nickname for 8 years before coming out at 15, and an obsession with a documentary about some trans kids when I was 8 or 9, but I didn't figure out I was trans until just after turning 15, Then the dysphoria came... and it came in full force.
I don't think i had severe gender dysphoria as a child but I also grew up on a conservative household that would have mega gaslighted me about it if I had had it. I look back at all the things that I think now were clear signs for me if I had had neutral information about being trans. I had severe insecurity with how tall I am (I was 6'5 by the time I was 15) and there's a lot of other things there but I've been treating my dysphoria for a decade now so how cares lol.
My parents never forced me to do stereotypically boyish things, such as taking an interest in cars or sports. Even when I tried it for a while, I quickly got bored with it. I also spent a lot of time with my two cousins, who are girls, so we often played with dolls and things like that. From what I remember of my childhood, the most ""girly"" thing I did was playing house with my mother, where we played with plushies, and I was always the one who wanted to be a mother. Also sometimes I would dress up in my mother's or grandmother's clothes, but both my grandmothers and great-grandfather are tailors, so no one paid attention to that. But at that time I don't think I ever thought about wanting to be a girl, maybe I just don't remember. So maybe because I was never forced to take on the role of a typical boy, I had nothing to rebel against. When I was 13 or something like that I started to think about the fact that I would have preferred to be born as a girl, that I am trans I realized when I was 20.
I’m not sure how I felt about my gender when I was a kid. Also, I didn’t know that being gay or trans is a thing until I was 10. But I had a lot of tomboyish interests. I remember in elementary that I really wanted to play soccer with the boys, but the only girl they would let play with them was someone way tougher than me. I was frustrated that I wasn’t considered boyish enough. I also wanted to be in the Boy Scouts. Today, I really wished that I looked more like I wanted to so other people can see me as a man or agender I when feel that way.
I’m non-binary, and I didn’t even realize it until about 22
I'm the most stereotypical girly gal there is now! Always hang out with my gal pals, love fashion, makeup, have a boyfriend, love everything cutesie. Yet as i child i was a Lego star wars loving giga gamer, who loved boyish geek culture, had short hair and loved to hang out with the booooys, on lans and shit.

The thing is, EVERYTHING I've written is stereotypes. Nothing about this defines your gender. I was depressed most of my teen years and low and behold, it was because i didn't feel good about my body. Gender identity is so confusing, and i think some just are more lucky than others and get that revelation earlier.

You don't need an epic tragic marvel backstory to be trans.
It was a recent thing for me too, but then I’ve often had a very hard time connecting with my own emotions, I could be feeling deeply irritable and not know until I snap at someone for instance, I look back on a lot of things and something one might call ‘my transness’ existing without form or name until I found out more about what makes me comfortable and happy.
Yeah I didn't either. I had no problems with being a girl and I was even a very happy feminine adult, but to make a long story short, I never grew comfortable being called a ""woman"" or ""ma'am"" and decided to transition in the hope of never hearing it again. I'm always envious of the rare people who just keep their appearance the same, announce their coming out, and correct everyone who misgenders them. I couldn't deal with it anymore. In the end, I think I was a girl who grew up into a ~man instead of a woman.
I think so, I think I’m trans and I didn’t figure that out until this year, so I’d say yeah it’s normal, I’ve always been more into boy stuff (excluding dolls lol)
Yeah, for me it was not knowing and being in a solid all-boys environment throughout my entire childhood until university. Took me until 24 yo that I realised I liked hanging out with girls way more when I made my first actual female friend. Even before then I would have fantasies of being a girl, but nothing that manifested in the real world as I tried by darnedest to fit it with all my male peers, but it wasn't until then that things started turning for me. It still was another 6 years before I recognised my transness; it has been buried deep deep down by my environment and heavy dose of Christian guilt.
This is my experience too, FTM, playing with both toy sections and never really questioned my gender till Middle school since that’s the first time I ever heard about all this stuff, but keeping it on the back burner too because I constantly doubted myself and never wanted to look more into these thoughts. For me when I look back for signs it’s clear in hindsight, but at the time I would just write them off as something else.
I remember my first trans thought very distinctly. I was 13. Then it was off/on for a long time.
I never really connected the dots until MUCH MUCH later in life (I was 41 when I came out). But, apparently I was a happy go -lucky kid that had ""weak"" arms etc. That my father didn't like. To make it short: I developed a VERY effective denial function in my brain that buried things DEEEEEEP. 

I just felt that I was fake most part of my life. That I wished for certain colours. Something was coming out early 90's but someone mentioned ""that's so gay"". Or something. So I hid it. Again. And again. 

All I knew was that I was a fake. I had NOOO idea why. I look at photos from that time, my eyes are dead. Until 2015 when I finally connected the dots. So, I felt it like my whole life but didn't have the words to explain it. Or the knowledge, remember that I grew up pre-internet.
I had no idea as a child either, but here i am definitely trans so 🤷‍♀️
I didn't even really know being trans was an option until long after I became an adult tbh, and it took a couple years of questioning my identity before realizing I might actually want to be a guy. There were some signs growing up but it was always pretty subtle so you're not the only one
That's almost exactly how I felt, too. Never had an issue with my birth sex growing up, showed interest in the activities associated with my sex and everything, but then the end of middle school hit and something just felt...off. I didn't really dig into it further until I got into high school, but it honestly makes me sometimes worried that I'm faking being trans because I didn't already know when I was a child.
I never *really* felt trans until i hit puberty. Looking back now, a lot more stuff makes sense and i have a name for the way i felt as a child which previously couldn’t be expressed/explained. Puberty is a very common time for trans people to realize it, because that’s when hormones start making your body go the wrong way. Body dysphoria is a major indicator for a lot of people, but secondary sex characteristics don’t develop until puberty, so you wouldn’t really experience it as much beforehand. Gender dysphoria is the only dysphoria that truly makes someone transgender, but having body dysphoria on top of it can make people finally realize, “wait, something doesn’t feel right *at all*.” Like a bigger indicator that something is wrong, more than a constant, underlying nagging feeling of gender dysphoria that could have been around for as long as you can remember. Like you always felt uncomfortable but never actually knew what it was.

An analogy for this could be cancer. Some people may have a tumor that gets detected early on and treated before becoming a major issue, like maybe you notice a new, weird-looking mole growing on your arm and call the dermatologist to have it biopsied for skin cancer. Others could have internal tumors that go unnoticed for years until, suddenly, you’re super sick and losing weight rapidly. You get hospitalized and discover that you have stage 3 liver cancer and need immediate surgery and chemotherapy. Gender dysphoria can be like that too. Sometimes it’s a subtle difference that could be overlooked, other times it’s a sudden, overwhelming feeling that hits you out of nowhere, or it could be some constant nagging feeling that keeps building up over time. There’s no universal experience. Media may also push the narrative that “real” trans people know they’re trans when they’re very young, just to delegitimize the identities of older children, teens, and adults that discover they’re trans much later in life. Definitely could see that being pushed more right now with all the attacks (US) on providing gender-affirming care to minors and trans kids in sports.
What does being trans feel like?
The problem is that “boy” things and “girl” things don’t actually exist so you can’t determine a child’s gender based on how they played or dressed. It’s totally cultural that figurines for girls are called dolls and figurines for boys are called action figures. You don’t have to feel trans as a child to be trans, in fact when children under 6 start identifying as trans, they’re more likely to wind up as cis as teenagers while children who identify as trans when older almost never change their mind. So the older you are, the more you can trust your decision on your gender identity.
Reading this thread is so healing for me. When puberty hit me at 13, I wished every night to wake up being a girl. More than a wish, it was positive thinking, even daydreaming, that suddenly turning into a girl would be amazing. I had a fantastic childhood and a very cis-boyhood. I honestly didn’t realize transitioning was possible until Caitlyn Jenner's transition. And even then, it took me another six years to start medically transitioning finally. I’m so happy now, and I just realized that I’d been a girl all along, but before, I did not mind being a boy.
I didnt until 15 because it was repressed. My mom said as a kid i always hated shopping for boys clothes to a point where she would just shop without me “which i do remember”. In my teen years it was mostly repressed from growing up in alt-right youtube
You have described my experience to a T. By the number of responses to this thread I bet you know this already, but you're not alone at all and everyone's journey is different. 

Good luck out there!
It is and there is a reason. If you where getting lots of positive reinforcement in things that where connected to your AGAB. I got a lot of positive reinforcement when I was a kid for doing traditionally feminine things and it conditioned me to associate the positive attention with being feminine. Once I started to explore my gender I started to feel dysphoria because I was first able to experience gender euphoria when presenting more masculine. This is a pretty common experience especially for folks who grew up in more traditional homes and I feel like this experience should be talked about more.
I've long thought I couldn't be trans because I couldn't remember me ""knowing I was trans since childhood"" - despite having obvious gender envy and other symptoms. Then a few month ago I finally got out of denial and admitted being at least non-binary... and then all of a sudden very old, so far suppressed memories resurfaced, starting with me aged about 6 realizing I wasn't ok being a boy and desperately wanting to be a girl. Now I know...  


Now this doesn't mean you have suppressed memories, nor that you \_should\_ have in order to be valid - only you can know how you feel and who you truly are. Just wanted to share that not remembering some childhood feelings doesn't necessarily mean they weren't there.

my 2 cents...
Seeing all these people de-transitioning, I’ll say this: don’t rely on a bunch of trans people on the internet to validate you. If you’re feeling unsure, DONT. Wait until you’re sure. In my opinion, if someone doesn’t feel dysphoria as a young child, I’m very skeptical that they’re actually trans. Maybe you’re someone that doesn’t fit into either, and that’s okay too.
I didn't at all until I was 14 when I started to have doubts but it was if you asked me ""would you prefer to be the opposite gender"" I would say ""yes"" but thought nothing more of it. When I turned 18 is when I figured it out as I was starting to be called a ""man"" and absolutely hated it so tried to figure out why and found out it's because I was trans

I've thought about it a lot, the fact that I didn't show signs when I was younger but I was a very carefree kid and grew in a house with 4 boys ( my dad is one of them xD ) I suppose the way you have to look at it is that everyone has a different experience doesn't have your experience less valid
It was weird for me… 

I’m FTM trans. As a child, I didn’t mind many girly things, but never truly saw myself as a female if that makes sense. However, certain things seemed off since I was young and only got more apparent from there that something wasn’t right here. First thing I remember is I would throw tantrums over having to wear makeup and dresses. The next one I remember is I did like playing outside in the mud and dirt and LOVED monster trucks and soldiers, while simultaneously HATING Barbies and hot pink sports cars. Third, my first crush was a female (which isn’t 100% indicative I know but you’d think my first crush would’ve been a dude lol), which I didn’t understand at the time since I was too young to fully understand crushes, but now it’s oh so clear. Despite my current partner being a man, I am pansexual. I also remember when my chest started to develop, I wanted to get my chest removed or turn back time to make it go away, and I remember literally saying to my mom “I want to die” when I got my period. Around this time I also stopped showering a lot and stopped wearing revealing/overly femme clothes because I became extremely conscious of my physical appearance, and wanted to cut my hair short as well. I will also mention I’ve always been interested in art, and 9/10 of my personal characters that represented me were *male*, when only *one* was female. Also starting in 7th grade, I started choosing the boy characters in Pokémon and other games that gave gender choices. 

I can’t say I was fully comfortable being female in my childhood as that would be a giant lie, but it certainly wasn’t prevalent enough to where others, like my parents or friends, sensed I was going to end up being trans. Something was always off about me, but I didn’t really start putting the pieces together till high school when I started to play around with my identity. In 2019 it started to fully set in when I realized I was the most comfortable with he/him pronouns and absolutely hated she/her pronouns in return. So it wasn’t until I was 16-17 when I wished I was male instead of female. I’m fully out and currently transitioning now, so I’m in a much better place mentally, but I don’t think I’ll stop being body conscious until I get top surgery.
For what it's worth, I'm trans mtf and self identify as being on the autism spectrum. I didn't *know* what trans was until my late 20s. But growing up i always liked girl stuff like Barbie and playing house as well as having an obsession with ninja turtles. 

When i was 3 i was found wearing my grandmother's bra and panties (and possibly her high heels?...memory is foggy) and got in trouble for it. After that i recall having an obsession with wanting boobs and bras up until puberty. I never knew it was jealousy. When i hit puberty we got the internet (wild West of early 90s) and found a website that was a story about random stuff like a community created choose your own adventure book. One of the choices turned me into a girl and from that moment forward i recognized something within me that i was fundamentally different from other boys. Didn't figure out what that meant until late 20s early 30s when i decided to wear a partners fishnets and take pics for them and leave them in a place they'd find. I also painted my toe nails and it dawned on me that i was trans and just ""mucking my way thru being straight"".

I came out about 2 years ago publicly and i am Sylvia in everyday life now. Hormones are slow but i have boobs now and never been happier lol. Now...to d cups! :3
Now that you mention it. I did have some gender dysphoria as a teen. By now I've grown out of it and am happy as can be as a male.
I’m non-binary but as a kid and young teen I just accepted that I was a girl. I never really thought about my gender, and due to how I was raised I had a mix of interests but I generally leaned towards more stereotypically “female” activities. It wasn’t until I was more post puberty that I really noticed and was able to identify having dysphoria. Really the only sign of it as a teen I remember was wanting to wear feminine clothing, but not liking how they felt on my body after I developed breasts. Since top surgery and testosterone, I’m a lot more comfortable in feminine clothing, and I dressed masc pre transition because I assumed that it was the feminine clothing that was the issue, not my body dysphoria.
It's definitely normal. My Brother came out when he was 26 I believe and I only noticed that something was off when I turned 14
I am struggling with this some, as i’m facing coming out to my parents (dreading) and starting HRT (exciting). I’m 31 and while there were hints in childhood before 20 i would say they could have been  hindsight bias. The hints were stronger in my early 20’s and by my late 20’s they started popping up all over the place and around 28-29 i considered myself nonbinary but still passed as a man. I never seriously felt that i was trans as an explicit need until age 30 which is the same age i came out socially. So there’s doubt.

I’m bisexual, but i wasn’t always. Maybe i was always that way, but if so it was completely unbeknownst to me. I never had a single moment of attraction for men until a fleeting moment at age 22. I had watched all kinds of crazy porn as a kid/teen/early 20’s and never had the slightest desire to watch gay porn in the comfort of my own privacy - in fact it kinda squicked me out. Slowly my attraction for men increased over my 20’s and now it’s about 50/50, though i didn’t start having sex with men until i was 28 or 29.

Here’s the thing that gives me solace about being trans: I never have to question whether i truly like guys or not because i simply like guys now. You don’t wonder whether you like men when you’re craving a cock in your mouth and wanting to get bent over and fucked. So when i’m wearing a dress and makeup and feeling delicate and fem, i try to remember that i’m trans precisely because this is what feels right to me now, which is all that really matters.
I went through a similar experience. I came out as non-binary at 20 and ftm (in addition to non-binary) at 21. Prior to that, I thought I was a girl and had never explored or questioned my gender identity. 

I experienced a lot of self-hate and dysphoria about my chest during my adolescence, but just didn't know it was connected to my gender identity!

I'm glad you posted about this as it is something I've thought about a lot. I've definitely struggled with imposter syndrome because I didn't know I was trans when I was younger.
I was about the same, ftm tho. Played with the boys cause I grew up with a brother who made friends better than me. I climbed trees, thought life would be cool as a boy. But never really dug deeper than I'm a tomboy. 
Now I've been out 2 years, i came out to my bff (now boyfriend) at the time then my mom as soon as i was thinking i dont want to be me, I'm 18 now. 
I feel the same as you, why didn't I know sooner? Why didn't I think to do this? 
I think the answer for me was misguided fixes.
I thought I wasn't happy with my body and hated to look at it cause it wasn't femme enough. That clearly my issue was not having bigger boobs, cause there's no other reason to feel that. But I was clearly uncomfortable with my bottom bits.. I do hate to think I could've lived longer with the bit of happiness I do now from the ""sir"" or he/him but I do wonder if I had done it earlier would I be even happier. 
I think there came a moment, I was on yt or tiktok, idk, but I saw something about being trans and I just.. saw it clearly. For a bit i thought about looking like a boy, realized I could be like that, I could be happier. 
Idk. I still wonder a bit why I didn't realize I didn't feel attraction to most guys I saw but an envy, and boy do i feel a lot of envy for most guys i originally had thought i felt attraction.
But it's just the way the river flowed. And it'll all take us different paths.
For me, I didn't really feel like a ""boy"" directly during my childhood (ftm here). Although when I reflect on old memories, I can piece things together that makes sense why I feel trans now. Example, I often wanted to play as a male role in games.
Some know young. I think generally children have no concept of gender - not really. So when their body starts to deviate from what they expect, or what the brain wants, is when it becomes more noticeable that something’s off. I always had internal signs that I couldn’t identify until I was older because talk of trans folks didn’t happen where I grew up. I didn’t know being trans was even a thing that existed until Caitlyn Jenner, and my wife was the one that got me started on the Genderfluid track that got me to figure it out. Now I can identify that there were many moments that I definitely should have known sooner, but I kept it inside and wasn’t vocal about it. There was a level of shame on not being the way others wanted me to be, so I stuffed it all away in the closet.
That's good to hear I may not be out of ordinary
Just a point of clarity that being transgender is not a mental health illness that requires a diagnosis in the DSM-V. Gender dysphoria is a [diagnosis](https://psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/diversity/education/transgender-and-gender-nonconforming-patients/gender-dysphoria-diagnosis) and it’s specifically a feeling of distress related to one’s gender identity or secondary sexual characteristics. 

It is also possible to I be transgender without having gender dysphoria. It is possible to be transgender without having felt transgender as a child. This is in part because gender expression is largely a cultural thing and feelings of distress related to gender identity may be affected by how much a person was pressured into living a stereotypically gendered life. We as humans assign clothing and toys with a gender but they’re not intrinsically gendered items. So a cis boy child may want to play with dolls and a trans boy child may never have wanted to play with dolls because playing with dolls isn’t actually an inherently gendered behavior. We just tend to call dolls for boys “action figures.”
That's good. Thank you!
That's good to hear. I did enjoy boyhood too to a certain extent and that confused me.
Personally didn' like or dislike my boyhood. Kind of felt neutral about it tho there were several times I thought it'd be cool to be a girl/do girl things and there were plenty of feelings I just repressed and things I didn't realize were signs till after transitioning. There were definitely times something just didn't feel right but I just couldn't explain it. Of course, it didn't help that I didn't feel to start exploring my gender and sexuality till college.
Yeah for me it was the same but opposite. I hated the idea of my voice lowering and my growing body hair and such. I never knew why I did I just simply dreaded it for no logical reason and I assumed that all other boys hated their bodies and dreaded puberty too lol!
That story is also what is happening to me right now. 

A friend of mine came out as trans on Facebook and it just opened the flood gates. Am I trans? I mean, I have a dress in my closet, that's normal right?

Then finding the cis men don't think about changing genders opened the Google rabbit hole.
Oh wow, that would've been a really good article to have had… like, a decade ago. (Or even just read shortly after it came out, when I started questioning again.)
That's how it was for me totally. I just would always feel off. I never really wanted or insisted that i was a girl. But I always felt different than other guys. That no matter how I looked and talked like the other boys. I still wasn't one of them.
Yeah I had a bad anxiety disorder during my teens
Yeah for me once I started feeling trans behaviors I was around 13. They weren't as intense as they are now and also I never took them seriously or just that they were just projections of being single or wanting a gf or something.
Yeah the fakeness I totally relate to. That's how I felt most of my life. Even while I've been able to have intimate relationships with friends, SOs, and family, there would always be a factor of me that felt forced and fake. Now after being openly trans and on hrt, that feeling is gone or at least much less a factor of who I am.
Yeah thats kind of me rn
That's what I worry about a lot too. I've kind of accepted that I'm obviously not forcing myself to be this way so even if I wasn't this way before, I am this way now.
Yeah I see what you are saying. Overall I try to avoid the media all together when it comes to trans or lgbtq related stuff. Both liberal and conservative. They all come off to me as uneducated and overall not very interested in what the trans experience is actually like but just focused on pushing their agenda and getting votes.
It's pretty complicated. You have desires to be the opposite gender than your biology (for me, male to female) and don't really know why. It's like a primal desire that you need and your brain feels varying amounts of emotion to present yourself as close to you desired gender as possible. 

Basically for me it's like I have the mind/brain/soul of woman in the body of a man. Anyone in that situation would be very uncomfortable with that and would desire to present themselves to the world as the gender of who they are inside so that they can actually exist in this world as their authentic self since their self (their mind) is, somehow, designed differently than their body they were born in. 

That's the best way I can describe to someone who isn't experiencing these things. I hope this helps!
I'm glad this was healing for you! I had some questions and wanted to look for answers for me as well as others. I hope this helps! Wish you the best of luck in your life! ❤
Thank you! You aw well. Yea I wasn't expecting to get these many responses lol!
Yeah I find myself going through something similar. I used to body build and look pretty masculine. I would get a lot of compliments for those behaviors but eventually dysphoria got too much to handle for me and I've began transitioning to female. However, there are still times where I catch myself wanting to be a man again and get buff and muscular. But usually it becomes clear to me that I don't want to go back to being a man for myself. I just want to do it to make certain people in my life proud of me again or otherwise just go back to the status quo.
Yeah your welcome! I also think of it this way. I have adhd and was diagnosed with it at a very young age. I'm fortunate to live in a place where we have a lot of education around adhd and a lot of resources available for therapy and such. If I didn't live in a place like that and was never diagnosed, I probably would've lived a good portion of my childhood thinking I was completely normal and not questioning whether I had the disorder until I was older and knew more about adhd. 

Ig that's kind of how things are for my trans identity too. Since there is so little information and resources available at the ready for children with gender dysphoria, it's likely that they don't realize anythings wrong with them until they are older and more educated.
For me, I had no idea growing up, but looking back I can see the signs. I basically just wasn't very masculine and got along better with girls.
Yes, transgender itself is not a diagnostic term. But, most procedures and, in many places, access to hormones themselves, requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
Figuring things out can be confusing :p
I’m glad that you were able to find your you, it’s like a breath of fresh air when you finally figure it out
Turned out tho that depression could've been bipolar 2 and BPD
Yeah, but always a bit ""clouded"" between me and others. I'm fully out now, waiting for hrt etc, i sadly Lost my family but it's sadly not that uncommon. 

All the fakeness dripped off me, pretty much. It also connected me to life in a way I never experienced before.  Much more direct. Was s bit hard to deal with abuse etc that surfaced for all of it, still am.
Aww thanks Nicole, girl you got this!
Your feelings are totally valid. I’m glad you are making the choices to be happy though instead of pretending for others.
Exactly! You hit the nail on the head. I never knew any openly trans people growing up and had very little education regarding non-cis gender identities, so I had no idea I wasn't cis until after I started college.
I was definitely the same way.  No idea growing up but looking back there are some obvious signs.  Once I figured it out so many things clicked into place.
And hey, being out of the ordinary is cool!
Yeah totally. It's especially hard when you receive pushback for even questioning this stuff :/
Yeah im kind of semi in and out of the closet rn depending on which social group im in. I've been on hrt for about 3 weeks and I'm really like the effects. 

I havent lost any family members yet and my parents and friends at least are supportive. But I do gave family members who are really against me for this stuff which is really sad and hard to deal with.
No problem! 😊 you got this too!
Yeah same for u too
Yeah, I basically went from being so confused about myself to pretty much everything I've ever done making total sense in about 3 days. I think I pretty much wrote a full length novel about it in that time lol
That's absolutely true too & why many of us often ""suddenly"" seem trans because we often question in private since people aren't often accepting or understanding of what being trans actually is or how they could help with questioning.
Fully open and out in every situation. I kinda outed myself with a story in one the bigger LGBTQ magazines here, I was part of an art project and they wanted a story related to LGBTQ and i volunteered. 

We get to build our own families if the ones we're born in doesn't work out.

I wish that everything goes well for you, and that I finally get to start my gender affirming process soon (I live in Sweden and our process for that is currently struggling, COVID etc got in the way and the centre lost drs etc).
Same! All those memories that I had forgotten started rushing back in and being like, you were this the entire time.
Yeah thats how I feel. Many people who aren't accepting in my life are blown away when they hear about this bc they don't understand that the reason they never saw it in me was bc I hid it from them.
I hope the best for you too! I hope ur changes are everything you hope for them to be!
Personally, I legit blocked off like half of my childhood in trying to be normal and fit in. I convinced myself nothing was weird about me at all, when I'm basically the least normal person I've ever met. Being in my head is very strange...
It's common to hear from cis folks.  Before I came out, a friend's mother joked that it's always feminine men who come out as trans and that it would be *funny* if someone like me came out.

But more accepting people tended to realize how much it actually explained & contextualized much of my past.
Yeah thats with me too with other more accepting people"	vr6gi2	trans	473	0.98	2022-07-04 12:36:03
Depression sucks to say the least. So do panic attacks and never ending anxiety. But days where I feel no gender dysphoria, though few are what keep me going 😊🌈🦄.		"[deleted]

Have confidence in yourself. Take no shit from anyone. I went through discrimination and write ups and termination in my job. Family disowned me. Partner left me. I attempted to end my life. I was also raped because I am trans. Then I got pissed. I went to support groups therapist and psychiatrist visits took meds and I got better I got stronger. I filed a law suit against that employer and I am fighting them. The next employer outed me before I started. I found another job. I told nobody I was trans. The local lgbt center asked me to be the key note speaker and tell my story at the main fund raiser for the year. I stood in front of 600 people and I shared my lows and my highs. I got a standing ovation. I joined the pride employee resource group through my employer. I told them about the speech I gave. They wanted a copy of it. The next thing I knew the vice president of diversity called me on the phone. They wanted to fly me to the out and equal conference in Seattle. I met trans people from all of the largest corporations in the world. We won an award for the most progressive LGBT workplace in the world. I joined others from my company. I was asked to hold up the award in front if 6000 people in attendance. I was also asked to tell my story in an international webinar training. I told my story to a half million employees in 80 countries. So if I would have given up and ended my life it would have been a terrible shame. I touched people's lives. I made a difference. My next assignment is to become a commissioner on the Milwaukee county department of aging. I want to get protocols put in place for transgender elders as they enter long term care and assisted living facilities. There is nothing in place and it needs to be done. Otherwise when we are old and in a nursing home there is nothing to protect us. Find yourself find your inner strength. Love yourself. At the age of 60 I am peaking. I had all of my surgeries my companies insurance covered top and bottom surgery. I am an advocate. I am going to be a bride this Saturday. I went through hell. I almost gave up and cashed it in. But I never lost hope. I believed in myself. I loved myself. I made it happen. You can too now go out in the world and make a difference. And don't let anyone stop you. I didn't. Many told me I would die miserable and all alone. I would make an ugly woman. I would never be anything but an ugly dirty ass man. I never let them win. I did me and I did it right. I lived my truth I cried I showed how vulnerable if was and how badly i was treated. I rise above all of it. I prevailed in the face of adversity. I stood up in front of those people and I shone like a bright light. Alyna means bright light or sunlight. Joli means cheerful and pretty. My name suits me. I an a transgender woman and I am strong and I am proud if who I am. I am respected and admired and I am a positive influence on other trans people. I wouldn't have it any other way. I believe in you! Now go out there and shine. Don't look back. Use those feelings of insecurity to build your strength. You can do it I believe in all of you!

Can’t start HRT because I’m anemic :(	"I wanted to start taking T and transitioning more into a non-binary type of look because I have extreme gender dysphoria. My voice always gives me away and it makes me sad because I don’t feel female / womanly at all so being perceived as one is hard. I’m trans masc and am old enough to start taking T on my own now and to make my own decisions. 

I just got diagnosed with anemia last month and got some blood transfusions along with iron supplements and feel a lot better. It just sucks because my doctor wants me to get my anemia under control in around 3-6 months before I do anything to my body. It makes perfect sense, but I’ve been waiting practically my whole life to transition and having delays is going to be tough. 

Just needed to rant and hopefully gather the strength to survive a few more months without looking or sounding like someone I’m happy with yet 🙃"	"Hang in there.  I had to get my cholesterol under control and lose weight to start HRT, but I got there eventually. 

3 to 6 months may feel like a long time, but it'll be here before you know it.
https://www.practiceupdate.com/content/treatment-with-testosterone-improves-anemia-in-men-with-low-testosterone-levels/

>Conclusions and Relevance. Among older men with low testosterone levels, testosterone treatment significantly increased the hemoglobin levels of those with unexplained anemia as well as those with anemia from known causes.


Tell your doc to do some research, why get your anemia under control first when taking testosterone is a possible treatment for it
My transmasc partner had anemia when they started T and it completely fixed the anemia they'd had for years. What the heck?
Dont worry, the months will pass and before you know it you will start hrt and looking back it will feel like maybe  weeks of waiting. It happened to me too. If everything had gone well I should have gotten on T around February, but only started HRT in July. I feel you, but its really gonna be alright, believe me
im so sorry
Tbh I recommend getting a second opinion. I’m not a doctor so like definitely check with a professional but I know in my case and other folks too where T has actually helped their anemia because it ups your red blood cell production. Like I used to be hella anemic my whole life and sense I’ve started I’ve been way better.
Needing to get some stuff stabilised/under control before starting hrt is very common, 3/6 months rly isn’t the longest I’ve heard of. Just think about how much you probably had to wait already, this is nothing. I know it sucks but hang in there, once it’s under control you’ll be able to start hrt without risking to have to stop for way longer because it caused some issues.
Maybe you could try minoxidil (talk about it with your doctor) and voice exercises while waiting?
I would get a second opinion if you can. I’m 11 months on T. I started borderline anemic and now my doctor is suggesting I donated blood if my blood count gets much higher on my next set of labs…
The delays are awful, I totally understand. I was delayed only by 2 weeks because of my doctor really digging into research around hormone therapies and my weird, rare condition, and it drove me nuts with anxiety.

Big hugs, my brother. 💙🫂 We’ll support you through it! 🏳️‍⚧️
As someone who didn't begin transitioning until their late 30s I understand the feeling of wanting to transition and not being able to, for whatever reason.  Be patient and show yourself grace.  Everything will happen when it is right. And it is so much better in the long run to take your time and transition safely as opposed to rushing and possibly risking your health.
You can do it!! You are strong and you deserve the happiness that awaits, just hang in there beautiful person 💕
You can find another doctor if the waiting list isn’t long. My doctor let me go through with hrt even though I smoked, smoked weed, did psychedelics which lower blood pressure along with HRT which also lowers blood pressure, and I was very vitamin d deficient. She still let me start HRT and pointed out that cis women can begin using the same drugs without being told to quit smoking or get healthy, they only tell trans patients that. Cis women smoke on birth control and doctors never bat an eye, my doctor was well aware of that hypocrisy.
I get you I’ve been trying to get started on E it just keeps getting delayed and I don’t have an appointment with a psychiatrist until September. I feel like it’s taking forever for me too. However, I’m sure it’s worth the wait. Hang in there and we will both be there someday.
I’ve been anemic my entire life and starting even just a low dose of T fixed my anemia within a couple of months, no joke. If you’re in the US and can afford it, I’d recommend looking into a service like Plume if your doctor isn’t budging on this.
That sucks, I'm sorry. It also seems strange because T stimulates Red blood cell production, and reduces menstruation to boot. You'd think it would be actually help anemia.
Hey man! Come here! _Hugs_

I know how it feels to have to wait so long and then get denied. I was crushed. It wasn’t due to my health however it was due to them gate keeping me.

You might enjoy [RadPax](https://youtube.com/c/RadPaxOfficial), he’s in a similar predicament and his videos helped me.
I can confirm testosterone increases Red bloodcell count and hemoglobin.

It will fix your anemia in a couple months.
I agree with others, I recommend getting a second opinion, preferably from an endocrinologist who has experience with HRT and trans folks. 

Otherwise, if you ultimately decide with your health care team that you need to wait, just know it's okay to grieve and be sad about this. Let yourself feel your feelings and consider making a goal to work on in the meantime so you still feel like you are making progress (like voice training since that causes you a lot of dysphoria).
Just know that we are here for you. 

Maybe get a journal, and each day, give yourself one page to rant, and another clean page for your gratitudes and dreams...
I am also anemic and highly recommend Floradix. They have liquid and pill form and I take the pill form because it’s a little cheaper on iherb. Good luck!
Do you drink diet drinks?
wait you cant start hrt if you're anemic? shiiiit bro im also anemic
thank you i’ll definitely try 🤞
Thank you!! I will definitely bring this up
I have to get blood test done every 6 months to make sure I'm not over producing because I'm on T. And a friend of mine has to donate blood every so often to regulate their hgb because they're on T.
So to follow what you're saying: T makes the body produce more blood.
Whattt, this is the first time I’ve heard this. I’ll definitely look into it now or find a different health provider asap because that’s not sitting right with me
AFAB tend to be more likely to have anemia due to our monthly cycle so if that stops while you're on T then that could completely change for someone
I know it did for me, I'm FtM and have been on T for over a year and I'm anemic. I still have some issues but after I stopped losing all that blood every month I stopped waking up with 20 random bruises on my limbs 🥲
thank you!! i’m hoping time will pass as fast for me
You’re 100% right. It just sucked to hear the news but I’ll manage. I’ll def see what I can do in the mean time, thank you!
thank you so much 🤍🤍
thank you 🤍🤍🤍
nah i only drink water, coffee, and tea and nothing else
I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone, in my case this happened because my anemia was messing with my heart rate making it abnormally low, i was fainting, getting dizzy, was very pale and had the common symptoms for months but only got diagnosed when it was far too late and needed two blood transfusions. I feel a lot better but my family doctor who was with me through the process kind of just made the excuse to not let me start HRT because they think my health is unpredictable atm. This is even after I did another round of labs and everything came back significantly better and I have felt fine since. 

You may be able to start HRT despite being anemic, I think my situation was more personal and a bit targeted between me and my doctor so definitely don’t stress yourself out thinking you won’t be able to get it one day 😅 hope I didn’t worry you
im in the army and has taken months to be seen by anyone, and have to wait months for it to move forward anymore, and have no clue how long this is truly going to take. i dont think ive related to anything recently as hard as “been waiting practically my whole life to transition amd having delays is going to be tough”
Honestly most health providers know sooo little about trans specific health care. Unless your provider is a trans specific practitioner, unfortunately trans people often have to do the job of educating our doctors about trans health. 

By all means find a new provider if that’ll make you most comfortable—id suggest looking for someone practicing in a lgbt health clinic or program. But unfortunately you may find your new provider is similarly unaware of this particular phenomenon. 

In the meantime, you could always try sending your current doctor information about t helping address anemia (maybe you can find something more reputable than a Reddit thread? Lol) and see what they say. Obviously you shouldn’t have to do the work to educate your own providers, but it’s the unfortunate reality of trans health care.
Yeah their initial blood panel- anemic
1st panel on HRT- no longer anemic and never went back
I was anemic before T, my levels are absolutely perfect now 8 months on T
No yeah I've been anemic my entire life on and off and my doc said T would likely fix that. My iron levels were low when I started and given that all my symptoms have basically stopped, I'd imagine my first blood test will be normal. They tell you if you don't have anemia *to* donate blood, so it makes sense that if you have anemia T will help. Obviously I'm not a doctor or anything, I've just been around a lot lmao.
Soon you will too mate!
👌
oh no worries! you didn't worry me at all, just a little shocked 🙇🏾 i hope you manage to start hrt soon!!"	wxlcm1	trans	461	0.99	2022-08-25 18:15:59
How do I even begin to tell my husband of 10 years that I want to transition (ftm)? My egg is about to crack!	I’ve posted on here before but I’m a 44 year old married mother of three beautiful children and I’ve been struggling bad lately. I’ve known since I was very young (5 y/o) that I was not in the right body. I’ve always known deep down that I am a male in a female body. I can’t keep hiding how I feel. My dysphoria has gotten so bad that all I can think of is how to fix this. I have an appointment next Friday to get on Testosterone, but I haven’t told my husband. Do I have to tell him? Should I tell him? I’m scared to tell him. I know he loves me dearly, but can he get past this? Will he still want to be with me? I think my sexuality would be considered “pansexual”. I am attracted to people for who they are not their gender and I would love to transition and stay with my husband. I’m terrified to tell him but I can’t function anymore. All I think about is how bad I wish I could share my feelings with him. Please help me figure out how to tell him❤️ Thank you.	"See if you can get a pamphlet or something from a local trans organisation, it could help get the conversation started. I find using props for difficult conversations helps.

Maybe your husband will no longer be sexually interested in you post transition, maybe he just isn't into men. Maybe he'll love you even more for being a fuller version of yourself. There's no way to know until you know.♥️
I have been with my wife for 14 years. I told her on year 10 that I was a man.

Two months later, she told me she was a woman. It's been a wild ride, since
here's how:

""..I’ve been struggling bad lately. I’ve known since I was very young (5 y/o) that I was not in the right body. I’ve always known deep down that I am a male in a female body. I can’t keep hiding how I feel. My dysphoria has gotten so bad that all I can think of is how to fix this. I have an appointment next Friday to get on Testosterone.."" ... and as much as I want this, I want your support and want this to bring us closer together, not further away.  I know this is a lot, and want to give you space to process this and then maybe we can talk about it again if you want. 

&#x200B;

\^ maybe some sort of angle, just being honest and saying essentially what you said above
You should definitely tell him. You can't control him by keeping secrets, and you'll hurt both of you by trying. I won't lie, he might not be able to take it. It's awful, but it's not the end of the world. As scary as it is, you'll chart a course forward and get through it. Remember that you're a strong, amazing person, even if it doesn't feel like it at the moment.

Just be direct, be honest about how you feel, and trust that he'll do the same. Make sure neither of you make any snap decisions, too. Partners of trans people that come out tend to go through some similar feelings, and it's a process that can take a couple of weeks (more or less) to run through. There's the panic and identity crisis at first, maybe with some denial. Then there's the mourning for the old you, going through their normal progression of grief (assuming they know how to mourn properly). Then they build up trust again, usually pretty quickly as they realize that you weren't a stranger that bodysnatched their partner.
I’m hope to give you… some hope.  I’m MTF and I’ve been with my spouse for 23 years now.  We are high school sweethearts.  I was terrified to tell her how I was feeling for years and suppressed it to the point i was suicidal.  After I decided to tell her, which took close to a year, it was rough.  We always promised never to leave each other  and meant “until death do us apart”, but this, this really tested everything we were.  It was rough those first few years but now, she has come to embrace it and is super supportive.  We go on dates still, shop together, and I couldn’t be happier.  I know some times she struggles but I show her how much I love her in the same ways I always have.  Still bring flowers for her, take her on outings by ourselves, and sill open the door for her.  What I’m saying is, its a 50/50 chance this can go badly or go great, but you wont know until you take “a leap of faith”.  At the end you need to be happy with yourself and as you can see from my experience, it can be detrimental to bottle it in.  So dont do that and be honest.  It will be tough, but hopefully love will prevail.  Best of luck love…
You should head over to r/mypartneristrans and talk with them.
MtF but I was exactly there 6 months ago.  I could not stop the feeling that I was a woman anymore. 

My wife of 17 years new I was struggling with something but had no idea what.  I wanted to protect her and the marriage along with our 9 year old daughter and tried to convince myself that it would be better to just hold it in.  

I came to realize that hiding myself was a massive lie and that if I tried to continue I would destroy myself and probably my marriage too.  I was already starting to break.

One night as she had many nights before, she asked what’s wrong and I just told her.  I think I’m transgender and need for transition.  She cried and told me her husband was dead.  It was the hardest conversation of my life. 

Six months later we are closer than we have been in years.  She is my strongest ally and bought me my first piece of jewelry.  We still have a long journey together and neither knows where it will end (we never did anyway) but we remain a loving married couple and parents.

My story isn’t everyone’s but keeping the marriage IS possible.  

I hope you find the courage
You're going to have to tell him, sooner rather than later. You owe it to him to let him decide whether he wants to stay with you while you transition *before* you start. You have to be prepared for the possibility of his not being supportive and let him go if that's what he wants to do. I was in the same boat as you and I had to be ready to transition alone. It was hard, but I couldn't keep up the facade any longer.

When you tell him, just sit him down and tell him you have something you need to say, and then tell him you *are going to transition*, not that you *want to* transition or that you're *thinking about* it. Tell him that you're still the same person he fell in love with, it's just that your body and your mind/heart/soul don't match up, so you need to fix that. Make it clear you want to still be with him so he doesn't automatically assume you'll want to be with a woman since you're a man (some people, unfortunately, may assume this, in my experience). Finally, consider not telling him you're pansexual in the same conversation unless the question of sexuality comes up. You can definitely tell him, but give him a chance to process each thing one at a time.

Keep in mind that this is my advice based off of my own experience and you can handle it however you feel is best. Whatever you do, I wish you luck and strength.
Very difficult conversation to have. From a cis person’s point of view they almost see it as losing someone. They can get overly dramatic about it. He will eventually find out when the testosterone starts kicking in. I’m somewhat in a similar position as you starting estrogen in secrecy. It ultimately comes down to are you gonna tell them or is HRT gonna tell them for you. Having HRT come out of the closet for you could provoke a huge emotional response and it could hurt the trust you had as being a married couple. From what I’ve seen it’s hard for them to see you as the same person even if you are on the inside. There in turn making it harder for them to love you in the same way they did pre transition. I hope it is a smooth transition and your husband isn’t mean about it or anything.
i’m really sorry, i won’t be much help on this issue but i can sympathise with you and i understand it’s a difficult one to navigate so i wish you the best of luck <33 i would say you should tell him, even just because the changes on testosterone will eventually be noticeable and because he deserves the truth, given he will find out sooner or later. however i know that’s easier said than done, and i can’t offer help on how to tell him. i really hope you are able to work this out, the best of luck to you on your journey <3
Hey Awesome! It sounds like you've cracked alright!!!

You need to be honest with your husband about what you are feeling.
Please, whatever you do, give him some time to digest.  You'll feel relieved after you get this weight off of you, just to inadvertently throw it onto him. Just give him some time and let him go through the grieving process before you jump to conclusions by deciding how the rest of your life will go. 

This is coming from a Married 43 MtF with 2 children that came out to my wife a couple months ago.  At first she was supportive yet angry. Now, a couple months later we are doing better than we have in the past 15 years! Hope for the best and prepare for the worst they say. 

About the T.....no,no,no, not until he knows about your gender change and is past grieving.   This would just compound an already tough situation.   

Best of luck to you and yours!

I think you need to tell him before your appointment. It will likely be hard for him but going on T before telling him *will* make it harder.

I don't really have much advice for actually *doing* it sadly, my coming out to my wife was influenced by me trying to figure out where I fit in the whole LGBTQIA community and she knew this, so a day or two after I accepted it myself she asked if I had any more thoughts on it and I ended up breaking down and just telling her.

Like others she took it kind of hard at first, I had repressed everything so much there weren't really any signs for her so it came out of nowhere, but I'd been depressed and troubled the whole time we've known each other and just seeing how *happy* I was able to be as myself helped her see how real this was. 8 months in we're stronger than ever. 

I hope he can see how much it means for you to be able to be yourself but even if he's 100% accepting there's still a chance he's just not attracted to guys. As painful as this can be I know there are trans people that have gone through it and while they came out divorced they were still able to be the best of friends.

It's terrifying but you can do this brother 💙
I feel like you definitely have to tell him, but for his sake. And not because of like ""what if he leaves me"" but simply for the fact that youve mothered his children, that youve been with him for 10 years. So i feel like after all that he deserves to know about what you're going through. Although please keep in mind that i am no more than an 18 year old mtf who has never been married so like- take it with the ENTIRE Himalayan salt mine. :)
Do you have to tell him? No. 

But he is definitely going to notice after you go on T and that conversation would probably be a whole lot more awkward than telling him up front and getting it over with. 

Unless you think there is a potential safety issue with telling him then it's going to be the easiest and best thing to do to tell him in advance.
Be honest and expect any emotions. Its just as confusing to your partner as to us. First time I told my partner they cried but -in their own words- because of the shock. Its not something a lot of people expect and it can be full of emotions.

Try to remain calm and state why you feel this way, what it means for you inside your relationship and what do you expect to happen in the following years of transition. 

If your husband loves you, i'm sure they will go through this giant challenge besides you,  and deal with it in different ways than you.

Much love and good luck
Yeah, this is the hard part! (or one of them). But it's definitely up there.

I told my wife of 7 years that I was MtF last October. She's still with me! She struggles from time to time, still getting used to all the new things, and so do I, but we're still together and taking it one day at a time. Idk if this will be true for your or not, but one of the mistakes I made that made things harder on my wife than they probably had to be was this: I came out to her before I really knew what everything meant. I thought I was nonbinary or something, without really even knowing what ""nonbinary"" meant - at the time I couldn't fathom being transgender. So I left her in limbo for like a month while I got a therapist and figured everything out. I wish I could go back in time and wait to tell her until I knew for sure what I was doing! So just be honest and tell him everything!

My 2.5 y/o daughter, on the other hand, couldn't care less that I wear makeup now lol. Best of luck, my man! :)
>Do I have to tell him?

Yes, for both of your sake's.  There is only so much of a transition that you can hide and your goals may go well beyond what can be explained away.  But while you do that, you are lying.  A relationship can withstand many hardships, but it cannot endure deceit for long.

>I’m scared to tell him. I know he loves me dearly, but can he get past this? Will he still want to be with me?

I wish I could answer this, but I can't.  What's more, if he can't get past it, it very well can be outside of his control.  

Having said that, there is something very important to know going in: he *is* going to need time to sort it out for himself.  Because when you get past all of the details of why you're asking, what you are asking is for them to accept that you are someone other than the person they fell in love with.  He'll need time to understand who the new you is and how that is different.  And he'll need time to mourn the version of you that is gone, the one that never was.

>Please help me figure out how to tell him❤️ Thank you.

I don't know him.  I don't know you for that matter.  But I do understand the pain, the *need*.  This means that I cannot tell you the right words or order the ideas in the best possible way, but what I can offer is this:  you must be honest.  Right now you have a thousand different ideas running through your head and a few haphazard steps for a plan.  Right now, you quite literally don't and can't know the answer to questions he is likely to ask.  If he asks about a step in a plan you don't understand, then that is exactly what you should tell him.  If he asks about your goals and you don't know what they are, tell him that, too.  Tell him that you love him and want him to stand by you.  Tell him that you're as terrified and confused as you actually are, and if you find a scrap of courage beyond the mountain it takes to simply being, tell him about that too.  And if the conversation is too much for you, tell him that, too.

When I came out, I couldn't think of a way to do it properly.  Even now, almost a year later, I still don't know what the best way might have been.  Things were too raw, too confused, and I was too god damn terrified for cleverness or nuance.  I brought up one thing, one specific thing that I couldn't possibly hide where it to happen and asked my spouse's opinion.  That tiny wedge was just enough room to have the next talk, and then the next and the next.  The full process of my coming out took *months*.  Each conversation was hard, but each one was easier than the last.  In part this was because I have thus far been lucky enough to have a spouse who *could* accommodate the change, in part it was because each bit of honesty makes the next one easier, but most of it was that it was only when I started a transition that I could truly comprehend what the hell I was doing, what transitioning really means to me.  

The first conversation is the hardest, but you need to have it.  Because no matter what happens, if he loves you, he would not want you to love a life consumed by pain that no words can express.  If he loves you he would want to know the truth even though that truth is going to hurt him - at least a little, at least for a while.
I honestly think you should sit down and as scared as you might be and how hard this will be you have to tell him , I hope that he is willing to stay by your side and I hope you nothing but the best. But pls remember your happiness comes first always, you do what you have to do just be strong and I’m so happy for you for taking this big step in your life ! Your so strong you got this man .
You gotta tell him before you start hrt. I wrote my wife a letter. It's been hard but we're okay. There are absolutely couples that stay together. SOFFA has resources for partners of transgender people.

I was in the same boat...just ftm and I was Petrified. 
I know I cannot speak for your husband but just be you.
explain how you feel and what its doing to you.
My wife fully embraced it after I told her she is even more my best friend now...if that's even possible 
Who knows maybe he'll become your best ally 💕
We shop together....everything  I just wish I would have told her sooner
Oh my gosh, there is so many great suggestions on here.  Coming out is the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. Be true to yourself, your kids, and your husband.  You have a husband and kids who love you dearly.  Be ready for maybe three different reactions… what you wrote here, and the responses given is a great start.  There are no 100% right answers, no canned method, we all have to find a way that works for is individually.  I’m sorry I’m not much help, but it does get better.  Even with initial rejection, some do come around.  Sending you love and support in your journey, maybe find local groups to talk to, but also be careful with those, taking on others issues while dealing with your own can be tough.  I’d look towards other F2M people, with kiddos and husband…. Having something in common for a new friend might be a great start.  Oh and don’t let your family find out… tell them, that can help.
That was me 2 years ago. I'm 28 and I've been with my husband for 12 years. I pretty much just told him that I was sure I am a man. He was of course a bit shaken but was very supportive. There was a lot of processing and a bit of grieving involved, but we're still together and I'll start hrt soon.
Your egg is cracked bro.

Tell your husband he’s about to have one hell of a gym buddy.
Hey! Ftm pre-t here who’s engaged to a woman who identified as liking women. I was super scared to tell my fiancé because she was the first person I came out to and I love her dearly. My only piece of advice is that taking it slow might help. I simply sat her down one day and explained how I’d been feeling and how I needed to explore this side of myself. She was understanding, encouraging, and helped me buy a binder. She also told me she would not leave me because despite any changes she loves me.

We’re taking baby steps basically. When she first saw me in a binder she said “WOW” I liked it so much more than I thought I would. She enjoys me packing and trying different underwear. She gets a little nervous about being on T, mainly because she doesn’t want to snuggle my facial hair, but we make lighthearted jokes and she gets more comfortable with the idea every day.

I know your experience may be different, but I just wanted to share. Taking it slow will give your partner time to process and understand you. I know you said you have a T appointment soon so this may or may not be something you’re open to but I do think for someone who doesn’t know they’ll need time to process or it may be a but overwhelming for them. Hope this helps!
Just dont. You will break him.
I really don't think that would be a good idea. I told my girlfriend that I wanted to be a woman. She killed herself 1 month ago
This is a super tough call. Obviously you have to tell him at some point. Sometimes people can surprise you. I MTF came out to my fiancé years ago. She told me she loved me for me regardless of my gender. But I went into the conversation prepared for the worst. 

When I came out to everyone I was called selfish by the people that left. In a way that’s true. For once you are thinking about yourself and what’s good for your physical and mental health. When you have spent your hole life living for everyone else in pain. I don’t know how to help you but I hope my bit did in some way. I wish you all the best and I hope your husband understands. 🙏
first off, good luck, op! :) being able to physically transition made my mental health absolutely skyrocket, and I hope going on t brings you nothing but happiness.

to parrot a lot of people here, I would definitely advise telling your husband you're starting testosterone -- you want him to find out through you telling him, not on accident. I've always found it easiest to tackle tough conversations by biting the bullet and diving right in. also, remember that you're partners; you're in this together. I've found it a lot easier to communicate with partners by reassuring myself that we're working with each other, not against each other. try and find a low-stress time, and remember that it's not bad if he needs a little bit of space afterwards to come to terms.

it seems like you two have a strong relationship, so even if he ends up no longer attracted to you, I hope you two will be able to remain close :)! in addition, while obviously you don't have to wait for him to come around if this does happen -- many of my family members were transphobic towards me when I first came out, but in the following years they all came to terms with it and are now some of my strongest supporters. even if his initial reaction might not be good, he may turn back around.
I've told my wife the truth, that I have issues since childhood and it's getting worse with age, that I had to visit sexuolog and psychologist to determine my issues and that the solution for relief and better mental state is HRT. I've not certainly said I'd like to present fem on public and be outed to all possible people at work etc. If I would say that with requirement of bottom surgery I'm almost certain our marriage would end immediately. So I'm trying to handle situation that way, just medical transition (MtF). After year on hormones I have zero passing anyway, but it's not super important for me luckily, but HRT is super important for my mental health.
update?
That’s a great idea using a prop or pamphlet. It’s hard to know how someone will react to such life changing news but hopefully he loves me for being me.🥰
My husband has always been really feminine and I wonder sometimes if this could be us. I’ve secretly wondered also if he might be closeted on some things. I guess we’ll see. Hopefully me being honest will open the door for him too.
Eggs that found each other that’s really cute!
Thank you. I was kind of thinking the same thing as I was typing my original post. If I just speak from the heart and I’m honest that will mean a lot to him. Hopefully 🙏
That’s true. I’ve came out to my mom and she’s having a hard time excepting that she doesn’t have a daughter anymore. Grief is part of the process I guess. I don’t want to start this transition with secrets and lies. I want to be open and honest with him. And like you said, life will go on no matter what. Thank you!
Thank you! I really needed to hear this! You’re definitely best case scenario. I’m so happy for you❤️ My husband and I have been thru a lot and hopefully this will be like all the other times and we can get thru it together. Sometimes I can’t stand him but I’m all honestly he’s my best friend.
Cool. Thank you!
Thank you so much. It’s like you’re in my head. I feel the same about if I keep trying to hide who I am it will destroy me or my marriage. He knows something has been bothering me but he thinks it’s because I don’t love him anymore. That’s not true it’s because I don’t like myself. I can’t stand to look in the mirror because of my dysphoria. I feel like I could be a much better partner if I was able to be my true self. It’s so inspiring to hear your story and know that it is possible 🥰
I love it! Thank you so much. I understand what you’re saying and absolutely agree. It won’t be easy but I think what you said is the best way to go about it. Just rip the bandage off and be honest. At least I won’t be hiding things from him. I hate hiding how I feel. I want to share with him and do this together I just hope he feels the same way.
Thank you. That’s what I’m afraid of. I don’t want the HRT telling him for me. I guess I need to get ready for a tough conversation.
Thank you for your kind words. I agree with you that he deserves to know it’s just just scary thinking of him reacting badly. If the shoe was on the other foot I would want to know. Hopefully he’ll be more understanding than I think.
That’s what I was thinking. I hate to unload all of this on him but it’s what I have to do. I will try very hard to be understanding with him and let him take the time he needs. It’s hard not to rush though when I feel like I’ve waited so long. I’m happy to hear that you are doing well after coming out. I hope he is as understanding as your spouse🥰
Thank you. I’m working on that as we speak 🥰
That’s good to know. I’ve always wondered if he might could be bisexual but never confirmed it. I hope he loves me for what’s inside and we can get thru the rest of it together. I’m glad it worked out for you guys. At least I know there’s hope🥰
Lol! You’re sweet🥰 I agree that he definitely needs to know. Especially after reading some of these great posts. I love my Reddit family. I do envy your generation, but in the same breath I’m so happy that you guys won’t have to grow up with quite as much hate as the LGBTQ has had to endure in the past. Good luck beautiful! You seem like a really cool gal.
Yeah I think your right. Being up front and honest will be the best way to handle this for sure.
Thank you for this. It’s going to be hard I just hope it all works out for the best.
That’s so sweet. I bet your daughter loves you no matter what🥰 I hope we can be as lucky as you and make it thru this together. I’ll definitely understand if he doesn’t feel the same way but I’m hoping for the best.
Thank you so much for your kind words and great response. I feel like this is the hardest thing that I will ever do. And I definitely have thousands of thoughts running thru my head with no rhyme or reason. I’m hoping like you said that he sees how much this is hurting me to live a lie and wants to help me and stand by me while we go thru this together. I love him and hope this works.
I think you’re right. It’s gonna be hard but it’s gotta be done. I know it will be such a relief to get this off my chest.
Thank you! I’m going to the site now😁
This is what I’m so hoping for🥰
I would recommend not bringing up to him that you feel he is feminine and might be closeted on some things. My wife came out to me within the last year. Then a few months ago she mentioned to me that she would be supportive of me if I also felt the need to transition and listed of some of the reasons she thought I might also be trans. I was not in the best space mentally to consider that at all and was kind of mad at her for even bringing it up. I’ve come to realize that she was right and I’m definitely not cis. I just would’ve appreciated being able to work through that at my own, much slower, pace. 

There are a lot of feelings to work through as a spouse when your partner tells you they’re trans. And it will take some time for him. But I’m hoping he’s supportive and you’re able to work through this together! And even if he isn’t, being able to finally be you is worth it.
I really hope it works out, my dude. And good luck with your transition!
I have also had an overwhelmingly positive experience with my husband. He said that we signed up for a life together and this is part of it. He loves me and is deeply happy for me. He's been my biggest supporter through my transition. It was scary to tell him, but it went really well and our relationship has only improved since then
>Cool. Thank you!

You're welcome!
You're welcome! I hope he feels the same way, too.
Just take your time to plan it out HRT won’t make you a noticeable in a day. Some of the comments here had some good ideas on how to have that conversation. Also don’t be too hard on yourself being trans it’s a hard journey for pretty much all of us.

edit: I’m so sorry for poor word choice! i meant to say noticeable instead of man. You are already a man about to start second puberty and I’m sure you will turn out to be a very handsome man! :)
That's a very good perspective. Telling him shows him that you trust him, and it respects the trust that he's put into you. 

Not telling him runs the risk of damaging your relationship and his trust in you.
Thanks for the reply.  You got this! 

I read down a bit to see where you say your husb is femme....... Ya never know until you do. 
Hard work pays off... Good luck awesome!

It's possible he could be. And sometimes folks hit the jackpot and their ""straight"" partner learns they're ""straight *except for*"" I don't want to get your hopes TOO far up because that outcome is probably the most rare but it HAS happened
Well good luck okay ! You got this sending nothing but positive energy your way 🙏🏽
This, so much this. Telling someone you think they might be trans is pretty much never helpful. Feel free to think whatever you want, but i would recommend keeping your hypotheses of your spouse's gender identity to yourself, and let them go through that journey themselves, at their own pace
Oh no. I would never say that to him. I just have had my doubts on exactly how straight/cis he really is. It’s up to him to bring that up. I would hate for him to bring that up to me. I am hoping that my honesty will give him the room and freedom to tell me anything that he might need to talk about.
Also, some guys are just feminine. Defying gender stereotypes doesn't mean you're automatically an egg.
Hard agree. My ex kinda egged me on into doing… well, egg shit. In the long run I guess it helped me come to terms with myself but at the time she was just making me feel really insecure.
Thank you!
Omg! I’m literally crying right now. Thank you for this. I might be wishful thinking but I really hopes he reacts the same way with unconditional love and support 🥰
Thank you. I’m definitely being hard on myself. I feel like if it goes wrong I’m the one that destroyed our family. I know I shouldn’t think like this but I struggle with guilt, depression and anxiety bad. I’m hoping the testosterone and feeling like the real me will help with these feelings.
Fingers crossed 🤞
Thank you!
I hope so too!

My wife wasn’t being malicious at all. She really was just trying to be supportive. But I wasn’t ready to confront that side of me with the other stuff going on in my life. 

It was hard for me at first when she came out to me. I didn’t understand. Mostly because I’d always hated being a woman and had never felt comfortable. But I thought that’s just how it was for everyone. So I couldn’t understand where she was coming from at that point. I also had moments of feeling like I’d been lied to and that she wasn’t the person I married. And, in all honesty, she isn’t anymore. And neither am I. We’ve both changed since we got married and we’ve both come to a point where we’re finally being honest with ourselves which is allowing us to be honest with each other. So it was strange at first. But for us, it’s brought us closer together. I feel like I know her better know than I ever have before and the increased confidence in her makes her glow. It may take him time to adjust. He’ll likely be confused. But I really hope it brings y’all closer together too!
I hope so too
You shouldn’t feel that way and I’m sure your kids will still love you the same. Many kids still love and respect their parents during transition. It could be hard for them at first but they will eventually see you as their father. Shame is a common obstacle many trans people deal with but it can go away. Loving yourself and accepting you are a man will make you happier. I believe HRT will help calm the dysphoria and be happier in your body. Seeing that you are in your 40s it looks like you really repressed those feelings. I feel bad for your generation of trans people because of how transphobic and homophobic gen X is.
I hope it brings us closer too. We’re not getting any younger so every minute counts.
Thank you. You get it. It’s crazy but I was raised by a very homophonic family. I have so much guilt and shame from it all. I think that’s part of why it’s taken so long to come out. I’m terrified of losing my family and friends. My mom acted all cool when I first told her but now she’s being all passive aggressive towards me. It will all be worth it in the end I hope!
[deleted]
You are a very wise young person. It’s like you’re an “old soul”❤️ I can’t speak for your mom but I would love my kids no matter what. I tell them that as long as they are happy I will be happy. It’s their life to live and make the best of it that they can. That is kind of funny karma for your mom and dad, but they should still love and support you through anything. I think you are awesome and I truly hope it all works out for you. Even though my mom is acting all weird I’m still glad that I told her. Hopefully she’ll come around. 🥰"	tfhn5s	trans	454	0.98	2022-03-16 13:26:40
I don't have gender dysphoria but I do wish I was born a girl	What does it mean	"Nobody can tell you if you're trans except you. But being trans does not require dysphoria. It only requires you to identify with a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth. From there, it's up to you to explore and see who you might really be.  

Check out genderdysphoria.fyi for some more stories and info.  

Good luck!
if you view yourself as a woman you are probably a woman. dysphoria is just a reaction some people have to having anatomy that doesn't correlate with their gender. like all unfortunate circumstances, everyone reacts to those circumstances differently
I think that is gender dysphoria by definition
Dysphoria is not needed to be trans. Whether your wish to be born a girl and other things in your life is enough for you to question the gender you were born with is something you need to figure out for yourself though. A therapist can help a lot with that so that would be a good first step.
What you're discribing *is* gender dysphoria.
try and look up stories of trans people and see if you can relate
So no one can tell you definitively that you're trans that is something for you to figure out... But more often than not if you wish you were another gender... That is probably your gender. Dysphoria isn't required to be trans it's more about how you identify and the euphoria you get from experiences that make you feel more like that gender
I don't have much physical disphoria, but I do have a fair amount from how I was raised and the stark difference between ""boys"" and ""girls"" in the eyes of my family. I don't consider dysphoria a prerequisite to transness. Only you can decide what will ultimately make you happy. Good luck!
This is how I felt too. I had no dysphoria until I started experiencing euphoria from transitioning. Just the simple things like hearing my close friends call me by my chosen name gave me euphoria. But then hearing my parents who don’t really understand call me by my dead name gave me dysphoria.

Originally I thought that I would just live life as a boy because it would be easier than dealing with transphobes and potentially losing friends and family. But after some serious depression, I decided to take that risk and start. And I couldn’t have been happier with my choice. 

We all come to the realization we’re trans or not in similar and different ways. This is the start of your journey to discovery.
Wishing you were born a girl is dysphoria, imho. 
(I did too - and it’s part of what helped me see myself)
That's okay! You don't have to have dysphoria to be trans. A lot of people just experience gender euphoria (I e. Joy at being gendered correctly). Wishing you were a girl is the number one symptom (jokingly used) of being a girl
Judging by the things you've described in some of your other posts and the frequency you've been having these thoughts, I'd say that you are almost 100% trans. Really though, just do what makes you feel happy. If you start transitioning and feel like it's not right for you, then you can always go back (unless you've gotten changes from  hormones, but at that point you'd most definitely know if you're trans or not, so there's no need to worry about that).
I never thought about it until I was three months out from my first bodybuilding show. I caught myself naked in the mirror and said ""my genitals disgust me"", then I cried in silence for a week straight. I knew from that moment but denied it. I'm currently in the experimenting stage and have been having a lot of deep memories come unlocked where I realized I didn't like being a guy. Now I fantasize being a woman.

Regardless, you need to take time to explore things and play around. See what you actually enjoy, see what makes you feel good
you should see a therapist before you make any permanent decisions
Given what little you've said on the topic, I would say that you may be feeling gender EUPHORIA. Just a valid an indicator as dysphoria, gender euphoria is the positive feeling associated with identifying with, well, your true gender. Unfortunately, I can't really tell you more beyond that. Could you provide more information?
dysphoria is NOT required to be trans, just a common byproduct
I thought that but when I did a dysphoria test turns out I’m Trans, so have an appointment with endocrinologist at the beginning of October.
Must admit I’m looking forward to it.
But do I go dressed as a male? Or as I see myself, female.
you remind me of myself
Ask yourself, even if you are fine right now, would you be happier if you were a girl?

If there was a button to instantly change you to be a woman with no negative consequences would you do it?

If the answer is yes to either of these you may be trans. I would talk with a therapist specializing in gender identity to work through this a bit more
Same
That is gender dysphoria, gender dysphoria just mean your assigned gender don’t align with how you feel and how you identify.

Their are also two kind of dysphoria, physical dysphoria (feeling dysphoric about your body, clothes etc…) and social dysphoria (bien dysphoric abour how people perceive you, how they gender you, how they call you) in some case it can also include how you see/gender/name yourself

Also you don’t need dysphoria to be trans, you just need to identify as trans
Means whatever you want it to mean. If you want a girl body you can take steps to go do that. I'm a trans guy who didn't have dysphoria and I took things one at a time and decided yea I think the results of hrt would be an improvement, yea male pronouns are much much better sounding, oh yea binding is annoying I'll have top surgery. I more or less considered the pros and cons of every part in the process and did what I wanted to do.

The thing is just you may not be dysphoric, you may not be in distress or feel out of place, but would you feel better by transitioning? Would it improve your life and make you happier? That's gender euphoria, where aligning with a certain gender makes you happy. I never felt tortured as a woman, but when I was compared to men or mistaken for men or did things ""for men"" it made me smile. So I figured it would be nice to just try to make that happen every day.
Wishing you were born a girl is not a thing Cis men think fun fact
Those words have meaning that are specific to you. What about girl life seems different than your life, specifically? What are you defining that you actually want? That definition is yours, so some limitations of current you vs. perceived girl life is yours too. Keep listening to yourself for questions AND answers (as well as turning to others).💜🏳️‍⚧️
If you're asking, you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans. Some people have euphoria, others don't. Only YOU can know if you're trans or not.
Listen, no dysphoria doesn't  mean you are not transgender. You can be trans without dysphoria or cisgender with dysphoria. Maybe you just don't have dysphoria now or you wont have it at all. I didn't think I had dysphoria until I heard a recording of my voice. It is just different for everyone
[deleted]
I felt just the same, but then when i started to transition very very slowly, i found out many of my self desteucting habbits have fallen away, without too much effort. So eventhough i never felt gender dyaphoria, i was actually still hurt. I know people here can go on forever about their gender but really, sometimes you can just see how things play out and decide for yourself with no specific identity in mind.
Its not simple I realised i was trans bc I wouldn't stop fantasising and wishing I was a girl. I didn't get dysphoria until recently. The best way to tell if ur trans is to try it out for a bit maybe try some pronouns and names.
It means what you want it to mean, it could be simple curiosity, or a genuine wish, afterall, not having dysphoria doesn't mean that you are any less valid than someone else
r/egg_irl

I'll just say that I basically told my sister the same thing when she came out as trans and like 3 years later I started transition.
[removed]
Same
I didn't experience gender dysphoria until I started presenting female, at that point every time I went out in male attire it hurt my soul more and more each time.

Dysphoria is a sign you're trans, but euphoria is a bigger one
Well, if you want to figure out if your trans/wanna transition. Try not to worry about the dysphoria, you don’t need to experience dysphoria to be trans. Maybe try presenting as a woman for some time and if you feel better like that then you’re more likely to be trans! And you could experiment with pronouns. It’s about the euphoria not the dysphoria.
you are trans
Dysphoria is not needed to be trans, but also dysphoria could be repressed. I didn't really had any dysphoria before I came out to myself or at least I thought so, but I after I accepted myself and started to understand myself better I realized I had sever dysphoria in my life. It's even got more stronger after I started hrt and my emotional levels turned to the maximum.
And you’re on trans reddits ;)
You don't have to have dysphoria to be trans. Somedays (ftm) I like wearing hot pants or high heels and just feel feminine AF with no dysphoria at all and sometimes I feel masc and just wear shorts and stuff. Though I always wear a chest binder when I go out no matter how long it may be
Still valid, whatever you are.  Dysphoria isn’t needed to be trans.  Dysphoria just means it is harder to pretend to be cis if you’re trans and that’s the route you choose.

This doesn’t mean you are trans.  You’ll have to explore this and find what makes you feel better and happier.  You could be a trans woman, you could be an feminine man, or you could be one of the non-binary genders.
That means you have gender dysphoria, las.
I think you have to ask yourself why you want to me a woman. Privilege? Looks? Body parts?

Gender dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re trans, just like how having a stomach ache doesn’t mean you’re going to be sick. 

If you’d like, I’d consider looking into therapy, as your definition *is* gender dysphoria.
Well, can’t you track your Amazon packages? I got something delivered before I came out to my parents. I just had my packages tracked and as soon as it was delivered I got it from the mail and brought it to my room. And again if you wanna go to the store without being questioned, buy feminine clothes with a birthday card or something.
It means exactly what you typed.
I’m honesty not sure ??
I feel the exact same way my friend.
You do not need dysphoria to be trans, no matter what anybody says, I'm trans, I don't have bottom dysphoria at all.
it means you’re like me!!  i’m transitioning because it makes me happy and you’ll have to find the same answer for yourself 💕
I don't think I had gender dysphoria when little, but I remember wishing I was a girl as long as I remember. Now however it feels like dysphoria is railing me in the ass, and not in a nice way.

So idk. I hate it
that probably still means your trans you don’t need to hate yourself just to want to be someone else you can just want to be someone or something else
Here’s the thing. Dysphoria isn’t always a super obvious chronic pain. It takes different forms and affects people differently. I felt the same way for a long time and it took a lot for me to unpack that I was trans, because my discomfort was really subtle, and I couldn’t always even call it discomfort. [This tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/transsalamander/status/947522372315369472) does a pretty good job of summarizing my slow realization that I was a woman.
I have this situation. My gender dysphoria is really weak and sometimes I can’t even feel it. But I really wish I was born a girl…I just want it so much.
you don't need dysphoria to be trans!
What do you mean ""identify""


I know that no one can tell me except myself but I just wish someone would just come to me, slap me in the face, grab me  and scream into my face ""hey! Your not trans/ you are trans!"" And would call it a day
Thank you for that I couldn't put in to words how I felt and this summed it up. I was always able to ignore my dysphoria, at least I thought I was until my therapist said ""maybe you get angry over feeling distress cuz it's easier for you to deal with"" she said it in a smarter way lol
that is scientifically incorrect
Say that my country where i must convince some doctors before even thinking on transition
Well I don't view myself as a woman but wish I were one
Right? I think there’s a gross misunderstanding of what “dysphoria” is. I find it kind of odd in these subreddits when someone is like “I hate being a man! I hate being masculine! I wish I was a woman! But I don’t have dysphoria, what does this mean?” And ppl are like “it’s ok, you don’t need dysphoria to be trans.” Like, y’all, they literally just described dysphoria.

From Wikipedia:

Gender dysphoria (GD) is the distress a person experiences due to a mismatch between their gender identity—their personal sense of their own gender—and their sex assigned at birth.

From the DSM5, the *first* qualifier of a dysphoria diagnosis:

A strong desire to be of a gender other than one's assigned gender
Seconded. A good gender therapist can help a lot. I knew I was a girl at age 4 and then the dysphoria really kicked in and started becoming unbearable at puberty and made my life a living hell for the next 20 years until I finally came out and started transitioning. Wish I had done it so, so, so much sooner. Good luck—and FWIW you sound like you’re trans from what you’ve said. 💗
Oh... I thought it was being uncomfortable with your gender. I'm not uncomfortable with my gender I just prefer another
Wait. There are non permanent transition thingys? Like what?
Yep. Scheduled one as of right now
Well I'll try..

I find myself thinking that if I was born a girl would be happier. I think girls have so many cool clothings and just look better in everyway, clothes, hair, makeup. Like I really wish I was born a girl. 
How I feel about my current body is more complicated. I don't feel good about it because I think I look like a sack of freshly picked potatoes but I don't feel uncomfortable in it. 

I didn't really know gender euphoria is even a thing until you explained it so I need to look into that...

Also if it means anything the only time people mistake me for a girl is when I'm on the phone and at the start it made me feel insecure about my manliness but now when and if it happens I just kinda let it happen and don't correct them. Though it didn't happen ever since I started questioning so idk.

TLDR: girls have cooler clothes, hair, make up etc and I don't feel anything about being a boy
Go as yourself is always the answer and no one can tell you otherwise
Yea I I think im going to go to a gender therapist
So people have told me this on other posts and to be honest I literally thought every man wanted to be a girl even if just abit and I'm still in shock from that
Wow yes that is alot. And I have a feeling I'll go back there often. Thanks for sharing the site!
Oh nice
What?
But I don't want to draw attention to myself so how can I experiment in secret?
Why do I want to be a woman? Tbh idk. I think it's just... Better In general? For example what for what you listed my answer: *yes*
I guess I could try to snatch the package before they notice? I'll give that a try.. I think I'll try s skirt and some kind of top idk anything else I should get or... 

I really don't know anything about this
Everyone feels their gender identity differently. So it's hard to exactly define ""identify"" in this context. But for me, I realized my body didn't really make me happy. I wasn't upset with my old body, but it wasn't really me. And when I thought about what it'd be like to be a girl and have the body of a girl, I realized that thought made me happy. And as I thought about it more, I realized I actually do identify with being a girl more than being a boy.  

You kind of have to figure it out for yourself though. Nobody's gonna slap you in the face and tell you you're trans. But lots of people will try and tell you you're not. So it'll be up to you to sift through the noise and figure out what's true.
Maybe this will resonate with you

[Gender desire vs gender identity](https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5)
Basically identifying in this case, would be whether you identify more as a Male or female, but in the inside, not what society expects of you.
This, unfortunately, is one of those things that no one can tell you but you. I will say, however, that euphoria is a more valid indicator of a transgender identity than dysphoria; imagining yourself as a girl and being happy with that image is just as valid as disliking your current body, if not more.  


A lot of the journey on realizing one's gender is self-reflection and hypotheticals, and the person who knows you the most is you. It will take time to sort things out, but it will be well worth it once you realize what you are. Even coming to the conclusion that you are cis (or not trans) is well worth it once you realize that feeling is because you identify with what you were born as, not just because it's the way things are.
Life is never this easy unfortunately. Figuring out whether you're trans and if you are then where to go from there is a whole process and takes time.
For me, I was just happier being called/referred to as a girl.  The first time I was hanging out with friends using my chosen name and she/her for me, I woke up the next morning (a monday) in an inexplicably good mood.  I'm the kind of person who usually hates Mondays.  That's just one dayapoint, obviously, but it's one of many for me.
Hey, you are trans. Slap.
lol that was mushrooms for me, i cant say you should go take shrooms but they did slap me in the face and say “you’re trans!!”
I can totally relate to that. I wish I could go to a therapist and have them tell me whether I’m transgender, or just crazy.
Haven’t been to one yet, but I get the feeling that’s not how it works.
I think you’re the only one who knows for sure. No one can tell you better than you can.
I neither have dysphoria nor really euphoria, I just instinctively knew that something wasn't right and eventually found the words to name it. on HRT and had top surgery now and it's much better now

You don't have to be trans to want gender affirming surgeries or change pronouns. you'll be aligned to us since your struggle with bigotry would be very similar and in a lot of countries might have to lie that you're trans to get those surgeries, because laws are bs. 

On a pure philosophical level; you can have she/her pronouns and not be trans. you can have surgeries without being trans. at what point you define your identity as ""I'm trans now"" is entirely up to you, and you can try it out and then if you realise you don't like it you can stop; there's absolutely nothing wrong with detransitioning and experimenting with gender is very healthy, no matter if you're cis or trans
I was like that. It's just a matter of trying new things, experiencing how it feels to you when you get treated like a girl. No one can tell you if you're trans or not because you have to find out what you truly desire.
I didn't say anything scientific in my post.
i'd say think about it a little longer. do you wish you had female anatomy? is that what you're saying?
all of the above replies are incredible, you may want to read them again. I don't view myself as a woman but wish I were one, you should then ask why??? what about being a woman makes you feel good, what about being a man doesn't make you sad but just does't feel right. you may or may not be trans but to wake up look at yourself and be happy with a great smile you may want to start with those questions. I have questioned myself my whole life and never new why, forever I thought I was gay since I like woman clothes but the thought of being with a man created no desire in me. I wished I had been born a woman and until I found this reddit I thought trans was just wrong, but I look at myself and think about being a woman does make me smile. It will probably never happen for me but i do feel better knowing who I am
Yeah, that's why the ""dysphoria debate"" has always confused me. It's like, if everyone just agreed on the definition of dysphoria we wouldn't need all this discussion around it.
The problem is that a lot of the way dysphoria is talked about, especially in cis media, is as an active hatred of one's own body.

I certainly disliked things about my body, but I didn't actively hate it. Also between thinking it was ""all surgery"" and not having stereotypical feminine interests I thought I couldn't be trans.

But for as long as I could remember I wished I'd been born a girl. Despite being a ""cishet white guy"" I felt my life would be better as a girl.

The biggest realization of my life was recognizing my indifference about my body *was* dysphoria.
Different people expereince it in different ways, but how you say you feel absolutely falls under the umbrella of gender dysphoria, and lots of trans people feel the same way.
You could try clothes, makeup, wigs, jewelry, or anything else that makes you feel like a woman.
Well, on the outside I’m male, but inside I believe female. So which one?
🤷‍♂️
Hm, maybe try dressing as female in private and I mean, I saw some people experimenting with different names and pronouns on Reddit asking them to call them with the name and pronouns. Just to start to see how it feels? You could also try some makeup?
Then there’s a possibility you could be trans. Or, it could just be a thought. Look into the community; this sub has a lot of great posts detailing peoples experiences discovering their gender identity.
Yeah, we’ll good luck. If you need, just make up an excuse.
This was such good read. Thank you for sharing it, I needed it.

""For some of us, thinking of gender as an option to pursue rather than a deeply-held sense of self can be very freeing. It gives us permission to move forward rather than remain stuck in our own heads, wondering if we’re “trans enough”, whether our suffering is great enough to justify seeking treatment.""
It resonated with me just now. Thanks for sharing
That was what i had to read right now. Thank you a lot.
I cried reading this thank you so much for sharing 💕
There are other gender identities to branch off into! But yeah, the gender journey is all about coming to terms with who you are on the inside; the LGBTQIA+ community is a shelter for those of us whose gender identity does not align with society's views--and that includes questioning, as you are right now--but we can't really assign you a gender for you.
*with every moment I believe you more and more*

Until I go eat sushi and then not think about trivial things like ""gender""
*yes*

If there was a button I could press that would make it as If I was born a girl I would press it
To be honest I don't know. I just feel like women can be more.. themselves?

Also I may not respond to every comment but I do read every single one multiple times
I think there *is* an agreed upon definition for dysphoria already, as described by WPATH. I think the problem is lots of ppl just don’t understand that dysphoria doesn’t just mean “I hate my masculine body and I want to die” it also can be “I really, really wish I was a girl and people treated me as such”. Those are both textbook dysphoria.
Huh... Well thanks!
Would you be comfortable going as a female? If so then go as a female
Did that guy post a transphobic comment or am I wrong?
I guess I could try that but I have no idea how to get clothes without my parents knowing. My mom knows I'm questioning but I told her ""I'm just wondering nothing more"" while it is Abit more. Plus I think she is Abit transphobic but idk. 

I do have my own credit card so I could order from Amazon but they deliver to my house so idk how I'll hide that. Maybe I could find a way to tell them to deliver to a pickup spot. Idk
Don't think. Be. It should come to you as natural as the falling rain or the rising tide.
from what you're telling me i would say you are trans. but only you can really know that
Heh. I suggest you go check out transmasc spaces and see how little you relate to what is there :) There are people who legitimately feel more free being seen as men, just as there are people who feel more free being seen as women; there are people who feel more free confusing people everywhere! Idk, this may or may not help you.
The dsm 5 requirements also include 
> The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning  

which is probably where the ""you don't need dysphoria to be trans"" crowd comes from (at least it's my reason for holding this position)
So based on your definition, does that mean every trans person has experienced gender dysphoria?
I think I would, I don’t wear make up or wigs, I already have long blonde hair, so just jeans, blouse and heels. Oh and bra bra and panties of course 🫢
I’m kinda hoping she’ll confirm my dysphoria test results.
Probably, I honestly don’t know
Yeah.. I mean, do you have any female friends you could borrow clothes from? Or if you can drive then maybe go to a store and buy some stuff? If your worried about someone judging you then you could say it’s for your girlfriend. Or you don’t have to- just if you want.
That's... Arguably even harder... But I'll try to be myself.


*Oh shit have I ever really been myself?*
I'd have to think about longer to make sure it's not my sleep deprived self thinking these things but idk maybe
Ya that’s kinda my point. I’m not sure I fully understand the “being trans without dysphoria” stance. Cause my understanding is that dysphoria is a feeling like you’re uncomfortable with your agab and/or you want to be a different gender than your agab.

I have a hard time trying to picture a trans person who is happy with their agab and does not wish to be another gender other than their agab. That sounds like a cis person to me. Like…why would you then identify as another gender if that’s the case?

I’m just confused I guess when people say you don’t need dysphoria to be trans. Like, you don’t need to take hormones, have surgery, change your gender expression/presentation, or be clinically diagnosed to be trans…but surely you must experience some sense of dysphoria right?
I don't feel comfortable telling anyone just yet including the very few female friends I have. 

I don't drive but public transport where I live is almost Europe level (good) but I don't feel comfortable even going into a store to buy them. I think the only option is to find some drop off point I can stop by on the way from school and hide them in my bag when I get home
Questions we've all asked ourselves :')
Sitting in a waiting room hoping a therapist can help me understand what “be yourself” even means as we speak 😂
Getting warmer, love. ❤️
You make some good points. I don’t wanna speak for them, but it’s probable that the people who say you don’t need dysphoria to be trans have a much stricter definition than you.
That’s the thing some people miss. The wide umbrella that dysphoria as a term casts. They think it just means the physical pain connected to the grief of that desire. The extreme moments of sadness. And even that is something everyone probably has some fluctuating familiarity with. But not all people call it dysphoria. I’d probably just say I was feeling depressed. Yes technically it was depression centered around the grief of transition related woes. And that’s dysphoria. But it’s also just sadness. 

I think the “dysphoria debate” is simply a misunderstanding. Every trans person technically has some “dysphoria” but people use the term differently, and some prefer to not use it to describe their experience at all.
Alright that should work. Just do whatever makes you comfortable! Good luck :)

Transphobia :(	"I was hanging out with my friend who I'm very out to and has been very supportive and me, his sisters and my sister were all in my bedroom. He mentioned how he was the only boy in the room. I mentioned that I was also a boy. He said ""yeah, but I meant like, original boy."" It dysphoria"	"He was the only boy. You, my friend, are a man!
if that ever happens again (which istg it better not), hit em with the “im a self made boy, which makes me 10x the man you’ll ever be”
that’s not cool- i give you the honor of being 
✨the og boy ✨
Next time just say that he might be a boy, but you are a man. You are the only man in the room
He clearly hasn't been very supportive if he thinks you are a second class boy or a ""fake"" boy.   
You deserve so much better than this and people who will support you genuinely , and this means people that do the work sitting with their transphobic and cissexist baggage and sorting it out.
“You mean you didn’t even make your gender, you just took the one your mama gave you? Okay… weird thing to brag about…”
I am not trans. I am here because I try and support the community and want to educate myself. 

I have a 5 year old assigned male at birth child. She has begun identifying as a girl. She asked me if she was a girl like the other girls in class. How do I reply to that. She is clearly not the same in some way. She can still be a girl, but to tell her she is the same, when she was born a male, to me feels a bit misleading. She knows she is different, and yet she is happy and accepts that she became a girl. She says she ""realized"" she was a girl after being born a boy. But she accepts she was ""born a boy"". Rather, born a male? I don't wanna use the wrong terms here. 

Your friend was being immature, and a good talking about how it made you feel should hopefully help. But a lot of of non trans people feel like, is it that bad that I see a difference between a girl who was born a girl and lived a girl her whole life, and a mtf trans girl. They are different. Both girls, but different. And sometimes I think that difference should be accepted or celebrated, rather than ignored. I dont know. Keep on though.
Is not good.
What was he even thinking with the ""original boy"" bs
“Original boy” lol that’s a weird way of saying cis. You are just as much of a boy as he is.
How is he supportive?
Self made men are much more of a threat than any cis guy. Why? Because we know both sides of the coin. We know more than the average bear.
I wish I knew how to snap like this. If op said this it would have been an ""Ohhhhhhhhhh meme"" moment.
Destroyed with facts and logic
Think of it like this. If someone was born with very bad eyesight and lived their life up to a point with that bad eyesight, and then they finally got glasses a few years later, why would you constantly put them into an ""other"" category when it's not relevant? Now yes, needing heavy prescription glasses does mean that someone would have a different experience than people who don't need them; when you go on rollercoasters or go swimming you might need to take extra steps to do so. But in the end constantly putting them on a pedestal and telling them they're better/worse or even simply different, is really pointless and at a certain point WILL be damaging to someone's emotional wellbeing, especially children. 

Now obviously there are some differences from this metaphor to the reality of being trans but the majority is very similar. Both are things that allow a person to live their life more naturally and comfortably, even if the amount of modification needed is different for each person, and both of these things aren't obligated to be shown off. Some people might want to have big eccentric frames because they love showing their glasses, while some may prefer slim frames or even contacts and both are completely fine. Same with trans people. Some may want to flaunt pride in their identity but some may simply want to live comfortably. No matter what though it isn't other people's business to force someone to do one or the other. Again especially with children, being made public or ""outed"" more than necessary can and often does cause bullying. If your child wants to tell people and is able to explain it to other kids, that's completely perfect and good job to her. Just please remember this isn't a necessity. Being trans doesn't make you all that different from not being (or cisgender) because though it exists it's not necessarily something that changes who you are, and that part's more important.
To do a bit of clarification on my other comment, the issue is that when people ""see"" this difference, they're doing more damage than just seeing it, they're putting trans people into a separate category when in reality being trans doesn't define anything about who someone is, and to end the harassment and assault trans people face daily we really need to normalize the thinking that being trans doesn't make you any less of a gender than having a certain hair color does. In the end being trans is a descriptor not the totality of who someone is.
No difference..both are girls. Differences are between the term female..
Yes, she is just as much a girl as cis girls even if there are differences.

She was classified male at birth and accordingly (wrongly) presumed to be a boy based on the assumption that if you are born with certain genitals, you will see yourself as the sex that goes with that (which is what gender identity is).    
It would be wrong if you think the difference makes her less of a girl than her cis girl peers , just like it would be wrong to think girls that do not meet the dominant ideas of who a girl is based on other differences are lesser than girls that do. 

Do you think this though? Do your actions and how you treat her show that you see her as just as much of a girl as cis girls? This is for you to reflect on with your own conscience as the judge.
I can only speak for myself but I will try to help you out here. 
Your daughter is definitely a girl like the others. All trans people will recognise thier assigned sex at birth, but we want to be recognised as our own gender not some second rate of that gender. We know we are different than cis people, but in any situation where health care is not involved most of us would wish to be treated as our gender. 
Telling her she is a girl like the others isn't misleading at all. If she was a cis girl and the only blonde in the class you wouldn't think telling her she was a girl like the rest was misleading. Yes, she is different but she's still a girl like the others  

It isn't bad to say that they're different as long as people aren't rude about it. Like I said if your daughter was the only blonde it wouldn't be bad to acknowledge that she is different. It would be bad to use that difference agianst her though. It should very much be celebrated. For me being trans has been a beautiful experience.
Honestly, now that you mention it, I don't know. He's never used my correct name or pronouns, if anything he uses they/them pronouns which I've said I don't like. And he's called me a ""girl"" or ""not a real boy"" multiple times since I've come out. I guess I just thought he was supportive because he's part of the lgbtq+ and his family is really supportive in all the ways mentioned before, as well as him having been my oldest/best friend.
Easy to follow and puts the subject the metaphor is designed for in an easy to digest perspective. Well done on answering the questions, and especially well done if you're the person who crafted the metaphor.
Dude, that's not supportive at all! If I can ask, what is his sexuality?
Cringe, you should rlly let him know how those things make you feel cuz hell just keep doing it

just got some major dysphoria turned into euphoria when I compared my hips (1yr 9m on T) to one year ago (10m on T). This completely changed the way I see my hips and wanted to share some beautiful euphoria:)		"Bro congrats!! That is such goals!!  I hope one day I can be able to do that too
Dude your hips are legit....in the fact that theyre not feminine at all. Fuck yeah for results!
Very nice progress, it's cool to see how much impact the element of time can have.
Got that happy trail going too.
I have some hips dysphoria too
My stomach is actually very hairy you just really can't see in the photo lmao
Well, I hope you can enjoy the hair!!!

your post inspired me to go measure and it made me feel good to, btw.  Just thought I would let you know (though I'm a trans woman).
Hell yeah! Love a bit of euphoria about something I've not thought about having changed that much. Glad you're feeling good about it, sister!"	urbk92	trans	438	0.99	2022-05-17 01:44:36
Is it possible that I'm just not trans anymore?	"I've known that I am trans for about 5 years now and I have repressed that but I feel like my dysphoria has faded over time due to my parents. They're conservatives and if they'd find out I am trans they, and the rest of my family (they are also conservatives) will probably disown me and shame me infront of other family members and that would make my life even worse. It's already hell having to live life as a man but it'd be significantly worse if I came out or transitioned and went on to live life as a woman because my family would likely never accept me.

This has kind of caused my dysphoria to fade to the point where I'm thinking I shouldn't transition and that I'm not trans. and that maybe it's better for my own mental health to just man up.

And I don't think I'd ever want to take female pronouns either. Nobody will accept me if I do so and it would just make my life harder. Maybe if the world was more accepting I would have a different opinion.

Am I just not trans anymore? If you barely have gender dysphoria anymore how can you even be trans?

Sorry if my post seems incoherent. I'm just in a dark place mentally."	"You are repressing and it is possible but not sustainable
From my experience, dysphoria lessened when I was in the darkest places, because these numbed everything down including dysphoria.
""It's already hell having to live as a man...""

I believe this is the key sentence in your text. If you were not trans anymore, then why would you word it that way?
You are basically just planning to hide it from your family. And I think you are trying to make yourself believe that you are not trans because of it.
So the reasons you’re stating for not transitioning or changing your pronouns aren’t “I don’t want to transition or change my pronouns because I don’t think that would be a good fit for me” they are “people would never accept me” and “I should just man up.” I’m not telling you what you are or aren’t, but that doesn’t sound like “not trans” as much as it sounds like you don’t want to be ostracised for being trans.

You say yourself that you might feel differently if the world was more accepting. A cis person would not choose to become trans if the world were more accepting of trans people. They would still be cis.

Again, not telling you who you are or what you have to do. But choosing not to transition out of fear is not the same as not being trans.

I would suggest you look into mental health resources and support groups in your area if you can, you sound like you’re in a rough place right now and have kind of resigned yourself to it. Things can get better for you. No matter what you decide about yourself and what you choose to do about it.
If you don’t want to transition because the people around you aren’t accepting, that doesn’t mean you’re not trans. It just means you’re in a transphobic environment and in order to survive you’ve been forced to repress your feelings. 

Maybe right now you don’t feel dysphoric, but even if it didn’t exist then that wouldn’t make you cis. Being trans is about wanting to be a gender that you weren’t assigned with at birth. 

I’m sorry this isn’t an easy answer, but if you were cis then this wouldn’t be a difficult decision for you. I hope you find a better living situation soon and are able to live in a way that is true to yourself!
You don’t require gender dysphoria to be trans. I hardly have dysphoria any more, i used to have it so badly when i first came out. Sometimes it fades away. It doesn’t mean you are less trans.
You might lose everything but you might learn to love yourself girl.
One way gender dysphoria is so insidious is that it fluctuates. One day you'll be certain you're a girl, the next day it might barely be anything and you really doubt yourself. Those strong feelings will return. Just keep pressing forward with your plans, you'll be happy you didn't waste any time when GD comes back! 🙃
You're definitely numbing yourself. Its a survival technique. 

It is your choice to transition or not or even ever come out or identify yourself as trans, but i would definitely be careful about becoming numb to everything else in life. Its very easy to start going through the motions and never find joy. 

There are alternatives to binary trans identities, if that's why you couldn't have feminine pronouns. I dress very androgynously and have been taking hormones only at a rate that feminizes me slightly. On days where i need to present like a man, i still can. Otherwise i dress kind of soft-butch and use they/them. 

There are a multitude of options, and you dont have to be out everywhere and all at once. But always put your safety and health first, and recognize that no one else knows your life better than you.
""Maybe if the world was more accepting""

Just because you decide you don't want to transition does not mean you stop being trans, as much as you may want it to.

Best of luck.
you don't have to have dysphoria to be trans. also, this sounds less like your dysphoria fading and more like you repressing yourself to the point that you don't even let yourself feel the dysphoria? (idk if that's actually a thing tho)
I thought this way all through my twenties. I thought, oh it’s just a phase, I just need to man up, it’ll disappear eventually and I’ll be a normal hetero male…..
I got to 30 and those things never happened. I never felt comfortable being a man. I had a good job, gf, car, but it never made me happy. 
Once the androgyny of youth started to fade I fell apart and had to admit to everyone and myself that I’m just not the person I was trying to be.
I don’t how you feel exactly, but it sounds like you may be struggling with similar things that I do.
Im much happier after transitioning.
My brother and dad are a little weird about things, but they accept me enough not to disown me.
My mom loves it I think cuz now she realizes I liked shopping and all that stuff she thought she was forcing on me that we did together.
If you don’t have any family support then it’s incredibly difficult, from what I’ve heard. I don’t have that issue fortunately so it’s something to consider if you do.
I hope you find peace with yourself no matter what you choose is best for you 🫂
I didn't go away you're just ignoring it. It'll come back and strotnger. You can't help whom you are and that isn't something that generally changes.
I “man upped” for almost 40 yrs. It has gotten me nowhere but miserable. Pushed away everyone I ever cared about trying to man up. I hate to say this but it doesn’t go away. It’s possible to repress it hit each time it comes back, it’s worse. Took my wife leaving and saying I was happier dressed as a woman for it to finally click that you can’t just run away. If you don’t have a therapist, find one. Mines the best and their partner is trans so they understand my issues but I’m 9 months into my transition and also in the middle of a separation from my wife who “was” supportive until it became real. I’m not trying to be a Debbie downer, just wanted to tell you a little about my wonderful mess. It does get better but only when u accept yourself.. I wish u the best and hope you do what’s best for you. I wish I had done this sooner 😊
As someone who ostracized and disenfranchised themself due to being a MtF amateur voice actress for similar reasons, I can safely say that in similar circumstances I've internalized it myself like this before. In an environment of hatred and guilt, it can only breed more hatred and guilt. Acceptance is something worth fighting for in a world where we're all being divided by the color of our skins, how we pee and babymake, and what's between our legs.

In isolation and self reflection, I do have some advice for you. Do with this what you will:

There are people in this world who would rather see you as a sum of your pieces rather than what you are as a whole, a human being with aspirations and dreams. If you feel you were born in the wrong body, that is still a form of dysphoria called body dysmorphia (help me if I butchered that.) From the way you wrote that, at least in my mind, I'd say you hear what they (your family, illogical conservatives, and a few bigots) say about transfolk and you worry that they won't treat you the same anymore.

Once you reach a certain age, your only true duty is to your own preservation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's like that Jack Stauber song 'Dead Weight' says.

""What I control is in me.""

You aren't what they say, you are what you feel.

If it isn't illegal by the time you can transition, and you feel like it will improve your quality of life for you personally, then pardon my language, but fuck what everyone else says. The only power they have is the power you give them, as with all human individuality. Outside influence like vile and vitriolic comments, threats of violence, etc. Is all a tactic to enforce conformity over individuality. 

Be true to you, ignore what they do, regardless of what your decision is in the end.
Upping your coping skills or repressing your feelings of dysphoria doesn't mean you're not trans. It might just mean that your subconscious has been building up defenses against the emotional pain you expect would come your way if you came out.

I didn't know I was trans until I was 45. I had no idea I had massive gender dysphoria, because over those years, I developed some hella-good coping skills. But none of that means I'm not still trans.

You can repress it for a while, especially if there are strong emotional motivations at play. But it comes back out eventually and you'll wish you came out sooner rather than sacrificing all those years on the altar of appeasing a family whose small-minded attitudes won't let them love and accept you like true family should.
Hun, I ain't surger coating shit. You're repressing it so deep that you're no longer feeling pain. But it's still hurting you. It'll slowly tear you apart, even if you don't realize it. This is something that if not taken care of, will utterly break you when it all finally hits (take my word on it). Your family can go straight to hell, and all go fuck themselves. If you get stable, cut them all out, and make yourself happy.
Are you honestly thinking your not trans or are you just scared of not being accepted? It honestly sounds like you’re scared of not being accepted and that fear is overtaking your dysphoria.
When I was younger it was easier to repress myself. But with getting older and more stress situation the dysphoria has hitted me back very strongly. So yes you can repress for years and years, but one day in future it will collapse.
Sounds like you're repressing, you're dissociated from your gender. That can be useful given your unaccepting environment, but long term it's only going to make you miserable. Please find some kind of outlet where you can be yourself freely without judgement, for your own mental health's sake.
There are a lot of possibilities. Perhaps you misinterpreted something else as dysphoria to begin with, perhaps you had dysphoria and it somehow went away (which, if it went away without anything worse taking its place, is not necessarily a bad thing), or maybe you (or your external circumstances? are just repressing your dysphoria. I think the last one is the most likely.

I think something to keep in mind is that medically speaking, gender dysphoria is defined as a mental illness for which statistics and research has shown transition to be the most effective treatment by far. This is not to say the couldn't be other treatments, just that they are so unlikely to work that generally the only medically responsible treatment path is transition.

However, the human mind is too complicated to reduce to such simple terms, so you can't rule out any possibilities such as gender dysphoria going away. If that is the case, it's not a bad thing. Transition is tough anyway. (also, we aren't r/truscum here, so even if you aren't dysphoric, if transitioning gives you enough euphoria to be worth it to you, go ahead, no judgement)

A trick that the human mind plays much more frequently, though, is to allow certain things to take over your emotions. If you are in an extremely stressful environment, your environmental stresses may override your dysphoria and make it seem like you don't have dysphoria anymore. This is similar to how conversion therapy gives the illusion of curing people - diminish one bad thing by covering it up with something much worse (in the case of conversion therapy they are basically trying to weaponize PTSD as a medical treatment which you can imagine how well that works).

Without further info, I think this last case is the most likely. I understand you are probably not in a position where you are free to do these things, but if possible, talk to a therapist or talk to one through online resources, especially LGBT related ones. A therapist would be able to tell you more than someone on the internet can.
I would focus on euphoria rather than dysphoria in this situation. What makes you feel good about yourself? What makes you feel more “you” ? This is more important than focusing on the bad feelings. I know you feel unsafe trying to transition, which is totally understandable, but is it more that you don’t want to or you don’t think you can? If you could live anywhere you wanted, with any friend group, and access to proper medical care, what would you do then?
So I repressed *hard* each time I tried to explore my gender identity, and my ex used it as an excuse for more abuse/to shove past my boundaries. I have felt sick for nearly a decade and told myself I didn’t know why. 

Honestly, it sounds like you just need to find a way to get some space. Breathe. Get your ducks in a row so you can leave your family behind. *No-one* is worth denying who you are, not family, not friends, not partners. The people who love you for who you are are your real family, not just people with whom you share a few chromosomes.
Only you can know that. And denial is never an answer, no matter how many lies you’re told by the ignorant
I can’t tell you what you are feeling or need, but the way you are talking about this sounds like the reason your dysphoria has reduced is via disassociation.  It sounds like you hate “living as a man” but are locking those feelings away to deal with your parents.

Whether you are trans or not isn’t a question of what your parents need you to be.  It’s a question of what *you* need to be.  If you don’t need to transition then okay.  There is no pressure here.  Do what you need to do.

But if your parents are the reason why you feel that way, and you are suffering because you have to “live as a man” as you’ve indicated… then it doesn’t really sound like dysphoria is gone, does it?
I would say not likely.  It was the same for me.  I was able to repress it for years and years.  It was always there, boiling under the surface.  A constant itch I couldn't scratch.  A dull ache.  


It \*will\* come back with a vengeance.  And it will get harder and harder as the years go by.  Aging as a ""man"" has a way of bringing dysphoria front and center!
I know what you mean and I often struggle with the same negative thoughts of ""its not worth the pain"" or ""The world will never let me be happy"" and somedays I don't ""feel very trans"" and somedays I do but idk but after having probably one of the worst weeks I'd had in a long time and I started to doubt my transness but I when I think about living as a man I become despondent and depressed so that pain lets me know I'm trans even if its not ideal and I feel your doubts are also coming from a place of fear and I know how terrible that feeling of not being accepted.
Gender is a very complicated concept and, for many people, can’t be defined by any binary. And people choose many different ways to express that gender. The vast majority of people present their gender in the way that is stereotypically “correct” in society (i.e. afab presenting as women and amab presenting as men). However trans people and people who otherwise don’t fit on the binary must put more thought into gender and presentation. I, for one, am afab with a nonbinary gender. I experimented with presentation, but in the end I just landed right back at a feminine presentation. My gender never changed, but my presentation and dysphoria levels did. I also know trans people (mostly those whose dysphoria isn’t severe) who have chosen never to transition. Your journey is your own, your labels are your own, and you get to define yourself however you wish to.
This sound more like repression to me. You want to live as a woman, but you're scared that people won't accept you if you do, so you push it down and numb your feelings, even subconsciously, to keep yourself safe, right? Whether you are trans or not is just whether you want to use that term for yourself, which is usually based on how you feel inside, and all of that can absolutely change.

 I think you should think long and hard about what matters to you, if you aren't already. Is the conditional love of family worth more that living as yourself? Are there places you can go where people *would* support you? Are you willing to go searching for those kinds of people even if it's hard? 

Living life as yourself can be incredibly enriching. You'll find people that hate you for it, but you also find people who love you for it, and that love I'd more authentic that any love based on a lie.
No because conversion doesn’t work. You can never get rid of who you truly are. You’d only be repressing it and that could cause even worse of mental health issues for you later on just because it’s not good to suppress stuff like your emotions and how you feel. If you actually had gender dysphoria at some point, chances are, you still have it. But since you’ve been suppressing it for so long, you could have just tricked your mind into thinking that you don’t have it anymore by wishing that you weren’t trans and trying to hold it down. The mind is a powerful place so I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve only tricked your mind into believing what you wish could be the case. You’re thinking that there will only be bad consequences that come from being yourself so therefore you don’t want to be yourself. But safety should be your first priority and if you have a super hateful family to the point of which you may be in danger, then it’s best to stay in the closet for the time being. That’s if you’re still a child anyways. If you’re an adult and have enough money to move out, then just come out if you feel like you’re ready and if you’re family doesn’t accept you then fuck them. For each family member and friend you have IRL right now that won’t accept you…trust me…there are 100 times more people in the community in which you can meet and build a connection with who will accept you. But all of this is just my take and my input. Just don’t lie to yourself really. That’s the last bit of advice I want you to keep close to your heart. If you are really trans then don’t be afraid to be you just because of family.
Been there, tried that, didn't work & almost killed me. 

1- you don't have to change your pronouns if you don't want to, but please don't base that decision on whether or not you think new pronouns will be accepted, base it on which ones you wish had always been used for you.
2- sure, repressing yourself can & does work. But is it really worth hating yourself, to make other people more comfortable?
3- not everybody who is trans experiences dysphoria with their body, some just feel ""this doesn't match my brain"" But there's no crippling self-loathing attached to it
4- not everybody who is trans chooses to transition - and those who do all choose their own path, which works for them. There's no ""You must do A B and C"" of transitioning or of being trans. It's a wholly personal experience.
5- there's no nicer or kinder way of saying this: your family is not the world. Does it suck if your family who are supposed to love you unconditionally, don't? Yes. Absolutely, yes. But there's a whole world of people out there, who aren't your family and who will accept you with no questions asked. There are people who will love you and support you and be there for you. There are people who will  want to know more & discover everything about you. There are people who will be your family, once you meet them. This family that you're with right now seem like the most important people in the world, because they're all you've known up to this point. But I promise you, they're not. I promise you, there are people out there waiting on you to join their family, where you'll be accepted without doubt or conditions.
Let me ask you a question. If you knew your parents would accept you, would you then want to transition (even if rn you don't really feel the need to)?
From what you're saying, it sounds like the idea of being trans and living as the gender you'd prefer to is a very scary idea due to the concept of social rejection and oppression. This is continued repression, and I am so so sorry you're living in a place where you have to be afraid. Being scared of what could happen if you transitioned, especially rejection, does not make you any less trans.

Also, it sounds like you do have dysphoria, and your mental state is numbing it. However, it's important to know that no dysphoria ≠ not trans. There is no dysphoria requirement to be trans.

Edit: comment posted weird so I had to add back the text before the does not equal sign.
For years I supemmressed my feelings and it turned me into a person who wasn't nice. There's always the possibility you might of just noot be anymore, but that rare if not ever happens I think you've gone numb to all your disphiria which in some ways is good but long term its not good
I've had to hide being trans for over 20 years. I'm still trans and since I don't live with my parents,I can now transition. I suggest moving in with ppl or family members that actually accept you.
same
I have suffered and broken myself for a new life and home where I can be myself where I can just be a transwoman some of us have to walk through tar even after you've given up, but im am comfortable and taking being a girl at my own pace if you want a certain life make it happen when it feels right and you're ready some people suddenly are trans in their 80s when they've had time to do soul searching. take everything at your own pace do what you know is best and whats right for you listen to your gut whatever it is you don't have to be trans if you don't want to if you want to be trans do it when life allows you to and it is right for you.
I’ve tried repressing for years. Believe me, those feelings always come back.
When you are able to leave, find q place that's more accepting. And then continue to try and see how you feel then
I’m sure most of us here can relate: I don’t want to lose the people I love by living a life I don’t think they would approve of.
Sorry girl but that is not living at all. Only you know best how to truly be happy, and maybe you can make it work. But remember: you deserve to be happy, you deserve to be authentic. You live in this world with everyone else. I can’t help but think folks like us are here to love ourselves so we can teach others, cisgender, transgender, non binary-to love themselves too. You deserve love. Accept yourself and the right people will accept you. The wrong people will see themselves out.
I repressed it because of conservative family members for decades and it still burst out. Up to you to deal with it now or deal with it later.
It doesn’t really sound like you’ve come to peace with being cis, moreso that you’re very scared of the dangerous and repercussions of coming out. When I was at my worst, I would not have said I was as dysphoric as I used to be either- I was so depressed that I was unhappy with absolutely everything I was basically numb to it. But when I came out, and later got on HRT, the relief was immediate.
Personally, I thought my parents would disown me or quietly hate me forever. My dad ended up coming around pretty quick and my mom still just avoids saying my name pronouns as much as possible, never the correct ones.

All in all though, I know they both love me and support me a lot, and I'm closer with my dad now then I ever was. The extended family I was terrified of as well, but after a well written letter from my dad, they've all come around and most have been very accepting which is a shock coming from people who talk about what happened on tucker Carlson last night. 

I hope your family is as close and loving as mine was. If they really believe in family, they will learn to love you again, but it may still be a shock. Good luck!
I afraid that transition is not something you can logic yourself out of unfortunately.  I know because what you have just said is exactly how I was during my teenage and well into my early adulthood.  Sure I was putting on a brave face and had a ‘life’ but that was me surviving, not living.  I was nervous constantly and never felt like I was part of the moment even with behavior that I thought was appropriate around my religious and conservative family/friends, so I wasn’t even getting a good interpersonally experience with anyone.  

Ever since coming out and transitioning, I have absolutely found that while I get odd looks and the occasional demeaning remark, my capacity for patience and tolerance of that kind of ignorance has only expanded.  I am far more calm than I was and 1000% happier as a result ☺️☺️.

I’m sorry that you have to go through this but you are not alone, having a found family is better than the real thing imo simply cause you can choose them.  GL and I hope you make the decision that puts your mental health first.
So many great responses. I didn’t read them all and maybe this was already brought up. I’ve noticed quite a few of these types of posts. OPs seem to think they have to jump ship from one gender to the next, like over night. That’s just not the case. You can absolutely BEGIN your gender journey. There are many ways you can do that, you don’t need me to point them all about. Thing is, you don’t have to make some big announcement to your whole family. You can just start “drifting” further to the fem side. People see what they wanna see. Peoples memory adjust on a daily basis, they won’t even register your changes. Like for a long long time. You could go quite far before questions arise, and by then, many folx in your life will be “used to the way you are”. No big reveal or shock.
Sounds like ur repressing it :(( plus u can be trans without experiencing dysphoria
As someone who felt that way all thru highschool,  there is a good chance if you stop suppressing it the feelings will come back sadly. Or who knows maybe it is gone. Or I know some gender fluid people fluctuate really inconsistently and can spend years feeling one way only for it to change. Plus you don't need dysphoria to be trans and dysphoria can change with time. Sit and think about what gender you really are and ignore the changing dysohoria.
I think a good way of understanding better your feelings can be imagining an alternative world where you could choose your physical appearance, your gender, your sex. Disconnect just for a bit from reality. Do not think about your family, situation or anything, just think; what would you like the most?
Well it is possible that you just aren’t trans but to me it sounds like your convincing yourself that due to outside pressures you shouldn’t be who you want and then finding things that you wouldn’t see in the “typical” or “average” but do see with you as justification towards that repression of who you might be. Now I don’t know you and I’m not you so I can’t say for sure, but, just keep your mind open. If may turn out ghat your not trans And hey that’s fine. But hey once your situation improves and there is not as much repression in your life you may find out you are trans and that’s great too! Hope you figure yourself out! <3
I had a similar thing happen to me, I think for my own survival I instinctually pushed it down. When I finally began transition and started actively trying to appear masculine and didn't quite look as I wanted to it began to flood back. I had to sort of pace myself. I was trying out trans tape and I couldn't get it quite right; it took five attempts on separate occasions to finally get the results I wanted. That first attempt however, I was hit like a truck by my dysphoria. I'm so glad I had my support system with me because it sent me into a panicky anxiety spiral.

It was like I stood on ice and suddenly the surface cracked and for the first time in a long time I was forced to look at the infinite dark water of repressed pain frozen beneath me for over ten years. I was suddenly that terrified lonely girl on the bus heading home from high school all over again. It was overwhelming but also reassuring. I had had my own doubts up until then because I had shoved that pain and dysphoria down so it was numb but, not anymore. That sharp reminder solidified for me that I am trans, that this is real, and I am finally going to be whole.
1. dysphoria is NOT necessary to be trans. believing it is is a very trans-medicalist idea. pretty terf territory. 

2. people will accept you. putting your projection into others who would absolutely accept you isn’t fair to them as people and ally’s. i would 100% accept you if you came out. use correct pronouns and name. 

3. “man up” is very toxic. very misogynistic and also suppressive of mens emotions and pushes that men shouldn’t have feelings, much less express them. 

i know you’re hurting. i know how it feels to live in a place where you’re not accepted. i moved away from that place but had to move back. my direct family isn’t conservative per sé but the town i live in is. i know your fears. if you can hold on until you move out, i would do that and then immediately seek therapy to start undoing the trauma you faced and learn to be yourself through and through.
It will continue to eat away at you until you are no longer capable of finding joy in life. You have chosen death.

This is a must read for you:

Are you living at their place? Are you financially independent? 

If not start trying to get out.,

If you are you can try things you want like dresses in the comfortable of your own home. See how you feel.
Hun I went through the same thing with my family and only years later in my late 20's did I come out and my family said they were shocked and struggled to except me and I mean they definitely aren't as close to me as they were and don't speak to me as often or even about the same things but slowly over time they have excepted me for who I am and believe me it's better to be your true self because you will find that people can tell that you're not being honest with yourself, that can and often does manifest in some pretty fucked up ways. The best thing to do is to just tell them there will of course be initial upset but they will still love you even if they don't agree with you and freak out at first. Being transgender isn't a choice we make it's a fundamental part of out being. I tried to convince myself for many years to just ""man up"" and without realising it I became self-destructive and a complete nightmare. After years of therapy to try to work through all my self hatred and terrible behaviour it boils down to me not being honest with myself about who I am and how I feel and excepting myself you have no idea how far I went to try to convince myself and others that I was this ""fictional character"" that was such a manly and tough gentleman with machismo coming out of every pore and it was fiscally causing my extreme depression my self-destructive behaviours my inability to make a honest connection with anyone my trust issues my crippling anxiety etc... So believe me when I say this , don't try to fool yourself because you will only end up becoming a fool with no happenes and you'll just be getting more hurt then you ever needed too so just be honest with them and with yourself and save yourself a whole lot of heartache and pain. I'll never get the years back that I lost denying who I am, don't make the same mistake I did ""it's not worth it"".  

There will never be a right time. Just do it .

Everything will never be perfect all at once. It takes time.

Don't do it for other people do it for Yourself because no one else is going to do it for you. 

Believe in yourself and your own ability to survive in this word.
This is like exactly what i said when i was 18 and then 3 years later i was starting hormones. Like i literally remember telling my therapist that bc my attempt to transition was so poorly received i told my therapist, ""i'd never really be able to transition"" and ""no one would ever think of me as a woman."" So we just all chalked it up to a phase. 

But eventually, for me, the dysphoria got much worse over time and i realized i was lying to myself. 

That being said, it is possible that it was just a ""phase,"" but i would say go to a gender affirming therapist and talk to them about your feelings. 

Watch out for self destructive negative coping mechanisms like substance abuse and self harm.
That seems like you need to figure this out with a good therapist
So I have dealt with this for many years myself! I had told myself that I wasn’t trans, held everything in, even got married and have a child, divorced, then ended up with another woman still presenting as a cis man all because my family and childhood friends would disown me because of it and I have lived in fear because of how things in this country have been. Finally I decided I just can’t do it anymore, not being my true self has been killing me slowly! I’ve been on hormones for almost 4 months, bought almost a $1000 in clothes, scheduled laser hair removal and cool sculpting to get to where I feel more comfortable in my body. I haven’t felt this good in my life and look forward to getting to the point of presenting as my true self daily!
Yeahhhh I tried the whole ""maybe if I try living my adult life as I was assigned it won't be so bad!""

Flash forward a decade... Yeah you get the picture for this anecdote. I can so relate to the poster's struggle, though at the time my awareness was much dimmer. 

Everyone has their own path, but repression to mold to the expectations of others is never the answer, either for yourself or for sustainability.
Agreed, ur reasoning don’t come from a place of peace réflexion. You will burst out, in 10 month, 10 year but no doubt about it. Now just think about if u’re ok to loose time to ´try’ to be cis longer. It’s valid to do so. But be honest with urself for ur sake
I repressed for decades. It kept getting worse until I couldn't anymore.
This was obvious from the first sentence.

So yeah, what that person said. Its certainly possible to realise that you are in fact cis. But this is not remotely plausible based on your description.
This. I'm currently trying do the same thing (with a conservative family being one of the biggest reasons as well). It's not good to do but can feel like your only option sometimes
Same here. You can’t feel like shit specifically about your gender presentation when you already feel like shit about everything
Yea, the downside however is a lack of emotional response. My dysphoria shot way up but it's calmed down with time and support. Now I don't have massive dysphoria or a had time feeling emotions. Also I've been hella confident and I've made more friends than ever so with my overthinking brain I say it's totes worth
I think you're right about most things but should I still keep repressing then? cause even if I did decide to be myself and my family finds out life will be hell. I still care about them even if they'd hate me for being trans, they are my family after all and they are genuinely the only people I have. I pretty much lost all my friends ever since I moved last year.
God I wish we as a community could see lack of dysphoria as a good thing. Like we’re making people feel insecure about their identity just because they…feel ok about their bodies?
Definitely a thing. I disassociated everything and lived in a black hole for like 27 years.
>If you could live anywhere you wanted, with any friend group, and access to proper medical care, what would you do then?

I would transition without doubt.
What exactly do you mean by disassociation and why do you think I'm disassociating?

I've heard people talk about it I just never fully understood it.

&#x200B;

>But if your parents are the reason why you feel that way, and you are suffering because you have to “live as a man” as you’ve indicated… then it doesn’t really sound like dysphoria is gone, does it?

Yeah true but it does feel like it has lessened due to the whole situation I am in.
I came out to one of my friends and he said that his ""uncle"" was like this, she dressed up privately but presented as a man in day to day life. I'm from Nepal and she needed to do that for safety and societal inclusion but he expects me to do the same. 
I told him it was either living my truth or not living at all. He seemed pretty shaken, haha


It can be different for everyone but the main thing is, what do you prioritize? Acceptance from all and constantly living in the matrix or freedom with a little bit of adventure and risks.
Ugh :(
There’s a difference between being in the closet and repressing. Only you can decide when/if you want to come out, but trying to repress your true feelings is extremely unhealthy. I am however not a therapist and I suggest you get (a trans friendly) one.
Repressing and dissociating was not healthy for me for sure. I should have just sought safety in the closet while I needed to. Refusing to see it or feel it left a lot of crap to undo and sort out.

It also put me in situations where if I had not been lying to myself I could have had important discussions about it prior to things like getting married.

It seems like a great many that do shut their trans identity out of their mind eventually have dysphoria break through and force the issue at some point later in life.
I'm in a very similar boat. I love my family and I honestly don't think i could handle losing them. They're genuinely good, kind, and loving people. The only major downside is they're conservative and not accepting of the LGBT. They don't hate on it or go bully gays on the street, they're not like that. They're the kind to say they love the people but don't approve of their life style. When i talk to people about not transitioning yet because I'm not ready to lose them, they hardly understand.

I know my family would probably cut me off if i came out of pay for me to conversion therapy or something, even though I'm in college already. People tell to just be myself and it doesn't matter if my family loves me or not but that's not true. It matters to me. It matters so much to me. My family is my entire world. The reason i live, the happiness I've had, the memories I've made. I feel like I'll never be able to fully transition because of it though. I'm socially transitioned here at my college 4 hours away from home, but I'm scared I'll never be able to fully transition. It's not a simple choice for me and people don't seem to understand that. It feels like either way I'll end up miserable.
AMEN
Same. I disassociated for most of my life and it felt like I was buried alive in a mausoleum with only a tiny little slit to look out of and watch the world going by, knowing that I would never be seen, heard, loved, or even known as a blip in the universe. That pain was so awful for 30 years that finally my mind broke (because egg cracking is too cute for what happened when I finally came out to myself and decided that I had to transition to survive), and if I believed in god I’d pray so hard that no one ever had to live that way again. Even if you lose people, what you gain on the other side is so worth it. I’m no therapist (but I go to a very good one), but I would suggest that repression is only going to result in lots of agony until, if you’re like me with “life threatening dysphoria”, the decision is finally death or transition. It’s not worth the pain or the regrets that you never did it sooner. Best of luck finding your way 💗🥰
Well then I think that’s proof enough. I’m so sorry that you’re in a place that is making it so hard to accept yourself. Focus on the good things, the things you like about yourself, the little things you can do to affirm yourself. I believe you, and I believe in you.
Disassociation is a psychological process where in order to endure pain our brains learn to ignore it so we can keep functioning.

Like, if somebody punched you in the face every day, eventually you might psychologically stop caring in order to cope, and say things like “getting punched in the face doesn’t really bother me.”  You might feel emotionally numb, or you might start to view your experiences with detachment like they were happening to somebody else, or you might go into denial.  

It still ends up hurting you.  It’s like you’ve locked your feelings or pain in a box and thrown away the key.  They are still there, they still happen, but they are so bottled up you can no longer access them.

I don’t know that this is what is happening to you.  Maybe the dysphoria really did go away.  Only you can figure that out, ultimately.

I feel like this is what's been going on with me for the past years. I just ignored what I really wanted in life and started seeing my biggest problems as non problems over time since it was basically an impossible for me to be myself in my situation. It reached the point where I tried to make myself completely forget about the whole trans thing. I refused to visit places like this subreddit because I just felt like it would help me if I forget about the whole thing and that it would make me any less sad but it didnt work.
Yeah.  That definitely sounds like disassociation.  It can help you cope in a temporary situation, but You end up paying for it later.

I’m sorry this is happening to you.  I’m sorry you have to repress yourself to stay safe.  You aren’t the only one.  And a lot of us do get out eventually.  It’s just hard.  Really hard.
Thanks. and yeah thankfully it's a temporary situation. I was going to move out in a few years anyways after which I'll be myself and if an opportunity presents to move out earlier, like for example me getting a boyfriend or girlfriend that allows me to move in with them I could do the same thing.
I’m glad to hear that.  Do whatever you need to do to get through that.  Don’t lose yourself in the process though, ok?
>Don’t lose yourself in the process though, ok?

But I think I lost myself already. It's like I'm always looking at everything though a thick mist. it all doesn't matter to me or get to me. I just feel nothing but numbness.
:( yup.  That’s disassociation.  But at least you know what it is.  If you can name a problem, you can deal with the problem.

Are there things you can do to reconnect with yourself?  

Here’s an example.  When I get dissociative, I put on some emotionally resonant music and try to pull the emotions out.  Not venting per se.  I get to a safe place, dig up the pain and *feel* it.  I cry, I sing, I scream, I laugh maniacally, I break down into a terrified shivering mess, I break sticks or other objects I don’t mind breaking.  I don’t per se recommend you do this… this is what I need in particular and it can sometimes destabilize me or I can lash out and hurt somebody if I don’t have the proper safeguards.  But it provides some temporary relief.  I allow myself to feel the things I was not allowing myself to feel in a safe environment."	tt7qxc	trans	444	0.99	2022-03-31 19:35:35
The guilt is killing me	"I think I made the wrong decision. I didn't think things through all the way. I'm FtM and I expected HRT would make me look like a man but instead I've become like half-and-half and there's nothing wrong with that but I hate that now I am visibly queer and don't pass. I feel like I was misled because everyone else has decent results... I feel guilty for existing in public space because I'm like a walking political statement now. I don't want to be political or offensive or aggressive to anyone, I just want to be me.

The physical dysphoria is gone but the social dysphoria has gotten so much worse and I wish there was some way I knew beforehand. I feel so guilty and so ashamed of myself but I don't even know what I would have done differently. I'm embarrassed to go to school and to be at work especially around strangers because they don't deserve to be subjugated to this. I hate that I've become part of the problem

And now I'm not sure what to do, I just feel so completely trapped. I would rather kill myself than go back to presenting as a cis woman but I feel so guilty existing in the world as I am now

Edit: People asking how long I have been on T. My first dose was 2019. I have been on a steady dose since late 2020. So I just say I have been on T consistently for a little over two years. My voice have settled, I have facial hair, I am not expecting any new changes from T and I am still taking T. I am happy with what changes I got from T but I am disappointed that those changes have not helped me pass any better than I did pre-T."	"As others are saying, our existence is not a political statement. The people that it is ""political"" to are hateful bigots. I can understand wanting to blend in--I myself am grateful that for the most part that is something I'm capable of--but an inability to do so is not a failure on your part. HRT works different for everyone and the concept of being cis passing is so goofy and situational that its not even something every cis person can do.

Tell me, if the people in your area reacted similarly to people of color, would you think it rational for racialized individuals in your town to adopt the same mindset? Feeling as if theyre doing something wrong simply by existing because the white people around them make a big stink about seeing someone who isn't white? Feeling bad because someone might have to explain the existence of POC to their kids? Would that be a good way to internalize that?

The answer, of course, is no. I can understand wanting to be ""cis passing"" for self esteem or safety reasons, but don't ever let the bigots win--dont ever let them convince you that your mere existence is political and gross and shameful. Moreover, dont let them convince you that their bigotry is anything but bigotry. It may be normalized in your area, but that does not mean thats the way it should be.

You are strong, you are here. You have fought a million demons to get to the point youre at now and I know you can fight through this. You are handsome. You are worth it. Much love, dude ❤
Who do you feel guilty to ?
There's a lot of internalised queerphobia going on here.

You have no reason to feel guilty, and you are not responsible for other people's queerphobia. You have no reason to feel guilty for people ""having to explain you to their kids"": we exist, they're going to have to explain it at some point.

What you're saying here is that queer people should hide ourselves, pretend to be cishetalo, just so strangers are more comfortable.
I have been experiencing sort of the same thing (only I'm MtF), especially when I femme it up people do tend to stare. Eventually I just got exhausted of always having to base my behaviour on other people's values and opinions and after that it was like a literal weight off my shoulders.

You don't need to feel guilty for existing and people's reaction is entirely on them. If a PoC walked down the street and a bunch of racist people accosted them it wouldn't be the PoC person's fault but the people being racist.
I'm sorry it's been hard and not going how you hoped.

Though... being trans, and trying to be comfortable in your own skin isn't political. 

It's being adopted into politics by bigots filled with misinformation to drive a base through fear mongering.

It is not, however, a political statement to be trans. 

If, as an example, in the U.S. there was not one particular party that became hell-bent on using us as a platform to run against there would be no assumptions of political view. 

It just so happens that when one group is pushing for your extinction, you tend not to side with that group. Not necessarily because you like the other option. Simply because the alternative is innialation. 

Unfortunately, these are not normal geopolitical times.
How long have you been on HRT?
Do you have a way to access therapy? What I'm hearing here is that you feel guilty about having your needs met/taking up space - like you value protecting other people's opinions over your own comfort. And it's not fair to you to feel that way. ""Existing in the way you feel comfortable"" is not ""subjecting"" anyone to anything. You are not ""part of the problem"" by being visibly queer - visible queerness is not a problem.

Your feelings are completely valid, and I'm very sorry you're going through this. But I urge you to try to get therapy if you can, because you deserve to feel like you have a right to be yourself regardless of other people's opinions.
It’s not your fault that people politicize us. You don’t need to feel like you’re obligating people to make political judgements about you, they don’t matter. Also HRT takes time, you’re not gonna see perfect results right away. Also we tend to notice our own changes waaaay more than other people do, so most people probably don’t even realize
Idk your home or your close friend/family circle situation, but having a support group or just a few close people to help you see that what you're doing isn't a mistake. 

I also don't know how long you have been on hrt, but it can take some time.


Please hang in there and talk to others who are in similar situations
Mad queer phobia going on right here :(
You are not subjugating anyone to anything by existing. If they take offense from you being yourself, then they are the problem, not you. I have read the other comments and I know you don't like to call people bigots for being offended by trans folk, so let's think of them as misled, ok? By presenting yourself as you are without shame, you're actually helping these people. Being yourself helps normalize us, and can teach them that we aren't anything bad or scary. We can help them learn by being ourselves, all that hiding does is keep them and us in the dark.
I get it man. I’m over a year on testosterone now, at first I was scared, worried I didn’t quite make it, you know? There was a period of time I was scared, so scared I didn’t pass and that I could be clocked, that I wasn’t quite there yet. It gets better. It’s tough, it’s difficult, but you can make it. You have nothing to be guilty for, nothing to be sorry for. 

If you’re looking for a slightly faster solution, talk with your doctor or medical professional who prescribed your HRT. Uping your dosages may help speed up your process a little, and you might yield more of the desired results you wish for as far as passing. But always talk to your doctor first because they can help you if there are complications or other issues. 

But on another note, weather or not you pass is irrelevant—you are you. Of course it’s a desire for many, but always remember it’s not a requirement! Your journey to whatever end goal you desire may be long but it’s *yours*. You are not just a “political statement”, not something or someone who needs to be explained—you are your own individual. If hat other people think, we can’t always worry about it. It’s draining, it’s taxing on your mental health. Ignoring people is difficult, but it can help. Me personally it’s really helped reminding myself that the only real person who knows me is myself. It brings me comfort, because I do not need to prove anything about passing to anyone but myself. 
To add on after reading some of your other comments: You do NOT need to cater to other people’s ideas or expectations, you are allowed to exist alongside other people without bending over backwards to suit their wants or desires. You need to and are allowed to focus on yourself. Don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise. 


Stay strong!
It is exhausting, moving through the world like you are a walking political statement. How I cope with it is to understand that it won’t be forever. The more visibly queer and trans people there are in public, the less we will stand out. I’ve had other people say to me that watching me move through the world has given them the confidence to be more visibly queer. And even though sometimes it feels like a burden, I take a lot of pride in that. In the fact that I can make it easier for others. In the fact that me just being - living joyfully and authentically can be a force for good. Just my two cents :)
There is a lot of internalised hate and queerphobia here. Someone being trans or not, or being gay or not, are not political statements. You’re not choosing someone to take a side. Most people don’t care, the only people who will are the bigoted transphobes. I try to be half and half, I like confusing people and I like being visibly queer. But that’s just me. 

HRT takes a long time, and just because you may think you don’t pass now, doesn’t mean you won’t in the future if that’s truly what you want. 

I really think you should seek out an LGBTQ friendly therapist, because this sort of internalised self hatred and guilt is far beyond what anyone on Reddit can help you with. It really took me aback to see someone blame themselves for bigots and transphobes hating them and thinking the way they do, and feeling guilty just for existing. Please get help.
Hi OP — reading through your post history it seems very likely that this guilt you’re feeling sounds more like projected self hatred for unrelated personal issues than anything related to transitioning. It looks like you’ve expressed that no advice, suggestions, and commentary from anyone online or otherwise has been good enough or makes a difference, and many of the points you’ve made on previous posts are contradicting. Please find a better mental health professional than your current therapist and prioritize your personal mental health issues outside of and related to transitioning. For good or for bad, transitioning does not change who we are at our core — it only aligns us closer to the gender we have always been inside. I truly wish you good luck in finding peace with yourself and determining what is best for you given the factors in front of you. 

It is a difficult but universally part of being human for everyone trans or cis that while they can offer perspective, no one else can find that peace for you but you, on Reddit or beyond.
To start, everything you are feeling is valid. You have every reason to feel this way, I don't know your whole history, but obviously there's a reason you came to these conclusions.

I am MtF, I've been through male puberty. I didn't even grow a beard until a few years before puberty was supposed to be 100% done. I understand there are differences, but it's puberty. It's not what you'd call a science ironically.

The important bit here is that you are not a political statement. That's a form of objectification, it's not a definitely sexual thing, you are making yourself a political object by believing that. Why wouldn't you though? Our existence is only real for most of the population in the realm of politics. The only way to change that though is to be a real present person in the world.
How long have you been on HRT for? It’s possible that you haven’t experienced all of the changes in full yet if it’s been less than a couple of years. The language you’re using indicates that you have a lot of internalized transphobia. Believe me, we all know how difficult it can be to exist in the world as a trans person, but you can’t talk like this. For your own mental health and for other queer people. You are not “part of the problem”, what does that even mean? You talk about yourself just doing something that clearly makes you happy as if you’re actively hurting other people. You’re literally just existing. It really fucking sucks that there are people out there who treat us badly just because we’re trans but that doesn’t mean they’re right to do that.

You’re not wrong for wanting to pass but I hope you take everybody’s comments to heart because if you ever do start to pass you can’t have this attitude towards other visibly queer people.
I'm so sorry dude.

From what I've read on this post you live in an incredibly toxic environment. No one should be making you feel this way. You don't owe conformity to others, but they do owe you basic human respect and it sucks that you are apparently not getting that.

I'd reccomend you move somewhere more liberal - somewhere where the majority is open and loving towards the queer community if not openly queer themselves - but I'm assuming that's not an option or at least not an easy one - it never is.

But even if you can't get out of this situation right now I want you to know that this is NOT normal. It is NOT like this everywhere. Basic acceptance and respect of other identities is the norm in a lot of places and I sincierely hope that you can find such a place for yourself. In the meantime I'd reccomend finding queer groups in your area. Ways of doing that are just starting at google and then scowering social media. Even asking on reddit if there are other trans people in your area you could chat with. Carve out as much physically present support as you can and cling to online support if necessary.

You deserve better. And I sincierely hope you get to a safer place, both physically and mentally. Take care.
I hope you find peace as your gender, male or male adjacent. Everyone's bodies work different with testosterone. I'm AFAB, but enby and pre everything. So I'm not even sure if I can get on hormones because my Dad has passed away from an aortic rupture at 52. It will probably shorten my life significantly. Maybe if I microdose, it won't present itself a problem as quickly? I haven't talked this over with any health professionals yet. I'm also thinking about top surgery too, but I'm not sure if I'll be completely out, seeing as I wasn't during my wisdom tooth surgery. But everything was still numb, so don't worry.
Anyways.
Cis-passing is such bull, there's got to be more gender neutral bathrooms for us who don't look ""conventionally male"" or ""conventionally female"". That's all I've got. Stay strong.
Why do you care more about how random strangers perceive you than how comfortable you are in your own skin?
i'll put it like this: you, as a human being on this earth, have the right to take up space as who you are. if people think that is aggressive or offensive or political, then so fucking be it. you cannot control that. you are not responsible for controlling other people's reactions to how you exist. you cannot be responsible for controlling other people's reactions to how you exist. it's a hard lesson to learn (i struggle with it myself) but it's not one you can ignore. you've gotta figure out a way to address your guilt and where it comes from, or you're not going to be happy. you can't live your life in fear of the way other people perceive you for existing. from a safety perspective, you may have to, but outside of that, this is something you've gotta work on. you are not the problem, the guilt is in itself the problem.
As a femme non-binary person who doesn’t quite pass for a cis woman, I identify with you and all of this so much.

I think it all comes down to internalized transphobia, which I have more than enough of to go around. You perceive yourself as “subjugating” other people to your identity and forcing it on them because deep down you believe that trans identity is something that’s immoral, wrong, gross, or to be ashamed of. 

You mention you’ve “become part of the problem”, but what you need to realize is that being trans *is not a problem*. Being yourself and feeling comfortable in your own skin (as you mentioned, your physical dysphoria is gone) *is not a problem*. 

The reason you feel guilt and shame is because since you were a child, you’ve been taught that trans people are disgusting and unnatural. If you ever want to be happy as yourself, you need to focus all of your efforts on unlearning this. It’s going to be very hard and will take time. 

But I believe you can overcome this guilt and learn to see yourself with love and grace.
MTF myself, and I totally understand where you’re coming from. Totally. The first year of my transition was that uncanny valley thing. Not quite a man, not quite a woman. 

I made people very very uncomfortable and the worst thing about it in those early days is that the harder I tried to blend in, the more obvious I made myself. I felt like a walking neon sign.

It’s not that I felt queer people need to hide, nor even that I felt necessarily ashamed of who I was. I just didn’t want to deal with it. I didn’t want to deal with the stares and the conversations I knew must be happening every time I left a room. 

I felt conspicuous and worthless … like there was no group I could ever belong in. Either I was trying to hard to pass to hang with the out and proud crew or I was too queer and weird looking to hang with the straights.

I get where you’re coming from. I don’t think it was internalized transphobia. I think it was an urgent, desperate, visceral need to just *fit the fuck in* like I had all my life up to then (at least on the surface) … I just didn’t want to be different. 

But I was different, and I was transitioning and that meant leaving every vestige of “just fitting in” behind … it meant admitting who I was in public every day everywhere forever.

It just took a long while. 

I’m in year 4 now and those feelings are still present for sure but nowhere near the old severity. 

HRT took a very very long time to yield results but that did improve things. I visually pass these days for the most part … not to say I’m unclockable, but things have progressed out of the uncanny valley to the “foothils of the benefit of the doubt” … stares and such are much more rare these days

But overall the biggest change was interior to my own mind. There came a point where I finally internalized a new point of view: I cannot know or care about, or own or control how people perceive me. Period. If I sounded like Julie Andrews when I spoke and I passed like Janet Mock every single day that *still would be true*

Be patient with yourself. You aren’t where you want to be, but I’d bet looking back you can for damn sure say it’s better than where you’ve been. 

This mess takes time is all. 

And you existing in public as a visibly queer person is not a burden on others. Your perception of what you imagine other people think about you … is a burden on you.

You can give yourself permission to stop carrying that weight. If you’re like me, it’ll take a lot of reminding yourself and it’ll be a long while till you believe it. But you can and you definitely will. 

You’ll get where you want to be
Ok babe, first thing’s first: You are not responsible for anyone’s snap judgements or political views, especially not that of strangers. This is a hard thing to unpack, especially if you have an overdeveloped sense of empathy, but if some rando’s blood pressure shoots up because they see a visibly trans person then that is their issue they need to work out. You are not subjecting anyone to anything by existing in public. Take it from a little bastard like me who lives in a major metropolitan area. I see so much stuff from random people that I’d rather not see, but that’s just what happens when you live around humans. If the street preacher has no shame about spewing hateful rhetoric, then you shouldn’t for just being.

Now, this is a very vulnerable thing to accept. You’re working against your external safety in order to achieve internal safety. Unfortunately for us trans folks, those often come in conflict. But what helps me is understand what is and isn’t in my control. I can control what makes me feel like me. If presenting as a woman makes me feel like a danger to myself physically or psychologically, then it is my duty to do what is necessary to ease my internal suffering. Call it self care, call it self respect/love, or call it just existing in a rebellious meat suit. It is necessary to live authentically. What you cannot control, and will never control is how people see and react to you. If someone treats you terribly due to their prejudice, it is THEIR fault for acting in an antisocial manner to someone just existing. It is THEIR duty to educate themselves and acknowledge their behaviors as negative. You could stop presenting as visibly queer, sure, but clearly the cost is too high for you mental health to do that. 

So I suggest working towards accepting fear, vulnerability, and lack of control in this situation. This is terribly hard, I know. But coming from a person with OCD, I can tell you it’s possible. You are so strong in being able just to have done the inner work to realize  you’re trans, especially in this bullshit world. It’s shitty and terrifying and exhausting to have to fight every day of your life, but it’s better than the alternative.

So get yourself a treat and be gentle with yourself today (and every day). You deserve to be treated with the same grace you give to everyone around you. ❤️
You aren't forcing everyone around you to choose a side just by breathing. The truth is most people do not care thay much amd those who do, suck. You are punishing yourself... For breathing. For taking up space. You do not deseve that.

Hear me? You are punishing yourself. For being alive.
You deserve to feel loved, and safe, and supported just the way you are.
I’m a trans woman, 9 months HRT, and my voice is deep as sin, I’m hairy, and my clothes are as agender as they come.

It’s important to remind ourselves that our journeys are different. There are pre-HRT people that “pass” more than I do, but that doesn’t make me any less trans. I forget that sometimes and sometimes I’m terrified of being a conservative’s idea of a trans woman, a deluded, hairy man in a dress. That’s not who I am though, and I have so much more work to do. Trans isn’t a start or an end, trans is you.
I’m so sorry it has been so hard but it is a very slow process and requires time. I do hope you have a solid support group of friends and allies that can give you encouragement. Your doctor would want to hear this too. He/she might help you anticipate what can still be expected. Knowing the expected results might keep you encouraged too.
People being uncomfortable around you is not something you should feel bad about. Should burn victims hide themselves at home because it might make some people uncomfortable?

As to wanting to pass you could take stock of what is preventing you from passing, and work on the needed areas. If it’s your voice there is vocal training for transmasc people. If it’s your chest you can bind if surgery isn’t an option. If you have wide hips there are pant options that can minimize the appearance, you can also wear shirts that make your upper body look larger. Building upper body strength is a good way to appear more masculine.

Confidence is a huge factor in passing. Your internalized transphobia is bad for yourself, and other trans people. A lot of people won’t have the luxury of passing. Trans people deserve to exist, and be treated with dignity regardless of how well they pass.
“Full changes” are going to take a few years
If it helps, “looking half and half” as you put it is par for the course especially if you haven’t been on HRT for a significant amount of time. I think it takes years for some things to fully develop. I’m not too versed on FTM changes but I know it’s that way for trans women.

And as others are saying, you are not responsible for other people’s queer phobia. You aren’t part of the problem, you are the subject. You are a real trans person so people having a problem with trans people isn’t your problem, it’s theirs. They are the ones who should be holding guilt. You said it yourself, people like that are making you scared to live your life and it’s affecting your normal daily functioning. That will never be your fault.
>I hate that I've become part of the problem

You are not part of the problem. Trans people are not part of the problem. People who hate trans people and systems designed to oppress us are the entirety of the problem.

You are not the problem. Please let go of that damaging, self-destructive, transphobic, and **false** notion.

I hope you are able to find a way to present the way you want to in a way that you feel safe. I hope you can overcome the hate society has taught you to feel for yourself. I hope you can love yourself.
Not your responsibility!

Plain and simple others opinions of you are not your responsibility. If you were horribly scared or born with a visible defect or afflicted with any condition that made you stand out you wouldn't feel responsible for their opinions or discomfort would you? Being trans is no different. Your only responsibility is living your best life.
Stand tall and proud and be the best you. It will get better.
Hang in there brother, you got this.
I'm so sorry <3  
I totally understand this feeling, this will pass in time, not as fast as you want but faster than you believe...  
and whats even more amazing is that so very few people will see the statement you think you are making, but the ones that do will probably be the most amazing allies and new best and most amazing friends you have ever had in your whole life.  


so....  
buckle up buttercup, if you keep going out, and living every day like any other normal day, the best ride of your life is about to begin. If its anything like my experience has been, you are going to have smiles for miles like you wont believe <3 <3
Bro don't detransition go to therapy
Eh maybe give it more time? I don’t think you need to be ashamed, everyone has the middle period. Besides, being a “walking political statement” doesn’t have a lot of social benefits, but it means you’re doing what you believe is right.
First question: How long have you been on HRT? It takes a while to kick in, and it's easy to be disappointed because it didn't live up to your expectations. Stuff like this can take forever to work, think of it as any other medication. It takes a while to fully set in and work well, right? Also, remind yourself that really no features are ""masculine"" or ""feminine"". The way that you look could be reflected in a cis man, easily. Trust me, there are billions of people in the world and every single facial combination you could think of. I have plenty of cis friends who get mistaken as men or women when they're not. What you're feeling is a valid feeling, but remember that HRT takes time.
Others have said it better but here's my thoughts.

Why do you feel guilty about things that are it of your control? That makes no sense. You're needlessly pinning the reactions of others onto yourself. Even if you were cishet, you'd still not owe other humans anything; not too look pretty or act a certain way or have certain outlooks and reactions.

In short: you are you and there's nothing anyone can do about it. 

In short vulgarity: Fuck the opinions of not-you. 💜
You come first. If people around you, or even your family members, hate you for being yourself, then fuck em. Sad but true.
Just don't do what I did. I'm a trans women but when I couldnt pass or was forced to present male Instead of fighting back for the longest time I rolled with it and just blended in by acting like all of the conservative redneck men that live in my area. Because it's easier to try and blend with them, than try to pass as a woman. During those times seeing any lgbt person angered me and made feel hateful towards myself for not letting myself be happy the same way they were and I'd take my anger out on them. 

Even if you don't pass just stay true to yourself. It isn't worth trying to hide it. I knew plenty of trans women that made you question what they were, and they were at their happiest constantly pushing me to just come out. What I did wasnt right at all and I wish I came to terms with myself sooner. 

I still get called sir at work, usually it is some spiteful redneck trying to get a rise out of me, other times it's not and they instantly apologize. Social dysphoria sometimes never goes away, never compare your journey to another person's. Everyone has a different beginning, middle, and end.
Idk why people are downvoting every answer you give, dont feel bad for feeling this way, it happens. But you need to accept that you are who you are and you made that decision for yourself. You dont live to please other or make them comfortable. The hate you get is unjustified. If straight people made you uncomfortable, should everyone ajust to what you feel? I dont think they would. Dont give them the victory. Its hard to be visibly queer, but its not your fault. Its the way you were born. Hope you find peace with this 🖤💜💙💚💛🧡❤
did you really just say that people dont deserve to be subjugated to seeing you? 💀 puhlease, that literally doesnt make sense.

what ""problem"" do you think youre apart of? how are you ""political?""

you deserve to exist. you existing does not harm anyone. do not ever think otherwise. this does not change if you think you dont ""pass."" saying otherwise literally makes zero sense
If youre a man youre a man, man up. Its not social dysphoria its called internalized transphobia. Were you raised conservative or in a conservative area because there is no other reason i can genuinely think of for being so guilty over being yourself. Youre allowed to have pronouns. Youre allowed to impose them on others. Its called respecting yourself. Grow a spine.
This is a troll it has to be
How long have you been on hrt?
It’s not your fault. HRT and other transitioning methods are often shown in an amazing light when often, many people get stuck in the exact same position as you. Do what you can to feel good in your own body and don’t care what other people think. Whatever path you choose to take now is valid
How long have. you spent on the meds, sometimes it just takes longer for your body to “look like” the desired destination.  That said, if you want give it up, its up to you, you can always return to your prior state, or even be in between.   Don’t feel guilty.
First of all, jerks being hostile to queer people is not your fault. You don't owe anyone a specific gender appearance. 

Second, you are not a problem but OMFG I relate to this feeling!!! Asking people to call me a different name and use different pronouns feels like a huge ask. 

Source:  I'm kinda passing lately but it's inconsistent so public toilets are a nightmare. I am so visibly queer it is a little ridiculous. Lately I see people doing intense calculations trying to figure me out. Even my voice is indeterminate.
It takes a bit for it to start to kick in give it time
i felt this way about 6 months into my transition, it felt stagnant and unfulfilling and the results were really letting me down. another few months down the road and i finally started recognising myself in the mirror! stick it out just a bit longer if you can, it can take up to 2 years to see the full results of masculinising HRT. good luck
How long have you been on T? Do you have had top surgery or do you have so less extra fat you're able bind it way it's not really visible?  


Guilty and ashamed sounds odd. Like you would done something wrong to somebody else. I get if you're sad or disappointed or angry but why guilty or ashamed?
How long have you been on T?
Holy moly there is soooo much to unpack here. Have you been in therapy yet? Not just for the issues you’ve stated but the way you speak about yourself is as if you don’t believe that you deserve space in the world. I struggled with that for non lgbtqia+ reasons and it took a lot of time to learn self love and allowing yourself to be allowed to exist in the world. You are allowed to take up as much space on this earth as anyone else. You are allowed to exist in the world. You cannot and will not ever please everyone. And that’s ok.
People need to calm down and take a deep breath. Down voting op for things they're facing irl is just not helping at all.

Op there is no magical solution other than trying your best to present the gender you want. You don't owe anyone any expectations. It's there fault if they show you open hostility.
I’m sorry you’ve been led to such a sorry state of living. But let me tell you this. Trans people are not rats living off cis crumbs. They do not dictate our lives. I do not give one toss about their comfort or what seeing me makes them think or feel. They will respect me. They will show basic human decency or they will suffer the consequences. You’re acting like a worm crawling along for a crumb of acceptance from a populace that wants you dead. You’ve got to get a sense of pride and stick to it. You are not here to please and placate the cis. You’re here to inform them how it’s going to be.
It’s definitely not talked about enough the social changes that come along with transitioning. I wish I would have known and had been more prepared. 
Your being put into a completely different gender role and also the way T effects your brain isn’t even gone over in the initial paperwork. If you need to talk my DMs are open. This is really tough to navigate.
Yeah this is my fear of being half and half but I see a lot of people who have been doing it for years and they have the before and after photos and I’m just like “OMG GOALS PLEASE BE ME!”
The reality is that T affects everyone differently and people respond differently. And that should be enough. It's really frustrating when people don't see you as what you want but your life is not contingent upon their acceptance or perception of you. Anyone who cares otherwise can get fucked.
Holy shit this is so eloquently put, well done!
Damn. Thank you for writing this. I needed it
You put it so wonderfully. As a Trans woman who doesn't pass yet I need to hear this myself sometimes. I hope this helps the OP as well.
Coworkers made the decision to use she/her for me and I feel guilty getting upset because like, that's their free speech, they should be allowed to say or think whatever they want but I feel like such a dick for making it into a huge issue

Edit: ""free speech"" is not the right word term but I don't know how else to word it. I don't want to force people to police their own language, I guess
I work in a grocery store and kids come in sometimes and I don't want to be the reason why parents have to have that talk with their children
People want to go to school and the grocery store without having to make political judgments about others. I am scared I'm forcing them to choose to take a side when they see me and that's unfair to do to a stranger
I don't think other queer people should have to hide their identity, but it would be good if it was an option for me specifically. I think people want to live as visibly openly queer should be *allowed* to do so but in the world we live in it is not reasonable for everyone
My first dose was Mar 2019 and I have been off and on but since Oct 2020 I have been on a steady dose. Things stopped changing like my voice has settled and stuff around halfway last year
I'm in therapy but it's with a cis woman and I'm not sure she understands entirely. I have tried to find LGBT therapist but not much luck. I have been in therapy since I was a kid bc I have cormorbid disorders. I feel like not much is being done in therapy to help me. I am seeing her weekly and actually our next appointment is in a couple hours
I don't have any support circle at all. I don't know how to find it. I feel like when I find a group I am so completely different than their experiences
I think it's because quite a few of his comments are pretty transphobic. Not intentionally, obviously, but he is basically saying ""it's bad to be visibly trans because people shouldn't have to deal with that.""
2-3 years. The timeline is wonky but I have had at least 2 years stable dose Oct 2020- Dec 2022 and most of the physical changes have settled now

My first dose was March 2019 and I had to quit around August that year and then since last month I have been taking shots but I think it's too low
also the fact that you’d do anything rather than go back to presenting as a woman is the key that you’re on the right path. that’s exactly how i knew as well
Okay you have already talk about those feelings.
Hey np, I'm glad it helped! It seems to be resonating with a lot of people, so I'm glad I thought to write it :)
Fun fact, free speech is a right guaranteed **by** the government, for freedom from persecution **from** the government. It's not freedom from the consequences of your words?? An every-day person making requests about what they are called is not an infringing on freedom of speech, don't be ridiculous.

are they ALLOWED to use she/her for you? sure, i guess so. that doesn't mean they should, or that you are in the wrong for correcting them.
That's not their right, it's a form of harassment. What if you were to call a cis-woman with she/her pronouns colleague he/him all the time? How would that go down?
You can't help getting upset at that , they also know that.

It’s a set given , you can't influence it.
That's not what freedom of speech is lmao
The whole idea of “free speech” is that the government can’t punish you for speaking your mind, not that nobody is allowed to disagree with or challenge what someone says. Correcting somebody who is misgendering you isn’t infringing on their right to free speech, and it certainly wouldn’t be infringing on anybody’s rights for you to feel upset about it. You can’t control how you feel. This stuff is only a “huge issue” to people who want to make it an issue. You’re not a dick for sticking up for yourself.
Oof I think you could really use a different therapist. Or just more of it.
Hey there. How people talk about YOU is not free speech. In fact it is a crime to harass, offend, accuse falsely, saying hateful (racist, homotransphobic) stuff.

I hope you can see you are just being yourself and everyone has a right to their own experience, but no one has any rights about other people's existence

Btw if you want tips to pass better as a man I bet we can help out! How long have you been on HRT?
You’re allowed to stand up for yourself, you know that right? Also how long have you been on T? You stay on T for a few years and it’ll be different.
oh my goodness, friend. this breaks my heart to read. i understand not wanting to garner that attention for yourself, but you are not responsible for the reactions of others.  also, being trans and visible isn’t something shameful or unusual such that it requires “that talk”. and frankly, if they have children old enough to be out in the world, they should be exposed to the realities of said world (also, as a 20+ year veteran childcare provider, i can assure you that the kids are absolutely fine and tend “get it” because they don’t have to unlearn as much nonsense as most adults do.). do not let strangers dictate your comfort in your body. you deserve to be here as your authentic self just as much as anyone else. 

HRT works differently for everyone. i’ve been on T for about 18 years and i definitely remember feeling similarly disapponted for at least the first 3 or 4.  remember that you are essentially putting yourself through puberty (again), and your body is going to go through all that unpredictable, awkward shit (again), but i guarantee you’ll be so glad you stuck it out.

edited for typo
If not you there's tons of other people that although few compared to the total population they might be meeting eventually,  you don't have to shield these people from the world that's not your job.

(Edit: yo you don't need to downvote him like this we're talking it out)
But do they have to make political judgements ? Why wouldn’t they just go 'oh that person looks a bit androgynous' and move on with their life ? What is it to them ?
Their rights end when ours start. You’re just paralyzed by fear that you’re going to get made into a viral video. I get it. But you can’t let others railroad you for your own life.
sorry but this right here is total BS, it’s not your problem it’s theirs, and if you continue to make it your problem you’ll just go on hurting yourself… also following your logic: then slaves should’ve remained slaves in order to not force people to take a side? imagine those poor slave owners they must’ve been devastated… now seriously, no offense but this is freakin nonsense
First of all, you can't MAKE anyone do anything when it.comes to their thoughts, beliefs, and what they do with their emotions. Generally speaking, it is a choice for someone to become upset at how you present because ultimately it's not their fucking problem. They don't need to be gawking at you. Also, anyone can get mad about anything. If it's not a visibly queer person it'll be a punk or someone wearing a mask or a women walking down the street or a black person or a young person using a cane or....it can go on and on and on. 

It's uncomfortable for you right now but also hormones can take time and that time varies person to person. It might just take a bit of perseverance to get through
""People want to go to school and the grocery store without having to make political judgements about others"" they can choose not to, is the thing. You are taking all this responsibility for something that's not your fault.

You aren't forcing everyone around you to choose a side just by breathing. The truth is most people do not care thay much amd those who do, suck. You are punishing yourself... For breathing. For taking up space. You do not deseve that.
Think of it like this, replace the word trans with black. As in “im scared im forcing people to pick a political side when the see me a black person in public, it’s unfair to do that to a stranger” 

That sounds really ridiculous right? That’s because there’s only one right side to be on. Anyone who is uneasy about seeing a racial minority is absolutely a racist or very ignorant. This isnt a perfect analogy, trans. Pltrans people and racial minorities have very different issues Black people can’t hide the fact that they’re black. But even if they could, they shouldn’t have to. this is literally about affording people, the bare minimum of basic human decency. 

There are no two sides to this you either support trans people’s existence or your a bigot/transphobe. This is not a political issue, but shitty hateful people are making it a political issue. don’t buy into that. Tolerance of your existence in the world is not up for debate. 💜
It sounds like you've internalized that queer people should have to hide though, even if you consciously understand that's bull.

You wrote:

> I'm like a walking political statement now

and

> I don't want to be political or offensive or aggressive to anyone [implying you are right now]

and

> [strangers] don't deserve to be subjugated to this [my transness]

and most troubling

> I've become part of the problem [visibly trans people]

and

> I feel so guilty existing in the world as I am now

You've internalized the belief that trans people are a problem, but since you consciously know that's not true you're projecting all that onto yourself. It's going to be hard, but you need to start affirming yourself and your right to exist even in the face of a hostile world.

A small step you can take towards this is writing down something you like about yourself or something good that you did once a day, like a gratitude journal just about yourself. At first don't even make it about trans things, it can be so small like ""I smiled at someone who seemed down and hopefully their day was a bit better"" or ""I thought my hair looked good today"". Even if it feels forced and fake, it helps get you in the practice of noticing the good about yourself, it will get easier over time.

And if at all possible, get a therapist (if you don't have one already), you are struggling with extreme negative self-esteem. If you feel like this all the time, you are probably depressed as well, consider asking a doctor or therapist about anti-depressants.

Best of luck on your journey <3
I agree, but it shouldn't be a reason to feel guilty. I get ""masking"" for self defense, but don't let yourself feel bad for being you. I understand your fear, but try to fight those worries: other people's feelings, especially strangers', shouldn't limit how you live your life. ❤️🤗
Not wanting to be recognized as transgender is a legitimate desire for a variety of reasons. I wish you the best and hope that over time you will pass better. Maybe for the time being, your supportive friends or trans peers can help you make it less obvious.

Internalized transphobia is not your fault.

But please understand that feeling ashamed for being recognizable as trans is absolutely caused by internalized transphobia like my previous commenters said. After all, you'd have no reason to feel ashamed if you didn't see it as something that at the very least others will think of negatively. Perhaps you have made negative experiences with people who tried to make it obvious that they're trans and you don't want to be associated with them. Perhaps you've made negative experiences with how others view trans people in general. Understand that in either case you're ashamed of showing yourself as trans because you know it as a bad thing, because you know it's culturally accepted as a bad thing. A person who doesn't transition is seen as less questionable than a person who does. That's the essence of transphobia.
you are allowed to choose if you want to be visible. but what visible means it is not defined by you. it is defined by society. the thing is that your discomfort is the result of assuming that the bourdon falls on you to answer for the failings of society. I get that it is dangerous. I am a trans woman tha tis 185 cm tall and weights more than 100kg. I am not exactly what you call passing. it is not my fault nor it was my responsibility to conform to the sensibilities or ""civil"" society. there are deffinitely steps to make you look more cis if that is what you want. I am more than happy to be here to support that decision. you get to choose what makes you happy and what fullfils you. on the other hand though you need to take a step back and see what part of the discomfort is you not reaching your goals yet or society been a\*holes. you can choose to present cis and yet say fuck society you have no control over me. I want to look as much as a beautiful cis woman I can, because I want to be beautiful for me and my potential partner not because society tells me to. I feel happy when I look cute. however I don't plan to put any effort other than the bare minimum required by cis women in my work place. I am no different and if someone finds that I need to explain my existence to them, they are more than welcomed to fuck off.
I agree with the commenter and your response OP! <3 Both are true. ;)
How long have you been on it? It can take 2+ years and sometimes surgeries to be able to look how you see yourself. And I think working on internalized transphobia stuff could help. Passing is definitely a safety issue and finding what feels truly authentic to you and how you see yourself vs what society says is also important.
It can take more than 3 years of constant treatment, and the effect comes in random spurts. What do you feel hasn't changed enough?
Do you think it might be helpful to bring up ""I feel guilty for wanting people to treat me a certain way"", and leave the trans part out of it? 

Because it sounds like that's what it boils down to - you've really internalized the idea that it's rude to ask other people to be considerate of you. Which is not true - you have every right to say ""I want to be treated this way"" and to exist in the way you feel comfortable. So the goal would be to work on it and get to a point where you really feel like that's true and not like you're imposing on anyone by existing and asking to be treated with respect.

 If you tried discussing that problem in general without bringing up the fact that it's popping up in relation to you being trans, is it possible that she could be more helpful then?
Have you tried looking for a trans support group? I’m part of an online group for trans men/transmasc people that is offered for free through a gender health clinic in my area. It has definitely helped give me some sense of community, maybe there’s something out there like that for you.
I haven't done hrt but several people I love have, it takes time and there can definitely be some second puberty moments that might not be reflective of how you'd like to look. Talking to a doctor about your hrt goals and concerns might be helpful, or maybe find a therapist who's trans (virtual visits are easy to find now and Psychology Today has some good filters).
Yeah i get that but i think it doesnt come from a place of hatred towards other people, mostly towards himself. Just thought it was kinda shitty
Can you get a higher dose? I’d bet a dollar that now you’re on injections a higher does would do the trick.
I have been on T for over two years consistently, almost four years total. I know it is not super long but it's at the point where most of the major changes stop happening
In an ideal world it would work that way but people here do get upset
I disagree. I think it’s more that OP is very aware of how the world sees him (and all of us) which is, currently, as a polarizing political statement that only exists to cause conflict. That doesn’t mean it’s the right way to view trans people but that’s what the external world sees right now. Being aware doesn’t mean OP himself thinks this is right.
Totally this. Fat redistribution and hair growth seem to decide on a whim when to stop doing their own thing and behave. I’m 8 years on T and don’t think my body got the idea until around yr 4-5. The disgust, dysphoria and discomfort  etc you’re describing are normal. I definitely felt that way for a long bit. The image you had of yourself pre transition isn’t always going to match the results at the end. And you’ll realize after a bit that’s fine and actually even better. We all tease that hormones are second puberty for a reason haha. Puberty sucks and you look like a lanky hairy smelly monster regardless of gender at some point during those OG teenage years. 2nd puberty does the same. You think I was expecting my shoe size to go up from a women’s 5 to a 7? Like omg I’m 26 and my shoes don’t fit wtf. Even if I’d started T at the youngest age like 15-16 it still would of been a similar whirle wind to decipher from female puberty that started much much younger 11-12. Give yourself some slack it’s okay 🥲

I was a 90pd blonde blue eyed perfect 🤮skinny white girl ^TM pre transition. Deodorant was an option and my size 0 jeans barely stayed on my flat ass twig hips. Gaining weight and hair was exciting at first and then when I was depressed from many other outside factors I started to hate the grossness of physical masculinity. Too smelly weird hair why fat there? But, just as puberty ends that did too. I’m 145-150ish pounds now and have a red beard of all things. Actually topped out at 170pd but that quickly went down and settled at where I am now. Kinda takes a while to figure out your new metabolism. Give it time and regardless of the future it’s your body. Do what feels right for this you. I don’t regret wearing a packer everyday in college. I know i needed the confidence boost and gender euphoria to balance out the “living in Arkansas” part of not passing. Or at least being mistaken for being 14. I don’t need or want to wear one now but I’m glad college me did. If the hair is gross now shave it. I know I shaved my legs for at least a couple of years on and off just because the texture got to me. You get to define your identity. Don’t worry your body will catch up to your brain. You can make it. Keep talking to other queer people they’ll understand. Thanks for sharing ❤️ 

ps take a picture of your original post so when google or apple give you a reminder photo of this “day” in 5 yrs you’ll be able to smile to yourself knowing that past baby you was having a hard time and would love to be able to see current you now. At least that’s what I do. 🤗
If I were to be very picky I would say I wish I had more facial hair. I never got bottom growth which is disappointing but obviously has nothing to do with whether I pass or not. I have stopped noticing new changes but it's not like there is anything that was really missed.

That's the problem, I have absolutely no idea what features don't pass. I see myself when I look in the mirror. I see a man and I like how I look. It's everyone else that tells me I look like a woman. I have no way to judge what needs to be fixed
It’s usually dose/application that effects “slower” results. 2nd Puberty is also a long ride average puberty is 5-7 years. It doesn’t impact everyone evenly as far as how/when it hits.

My first puberty I was a late as fuck bloomer. Second puberty is kinda being like that too.
I am not sure. Injections are very difficult for me to do so I am planning not to continue with them, to just switch back to gel. And if I am being completely honest I am happy with how my body looks and the changes I got from T. It is just that I do not pass
That consistency can be key! But whether or not you pass in society shouldn’t be your focus or priority. What matters is that you feel good about how you look for you. I had to disown my mothers parents after being on T for a year because they would not come around. You have to do what’s best for you. Always prioritize yourself.
Why do you feel bad about making awful people upset? Only a bigot would have a problem with your existence
Seems petty on their part.
You can recognize that transphobia exists without internalizing that trans people are the problem. Transphobia is the problem, trans people are just trying to vibe. Other people's bigotry is not on you
It took me 5 years of T to start passing 100% of the time. About that long to start growing a beard too. It can just take some time, longer than you want. But that doesn't mean it won't ever happen.

Alternatively, is it possible your dose should be higher?
Hi there! Facial hair can indeed help passing. You could try Minoxidil, it helps. Have you been talking blood tests to see how your T levels are going?
I'm over 6' tall. I don't wish to dress hyper feminine and I get ""sir""'d everywhere in person. My voice passes as a woman on the phone and online, but that doesn't translate when it's coming from someone my height.

I've heard cis women complain about the exact same problem. That if they don't perform gender to other's expectation they get misgendered all the time.

That is not an individual failing. That's an issue with society and them hyper focusing on certain traits or presentations that have absolutely nothing to do with gender.
If you're comfortable sharing a link to a pic of yourself, we could help settle your concerns. It may well come down to who you're asking, too (like, if your colleagues are ignoring your pronouns, they may just be being transphobic in general.) 

For what it's worth, though, I've (AMAB) always had very little facial hair growth; it's very patchy and has never grown under my chin. I have a barely noticeable Adams apple and hardly any chest hair.

Post a picture there. People in there will tell you what is the problem and what you can do. They are brutally honest with you.  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/)   
Not so honest every time so I do not recommend.  


It's also many other things. How you speak, sit etc. What kind of hobbies you have.   


And maybe it's not about passing at all. Do strangers get your gender right? If so, then it's not about passing. If no, then it is about passing. People who know you pre-transition most likely are never really going to see you as a man. No matter how you look like or act like.   


Two years is not enough for many people. Beard can take 5 years.
And how do you take your T? If it's gel try injections. And yes take blood test and try to get higher dose.   


About bottom growth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowYourTDick/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowYourTDick/)
I feel like I don’t pass either. Took a bit to get used to tbh I opted to be openly out, It’s not everything. It’s also an unfair pillar to hold yourself up to. Cause it’s wildly individual and variable as to what passing means.
To say that everyone who acts this way is a bigot is an awful thought process. It means I am surrounded by bigots every day of my life. it means my entire family are bigots. It means most of the people I have to interact with, are bigots who hate me. I don't want to think that way, it is sad and scary to me
I never said others’ bigotry is our fault, it’s not. But as someone aware of the bigotry I do get anxious that I will experience violence as a result of others’ views. That doesn’t mean I am internally applying that bigotry to myself. I was trying to say that the same may be how OP is feeling.
Yes it is awful.  However, closing your eyes and pretending like this isn't whats going on, and instead blaming yourself for the shortcomings of the people around you, will make you miserable eternally.

If you cannot be yourself comfortably because the people in your life are judging you, then the people around you are not healthy for you. That is simply it. Its scary and it is sad. But it doesnt have to be this way.

Accepting that its not you who is in the wrong, is the first step of getting better.
I mean, the alternative is to think that you're wrong for simply existing. You said that your physical dysphoria is gone - that's good! That means you're healthier! So if you say that you're the problem, that would mean that you *being healthy* is bad for *other people.* That's not fair or right.

It is a sad and scary situation, but I think it's far sadder and scarier to think that you're ""wrong"" for being healthy.
I deal with lots of trans kids as a teacher and I hear this. It’s an awful thought that everywhere around you, people are bigots and hate you for being you.

But…it might be true. I’ll tell you something though, not everywhere is like that and it sounds like you live in a shitty place. I live in a village in England and the school I work at has loads of openly trans kids who feel pretty accepted. 

I think you are probably a teenager and the world can feel awfully small (not trying to downplay.) but it’s actually enormous. Might be you are the right you, in the wrong place. That’s what finding out who you are is all about. So give yourself a chance.
The truth is sometimes awful. The truth is only a bigot would have a problem with your existence.

I hope you can find a place with less discrimination and can surround yourself with better, less prejudiced people, and can build a happy and healthy found family.
You are surrounded by bigots. Anyone who is gonna do that about you just existing is a bigot. There’s no way around it
Feel free to think you're a monster, but be aware that your internalised transphobia is also hurting us, which is pretty shitty.
It’s reductive, yes, but it’s not entirely wrong either. No person is one thing, and virtually everyone has some bigoted views. More to the point though, others viewing you through a political lens doesn’t make your existence a political statement. Now, I understand that might not be much consolation to you, but I think it’s important to remember anyway. I also think it’s important to remember that people around you holding some bigoted views about you does *not* in of itself mean those people hate you. It sucks, it’s truly awful, to have to deal with that but you are so much more than whatever bigoted views they hold about you
Maybe not everyone but probably a lot. Maybe take a breather from your community, go somewhere where you know people are open minded, experience different reactions and then you will notice that it's not you who's the problem, it's them.

If they have a problem, it's not you making/being the problem. It's them pushing it up until it's a problem.

I have an example where I don't want to compare trans people per se, but what you seem to think of trans people, please read with discretion, cause it's not necessarily a nice one.
You want to buy something at a shop near a major station, the person in front of you smells like booze, clothes look disheveled, pretty obvious they're homeless and they buy a pack of cigarettes with money they probably begged other people for. Most will judge the person, think it's unsightly, think it's a problem of the politics, think they shouldn't buy something like cigarettes if they're already given money, but after you paid your stuff, you go your way and forget about it. Maybe mention it to one or two friends how weird that experience was.
Only assholes go to the person, talk down on them, get aggressive, try to make their life even more horrible and go around blogging and writing everyone about how bad that was.
Both cases the people don't try to understand the homeless person and don't like it, but the first kind just go on with their life while the second kind decided to make it a problem not just for them but for all people.

It is not your fault if people think they must be the second kind.
It is what it is. It is impossible to work without bigots because most of people are. But you don't have to call them family. You don't have to have any kind of close relationship with bigots. And yes it is possible to find few good people to get friends or partners or whatever you want.
Surround yourself with better people. Those people are probably the reason you feel like this. You shouldn't live your life afraid to take up space. Whether it's moving away or just making new friends"	10pz8xs	trans	441	0.94	2023-01-31 13:37:39
"""It's okay for me to use the slur because I'm gay too"""	"In school, there's a trans boy who is in a lot of my classes. Specifically in our science class, he sits next to me, and it's really fun being able to have a conversation or to make jokes with him about trans stuff, despite him having very different experiences with dysphoria and transitioning. (I'm a trans girl btw)

But the other day, he made a joke with f*g as the punchline. He said it was okay for him to say because he's gay. (or some other sexuality where he's into other guys, idk) I'm not sure if he didn't know, or didn't realize, or if he automatically assumed I'd be okay with it, but as a trans lesbian, I was really uncomfortable. In the moment, I just kinda looked at him until the bell rung. Should have I done anything better?"	"I mean hes right that he can reclaim it as an mlm person, but maybe mention that youre uncomfortable with it being used around you, as youre fully in your right to say so, and reclaimed slurs are really only reclaimed if you dont use them to cause harm, so if using it around you is harmful to you, its wrong
I think he can say it. My rule of thumb is you can use slurs that have been used against your identity for yourself, maybe in general, but don’t use them for other people unless they told you you can. This seems more maybe, but still ok; however, if you explicitly tell him you are uncomfortable with it and why, it does feel really rude to keep using it when you’re part of the conversation
if he wants to use the f-slur as an ironic insult around people who consent to him doing so, then he has the ethical right to do so (since it’s a given that the usage does not actually imply homophobia due to his sexuality). what he *doesn’t* have the right to do is use it around another queer person that hasn’t made it explicitly clear that they’re okay with that kind of language.
[deleted]
Ok I'll be honest, I'm just like the guy you described. So maybe I can weigh in a little on his perspective. 

I used to be afraid to say that word, like a lot of people probably still are. But then I just said it, and now it's a casual throwaway in conversation that doesn't have the same shock value as it did before. And I think that's the point of reclaiming words that were used for a long time to tear people down. Those words weigh you down like an anchor, they were used by other people to specifically make you feel fear. They have power over you, but you refuse to let them influence you negatively anymore.

It might make some people cringe, but I say it for my wellbeing :)

I also would have loved to hear that joke!
I'm a transwoman and bisexual (although, much closer to a lesbian) and I use the f word with my friends casually. Either as a joke or just because I feel like saying it. I personally think it's perfectly alright to use if you are either trans or gay cause it is our way of reclaiming a slur that was used against us as a tool that queer people can use to socialize with each other. I think it's only wrong for a gay/trans person to use if it's maliciously and deliberately to insult/discriminate other gay/trans people like how Blaire White once in a video called other transwomen the t slur and that she consistently ridicules other transpeople while presenting herself as ""one of the good ones.
Me and my lesbian roommates call each other that as a joke, but never outside the house. Context and setting matters.
He's right tho. He can reclaim it. People in the affected groups are allowed to reclaim slurs and use them as jokes - my queer friend group uses the term all the time, just like we use the r slur because we're all autistic. 

If you personally are uncomfortable with that, you absolutely can tell him and ask him to not use the term around you. However it is absolutely okay for him to reclaim the term.
I’m a trans man and bi, male leaning. I’d say he definitely has the right to use that word, so unless you tell him to not do it around you because it makes you uncomfortable, he kinda doesn’t have to do anything about it. I choose not to use the word myself because I just don’t like it, so I do get where you’re coming from. I’m sure he’ll understand if you tell him :)
It's acceptable to reclaim slurs that are hurtful to you, but you can also say you're not comfortable with them
Who exactly *can* say it? I’ve always been confused. I’ve had a friend say anyone who wasn’t straight, another friend said only MLM, and I’m confused
Hws allowed to say it but you're also to be uncomfortable. Just tell him that you don't like ot when people day it
If you were a cis woman or het man, I would say that he has the right to use it as he pleases as a gay man, and that u have no grounds to weigh in as someone not part of the community it's used to demean. I think your identity as a trans woman is different. 

I'm not sure what experiences u have had, but I have heard of that word often being used in a violent way against trans women, especially before they may be out. If you're comfortable sharing your discomfort, I think ud be completely valid for doing so
Word choice is an interesting topic. Just as everyone can technically swear, that doesn’t mean everyone is comfortable with it. I’m not, for example, but I just have to deal with it. (Or else about 90% of the Internet is gone for me, and I’m friendless.)
However, slurs are pretty tricky. They are directly targeted at others, so if you object to that sort of language, speak up. You’re allowed to object to anything that makes you uncomfortable. Just talk it out and reach an agreement.
You can't reclaim a slur by using it as a slur, slurs are weapons used by bigots in order to dehumanize their victims, reclamation is meant to disarm that weapon, to take away it's power to hurt. If you use a slur to insult others you're not reclaiming it you're just doing the bigots work for them.
I don't know if you *should* have done anything better, you definitely could have told him that it made you uncomfortable (and still can just go back and tell him now). I think it's important to keep in mind that while it's obviously normal to be offended by f\*g, it's also normal for lgbt people to reclaim it and joke about it as a means of coping, so it doesn't sound like any harm was intended, but I'd still talk to him about it.
Im confused why op is upset with the word use in a joke, specifically why she needed to point out she is a trans lesbian.  I am a trans lesbian also, but i dont see that word as EXTRA offensive given my lifestyle.  Can i ask what im missing?
I mean, he can say it, it's really fine. Maybe you should just tell him hearing that word makes you uncomfortable and ask if he can refrain from using it while you're present? Even though he has the right to reclaim it in general, I doubt he's trying to make you uncomfortable.
Deal. We're allowed to use the self-descriptors that apply to us. What we do not get to do is dictate what correct language is to those who are staying in their lanes. Would you judge a person of color for using the reclaimed variant of the n-word?

Ask him not to use it if you feel compelled. But it's his call.
Reclaiming a slur is definitely a valid part of how minorities take their power back. Words like queer and dyke used to be slurs but they've been more or less reclaimed by the community.

However the key part of reclaiming a slur is that it does not cause harm. Queer might be reclaimed but plenty of older LGBTQ folks still find it offensive and so even if it's okay to say in general, you don't say it around those who aren't comfortable with it.

F****t is not yet in the reclaimed vernacular enough for anyone to assume that just because you're both LGBTQ that it's safe to use. Reclamation is a very tricky subject but if you're not comfortable with it, he shouldn't say it around you even if as a mlm person it is more or less acceptable for him to use it.
I’m not comfortable with the word, I want that word eradicated from the English language.

I’m not gay but I everytime I hear the word all I ever think is the violent history that gay people have had to deal with.

But yeah it’s not my place to judge whether a gay person is trying to reclaim it, and only for themselves, not for others unless they have been told it’s ok.
my opinion is anyone has the right to use any word but anyone also has the right to feel offended by use of a word.
trans gay person here! I don't really use the f slur much anymore but I feel fine when other people say it unless if I don't know if they can reclaim it/know they cant reclaim it. when its people i overhear definately feels weird. -Onyx+Finn
That is tricky. Some people are trying to claim it back. I see both sides it is a word used to demean gay men for decades, but some gay men feel as though they have the right to say it. I am not a gay man so I don’t feel like I have a place to say whether he should or shouldn’t say it. I realize this isn’t much help, but maybe just trying to see both sides could help.
Yeah, using a slur as a slur is not reclaiming a slur, he was definitely in the wrong and only wanted to use the slur with impunity, which is not why people reclaim slurs.
I reserve the right to call myself any number of slurs I want and will do so with complete confidence. So I can see where this is coming from.

But...

You should mention that you don't like it, and suggest he just keep it away from you. He should be able to accommodate for that, as it's easy and respectful to do so. If he continues to say things you don't like, then you're just gonna have to stay away.

I see it like cruel humor. I don't like to pad it and call it dark humor, because it's not dark, it's cruel, a lot of times. Thus, when I'm making fucked up, outright offensive jokes, I keep them in spaces where they won't hurt anyone. Usually with people who understand it's a joke and don't take it literally. 

I think it's the same way with a lot of things in language. Sometimes certain things don't need to be said at certain times and that's okay. Anyone with a half decent socialized braincell can fathom that. If they can't, then I don't think you should associate with them.

Remember, it's rarely a bad idea to speak up and mention you're uncomfortable with what a good friend is saying. Usually people will get it, so long as you're surrounding yourself with friends who aren't pricks. It's a good way to root out the assholes.
I spew gay slurs all the time in jokes, I just think it’s funny to be very gay and say that shit. I would never do it in front of someone I wasn’t 100% sure they wouldn’t mind and would understand the humor though.
It's a very weird topic. For me using those words sometimes in humor helps me reclaim it, they've been used against me by even my own mother, so it makes it feel more like it's more word and it can't hurt me if I use it. But if I'm around people that I know don't like it I try to refrain. It's an odd issue to deal with
i use slurs to BUT only ones that would pertain to me and only in the Spirit of reclamation... i wouldn't use it to hurt someone feelings.
he can reclaim it, but you have every right to be uncomfortable with it- let him know your boundary about that
Personally, I grew up in a small town, in bumfuck nowhere. Everyone called ppl names like gay, or f*g. It’s just a natural insult. But I can tell if it’s being used as a term to hurt me as opposed to being used loosely. I don’t really understand the sensitivity to words, it’s just how people talk in some parts. If it’s directed at me to hurt me then I will take offense, but ppl can say what they want and I won’t let it bother me if I hear it in passing
I'm kind of confused, are you suggesting he cant say it? He certainly can, but he shouldnt say it around you if it makes you uncomfortable! I'd suggest telling him that it makes you feel bad so dont say it around you, and if he continues that's a real dick moves and you are in no way obligated to stay friends, but its definitely in his right as a gay/mlm guy to say it. What's not okay is if he keeps saying it after you tell him its uncomfortable for you.
fuck it, reposting my reply to a comment as a general reply:

personally, it’s not a word i’ve reclaimed internally, so when someone uses it in front of me, it’s very jarring. (spoilered for homophobia)

>!it kind of feels like when you’re out in public and overhear people being blatantly homophobic—it’s a sudden reminder that there are a lot of people who hate you for who you are, and that they see you as a monster that’s not to be trusted around kids.!<

obviously, it would be better if none of us had that reaction, and i’m all for reclaiming terms and fighting our internalized homophobia. but it’s good to do so while acknowledging that the people around you may be in very different stages of that journey.

personally, it might be jarring but it’s legitimately helpful when someone uses that term to refer to themself in a shameless manner. but anything beyond that makes my day more difficult (using it as a joke about queer people in general or using it to refer to anyone who isn’t *clearly* consenting to it). that doesn’t mean y’all don’t have the right to use it like that—just that it will sometimes have a negative impact for some of us.

you’re well within your rights to tell him how you feel when he uses it. what he does then is up to him. maybe it helps him to use it! i certainly feel worse when people tell me that they feel uncomfortable when i use the word “queer”.
Gay guys can say it. If it bothers you so much you should just ask him not to use it around you.
He's allowed to say it, but he should also be understanding that it makes you uncomfortable, and avoid saying it around you.
I think It’s fine I’ve used that word before but if it made somebody uncomfortable I wouldn’t say it around them
He can say it because he can reclaim it, has long as he's not using it negatively towards other queer people it's fine. And if you're uncomfortable with him saying it around you maybe you can tell him how you feel, I'm sure he'll understand.
I understand your distaste of that word.  At the same time, I understand how him using it empowers him and it takes the sting out of it in his mind.  Nobody can use it as an insult to him if he openly owns it.  Please don't take that power away from him.

About me: recently out mtf trans who had masqueraded as a gay male for many years until I accepted who I really am.  I owned all of the insults and couldn't be harmed by anyone trying to use them against me.
The dissonance in some of these comments on the casual use of the f*, while reserving the t* gets me some kind of fucked up tbh.
This sounds more like a ""proper language shock"" case
This. If you say to him that it makes you uncomfortable and he keeps doing it or gets salty or angry then that’s a sign to unfortunately move on from being so candid with this guy.
Yeah, just depends on the people. Like, I'm fine with a transmasc person I know using it. He *is* gay after all. Would be fine with a lesbian using it as well, or really anyone who qualifies as ""gay."" I made sure he knows not to just make those jokes to anyone, though...
I think that it's arguable that it's not inherently unethical in a hard-line sense for him to use it around someone who hasn't explicitly made it clear that they're fine with it... just that it's socially questionable, and that one ought not to do so without first asking, since it might make other people uncomfortable. What *would* be unquestionably wrong is if he kept using it even after it was made clear that it was making people uncomfortable.
You have every right to take charge and own any slur used against you.  Doing so take the power away from those using them against you.
I get that, and that's great. But what about when you say that word and it hurts the people around you?
Wouldn’t “bi but closer to a lesbian” be pan? I’m in the same boat lol

Edit: literally just confused, not trying to misinform or tell anyone they’re wrong
I agree with you.  Definitely needs to be used solely for reclamation and not malice.

That word has definitely been historically directed at trans women as much as it's been directed at cis gay men. Op definitely has a stake in it, and it's not a word that has really been reclaimed the way words like dyke and queer have - it's still a very damaging slur most of the time.
It's not as common as using it as a derogatory term for gay guys, but it's also used as a derogatory term for trans women, invalidating our gender identity by saying we're just confused, effeminate guys.

Hurt who with the f slur tho? Straights? If OP feels uncomfortable then she just should tell the other person

That’s making me think even more. What if there was a genderfluid, non-binary, pangender, bigender ect. person that identified as bisexual or pansexual (just a random thought)
Interesting, i hadnt heard it used in that context before, but it is painful learning its used like that. Thank you for explaining!
I agree. But I also think that's an issue of personal respect, rather than a blanket rule to cease using it. If she doesn't like how he talks, she doesn't need to talk to him. But if she chooses to engage further, she has to take him on his terms. He has no requirement beyond what he's freely willing to give to not offend someone.

Personally, speaking only for myself and my own opinions, I didn't come out so other queers can police my expression as much as cispeople love to. Nobody has to like me. But I will describe and refer to myself how I please and I would hope that most queer people would do the same.
So I have a friend of mine who was dating this girl, and they were both quintessentially ""the straights."" For a date they went out golfing. During this outing, my friend was playing terrible and kept making what I'd say are casually homophobic remarks in a specifically self-deprecating manner. Like, he'd hit a crummy drive and say stuff like ""I might as well put on a skirt for how far I hit that."" Not vulgar, no slurs, but pretty sexist and somewhat homophobic.

She broke down in tears. He hurt her. She's straight as an arrow.

So, my question is, do you feel that your right to reclaim shitty language is more important than not hurting the people that are close to you? And, isn't placing the expectations on the person who is hurt really really close to victim blaming?

Just some food for thought.
personally, it’s not a word i’ve reclaimed internally, so when someone uses it in front of me, it’s very jarring. (spoilered for homophobia)

>!it kind of feels like when you’re out in public and overhear people being blatantly homophobic—it’s a sudden reminder that there are a lot of people who hate you for who you are, and that they see you as a monster that’s not to be trusted around kids.!<

obviously, it would be better if none of us had that reaction, and i’m all for reclaiming terms and fighting our internalized homophobia. but it’s good to do so while acknowledging that the people around you may be in very different stages of that journey.

personally, it might be jarring but it’s legitimately helpful when someone uses that term to refer to themself in a shameless manner. but anything beyond that makes my day more difficult (using it as a joke about queer people in general or using it to refer to anyone who isn’t *clearly* consenting to it). that doesn’t mean y’all don’t have the right to use it like that—just that it will sometimes have a negative impact for some of us.
Sorry Ilim just confused I think, a friend told me I was probably pan and that’s basically how I feel so I assumed that was the rough definition kinda
it’s not the bi umbrella it’s the mspec umbrella
Sorry I think I got it confused, a friend told me I was pan and that’s how I felt

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Personally I don't think anyone should use this slur but gay people still are allowed to.

They shouldn't use it obviously to hurt their own friends? Would question the friendship tbh but that ain't my problem.

If it's a laughter matter then who cares. What you were describing was a friend who was sexisitic as fuck
That is not at all the same thing as reclaiming a slur. That is a man saying homophobic and transphobic things. He was not gay so yeah saying homophobic things about himself was hurtful to everyone.
I think that a key difference here is that his bigoted language was explicitly sexist and directed against women, a group that she belongs to. I don't think that the previous commenter was saying that straight people don't also have the right to be treated with respect, but that the f-slur is not really something for them to weigh in on in terms of whether it is actively *hurtful* to them. Because the f-slur is inherently not about them. It's okay for them to say that it makes them uncomfortable to hear it, and it would be rude to keep using it if they expressed that. But unless they or someone close to them is the target of that slur (since straight people can be discriminated against for ""seeming"" gay) such that it has caused them personal harm, it's not really theirs to make judgements about.

And it's common courtesy, at least where I'm from, to hash out your differences in person rather than running to an online mob for support. It's also common courtesy to accept that different people have different experiences, different styles of speech, and different traumas they give voice to in different ways. And since that particular slur applies to him and not to her, as far as I can tell, common courtesy as it is applied to literally every other minority says it's up to him to decide what acceptable use is, provided he remains, as always, in his lane.

I would also say that if I had a penny for every single time someone has taken offense to my primary identifier (queer), I'd have a hundred bucks easy. That includes cis people and other lgbtq+ folks. Offense is subjective. To many, queer is a slur. To me, it's the most accurate descriptor of my identity that doesn't take fifty syllables to articulate and get me nothing more than blank stares. And I've always taken offense at anyone telling anyone else how they are allowed to refer to themselves. Whether it comes from a cisperson or an lgbtq+ person, it's rude to tell someone who they are or what they are allowed to call themselves. Common courtesy.

All she has to do is talk it out with him like grown-ups. He may agree to not use that language. He may not. But this isn't a hostile workplace situation. He doesn't have to talk to her, and vice versa. If she doesn't like it, oh well. If he doesn't like it, oh well. C'est la vie. Just because someone is queer doesn't mean you gotta be friends.
I think if you have a queer friend who doesn’t like it it’s a completely different situation. Think of all the other slurs people wanna be able to reclaim. I have a friend who loves to say transsexual (not a slur but it’s outdated and they don’t even fit in the definition of transsexual), the T word, among others. I’ll happily join in on transsexual, f*g/gy, dyke, but I draw the line on the T word. 

If a friend says that word to me, and I ask them to not, it’s a serious reconsideration of the friendship should they continue. They may be like “fuck this sensitive priss” but that’s on them and not me. No one deserves to suffer through language that hurts them, even in company of those that share in oppression. People who refuse to see that aren’t considerate, and I would hate to see someone lose friends over something so trivial. Not saying you’re a bad person or an asshole, but you don’t seem to understand the perspective espoused by many people in this thread. I’d consider examining that.

We should also be nice to straight people, as there are straight trans. Walk up to a Herero trans and call them a faggot, see what happens. On a bad day, you’re asking to get hit
That was 30 years ago, and a pivotal moment in his recovery from several of his -isms and -istics. From them to now, he's unrecognizable as the same person.

Again, he didn't mean to hurt his date. It was a ""laughing matter,"" and she cared. It still caused harm.

I'm not questioning if someone is allowed to use the word or not; I don't find that as an interesting question. What I do find as an interesting question is, are you willing to inadvertently cause harm to people close to you with your language, which you know to be capable of harm?
And if he were gay, then it would have been okay that he hurt that woman?
That's just gatekeeping with extra steps. You do realize that you're defining what can and cannot cause harm to another human, yes?
no not really. mspec just means you’re attracted to more than one gender. although bi and mspec can be two parts of cosiding identities, mspec and bi are not the same thing. bisexuality is very fluid and the meaning can change from person to person
This is the top comment too few will see imo 🖤
It would have been different. Like I joke about being so gay I can’t park straight all the time. I don’t see how that would have been hurtful? 

Like he was purposefully being hateful by making jokes about women and gay people being bad a sports when he is neither of those things. That reveals his true thoughts on how he sees other people. 

When I joke about being too gay to function people know I am refer to myself and my view of myself.
[deleted]
So then you're gatekeeping what hurts other people?
yes, mspec is all the identities that are attracted to more than one gender. but bi isn’t really the loose fitting identity. many bisexuals such as myself prefer to it being labeled as the mspec umbrella instead of bi.
No. I’m just saying using slurs and stereotypes of a GROUP YOU BELONG TO as jokes is not the same if someone who is not a part of that group makes similar jokes.
But does that mean that they can't or don't hurt other people when you use them?
If I made a joke about my bisexuality and someone straight told me that I hurt them. No I wouldn’t take it seriously at all. Like if you’re not also bisexual you don’t get to dictate how I joke about it. And yeah the most offensive I usually get about it is joking about people expecting me to make decisions 😂. 

If someone else who is bisexual told me that it hurt them. I would point out I was joking about myself and that I understand why that stereotype hurts. Hopefully we could come to an understanding and yeah I would watch out for the kind of jokes I make around them. 

But you made a false equivalency. Of course a straight person saying hurtful things about OTHER PEOPLE made other people upset.
>If I made a joke about my bisexuality and someone straight told me that I hurt them. No I wouldn’t take it seriously at all.

That is you literally gatekeeping what someone is allowed to be hurt by.

>Of course a straight person saying hurtful things about OTHER PEOPLE made other people upset.

It was self deprecating, ie a joke about themselves.
No it wasn’t. Because his joke insinuated that he thought gay people were inferior at sports. He wasn’t making fun of ONLY HIMSELF. In making fun of himself he was also making fun of gay people. That’s what’s called punching down. In making fun of himself he was spreading harmful stereotypes. 

When I am making jokes about bisexual stereotypes about MYSELF I am embracing the hurtful things people have said about me in the past. Because people know I am bisexual they know I am not saying I think all bisexuals are like that. I am saying ME this Bisexual is like that. People who are not part of the  in group (bisexuals) really can not comment because they do not have the lived experience I am joking about. 

Please look up the ideas of punching up, punching down and punching sideways in comedy. 

I don’t understand how you can compare the two situations.
>If I made a joke about my bisexuality and someone straight told me that I hurt them. No I wouldn’t take it seriously at all.

That is you literally gatekeeping what someone is allowed to be hurt by.
Why is a straight person hurt about a joke I made about being bisexual how does them joking about MY IDENTITY hurt them in anyway? 

Please look up the ideas of “in group” jokes. I really don’t think you understand how off base your “example” was.
Just admit that you feel that you can determine what is allowed to hurt someone else. It's not that hard.

Or, admit that sometimes people you don't expect to be hurt by something get hurt by it, regardless of if you understand it or not.
I mean ANYTHING can hurt someone. A well-meaning compliment or random neutral thing you say can hurt someone. Part of the human condition is accidentally or unintentionally hurting people. If you make it a law not to hurt anyone that's just going to result in censoring people from saying almost anything or everything that could conceivably bother another person. Not to mention that sometimes you HAVE to hurt people, for instance when you break up with someone or set a boundary that upsets them, etc.

The overstatement of harm, like what you are doing, is actually more harmful because what you are trying to do is sanitize every space as being 100% emotionally safe for all people (which is impossible) which results in censoring and policing people and making everyone hypervigilent and ultra sensitive, destroying their resilience in the face of difficult conversations. 

At a certain point you are responsible for your own feelings and communicating when something upsets or bothers you. Once you do that, then yeah the onus is on that person not to use language that bothers you. But it's unreasonable to expect people to read your mind and avoid anything potentially controversial or upsetting just in case it bothers you.
You're saying that I'm making arguments that I'm not.

Also, we're discussing slurs; known hateful language.

This isn't that complicated. I feel like you're becoming very defensive.
Nah I'm not defensive. I wasn't part of this argument earlier so I have no need to be defensive. It just sounds like you aren't that familiar with the concept of reclamation
If that's your take, I feel like you've not invested enough to understand what I'm saying.
I understand, I just don't agree. I'm invested because I'm queer and I have reclaimed words used against me. But you were projecting emotions onto me that I don't feel and dismissing my argument by calling me ""defensive."" And even here you're projecting that I don't care. Since you refuse to have a conversation in good faith about my ideas and instead insist on labeling my emotions from behind a screen, I don't think it's worth continuing the conversation
Are these the thoughts that you have in your head, or is it just the way you express yourself? Because that is a terrible mischaracterization of what I've said.

You do you."	t6bamu	trans	436	0.95	2022-03-04 05:10:39

Afraid of what’s hiding behind my beard.	"It sounds stupid it probably is stupid but I am so afraid that shaving my face and seeing what’s behind the hair will cause me even more dysphoria. I have literally not seen my face in almost 3 years. I don’t know how I look like anymore. Like what if my features have gotten even manlier since the last time I saw my face. I haven’t taken pictures of myself in forever so any pictures that I have pre-beard are from years way before I grew it and I really don’t relate or feel like that person is me at all. 
Sorry it’s just a stupid rant.

Update: I did not expect this to blow up like it did.

You are all so wonderful and supportive, it is nice to see that I am not the only one who’s felt this way.

Thank you all so much for sharing, I feel so encouraged and honestly hearing from y’all I will be taking some steps today to trim off a good amount so I can start gradually getting rid of my beard."	"I had exactly the same problem, I'd grown a big ol' beard (last attempt to fool myself into thinking I was a man haha) and was scared the outside wouldn't nearly match what I felt on the inside without it. If you're old enough to have had a face obscuring beard for 3 years it's highly unlikely you'll look more masculine.

It's universally agreed that when people get rid of their beards they look way younger, and that definitely made me feel better. 

Sorry if I've misunderstood your post at all, hang in their and all the best if you decide to take the plunge. All I can say is it made me infinitely happier X
The only way to start getting over it is to take the plunge, I didn’t like my face pre Hrt shaved but once I learned I was trans facial hair quickly became dysphoric to me, 7 months of Hrt later and I finally love looking at myself and taking photos when I don’t have a under shadow, gotta get back to plucking it today. Once it’s gone gonna take tons of photos again 🥰 if you need a small reference note it is not 100% you could use a beard remover filter see what your face looks like, don’t recommend if it could cause potential dysphoria. Could use beardless filter then take it to FaceApp to, I remember doing that early on 😅 but nothing beats learning to love yourself truly tho. I wish you much luck on this journey hun and hope you can someday look at yourself in the mirror and love who you see staring back 🫂 it only takes baby steps and one day you will see you have come very far.
im sorry im not english and missread somewords... I'm really sorry Atomic_kobra
Hopefully there are no squirrels nested in there. Sorry, couldn't resist 🐿️🙂 I'm sure it'll be fine!
You can always do a short cut. Just take a step at a time if you need to. Maybe a number 2? I don’t have my shaver thing anymore but I’m pretty sure my short beard was a number 2
My egg cracked when i was still wearing my beard and i had the same fears. One say i just decided to push past the fear and shave. If i dont like it, i can always grow it back again. So i shaved for the first time in 7 years.

And i am happy i did. Even if my chin or face is manly, those features wont be as manly as having a beard. Thats progress.
I was there once too and I hated it at first, because it was just so weird, but looking back new I could never go back, it was horrible and disgusting and so not me. 

If you shave it down you may hate it for few weeks, but after that you just don't want to let it grow back probably.
I have a big old scar from a bar fight years ago under mine. Luckily time has helped a bit but now I’m learning about all new skin treatments. Shave it, get the electrolysis going and fight the battle. Love the Journey ❤️
I shaved my beard after having one for around 6-7 years. Although it was different it is so much better and I’ve learned to love the skin on my face. Since HRT my skin has softened up and I’m so much more meticulous at washing and using serums and moisturizers. Facial hair makes everything bigger. My face is actually quiet thin and my cheekbones are fucking fabulous without my beard.
I have huge facial dysphoria and have hidden behind a beard for about 8 years. I'm now on hrt and am needing to lose the facial hair to start presenting more femme. I just shaved it off (about 15 minutes ago) and haven't had a panic attack yet, although there's still time 😜😊. I think it's the fact that I'm finally on the way to becoming my true self that is helping me deal with my stupid boy face.

We're all in this together and together we are stronger. Do what you are right now comfortable with and remember you will grow into being able to do what you next need to do.
If it makes you feel any better, I had facial hair that was old enough to vote. Almost old enough to drink.
It's soooo true tho.... and when you show the confidence people gravitate to that....soon your standing there in your skimpy bikini just talking away.....lol
Girl, tell me about it. Shaved mine last week (after 14 years of not shaving) - for a few days I was a fucking mess (ಥ﹏ಥ) but now im better and Im sure you will as well. honestly, just gotta stomach thru it. sadly, part of the process. all the best <3
Can't even look in the mirror most of the time
Wow. This is a mood for me.

I had a beard of some kind from the age of 15 to 31. My wife never saw my chin until I started my transition. I was legit scared start I looked like under it. Turns out it wasn't too bad.

Admittedly, it's helped divide my life into distinct chunks mentally.
I've had my beard for ten years now, exactly the same issue you have. I'm so scared of seeing how square my chin and jaw are. 

It doesn't help that I rely on my beard to throw people off the scent of me being trans.
Yeah I know how this one feels....

I shaved off my 10+ year beard a few months ago, and it was a trip. I ended up letting it grow back because it was so weird. Then a bit later I shaved it off again and it felt less weird looking in the mirror.

I'm a bit away from actually making progress on basically anything (for other reasons) so it just creeps back in between shaving..  doing anything more about it would require more mirror time
I wore a full beard from 16 to 25. Only shaved once I realized I was trans.

You may not like the person you see at first, but will come to find the beauty in yourself.
The first time my child shaved their mustache, they cried because it made them look like they wanted to look. I hope it is the same for you. <3
So, I've had a beard since..... 2015? Something like that. When I started growing it I had no idea that what I was hiding from was gender dysphoria, but it definitely was. I've been shortening it progressively over several months, and last week I shaved clean for the first time. And... I didn't hate it? Like, I definitely don't like it. But I know *why* I don't like it.

If you're too worried, just cut it short, but don't quite get rid of it all at once. Get used to the idea more slowly.
It's not a stupid rant, this is hella valid
I had facial hair for over a decade (a mustache, then a beard down to my collar bone, then a huge walrus mustache for years) — I was TERRIFIED to shave it bc tbh my mustache was iconic and I had no idea what my face looked like, but it was the best thing I ever did. who knew a pretty girl was hiding under there this whole time?

Worst case scenario is you stay home for a few weeks and grow it back :)
I used to have a big ol' beard and at one point the thought of shaving it off would have been the scariest thought in the world. But I knew that if I would ever want to be happy with myself it had to go at some point, so I started to slowly trim it down a couple millimeters at a time. Eventually it was only a couple mill long, and one day I just decided it was time and I bought a razor. Not even to shave it off right away. Ended up doing it a couple of days later. If I see pictures of myself with a beard now it just looks wrong lol. I definitely found it easier to take that final step mentally when it was already pretty short. It also helped that I could see the basic contours of my face but then so I kinda knew what to expect. And if you're still scared to go further at any point remember that it's just hair you can stop and it will grow back (no matter how annoying that might be). Stay strong girl, we're all rooting for you.
My problem was I had seen my face prior to shaving and I didn't like it. It was very chubby and it makes upset that I got so heavy. 

Now that I have discovered who I am, I shaved and it has given me the motivation to finally get healthier for the first time in my life. 

So while it is on you to do the actual step, there may be an unintended side effect that may help you on your journey.
ik the feeling. when i shaved i actually felt a little more feminine but my mom said i look like a pedo and my dad said it looks stupid so don’t do it again, but don’t worry abt it all trust yourself you got this
I was in a very similar place when I came out. Took me a while to come around to doing it and even then I think I only pulled the trigger causr I was afraid I wouldn't be take seriiusly by a therapist if I didn't
Don’t be afraid, you aren’t alone, I had the same issue hun and it yes did get worse but at the same time got better. I can take pics of myself now, I can be who I want and be proud of what and who I am without my beard hiding the woman beneath.
I had the same problem. I neglected to shave my beard off for years because I was afraid of not looking feminine enough. 

Now though? I know I don’t look super feminine but at least I don’t have that damn beard anymore. I’m one step closer to the appearance I want!
Maybe shave when you have some time off from work so if the dysphoria is bad, you can begin to grow the beard back without having to deal with the outside world? Reading all these responses I just want to say how awesome I think everyone here is and that the struggle is real and I hope someday we get to a point where people can be whomever they choose. You're not ranting and you are certainly not stupid. I hope you find a way to feel like you. true authentic self. Take care.
I was also really afraid to shave my beard. I hid behind that wall of hair for a long time. I reduced it incrementally by cutting it shorter and shorter then down to a goatee. I was really nervous, but when I finally shaved it off I was so euphoric! Looking back I don’t know why it took me so long or why I waited. Deep down I knew who my authentic self really was. I wish you the best with your journey!
Some good hints for getting rid of a thick beard-

If you have clippers, use that to knock it down as low as possible. It'll leave stubble, but at least like 95% or more of it is gone.

Next, either stand under the shower with the hottest water you can stand to soften up the bristles or nuke a wet washcloth in the microwave until it's about as hot as you can stand it. Wring it out till it's damp, but not dripping wet. Put that on your face to soften up the bristles.

Use at minimum a 4 blade razor to mimimize irritation, since your skin hasn't seen a razor in quite some time. You can use a gel based shave cream with aloe to make irritation less. I use a lavender based soap because it's cheap, yet very effective.

And make sure the razor is SHARP- get a brand new razor. I think you'll be amazed at how soft your skin will feel after a good close shave. I certainly feel better after a good shave- and less dysphoric, too.

I'm 50 years old, but I look like 30 years younger than my chronological age. I haven't even been able to get laser hair removal yet and just seeing stubble makes me feel dysphoric.
That's not stupid at all. It's pretty legit, actually.
I've had a beard most of my adult life.. when I went public with a small group of friends, showed up to dinner as myself, not the mask, I was asked when ""I"" was showing up.  Was not recognized at all.
Champ it’s been 8 years for me. I just make it shorter every time. Until you are comfortable with. Try to make short sides and fade into the bigger size into the front
It's not stupid.  I knew what was hiding back there and I hated it.  Thin lips, shadow, long philtrum, gaunt cheeks...  It was big dysphoria for a long time.

It's relatable.
I went around 10 years and finally shaved at the beginning of this year. I was also terrified to do it but was so glad I did after. It is scary and you might not like it at first but you will grow to love the look. Especially if you start laser and reduce the darker hairs! And honestly worst case scenario you let it grow back. If anyone questions it you can say it was for work or for a doctor's check up or something like that.
I had a beard before my egg cracked. I sort of had a similar problem to what you describe. I definitely wore a big bushy beard as a mask. It hid my face away and put up a barrier between me and the rest of the world. Nobody saw me, they saw the beard. After a point, I had this realization that I had made the beard a huge part of my identity, and I decided to reclaim that portion of my identity, so I chopped it off without actually giving it too much thought. I too was seeing my face for the first time in years, and it took some getting used to, but it was a first step towards being my authentic self. My egg was still a few years from cracking, but I think shaving the beard might have been the beginning, even though I didn't realize it at the time.
you looovely lil awk ball of dysphoriaa, this fear is telling you exactly what you need to do to ESCAPE your unwillingness to get better! \[probs Dr Z PHD @ youtube might help better, butt..\] just do it. just faking do it, fight yourself, get angry and be unwilling to spend one more second not doing what you know you want to do <3 community is vast and support is never ending, love your real self and there will be others that will follow, most freeing feel in the world <3
Yeah... I'm not out to many people yet, haven't started hrt or anything... Right now I tend to let my beard grow out as it helps hide my ugly face!
[deleted]
Thank you this gives me some hope. I’m not sure if it’s the way i see myself or just the way age has been affecting me but I feel like I’ve gotten a lot more masculine looking over the last few years At least on the parts of my face I can see.

I have started coming out to people and started on small things like nails and hair and just in general doing things that make me feel good about myself and how I want to present myself. But having a face that will make sure everyone and their mom is able to clock me scares me.
Took me 3 month after coming to terms with being trans before I shaved the beard... I never understood why I struggled to shower trim my beard... One day I grabbed the clippers and cut it. Now I shave every morning to keep the hair way... I'm still early on and not on her yet but I'm getting used to my face. Finally getting that off me was the best . I still wish I could see the person I imagine in my head.... So far she's only been a fantasy....
I did the exact same thing
I was exactly like this... Went on a single day from full beard in the morning, to very short beard in the afternoon to none in the evening. And now I shave literally every day because it feels more like me to have no beard... Had my beard for about 10 years, lol... Went out recently and the selfie I took made me feel amazing ( I looked very feminine)
I didn’t even read your comment completely missed it so I don’t even know what it said. But thank you for apologizing.
It’s big and long enough the possibility is there.
Thems is goals right there
I... don't think she is? Profile says she/her.
I totally understand how you feel. We live in a world where often, we can't win. Sometimes it feels like we have to live up to a public standard that will either ridicule us if we don't look ""femenine enough"" and accuse us of deception if we do.

Remember you're doing this for you and your happiness, nobody else. Take small steps and do things that make you happy. If eventually you feel ready to shave and see what you look like, think of all the makeup fun you can have!
When I saw my face for the first time in like nine years I cried
i said only stupid things don't mind it. Sorry i hope you will find happiness, i think that you are wonderfull to be who you really want to be.
😂
you're Right i'm confused i missread one of the phrases i Will be more carefull thanks for the warning Freya-sama
Ok I loved this....
Good or bad tears?
It’s okay thank you very much for apologizing you are wonderful as well.
No worries, an easy mistake to make! X
Thank you so much! X
Good, I was absolutely overwhelmed by the intense level of happiness I had never felt in my life. My second instance of euphoria was the first time I put on a bra, but I also got an erection so that wasn't great
I really don't feel good about it good reminder !! Have a Nice evening from France
...when My Little Pony makes an appearance, I say- ""Hey! Back in the barn!""

And don't feel bad about the erection- that's a common physical response. I used to get those before I started HRT, but estrogen and spiro has pretty much killed any male sexual response I used to have.
Whenever I’m looking at the removed comments it’s always vile so this was very nice change of pace :)"	w1d2il	trans	424	0.99	2022-07-17 17:51:40
Comic I made about social dysphoria		"*literally all the hugs*

Thank you for sharing how im pretty sure most of us feel :(

Im stealing this and sharing with people
This was literally me today.
This describes it perfectly! 💙💗🤍💗💙
Goddd this is just me every day I go out. I can’t describe how envious I am of people who pass
Really nice depiction/explanation of this. As someone who can't find it in themselves to make a single peep to correct anyone, I feel this to my core. *hugs*
Yup.  It's like that.
wow!!  you are a talented artist..
I feel this so much [oh my god](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/08UyYu0)
At this point, I have just resorted to saying excuse me as to not accidentally misgender someone whether they are in the closet or not.
This describes it so well
When you're in a bad mood but can't really explain to anyone why cause it's unexplainable to people that don't experience it.
It just chips away at you. It doesn't matter how strong you are, or how prepared you are. It's like being a rock in a river. There's only so much you can take before you break.

&#x200B;

Every time. It hurts every time and there is no escaping it. If it would only just stop for a day I might know peace. Even if they apologize it's still one more chip washed downstream.
Ngl the last panel broke my heart, that's me all the time. For me, body dysphoria is like 10% of all my dysphoria. It's social dysphoria that well and truly sucks.
This is so true
I try to never react when people misgender me, just act like nobodys there
I am that person that does correct well pronouns.... While I myself can accidentally misgender others but then I feel really embarrassed and tbh they can get a treat from me as an apology. I hate misgendering a lot. It makes me distressful the thought that I accidentally misgendered someone because what if they aren't in the right mental health state? What if I am going to be a reason that they might kill themselves off. It's those thoughts that frightens me sometimes. That's why I also correct myself with pronouns but I always feel horrible. It's probably a me thing, because what person might be thinking of those kind of thoughts? I always try to be as gender neutral as possible, but unfortunately Dutch isn't a gender neutral language
Petition to force people to stay in gender neutral grammar as long as they dont know the persons gender?
*returns the hugs* and omg please do haha
Same here, it rlly sucks
Hopefully one day we got the courage to correct ppl haha *hugs*
Thank u!
Omg the meme-
Why is this me all the time XD
Social Dysphoria really sucks :( i really hope things get better for ya! Sending good vibes!
Smart idea
welcome. & if it isnt a career,   it should be.. very talented..
Thank you! And all the best!
It's what I plan to do haha. Right now I just do animation and online ary, but I'm working to be a tattoo artist
ok  there is a market for comics & ilustrations, including story boarding,  depends on if its making a living or a suppliment to income. &  how much a prude you are.  i know a trans fiction writer that used some illustrations (simple b&w) on one of her stories.. but from what i understood, very expensive.  many authors forgo illustrations due to cost, but trans does have a kink factor.. & illustrations makes the story much more ""valuable"" so , if its just supplimental income, theres a market... youve got talent..."	qtayhj	trans	426	1.0	2021-11-13 21:48:27

I had a sneaking suspicion, either way it’s a beautiful name, you’ve chosen well girl"	sdoh3m	trans	417	0.98	2022-01-27 03:21:21
My mom outed me	"I’m 18 an y/o trans woman who came out to my parents a couple weeks ago. They seemed at least accepting and were willing to help me with coming out to my family. However over the past couple of weeks they have said and done some incredibly hurtful things.

The first thing I noticed is that they refuse to affirm the fact that I am a woman. For example, I started using my girl voice full time and from most people I’ve heard its actually pretty good, but my dad called it cartoonish and unconvincing once I showed it to them. I worked really hard and had felt very confident in my voice but after hearing that is started to dysphoria spiral. 

The second is the constant forcing of me to answer uncomfortable questions. It seems like every time I’m in the same room he asks the same questions on repeat, “How do you know for sure that you’re not making the wrong decision? Should you really be making that decision at 18? Did any of you’re teachers or counselors try to convince you of this? Do you know that the effects of hormones are permanent? Are you sure you want to keep taking them?” And many other questions that are meant not so much to inform but to dissuade me. Not to mention the fact that if I bring up the fact that saying some of these things are hurtful my dad will tell me to be patient and that he’s just looking out for my safety. He has also stated that I must continue seeing a counselor. My mom is also pressing that I allow her to use my deadname and called me selfish when I said no and asked to be called by my name.

The third is my mom outing me to my grandma after we as a family had discussed multiple times how I wanted to come out to each person. I made it very clear that I wanted to do it on my own terms. Coming out to my grandma was also important to me because she’s very progressive and could really help in bringing my parents on-board. But my mom went and called her anyway and tried to hide it. I have refused to talk to her since and when I told my dad about it he immediately jumped to her defense without any regard for how outing me made me feel. 

I feel incredibly conflicted as my parents have shown some support like driving me to Planned Parenthood even tho they’re pro-life. But the complete lack of regard for my feeling during this process even when I have stated that I need my space has shown me a complete lack of regard for me as a person. They’re very conservative and I have grown up hearing horrible things about trans people, so it’s safe to say they have a lot of learning to do when it comes to gender. They said they would probably seek counseling so I hope that helps to understand it because they’ve deconstructed just about every article or study I’ve given to them. 

I’ve only been out to them for 2 weeks and I’m at my wits end trying to get them to support me while simultaneously avoiding the hurtful things they say. I’m at a loss about what to do with them moving forward. I move to college in August(thank fuck) but need advice about what to do about our relationship for the time being."	"ah yes, the “I’m a great parent” parent that borderline bullies their child
I'm so sorry. My Dad thinks the same way but tries at least not to say much since my Mom is supportive. Both of them don't understand it. They, much like your parents, do indeed love you and want you to be happy, but they are also incredibly stubborn. They think that we made a choice to be this way, and that we don't know what we're really getting ourselves into. I wish there was a way to get through to them. It seems like they think they know what's best, but they only know what they're used to, they think we won't be able to 'handle' all this change, when really it's them who can't handle change. It's all new to them, so be patient because it does get better. It's extremely triggering, especially hearing about your Dad's opinion on your voice. For them, support is only acceptance, not support. If they really supported you they would help you feel better instead of using every time you're feeling down about how your transition is going as fuel for what they really want, for you to detransition (they might not be direct about it, but they will use every chance they can to make you feel worse about your transition. They may not even be aware of what they're doing by doing this). Their motives for such are unknown, but it's usually because they're ashamed of you or afraid of change. For me, I just try not to talk about it to them. I'll let my actions speak for myself.

A tip on the voice. So I would just practice every single day on your own and when you talk don't try to force anything, just let your voice do it's thing. The more you practice the more feminine it will become. The more you force it the worse it will sound. Just try to talk naturally, and with practice that natural voice will sound very feminine.
I have found this doesn’t really change when you’re older. I’m 35 and get the same crap. Dad also outed me to my grown brother. There’s definitely a piece of them that wants to dissuade, there’s a piece of them that’s terrified for you, and that gets worse the more transphobic they have been in the past. I’m going the respectful but firm route. Like I respect their feelings and thoughts are real, but my gender identity is not up for debate. So I’ll be around to the extent that that’s honored. I’m just gonna be doing what’s best for me in the meantime. It’s a little different since I’m not living with them, but you can still respectfully set boundaries without being antagonistic.
I understand how you feel my father outted me as well, it really fucking sucks
I feel you. In my case my mom outed me to my whole family just before a family reunion for christmas (At least they where supportive, but I wasn't ready at all). But yeah, it's sucks.   
I was getting ready little by little to go out to my family. And what sucks more is that when I told her how wrong it was to do that, she got mad because of how I was talking to her. 

Parents sucks sometimes.
My dad said some similar things to what you said when I first came out to him several years ago. Due to my circumstances I was unable to find the medical care of hormones until recently. When I told him that I planned on starting that process, he was much more accepting than when I first came out because he saw the history of my identity. I'm not saying that it's right, but when confronted with the sudden change when coming out, most people (I have experienced) are very hesitant. Especially when they don't see the history of where that identity began for you. I hope time makes it better for you and if it doesn't then I apologize.
Yeah, my mom always says, that I'm not a guy but also not a girl and keeps telling me that she also isn't the most feminine woman. But she doesn't knows how I feel at all. Like TRY TO FEEL CRIPPLING DYSPHORIA FOR ONLY ONE HOUR AND YOU GOD DAMN WISH YOU'VE NEVER FELT IT
OP, if you need our go ahead to leave yor parents, consider this permission given.

It is not your responsibility to raise your parents. That should be on them. You are old enough to make your own decisions, so I hope that you will choose yourself. What you could give the world could otherwise be lost to us.

I wish you all the best.
It probably doesn’t mean much but you’re inspiring. You’re so strong and so brave :)
I don't know about your case sorry to hear that.

My sister outed me to my mother and my mother told me if you want to become a woman your not my son and take your things and get out of the house
And I came out to my father as bi and trans he is OK with me being bi but not trans and I e c explained to him but he don't want to understand and told me it's a sin and God will punishe you made me cry and said to me if you appearance change and you continue in his don't count me as your father.

My father can be supportive of this but the people and society iam In is Arabic and Islamic so yeah I
Apologized to my sisters and mother and told them iam not doing this anymore( transition to female)
Of course I will in secret but my mother does not believe I will stop I can feel her disappointment

She was crying every day since my sister outed me. 

Need some advice to manage this situation please.
Hey OP which state do you live in? Perhaps you can crash at my crib till you get up!
My parents are the same way. My mom actually dug through the trash to read my pill bottles. Initially, she seemed a little apprehensive but supportive. The next day she said she was afraid for my safety around strangers if I continued. Her solution was for me to stop transitioning entirely and she said it would be my fault if anything happened. Since then she’s used every excuse in the book to get me to stop. She talked about suicide and becoming an alcoholic again. Which is extremely worrying.. but she blamed it on me and me alone. She sought counseling after that.

It sounds like you’re in a similar situation. Initial acceptance leading to disregard and dissuasion. I don’t really know what to do other than point them in the right direction. I told them to seek counseling and gave them a few resources to learn more but they haven’t changed so far. I suppose just wait it out. If you need someone to talk to dm me.
I feel ur pain that hashappened to me
If it feels safe for you I think it might be helpful to have your parents read your post. After that give them some time alone to reflect on and digest what you've written.

Your post is well written, calm, and clearly lays out why what they're doing hurts you, while also being respectful of their points of view. All of those things can be really hard to maintain while you're in the midst of a conversation that, understandably, could cause you to have some intense emotions.

I probably wouldn't show them the post \*on\* reddit where they can read the comments, but copying it into a google doc or something or just printing it out and letting them know that you posted it seeking support and understanding should do fine.
Please mind language here but what the fuck is wrong with your mom, you told her how you wanted to do it and she still did that. I’m sorry but that pisses even me off
I'm going to be honest, you should just not bother with being open to them until you can get out on your own and not rely on them. When you don't live with them, when you don't need their money. Get some roommates or whatever, work, go to college, begin your transition. You don't need their approval, and if they're conservative or jerks about it, then all you're going to do to yourself is get roadblocked and put through Hell by trying to demand they accept you.

Become independent, transition, and either let them accept it after you transition or no-contact them.
My dad used to tell me he was a great dad because he let me smoke weed at his house in an illegal state at 18 whenever I tried to argue with him because he was indeed a shitty father

He blocked me on everything and threatened to kill me if I went anywhere near his house when I came out as bisexual. Now that I'm trans I'm pretty sure if he found out he would genuinely try to kill me

Any parent who holds it over your head that they're your parent and they do everything for you and let you get away with everything whenever you bring up any issue - probably a sign it's a shitty parent
Literally my whole family when they found out i shaved my legs
Thanks it’s good to know there’s someone in the same situation. As far as it goes with my voice I consistently get called ma’am over the phone and all of my friends have said it definitely sounds female. I’ve had customers at my work compliment me on how soothing my voice is. This was the first time I’ve heard anything directly negative. So when it came from my Dad it really messed with the confidence I had with my voice.
Heck yea
I hope she is going to realise how you feel.
I wish you a lot of luck and support
Damn, your childhood must have been hell. Parents are supposed to support you and be a pillow to fall on when you’re in trouble, not the piston that pushes you down onto the non existent pillow in your case
I find that the phone helps with making your voice pass. Also when you're with friends you're probably not on edge/not overcompensating. This also helps. I'm sure your voice is fem. You may have just been on edge showing him and trying too hard which I've found can sound unnatural, but more likely, Your Dad is just being ridiculously meticulous because of the reasons I stated in my original comment. Good luck with them. Happy for u that u get to get out of the house soon. It will help your mental health tremendously and you'll be able to express yourself. It's fucking pathetic that our parents actively stifle our self expression by just existing. After transitioning for a year I took a weeklong roadtrip on my own and it made me way more independent so I finally don't give a shit and express myself however I want. I think my Dad has gained a little bit of respect for me for doing so. Proves to him that I don't need his support to be myself. I mean I'd certainly like it but I don't need it at this point. I can find another father figure who actually loves the woman I clearly am.
Any tips for how you learned your fem voice? I’ve been really struggling to get mine down
Oh I'd love to tell you how hellish my childhood was but I quite literally can't remember it because of trauma ✌️😁👍

Luckily a pillow did exist when my dad pushed me away. That pillow being my fiancee and her family. I got extremely luckily and am still living with them today, two years later

Me and my fiancee plan of getting our own place this month

I'm not gonna let my shitty father affect my life now. He's a drunkard who lost his license from drunk driving and has pushed everyone away. The only reason I had to go back to living with him was because my mom died..... From literally drunk driving.... Yes he lost his license from drunk driving after his ex wife died from it... And my mom wasn't even an alcoholic and never drank. She just made a bad decision once after a hard night and payed the price - I still wonder why it wasn't my father who is constantly drunk driving that was killed instead of her (as horrible as that sounds)
Seriously thx it’s so good to see someone who has been able to show their parents that ur an independent adult who can express themselves however you want. Thanks for the reassurance and for the voice tips.
I need tips too. Haven't told anyone yet but still need it
of course ❤️ best of luck ☺️"	vl8461	trans	412	0.99	2022-06-26 16:11:28
whats your reason for transitioning?	"Since i had such a good time talking to the girls about this i thought that i should share the opretunatiy. 

I found that its relatively hard to find long interviews of trans people talking about their dysphoria and internalized hate in depth. (Contra did one with dr k which was super intresting) 

So any sources or stories you know would be welcomed"	"The longer I live as a male, the harder it is.
I’m trans. That’s it that’s the whole reason.
MtF here

It's mainly about appearance. I do not like My ""male"" appearance, so I'm aiming to change that. : D
FTM here , feeling like a rare pokemon on this subreddit , but anyway my reason is well first of all I’ll talk about social transition, my reason is very simple and basic . I wanna be seen as the guy I am , I wanna be able to go out into the world and live my life the way any other u guy would . That’s basically all I want . And for the medical transition I want that more than anythint rn . I wanna feel free in my own body and I wanna be able to walk around shirtless and go swimming , flex in the gym and stupid stuff you know ? But also about that huge confidence boost . Not having to constantly worry about if I’m flat enough or if it looks like Iv got shit down there , because i want both surgery’s , bottom and top, the whole package. That’s my goal and as of right now I’m content with where I’m going 100% but yeah long story short I just wanna feel secure and my definition of normal
I'm non-binary. My dysphoria isn't too bad, I just want to look more like me. For me this means having facial hair, a more muscular body type, and top surgery. I'm pre T, awaiting a prescription. For now I'm working on getting in better shape.
Less ass hair
Imagine your invited to play dnd with some friends and you’ve never played it before.   


You show up for the first session but instead of being asked what kind of character you wanna play you learn that your friends went ahead and rolled up your character for you and made you a barbarian. It doesnt take long for you to decide its not your cup of tea and ask to change it  but they tell you you can’t “dm said you were a barbarian”. To make it worse though this group has like 4 rogues and 4 barbarians already so why does it even matter what you play? Still you go along with it, after all they can’t be that different. For a while its not too bad, and eventually you even find a dagger and think hey Ill just play my character like a rogue that seems fun. Except the Dm tells you “nope we need a barbarian cut it out” every time you pick up a dagger or try to sneak, or do a stab your repremanded. But also the other players start making fun of you saying “god your such a rogue” and cracking jokes about how your a terrible barbarian all while not let letting you be a rogue or even act like one even though your sure you would have more fun. Eventually the dm starts to introduce side quests only certain classes go on,  and every time you hear about a super cool quest that appeals to everything you want in a campaign , your told that its a rogue only quest. Sure some of the barbarian quests are fun, but most just don’t appeal to you.   Eventually you get so fed up with it and you tell your friends “I hate being a barbarian can I please just be a rogue, theirs absolutely no reason why I shouldnt be and even if their is this is our game lets just change the rules” but they tell you no.   


then one day you get invited to a different campaign and without questions they let you play a rogue. You like your friends (or at least you think you do?) but for the first time you actually see why pepole like this game. It takes you time to get used to the new rules, and maybe some pepole who herd about that first campaign still call you a barbarian, but really truly your having more fun.  And your new group gets you In a way that fist group never did. You had felt like their was something wrong with you for not just playing whatever you were handed but no a lot of pepole have a preference and thats okay. Finally you get invited to a rogue only side quest, and its hard, and its not perfect, but its also the most fun you’ve ever had and while you never felt like you undertood how to play a barbarian, you realize you have your rogue sheet memorized.  


So when your old friends ask you to come back to their group, you don’t even consider it.
I want as close to having a dick as I can get. Always wanted one, finally decided to see what T can do for me!
I want people to see me and say I'm a guy. I hate being assumed to be a girl just because of my body. I'm genderfluid between trans man and agender, but I still want strangers to automatically use he.
A blogger u/Monka_Kowalska has ~~stories~~ interviews on her blog [theheroines.blogspot.com](https://theheroines.blogspot.com) that you might find interest in.
Honestly? Idk. I’m still trying to figure it out exactly, but things lined up such that I made a realization, acted on it, and haven’t wanted to stop.

Who knows where I’m going at this point? I’m along for the ride with my feminine side.
I am honestly not sure I had a great reason to start... I was dysphoric and like I knew I was trans but like... I didn't have any idea what my goals were and for a long time I was stuck in a well i if I don't have a goal then starting doesn't really make sense... and then eventually I  ended up just asking a bunch of questions about the logistics of starting E and spiro... and it's really easy in my state and my physician was just like... you are welcome to make it up as you go so I just... kinda am... no plan... no gender... pretty cool guitar... it's kind of a vibe...
I socially transitioned as a non-binary person for years before beginning medical transition. When I started, it was partially to combat the ways I felt unseen and erased because people thought of me as male, and partially because of a belief in my own body autonomy and right to make the changes I want to. 

Now that I'm further down this path, I still feel all of that, but I've also realized how comfortable I can be in my own body, and how right my emotions and reasoning can feel, when estrogen and progesterone are running the show instead of T. Also seeing myself more as a trans girl than I did before. Idk if I'll pass one day, but I'm still so glad I'm transitioning, because on a really visceral level it just feels right.
after a while of not getting a girlfriend, i decided to become the girlfriend. i was a femboy for a while, and then decided to transition, after making the choice, i started remember a lot of things from my past and some things made me realize ""oh, i was like this all along"", and that happens everyday still, thinking back on old things, like the times i got girls toys from McDonalds. after almost 2 months on E, im very happy with my choice.
To align myself with my spirit. I've always been this person, but now I am letting it show.
Short answer is that my appearance doesn't match who I am at all and I hate it a lot I can't wait to get my tax return in so I can start hrt I'm legit excited
idk if I would call it a reason per se, but a collection of ""needs"" and ""wants""

I needed to transition because being stuck in the masculine role - especially in the West - was not how I imagined myself. I have always had a femme self-identity, even as male puberty did things I did not want. I needed to be seen as femme/feminine for my own self-esteem and self-image.

and, a bit selfishly, I wanted to wear that spinny skirt without having to justify or fear for my life.

to that end, I pursued HRT - I have no desire to undergo bottom surgery. It's enough for me to be accepted as feminine and that euphoria was worth to time, effort and lost friends and family.
I want my body to be different and I want to be perceived as male and female, not just one or the other.
My main reason for transitioning was just the dysphoria. I literally got panic attacks looking at my boobs (I'm ftnb, female to nonbinary/neutral) and overall did not feel like this was my body.
I'm still closeted and scared as hell of people knowing, so I can't exactly say when I'll come out and transition, but when I do it will be because I really dislike people calling me a girl, miss or young lady or including me in all-female groups.

I also just really want to get rid of my tits, because they don't feel like a real part of my body, but make people automatically read me as female. 

I like my face as it is most of the time, but I'm still curious if T could improve some of it.
MTF here. Hated every aspect of my male life and was sick of being so freaking angry depressed and hating myself.. so much happier dressed as a woman to the point people who knew said something. So I went for it. Love everything so far.. slow and steady is how I’m going about this. 10 months in, still boy mode only cause I’m not 100% to everyone and scared of all this negativity in the news lately. I’m in mass so I’m safe but still scared lol
I just want to be normal.
Growing up my body always felt really gross as it was masculinizing and now 11 months on hrt it sometimes still makes me feel insecure but I'm so much happier. I used to hate looking in the mirror or at pictures of myself and now I don't. Also, socially I just always felt very out of place... Like I fit in with guys well but I fit in with girls WAY easier. And, emotionally I always felt like I could never express whatever I was feeling whether it was socially acceptable or not.
For me its like asking whats my reason for eating
I’m a trans man. I probably would of killed myself cause of the dysphoria honestly, I still have a lot of dysphoria - in a lot of ways its gotten worse and I’m still not on T but its been a year since I came out and I think if I hadn’t been able to socially transition I wouldn’t be around. But I also think I’m just good at being a dude. Like the concept of being a woman is so foreign to me now, I can’t imagine a world in which I am not a man and not acting and presenting as one. I truly believe that transitioning has made me a better human being despite how much I’ve lost and how hard it is.
I just did what made me the happiest. I realized who I was presenting to the world was a lie, and I decided to start to strive to show my true self. Eventually I read about being transgender, and started to piece things together, like always being unhappy with my chest and stuff. I asked my friends to refer to me as feminine, especially after I caught myself referring to myself as a woman. Here I am a year later, can say that I am finally happy with my life.

If you're trans, you're trans. You've always known, even if you didn't realize.
I want to be a feminine man, not a masculine woman.
I want a happy life, I’m sick of being selfhating and miserable all the time.
FtM here.

I need the T to be happy. Since I started, I changed for the better personality-wise
If I didn't transition, I'd be dead.
I try not to define myself by my dysphoria and more by my euphoria! I feel happy and proud of myself being the women I was always meant to be. I didn’t dislike who I was as a man but I didn’t care about myself at all. I just tried my best to laugh at myself which quickly becomes very sad.
I’m transmasc and I started HRT and all that jazz because I wanted to be seen as more masculine. My dysphoria mainly stems from how people perceive me so transitioning really helped me out. Also deeper voice and more body hair is a plus!!
For me, I wished I looked female, dress female, sound female, have female sexual roles and behave in feminine gender norms. Although I would be somewhat ok with continuing as a male, becoming female is becoming more accessible and easy. Transitioning became a 'why not?' question to me.
In the words of the K-pop band ITZY. 
I wannabe me me me
I haven’t transitioned yet but I just hate myself and wish I would look more like my preferred gender.
[removed]
For me its all three. I prefer to be observed as either Male or Andro. And hate being called any femme pronouns (other than fae)

Physically I really hate some parts, especially my chest.
It's not that I hate myself, it's that I can't stand to feel the way I do. I want the best for myself. I want myself to feel good. I want myself to love. I want myself to *be* loved. And I cannot do that when I'm not living as my true gender. That's why.
i want to be sexier and genderer
Because I have dysphoria. It's bc of my body. I'm fine with my body (for the most part) now after transitioning
I'm honestly not trans but I am gender-fluid and the thing is that I know who I am the reason I want to look more feminine is because I feel a lot more emotion when I dress like a girl like I feel like a child getting ice cream but ofc I do sometimes have dysphoria about myself but in the end I know who I really am and I am proud of myself for that and for all of u I hope that u r happy of urself because all of u r amazing
So I can be come my own version of Tessa Violet
I imagined one day of what happiness would be like. What would it all be like if I did EXACTLY what I wanted. At this point in time, I was miserable. I had been suicidal since I was 12. 

What if it all worked out? What if in the most positive way possible....

What if became no longer negative, but a positive. What if everything just......worked?

Mind you, this was in time when I felt all hope was truly lost. I had just remembered a terrible trauma, lost my mind literally, and didn't see a way out. It was a messy time, and my 3rd psychotic break. 

I knew something needed to change. 

The only thing I could think of to motivate me to keep myself alive, was to do exactly what I wanted. To keep myself on this Earth, I needed to be me. 

I have spent many years as a neurodivergent and traumatized human, feeling like I was not allowed to have what I wanted/needed. That and too scared to ask for it. 

I finally decided I will do what it is I NEED. What I WANT. 

And being me meant being a woman. 

I grew up conservative Christian, and most of my family either run churches, or are pastors themselves. I knew what would happen next, didn't matter anymore. I'm glad I got a couple family members, which is more then most, of that I'm eternally grateful. 

So I transitioned to both save my life, and take a chance on seeing what life could be like. Even though I hadn't the faintest clue what that even meant. 

30 when I took the dive, and I've learned more from myself and more proud of myself then ever before. 

❤️
because i want to look on the outside how my brain says im supposed to. Crazy concept i know.🤣
I've noticed that for a long time I was never happy with my male appearance (mainly voice).
I decided my meat sack would look better if my outsides looked like my insides. My hormone imbalance didn't like me and was attempting to kill me. Transitioning fixed both problems. 

(Plus low key really obsessed with Transformers. Thanks for passing those on, Dad)
Mainly social dysphoria type reasons. I don’t really know my gender, but I know I like to be perceived as a man. Even if I do find out that I am a woman, I don’t know if I would go off of testosterone. Not only because people’s perceptions of me would change, but because getting off of testosterone would just feel…wrong to me. It makes me uncomfortable thinking about it.

I originally was a trans man and while that may have changed, my reasons for transitioning have stayed the same (for the most part). I do have body dysphoria (am hoping to get top surgery soon!) but most of it is social dysphoria. I just try and see what I am most comfortable with, and because I’ve been fine with testosterone and surgery for a while now, I don’t think it will change anytime soon.
I ""pretended"" to be a woman online for so long that I hated lying to them, causing me to have to hide my face and voice. A friend came out as trans, and I realized that I didn't have to hide anything, I didn't have to lie! I could be a woman- nay, I already was and am and had been LYING to MYSELF. Now I'm becoming more like the me I always imagined when I spoke online as Ruby.
Because waking up each morning and looking at the reflection in the mirror and knowing it is not who you are, gets tiring and takes a toll.
Upgrades, people. Upgrades!
Ftm here.

I've always thought of my gender as like.. Male fantasy elf? (Think lotr or anime) so I'm going for that
Alright, I'll share.

For starters and full clarity, I'm MTF, and haven't began the process yet, however I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow to begin the referral process so I can.

So for my personal reasons, I genuinely can not stand my body, the hair, the genitals, my voice, I hate it. There is plenty of days where I can gloss over it and push through, but there is equal days where I wish I would have been born as preferred gender, they way I'd describe how I feel, about it is well, it's angering, depressing, and down right existential at times, almost numbing. 

I wish I had more to say, but this about sums it up, I'll see you all as a girl in the near future hopfuly.
MtF

I've never recognized myself into what people's expected me to be/do as a guy, In fact it was the exact opposite "" you are a man, you should help your father with *insert typically masculin task "" and ""no don't wash your cloves yourself, let your sister do it for you"".

People's wanted me to go out, be agressive, dominant but in reality I am naturally more at ease at home, really introvert and try to compromise with everyone instead of wanting to dominate.

So basically I just feel more at ease with more traditional feminon behaviour, all the rest came naturally from that.
Because I feel I was born in the wrong body and it’s been a really distressing thing for me since childhood.
I like who I am as a person and my life and job overall. I just hate the shape of the meat suit I was assigned to pilot. So I’ve gone in for a light weight, high speed, low drag, modification program.
My dysphoria presented mostly as lack of care. I didn't care about my body or my life. I never made plans further than a year or two out. The more I started accepting myself, the more I started to care--the more I wanted to care. My 3 months on HRT is coming up soon and I can actually see a future for myself.
I could easily write an essay on everything that led me to finding out I'm Trans, but for me it boils down to years upon tears of therapy. I initially went for a variety of unfortunate reasons, one of the main being body dysmorphia. My body was never ""right"", I never had the same experience at the gyno as other AFAB individuals, and socially never felt feminine. 

I ended up coming out as non-binary, then 2 years later as Trans masculine. Experimenting with pronouns was a big part of my journey, and after strictly they/then then strictly he/him, I found he/they is my most comfortable area.

 Its been about a year since starting T, and I've realized I actually still prefer being labeled non-binary. I don't really fight the idea of being seen as masculine only, but I'm not comfortable with being seen as /a man/ if that makes sense. I ended up finding out last year, I've actually been intersex this entire time. I still personally identify as Trans, but know that part of it all was some level of undiagnosed intersex-related social and medical trouble. 

With the voice drop and facial changes alone, I feel more like me. I never really had or have dysmorpia around my genitals, but top surgery is a goal if possible.  For me there are a ton of medical complications that come along with medically neccesary surgeries to save my life, so it's harder for me personal to justify it as a necessity. That said, I totally understand that for some it's 100% medically neccesary and life saving. Its just not my personal cup of tea.
being trans
Sex
FTM HERE

for me it's actually quite simple. i've had severe depression for the majority of my life and after a failed attempt i realised i seriously needed to do something about how i was feeling if i ever wanted to experience genuine happiness again. i have always known i'm trans but decided to surpress it bc of my abusive family and just bc i haden't accepted it myself yet. all of that made me realise i owe it to myself to make the best of the time i have on this planet cuz i just happen to be stuck here for a while so i might as well make the best of it. 

i feel the need to transition physically and mentally. i want my body to change, how people see me, i want to be comfortable in the clothes i like and i want to live a life where i can wake up with peace on my mind and not constantly having to fight this battle against myself every single day. i know that battle will probably never fully be over, but i just hope it gets easier one day
I wanted to fix my body I felt like it was being destroyed by testosterone
debilitating dysphoria that made it impossible to live /srs
I just came to realize that no matter what I tried, how I tried to reframe it, or how much my family guided me, I always felt lost trying to perform as “woman.” No matter how much I was like “I defy gender norms!” it always felt so horribly difficult to be “woman.” Hilariously, I will still defy gender norms as a man as I have been passionate about working against toxic masculinity for a while.

But I mean. I couldn’t buy clothes without other people with me or “on call” on a messenger app to help me make decisions. I never understood women’s fashion. I never felt comfortable in the styles. The “useful” and “flexible” pieces I had, I hated them. I never touched them.

I questioned for years before trying. I couldn’t imagine it though with a mental block of my family coaching me to be a woman. I had to go thrift shopping for some men’s clothes (and was really excited even tho I was nervous) and ask my friends/roommates to call me a different name and male pronouns. I had to try on the male gender. And once I did I felt so much lighter and liberated.

My block was my family’s implicit transphobia and the way I was coached and berated constantly growing up about how to be a woman. I thought the only way to be worthy of love was to succeed at “woman.” Thankfully at 24 I have better people around me who love me for who I am and supported me. It helps that I’ve been empathetic and open to these ideas for a long time too. But I couldn’t be more grateful to my friends who always encouraged me to be me and do what I want to do. They will still love me and be here for me. It’s a security I’d never known until these past couple of years. I transitioned for the love of myself that my friends fostered.
after i realized i this was a fact about me i knew going back would break me. in my head i had no choice but to transition.
It was swallow some blue pills or swallow a whole bottle of painkillers
MtF here. I desperately want to have confidence in my body, my expressive identity and appearance, my sexuality. These are things I never knew living as a man. I still have a long way to go but already I have felt so much more alive than ever before.
I'm trans... What do you mean? Social transition? Medical or legal transition? Surgical transition?
i'm MtF.

I'm transitioning because i'm a woman.
Because I clicked the wrong option in character creation. 
But seriously am woman because am woman and the pain and anguish of living in the wrong body finally beat out the fear of coming out and living as me
I’m not female. I don’t feel connected to the word/label trans either. I’m a man. I am male. I was cursed by the higher being (or just pulled the short stick) and now I will spite the universe and continue on as the man I am.
I feel like I'm suffocating in my body, I'd like that to not happen.
dysphoria is too bad not to.
I'm inclined to give the short tearse response ""because I want to and I don't need anyone's permission,"" but I realize that isn't very helpful.

I hate looking at myself. Always have. I tolerate it when I have to look in the mirror, and only focus on whatever part I need to focus on rather than the whole face. I have pretty much no pictures of myself from when I was a kid till maybe last year because I would refuse to be photographed, if someone took a picture of me I would make them delete it. I'm working on processing it and realizing that it's not that I consider myself ugly, because I know I'm not as ugly as I tell myself I am, but the person I see does not ""look"" or ""feel"" like me. 

The only times that changes, is when I look more feminine. I actually smile when looking at myself which I didn't do for nearly three decades prior.
Ftm here, I'll add a few poorly-worded thoughts

From the moment my boobs started growing in (which was at least a solid 5 years before I realized my identity, \~2 years ago), I knew with certainty I'd get them removed as an adult. 

Only my chest and my voice cause me dysphoria most of the time, but the two of them combined make me beyond uncomfortable, far more than enough for me to want to transition

When I look in the mirror, I can't even recognize my body. It feels like someone photoshopped my head onto somebody else's body, it's like it's not me. 

In reality, my main hesitation surrounding transitioning is that I love to sing - like a lot, it's one of my favorite autism stims (I don't sing within earshot of anybody for anybody to be able to assume my gender so it doesn't cause me as much dysphoria as talking) - and I'm anxious about how T will affect the quality of my singing (btw if anybody has any experience with that I'd love to hear it)

It makes me very happy to be called by masculine pronouns/to be seen as a guy. An online friend helped me test out pronouns and I happy cried.

For upwards of 6 years before realizing who I am I'd been having thoughts of ""if I was a guy, then I would..."" then
Short answer, when I looked inward and saw myself, I did not see the same person I saw in the mirror. I transitioned to make these two versions of myself the same.
For me I’m non-binary trans femme. My gender flows from more female one day and more bigender on another. But I have no days that are more male. As such, I’m four months in on HRT now because I want to get to a point where I’m not being read male. Every change that has happened so far has felt right and been more and more confirmation that this is the right thing for me.
every reason pretty much. i dont like my male body, any part of it. id prefer to wear feminine clothes. i want to be addressed as a she. i want to *feel* like a girl in every way i can.
All my life I've been hiding parts of myself from my loved ones because I was afraid of those parts being judged. Growing up I never allowed myself to even look at those parts I was hiding to find out what they are, but realizing I was trans I found out what the parts of me that I was hiding were. Now I am not hiding anymore, that means coming out as trans and transitioning, but it also means a lot of stuff in a lot of other areas of my life. Me being trans is just accepting all the parts of myself
Pretending all the time is too exhausting.
i haven’t transitioned yet but i think i’d prefer to be a girl than a boy but the issue is i have no idea how i’d feel later and my voice is so deep so voice training is going to be hard and the transphobia, and my super old fashioned dad, and i don’t want bottom surgery so am i really trans it’s just so much and i’m so unsure about transitioning because of it
Cuz i'm a man and having these huge massive fuckin"" badonkeroonis is really cramping my white boy swag
Non-binary here, originally AFAB

I knew that although I'd love to have a flat chest, a dick, and wear more masculine clothes, that I didn't want to be a man.

I really hate being called a girl more than anything though, so it felt right for me to transition as Non-binary.

I used to be confused about myself identity wise but learning that I was non-binary cleared a lot of things up.
I just want to be a girl, I dont really know why.
My dysphoria was really vague. I couldn't work out what it was exactly. Didn't seem to be about my body but about the whole concept of being a ""woman"". References to being a woman appeared everywhere, the pain was just background noise. I'm an atheist now but while I was religious I thought my soul was male and wondered what it would be like on the other side, wondering if I'd switch genders when I died.

And yet when I started actually experimenting for the first time, turns out I really did have a problem with my body. I tried to immerse myself in uncomfortable things to get over it -- I started a pole-dancing class to force myself to be more body positive and it really, really worked but only because I grew massive, masculine shoulders. I put on a binder and it looked more like me. Eventually I started T, and while I was scared that the permanent changes would scare me, or it would be a mistake, none of that happened. I just started recognizing my own face in the mirror.

The changes were undeniable. I go out more. I spend more time with and have many more friends. My self-esteem has improved. While I still have some mental health problems they're mostly under control and I'm completely off psych meds altogether (I was on them since I was 7 so this is a HUGE deal). I've stopped taking T twice and both times scared the shit out of me because the good things started to revert and the bad feelings came back. So I'm about as sure as I can be that this is working.
(FtM)-- i just feel more comfortable living as a guy then i ever did when i thought i had to be a girl. it's just easier to be me, now that i know i don't have to try to be someone i'm not
Well, I was never a manly man and always wished i was a woman. Retroactively started seeing a lot of my crushes being gender envy and 4 months ago i was like “man im trans huh” Still coming to terms with everything, and I am pre everything. It’s all very overwhelming and i dont know what to do, but i know my conviction will hold because i see the hardships ahead as nothing but a step towards who i am. Feelung that kind of passion for the first time and knowing im working to be Ashley, and not be stuck playing the role of my old self. I lost my friends of 14 years when i came out to them, but i kept pushing, now i have more supportive ones, that hrings me so much joy! That joy and perseverance, that is why im transitioning! 

(Sorry that exploded into a rant i got off topic woops)
To piss off the transphobes /s




I’ve always wanted to be a girl from dressing up in skirts when I was younger, making a female version of my deadname and finally discovering transgenderism is a thing and immediately going “that makes sense now”. I want to be myself, I want to be happy.
Because I’m a woman and always was a woman. When I grew my breasts it just felt right, like my brain was finally relieved to have the body fixed.
Growing up I couldnt imagine myself being a  guy and living  past high school and transition has made me so happy I started hormones like 6 years ago  and that made me so happy and i was terrified of  starting but when I finally did and the changes started happeing I felt beautiful  and then things stagnated and my family tried to keep me from doing more  but I finally got bottom surgery  on 4/20   and I'm home healing now and I was terrifi3d of the surgery andnthat I was going to regret it  but now that I've had it i feel so free  and happy and fem amd just myself it started off with slow risks  trying clothes seeing if people would notice makeup but every risk was rewarded with happiness even in the presence  of Hate  and  I transitioned to make myself happy and enjoy life🥺🥺🥺
Basically I tried to figure out what kind of man I wanna be for years but none felt quite right. Then one day ""what if I'm a woman"" popped into my head, I tried imagining myself as a woman and things just clicked.
i feel like my life won’t start until i transition. i never got to grow up in a body or a role that made me feel comfortable and because of that i’ve developed severe anxiety and depression. however, ever since i’ve started to transition things have slowly gotten better. I feel like a real person finally, i recognize the person in the mirror, i’m able to find things about my body to be confident about. I’m still young and still growing but understanding myself has helped me to finally see that i do have a future. I want to live and be happy and i don’t think i would have made it this far if i had stayed silent.
I don't want to torture myself anymore. That's why I'm  (at least trying) to do it...
To be comfortable in my own skinn and be happy.

Just being born with the wrong parts makes me shut down.
I'm a male, what am I doing in this female body?
Honestly, just intense and horrible dysphoria that made my life really hard to live.
Eventually the dysphoria got too much for me to repress anymore and I grew tired of torturing myself in service of a none existent god.
 why do u think lmao
I just felt happier this way. Felt I was never normal and pushed myself to try and be average just left me with a love for the trades and…. Not much else I won’t be going back tho never in a million years. But my gf basically solved the puzzle for me considering I just couldn’t understand my feelings
Yes
I hate my male body.
3 weeks into hrt already
I'm 13 shit's becoming different now. If I don't have to be a boy I'm not going to be a boy. I don't like being associated with anything masculine.
I think for me there are multiple reasons
I started hating being a boy. Hated that I ""had to be manly"" and all that. It was about when I started puberty that also started. It got worse and worse until I finally started wearing different clothing in my late high school years. Came out once I moved out of the toxic af town I used to live in.
My crippling gender dysphoria.
thank you so much for putting out this opportunity for all of us to speak!! i was in a rly deep pit depressed over being trans and started losing touch with the realities that had led me to realize that i’m trans in the first place (in an effort to cling to ignorance)

reading everyones replys and your follow-up questions brought back a bit of my confidence :)))

for myself, i guess there’s many reasons ranging from social and physical for sure

i’m amab but i have relatively curvy legs and man bitties which had always been the source of toooonsss of dysphoria growing up. through the years, i learnt how to dress accordingly to my body but the techniques i’ve used have been mainly to find clothing that creates the illusion of a different silhouette than the one i have. i’ve actually grown to quite like my silhouette, but every time i feel a bit adventurous and want to step out of my “uniform”, i feel suuuuper dysphoric - i hate how muscular my arms, chest and back are, how broad my shoulders look. simply put, i feel extremely limited when it comes to my self-expression in this male body that i hold. and in my worst moments, it really sucks because i basically have the same physique as many professional boxers so if i worked out a little bit i’d probably be able to reach an idealized form of the male body. unfortunately for me, that’s not at all what i want or what i see myself as. my gender identity is feminine-leaning and that’s what i wished i looked like - feminine. 

a smaller but undeniably trans aspect of my life is the crippling bottom dysphoria i’ve felt since the moment i discovered my own sexuality. 

on the social side, it’s a bit messy as i grew up with no knowledge of queerness until my late teens and it was only after i moved out of my mother’s house and heteronormative city into a more open-minded city that i realized that for my whole life, i was putting on a mask of masculinity. masculinity was never something that i was authentically able to manifest. it started making sense why i felt so much closer to the women in my life rather than the men. i’m still kind of processing the social aspect but looking back, there was this time, i was subconsciously annoyed at being misgendered and i didn’t even realize it lol. i was on a date and this woman kept clocking me as male and i got flustered. i also felt quite a bit of imposter syndrome always being the only amab “cis” dude when hanging with my friends. 

honestly, like with most people probably, i think i’ve been my own biggest critic and even as i was writing all this, i found a few logical holes in my own reasoning but the one thing i can say is that i’ve never felt more centered until realizing that i am in fact trans.
I was pretty much shutdown had a weird obsession with hating women for no reason any little thing would set me off and I would rant about them. Family thought it was weird was told to go to therapy went to therapy found out I was trans went in depth with it with my therapist she helped figure out I was trans and listened and said “ you can live a life of self loathing and hatred or you can be the you , you want to be “ so I chose to transition to be myself and to be happier so pretty much to live happy and few other things but mostly to be the girl I want  to be
No like body and voice 👁
I know that months and months before I even cut my hair short I felt awful, I was so ready to cut it and when I finally got an appointment at a hair salon I almost cried. Even if it's the small things to present male I need it. I know I won't be happy or comfortable otherwise, which is why I want to/need to transition!
The reason I wish to transition is for a sense of belonging in a body I feel comfortable with. If you had asked me last year if I had any plans on getting bottom surgery I would've been on the fence, but after a long and perpetually bout of dysphoria with what I do have and doing research I have decided that I do wish have bottom surgery as well.
I just thought girls are cool
I wanna be pretty girl
Be happy
FtM here, basically because I have never seen myself as anything other than a man my whole life. As a kid, as young as 3, I'd throw a fit & cry if my parents tried to put me into girls clothes or tried to get me to anything do feminine. At 8 years old I even tried socially changing my name to Alexander but no one would call me that so it didn't stick haha. Everyone around me thought it was a joke (which it wasn't). It got especially bad when I hit puberty & I hit puberty EARLY at like 10. Developing feminine characteristics during puberty genuinely made me feel disgusted with myself & I didn't feel like I was in my own body most of the time, the only good thing that came out of puberty is that I got pretty tall but I guess if I were a cis man i would've probably been taller. I think the biggest thing though was whenever I'd think about my future & try to picture my future self, all I ever saw was me being a man, there was no happy situation I could picture where I wasn't a man and I don't want to live miserably.
I found my voice to be irritating coming from me since I've hit puberty. I always felt more like someone was voice acting for me or like I had inhaled a bunch of helium. I desperately want a nice deeper voice.

Also the way my body changed during puberty seemed strange to me. Especially my hip dips and chest. I remember being upset with myself for wearing too tight underwear because I thought it was the reason I got ""deformed"".
Also my body issues probably started when my mom pointed out my chest was growing the last time my little sister and I bathed together (idk how old I was man probably like 12, don't ask me why we were still bathing together). She was saying that I was turning into a lady in a taunting way and I remember feeling so insecure and shit.. I didn't notice I was getting a chest and I believe I didn't want one. Because as a teen whenever I'd look at myself in our full length mirror I'd hold down my chest and only then I was satisfied. I've also held my hair up to make it look short plenty of times, as a child, tween, and teen.
Also I've always loved jewelry and nailpolish and took an interest in makeup but I never felt comfortable in any of it, I'd always scratch the nail polish off immediately accompanied by a weird sense of dread (now that I'm comfortable and confident in my identity I can finally experiment with that stuff a lot more).

Now why did it take me 2+ years to accept I was trans?Hyper-femininity B)
Ever since the time I wanted my hair to be cut and wore a boyish shirt to kindergarten on the day we took pictures for our door, I entered a hyper femininity phase. It was the first time I experienced trans panic™️ and made me want to live to meet other's expectations or what I'd think their expectations were. I thought about what the perfect daughter would be and set out to end up as a wife with 2 to 4 kids. I was in kindergarten. 

Fast forward to me going on 16, I start somewhat questioning my gender (at least deep down) for no reason I can clearly recall (maybe because I contacted an old online friend and he said he was a guy now) and finally gather some information about the lgbtq community which also allowed me to realize I wasn't quite only into guys during a school trip like 3 months later (late spring, early summer).
Anyways I my urge to cut off more and more hair grows continuously, I almost buzz of my hair during an anxiety attack and some days later ask my older sister to buzz my hair with me (mind you I was always very adamant about not having my long hair cut because hyper femininity. I also thought I just needed big boobs and makeup to be happy with the way I looked.). The reaction to my hair was overwhelming. My dad cried because he had a rough day and I was always so proud of my hair, so he was sad. My mom was reminded of when she was a teen and buzzed her hair because her mom got really mad. She said I needed to start wearing make up to look feminine and I remember just being upset with that statement (for multiple obvious reasons) and also feeling the trans panic™️ again after all those years. I hide and cry under a blanket because the negative reactions from my parents is overwhelming and they finally realize that they maybe weren't being quite considerate. My brother and younger sister were really neutral at least so that helped. Also my grandpa was a fan which is one of my fondest memories. He was really religious, so I can't imagine how he would've reacted to me being trans but at least he was supportive of my hair.
The trans panic™️ and denial made me tell people I was just wanting to see my hair grow out at first. 

Either way, during Summer I'm feeling really depressed. I try being androgynous for a while but quickly realize it doesn't do anything for me and that I need to change something in my life. So I decide to come out as maybe trans to my older sister (I had already come out as pan ((I use bi now because they can also be attracted to NBs)) to her in like the same month). She makes me come out to our mom the very same evening/night who then told my grandma and dad without my knowledge or consent.
My grandma tells me she knows deep down I'm a girl at some point but by then I'm already somewhat confident enough to shake my head and mean it when she asks me if I believe her even a little bit (she didn't have a problem with me being pan/bi). She's dead now and I regret never having a talk with her. Not just about me, in general. She was such a smart woman but I didn't really live for the first 16 or 17 years of my life. I just existed to make others happy. I neglected my own mental health when I was just 13 and felt proud of not being a burden to my mom and big sister. I didn't live in reality, my brain was just on auto pilot, so I could survive becoming what I thought others wanted of me.
I wasted so much time and I wasted the only time I had with my grandmother. And my grandpa is so depressed over her death that I'm lucky if I can even get ahold of him for more than 3 minutes.

So that's my little story. Even if no one reads it because it's kinda long it was good to put this down into words.
My egg cracked when I saw a tweet saying you didn’t need to have dysphoria to be trans, just can just want to not be/not alway want to be the gender you were identified with as at birth, and next time I looked in the mirror, I didn’t see myself as ugly anymore. It turns out I did had dysphoria, I’d just mistakenly thought I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin because I was disabled; but I’m finally at peace with my disability now, something I thought I’d never have.

I thought I was so down because my pain was because I was disabled, and there was nothing I could do about that, but with it fact due to me looking males,it means there is something I can do about that.

Luckily when I came out to my mum, she didn’t think that me already following a load of trans accounts on twitter was brainwashing me, but she saw it as backing me up, with it being my subconscious trying to tell me something.
Not growing old in a male body was the last straw and dysphoria really became a problem. Was very feminine before so it took a while to really bloom. I can't talk much about internal self-hate tho, at least not for being trans 😂 for being an annoying anxious ball of PTSD on the other hand 🤔 maybe sometimes xD I didn't even hated my body really, its a beautiful body 💕 very fit and slender, wonderful skin, nice proportions and my face daamn. If anything I was in love with it my whole life. Dysphoria made my life more and more hell tho.. doesn't need to come as self-hate with me it came in the form of increasing and more permanent derealization and depersonalosation and I could feel that the communication between my body and brain was hindered by my brain expecting a different body. Additionally the sheer knowledge of my body being driven by testosterone was haunting me. Felt wrong, on a biochemical level. Haha and love my female body even more, oooff 🥵🥵🥵 now I can enjoy my hotness fully ahahaha 😂
FTM. Cause for the longest time, I was so unhappy with my body. Whether it be because I felt I was too fat, too short, the like. Once I figured out I was trans, I realized I don’t want to be unhappy with my body anymore. 

I don’t wanna go into a girl’s bathroom, but I didn’t feel safe enough to go into a boy’s bathroom. I’m five foot, and used to be 160 pounds before I began transitioning. I got sick of feeling out of place, so I wanted to try to get close to how I truly wanted to look.

Plus, my having a beard is hella rad, gives me good chemicals.
I transition to be myself in my bodey... not a universe error... also to keep living and not killing myself
Read way too much gender bender manga wanted to get gender bender, started to pray god for it even if I didn't believed in god then realized I wanted to be non binary and that I may had felt like that since im very little lol
Turns out that the things I wanted to change since childhood match the things that most people change during transition, and the reason I never felt the wrong gender as strongly is that I just don't have a gender. So now I am working on getting my body to a point where I can be comfortable with myself. Some I can do myself like dressing how I like, doing exercises and eating healthy to get into general shape and gain some muscle. Others I need the help of a doctor I can't detach certain organs myself and no DIY hormones for me as family history means higher risk for some things.

So reason for transitioning socially, cause I can and it makes my life less stressful, or well a different type of stress that is easier to deal with

Reason for medical transition, cause I can't do it myself and I need to hold on to the possibility to not end up going for extreme measures, shame the NHS makes it hard to hold onto that much needed hope
I just decided I would die if I didn’t live my true self. My whole life was a form of self harm and I deserve better than that.
i want to be happy. prior to beginning my transition i was constantly suicidal and even agoraphobic. after i started testosterone i became much healthier mentally, and i constantly feel a lot better than i did before transitioning. i want to get top surgery but cant afford it right now and instead im just letting the testosterone do its thing while i live the best life i can.

ultimately, im transitioning so that i can actually live my life.
It's something I fantasized for the longest of time. The first realistic opportunity I had - I took it without hesitation.
I want people to actually see me as a guy
i don’t wanna be a boy

no offense boys just that life isn’t for me
personal   growth and my own mental health
I want to throw my male identity into a box, pour gas on it, set it ablaze, stomp on it multiple times, throw it down a cliff, then down a waterfall and watch it rot at the bottom of the ocean. 

In short: I HATE being a man.

Women get it all. They get everything good. Body type, pronouns, religious experiences (at least for my religion), clothing options, less judgement, better names....

Probably more I could think of. But I just feel like a peasant next to girls. They get all that is good, the life that is hard, yet beautiful. I want that. I know my life will be harder if I pursue the girl. But I don't care. I hate the man.
Periods evil period
I wanted a body I could be proud of, a body I could walk with confidence in. I wanted a body that could support my life and not hinder it, one I could feel comfortable fucking around in. Honestly I have no confidence in ever “passing” but that doesn’t matter to me as much anymore, I am who I am and as long as I have my own recognition and acceptance I don’t need the worlds, I just want to be the best version of me that I can be and that requires taking estrogen because without it I’ll never be “me”. And frankly the effects are amazing, i just find it so intriguing how I basically went from a incredibly meek, submissive and docile person without a hint of pride or dignity, when I was on the hormone famed for causing aggressiveness, to a girl who basically walked out of a femdom novel in terms of temperament. I suppose confidence is one helluva drug and I needed to be on estrogen before I could have any.
Mine was hard to pin down, because I wasn’t “unhappy” living as a man, per se. But I spent way more sleepless nights worrying I was trans, and thinking about being a woman than a cis guy ever would lol. Also, the warm and fuzzy feelings I get thinking about having an actual figure, and not being built like a tube of chapstick.
When i was a little kid there was a boy in our class. He was everybodys friend but not with me ofc- i would always stare at him while he was playing with his friends and i was thinking inside ""maybe if i was a boy..."" and now i am a boy but i still don't have any friends 🤡
For me it was growing up in a hypermasculine environment and experiencing a lot of negativity/toxicity within the interpersonal relationships in that environment, namely from my own father. As a result nothing about being a man appeals to me at all. I don't want to be like any of the kind of men I grew up with or subject anyone I know or care about to being around that kind of person.

tldr: I didn't want to become my dad so badly that I became a woman
I am very confused by the question??

Isn't being trans the answer?
I’m trans.
Ftm here, I'm pre everything but when I started to really think about transitioning I noticed alot of the reasons social situations like out at school or in general never worked or didn't feel right were closely tied to how I was seen how everyone perceived me just like I'm super dysphoric about my body and hope to change it all I wasn't confortable being seen as a girl either I've been out to almost everyone I know aside from family and I can really say for me just that made me way more confident and happy so to me I want to transition because of body dysphoria and social.
I reached a point in my life (at 36) where the only choices I had left were transition or die. So I made a choice. Here I am. 1 year on HRT as of two days ago.
A lot of the time I can't really put it into words, and when I do it feels like I've just 'learnt' to say it, but I know that's not true. I hate being seen as male, I don't like how I dress or how I look currently, and I definitely don't like how I sound. Since coming to university I've only introduced myself with my real name, sometimes even specifically giving my pronouns because I'm not brave enough or something to dress how I want, and yet people still just see me as a man. I mean, granted, I don't look fem right now so that's not exactly anyones fault, but what the hell is up with being called Matt? My name's Madeline! Or Maddy!! Not fucking Matt are you kidding 😭. A few days ago another girl came up to me and said ""are you Madeline?"" and while that felt great I realised they only knew who I was because one of my roommates would've had to describe how I look and I just can't deal with thinking they, who are otherwise super supportive right now, would still have to misgender me to get the point across.

Sorry that kind of turned into a rant at the end haha but it's things like that which really make me certain I'm trans and I do want to transition, even when imposter syndrome and anxiety or whatever the heck this feeling is makes me feel like shit. Also highly recommend documenting these things, just so you can look back and see this 10 page document about how trans you are haha
I finally learned that feminizing HRT exists and what it can do. Seriously, I’m embarrassed that I went 35 years being jealous of trans women for somehow magically getting to be women while I was stuck in this gross hairy flesh sack.

I was having some serious denial issues and dissociated a lot though. The cognitive dissonance was insane in hindsight.

Definitely didn’t help that my sex education growing up literally didn’t exist at school or home.

I’m 100% doing this for the estrogen.
FTM here: I’ve always known I was a gay man, and I’ve felt “trapped” in this body for too long. For me, it’s about wanting what I see in the mirror to match how I see myself in my mind and who I know I am. I’m a leash this human on the inside and my mental space is there too. 

Side note because someone mentioned FTM erasure: yah I posted a question here for FTMs that got zero comments. I guess a lot of folks did leave eh?
Hmmm... Short anwser: Kirby  (Male -> Female) (living in Germany)

(disclaimer I think I butchered the englisch language extremly here so be aware)

When i was 14 or 15 (it is for me 5-6 years old. I cant remember exactly) I saw randomy some Kirby clips I dont know why but i got really excited about kirby super fast... then after watching 2 days only kirby content I thought... I wanna be cute to! and then I thought some time about that... I heard in the past about people switching sex.... After some more thinking around with the idea. I didnt really liked the idea, because: 1. I have a very big fear of doctors and surgey 2. I think everybody will lough at me in school 3. Nobody will support me in the family (divorced parent: I was by my mother and she was more a right-wing nationalist and also my grandparents are half deeply Christan and the other ignorant) so i kept it to myself.. and become somewhat gender neutral.. i didnt describe me as a man but acknowledged that im a Boy, also I hated it ,if some said something like: Be more a Man! after i moved to my dad (my stepdad was so bad i couldnt take it anymore and ran away to my dad).... i just wanted to move on in my life and throwed everything that was a burden away.... my dad that wanted to help me and did his best to get me on the right track.. problem was... he wanted to make me a grown man... this obviously didnt really work so he got extremy frustrated at me.. and I also became more and more frustrated at myself and hated everything from personality and my feelings. The thing is, that I completly forgot that im somewhat a girl and so didnt understood myself.

After a failed apprenticeship that costed me somewhat my sanity (but gave me somewhat the ability to ignore pain) i was in my lowes point in my life... 

Then I met a girl and talk a bit with her (she also wanted to help me).. she explained to me that she is trans and after some back and forth I felt the same way and so I rediscoverd slowly that im indeed also trans.. 

Most of my Family acutally supports more or atleast accept it. (My mother and christian grandma is really helping me now and yes the reaction of both to my confession cought me of guard :) ). So now its a half year after I realised it.. I become more and more mentaly stable and also i become more and more a sarcastic teasy version of pinky pie .. so give you a clap on your back for reading this story and I wish all of you a great and comfy day <3
To try dating chicks while still having gay sex
FTM here! I thought I was a boy in preschool, but when I asked  my mom about it she laughed and said I was a girl so I went ""Okay!"" and felt miserable about my body and image for a very long time. Puberty made me feel 1000x worse and I tried very hard to fit into a feminine stereotype without wanting to admit it made me severely unhappy. At some point I finally started taking care of myself, started respecting myself and asking what actually makes me happy? I was already struggling with pronouns and used to roleplay a lot as an overexeggarted male version of myself. Got a medium haircut for the first time and started using my nickname a lot more than my birth name. Very much enjoyed being called the dad of my friend group and jokingly being called boyfriend in a past relationship. 

Had a sudden encounter with a transphobe who I thought was my friend at the time and took the awful things he said very personally. Did some crying, thinking and researching and found out that all the feelings I was having had a name and that there are many people who are experiencing the same kind of feelings. Tried out new pronouns, tried a shorter haircut, tried out binding. It all clicked. I felt more like myself, I felt genuine joy being able to express myself in a way I understood and felt comfortable with. I found out the euphoria of actually being able to be myself. 

I no longer had to let myself suffer thinking I was doing things wrong or that there was something wrong with me. I finally let myself be happy and it just so happens that I am happiest as a man. :]
Turns out that I want to live.  That means I must transition.
Hit a dark point in my life and it’s basically transition and be happier in my self or no longer be here and leave my kids behind which is something I’d rather not do
Trans Demi girl here. I want to transition just get rid of some of my features that I've hated all my life and cause me constant stress.
I cant see myself living happily or genuinely as a woman. Everything I want in life, everything that makes me happy when I think about it, everything that feels like me & everything that makes me genuinely happy to imagine being my future, is a man. 
Always has been.
every time i looked in the mirror, i saw someone else elooking back. i dropped out of college because i didnt want a degree with my deadname on it. i didnt care if i lived, died, or anything for a while. eventually i realized that i actually was in a safe space to transition, and i couldnt keep pretending to be male.
I want to be seen as a boy. I want to look like a boy. I don’t want to get distracted from TV shows that I’m watching just because I am staring at a cis guy’s chest envious of it.
I have not begun any physical transition as of yet, but the reasion for wanting to, is because I can only see myself as a horribly malformed monstrosity. My only real coping mechanism is to totally disregard my own body as much as posable. Looking in mirrors makes me angry, looking at my own hairy forearms makes me angry. Thankfully the idea of my body usually fades into the background, like when you breath automatically, just sort of ignoring it. But if I see my self then BAMN the illusion is broken , and there's the disgusting blob monster.
i had the idea to change gender befor even knowing what a trans was, the first time i can remeber to had think that was nearely 10 years ago, im 21
I dont like my body, femenine (sorry for gender steryotypes) clothing just makes me feel so envious when i see anyone looking cute in it. Like gosh i wish it was me the body the hair everything.
Dysphoria. I don't gotta say more lol
I am non-binary so my transition gets to be a bit complex. I feel like I can split my transition into 3 categories. 

1. Social - I personally did this because my deadname, pronouns, and how I presented was uncomfortable for me and I was forcing myself into a picture of me that others wanted, rather than what I wanted. So for socially transitioning it was just to be authentic to me.
2. Legal - I changed my name legally and my gender marker (only on driver license) because of similar reasons to the social reasons. It also helped with not having to put preferred name and pronouns all over the place when it comes to jobs and college for me. 
3. Medical - Medical has been all about mitigating dysphoria. I identified what gives me dysphoria and started talking to the right people to get my transition started. However because I am Non-binary my dysphoria doesn't work in a binary sense. I yeeted my teets and am in the process of getting a hysterectomy. These are the only 2 things I want to do. I have reasons for each. The teet yeet was purely dysphoria, however the hysto is because I don't want kids, my uterus causes severe pain, and periods make me dysphoric.

It is all truly just for me to live and be comfortable with who I am. That is why I transitioned.
Suicide prevention
Because I can
My body, my choice.

Honestly, while closeted I was able to convince myself that having a male body was ""fine."" Existing meant putting up with something I never wanted. And I think eventually what I realized was that fine wasn't good enough. The turning point for me was as simple as deciding that I actually deserved happiness. I guess transitioning wasn't always on my mind before I started. But once I asked myself ""would I be happier living as a girl,"" and once the affirmative answer became impossible to ignore, I decided I had nothing to lose. It was a wise decision.
I haven’t transitioned yet but I want to so I’ll tell from why I want to, in short I want to be seen as a man. Longer answer I’ve always been jealous of what cis guys can do and wanted to be able to do that as well (stuff like walking around shirtless) and I have kinda always been more like a guy and not until recent years started to question gender (before it was always just “I’m me idc” but then dysphoria got worse at random times) so I just want to be seen as who I am and I want to be able to look at myself and like what I see
i am transgender
Wrong answer: shorter bathroom lines at nerdcons
Real answer: I got tired of lying.
I felt like it 💁🏻‍♀️
just wanna be happy
I Want to be Girl
Amen
I hate everything about myself, I am having mental breakdowns over my gender and I have no idea who I am anymore, but I want to be a girl so that is what I will do. If I don’t transition it will just get worse until it just ends.
100%. The longer i live as male, the less I care about myself. So the only way to not continuouslu slip into paths of self destruction is to transition. Health issues have been & are a major obstacle though, both medically and financially speaking.
I feel that in my soul.
AMEN
Is it more clothing or more body?
Fellow rare pokemon here - 10000% this. Just this.
Deborah: Yah I think most of them left thanks to accidental erasure a lot of which is transfemmes forgetting about them, still nice to see you around and hang in there brother. 💜
“Walk around shirtless and go swimming, flex in the gym and stupid stuff ya know?” 

Yeah. Definitely a guy… lol 

Go you! :)
'I can't agree more. 
passing by that bloody mirror without a binder makes me wanna grab the axe and chop them off. Can't wait for the day there gone. 
As for the lower parts they already told me i might not be able to get that do to some problems i had as a kid.
But i'm ok with it now. My amazing friends pointed out some things that made me laugh so hard that it's ok now.
So no social dysphoria?
Yeah asshair sucks
i’m ftm. MORE ASS HAIR /hj
Deborah: Damn that's like the story of our life, that's such a good explanation. 💜
Amazing
It's really put's into perspective this whole topic - I might use that one day if people don't understand (luckily most circles that I'm part of are very accepting)

Also D&D high five yay 🙌🏻
Idk why but this reminded me of a story from when I was younger. 

So I grew up without my dad around a lot, so having only seen(physically) and therefor learned from my mom and my two afab siblings. So I one day asked when my penis was gonna fall off, I still can’t get over how stupidly funny it is.
Nice dude
Deborah: Yo boyflux, our system is girlflux in a similar way, that's a fun time.
So for you its social?
Thx
There are dozens of us!
God i wo a hear from you when you figure ypur gender out becquse i bet that would be intrsting
All I could imagine with the first line was “Fine…I’ll do it myself”
Do you get social dysphoria?
Is there a specific reason or is it just an urge
I feel similarly
Deborah: We're transfemme and girlflux, that's like a mood both ways for us. Do we want to want to hang out in all gorl groups sure that sounds awesome, but be forced to, ahh hell nah.
Dude you should get a binder, like i should also get fake boobs but like you spund like ypu really need a binder
how so?
Ya my dysphoria got worse when i came out or rather it started to ve phisical
why is that?
we r too mtf dominated so i wanted to make some room for other people so its not just the mtf responses, like i got 100 coments on the other one or something ridiclus.
It didnt really change anything really but
can you describe how your dysphoria works, like is it social physical or internal (3 categories i found so far)
Dam that sucks
thx for sharing
Awomen
Body. I'm really unhappy with Myself. In general I'm not a fan of appearing male and would much rather appear female. That includes both clothes and body. I'm still pre-anything but I can't wait to become a woman already. : D
Deborah: Social dysphoria often goes with social transitioning if you're not binary presenting, or in our case being gender fluid, our pronouns bounce from she/it and can just swap priority and like that's not a fun time with cishets being the majority.
I cannot even begin to fathom why anyone would want ass hair lmao you’re awesome
if we got as much facial hair as ass hair istg 🥴
Yeah it was something I was trying to do but then I got kinda busy with work and honestly it doesn't come up too often...but e and spiro have been pretty good and that's enough probably
pretty much how it went.
Yea on occasion I do mainly around people who I'm.still in the closet around and when I'm wearing my work shirts with my dead name on them
I’d say it’s an urge. I’ve had it for as long as I can remember and I don’t really have a reason. I think it’s just something that happens, like being left handed.
I do, I just need to figure out a way to get it without my parents noticing. I planned to get a PO box, but where I live this requires an app my phone is too old for, so now, I don't know how to get a binder and have kinda postponed it to when I move out.
also good luck on getting yourself some boobies
You know when you starve to death and eating is the only solution to survive? That's what transitioning is for me
Definitely. Personally my social dysphoria got a lot worse, but physical dysphoria too
I just felt unhappy with the constant harassment online because of my (for me) stupid girl voice. It makes me genuinely unhappy being female and especially being perceived female. Guess that's my dysphoria!
You are correct
Awwww your babytrans excitement is just the best thing. 

Do you know if it comes from a social reason? Or is it a physical thing for you
I feel this. I’ve struggled appearing male and wearing male clothes. I’m 35 and really hard for me to dress nice. I’ll ask my mom and aunt how to dress sometimes. I’ve also always struggled to fit in and would jump from thing to thing
Oh so you guys are also a system? 
I see where ypu are coming from but i m not surd if ots that simple
Intrestibg
But my internal dysphoria got better so that was good
Then that falls ubder social in my categories. 

Thx foe sharing
Deborah: Did you notice what T does with your brain felt more natural? Because we certainly didn't with E, like those hormones hit different.
Physical. I've been unhappy with Myself for 7-8 years almost. I've come out to close friends & family only recently(just 2 years ago). Kinda hate Myself for never coming out sooner. Never believed anyone would actually hate Me. Just that nobody really would care or help.
We live in the south and have no intentions of moving, so at least here being anything of than binary presenting opens you up to intentional misgenedering by people that just don't get it, like coming out about that is it's own potential source of social dysphoria and in our case it's one we're just gonna accept like big girls and deal with because it's better than staying in the closet.
Yea I blame cintas for the shirt thing but I barely care as long as ik who I am its ok
From Bama, I fell you. Dress on, makeup on, hair did, heels on... ""Sir what can I get for you""... 
That's why I started my transition in Korea
Good luck."	uchv2m	trans	402	0.97	2022-04-26 17:27:24
Do I pass? I feel like I keep getting clocked and dysphoria is telling me I don't.		"In my opinion you are now in a stage where you can present as both female and male, depending on your hairstyle and clothing choices.

I am not trying to be mean, but i will try my best to explain why that is.

In your first picture, you seem androgynous, however due to clothing choices (blue loosely fitting shirt) as well as the hair, which seems like it's not been put in any way it gives off a very slight masculine feel (not a lot honestly). But don't be depressed by this, it's only caused by things you can easily change when going out to public, just be aware of this. In this outfit, i would probably think you as trying to be androgynous.

In the second picture, you seem much more feminine, this is due to your hair being touched up and you are wearing clothing that is more feminine. If i would see you out in public in that outfit, i would think you as a female.

So do i think you pass?

It depends. You are currently in a stage where you can present as both feminine and masculine, depending on your choices of clothing, hairstyle and possible makeup.

I want to emphasize that you need to make sure to have an outfit and hairstyle that makes you seem like the gender you want to pass as because your facial features are neutral.

Edit: i am in no way trying to be disrespectful, i just want to give you an honest opinion, because i think it's better to give an honest positively enforcing opinion.
For safety reasons, no, you don't pass. Not yet atleast. Your fairly androgynous.
I'm not a fan of the folks here telling everyone they pass regardless if they do or not. Not everyone lives in a safe area and we need to be especially transparent with trans girls who are especially at risk of violence.
I just noticed that I didn't say that I'm MtF and 6 months HRT. 😅
Not yet but after a year or two more of HRT you probably will, however you don’t appear awfully masculine.
YOU LOOK STUNNING HONEY!!
Love your hair💙
Honestly it could go either way, which is pretty cool if ya think about it
Yeah! But if you’re worried about it, here’s a tip: tinted lipgloss or lipstick. It helps give emphasis on your lips, and people are less likely to misgender you. Hope this helps, but I don’t think you got much to worry about. :)
You don’t pass entirely yet, but you’re getting there💕
I think so, you look very cute/pos
I think it mostly has to do with your cheek lines, see if you can use makeup to accentuate your cheekbones. 

The brain is incredibly complex and there many factors that go towards identifying people, I have an inclination to examining facial structure.
Haha no that is totally fine.  I don't think your style is bad mind you it just probably attracts more attention than other women your age.  But I could be wrong it's highly dependant on where you live heart 💗
You look like thelexikitty from Emkay without long hair so I say yes:>
to me, not really. you are really cute though. i suggest growing your hair a bit longer, maybe to shoulder length and do a side part with the sharp end of a comb to make the part really straight. wearing blush would help a lot too i think
No, you do not. You look androgynous in my opinion. As a previous commenter said, a lot of people will tell everyone they pass for validation, but that can be really unsafe for trans girls in violent and transphobic environments. However, not passing /=/ not looking cute. You look really good, I’m envious of your hairstyle. I think as you keep having changes from HRT, you will be able to pass really well. You’re pretty close!
Honestly i think you pass more in the first picture than the second. Maybe its the curly hair or the fact i can see your eyes better? But you look very cute and sweet.
The first one you look a bit more masc but the second one you look more fem

still really adrodgynous though.

I suggest growing bangs maybe you'll pass better?
Lookin pretty good
personally i think that the curly hair looks more feminine, i see a lot of chicks with a cropped short cut so it’s pretty normal and is good for growing out your hair (if you’re trying to do that) i think you look androgynous in both, but pass more feminine in the first despite the “masculine” clothing.
You look nice
You DO pass darling!
tbh first pic you posted look like an afab girl I knew.
i'd say 50/50. 'passing' is a dynamic act, and usually depends on the situation. i'd say you would pass in a brief conversation with a person on the street, but if you're sitting down with someone for a long period of time, maybe not. if someone saw you dressed from behind in the clothes from your second pic, deffo passing, but if they saw you from upfront as you are in your first pic, maybe not. also depends on your voice, your posture, mannerisms, all that gunk. so 50/50.
if you keep getting clocked, there's probably a reason for that :D
Theres not a single doubt about you passing, i just think people are looking at you because of how pretty you look (plus the kinda goth cloooothes omg)

You are beautiful hun and never doubt yourself again
Yes. You look great. If you're turning heads it's because you're cute and have a cool style
I would say you pass.
I would say your pretty damn close. The first picture you have an element of andronomous i would kill for. You really pretty and if your about 6 months in your only gonna get prettier love. I hope your area is safe if you do get clocked tho. At this point I’m not gonna say you completely pass bc that would be lying and I don’t want to do that bc I’m not sure what your living situation is and if the place your in is safe for trans people. But I will tell you this. Babes you are damn gorgeous and getting really close to passing. At this point your really andronomous but feminine, and by using clothes and makeup to your advantage you definitely could. Apon first glance as scrolling down my feed without looking at the would i pass I would have just thought yeah that’s a girl. And yeah that’s exactly what it is. Your gorgeous darling please remeber that nomatter what anybody says. And if anybody is rude to you I’ll Murdur them. Or send a strongly worded dm at least. <3 also where did you get your top if you don’t mind me asking haha
Be confident and proud, try to ignore your dysphoria.. 💋
female eyes but the rest of yo face looks like paul dano
No, sorry you still look male to me.
as what?
from my point of view, yes. your eyes look very feminine
You have a very androgynous face (as I'm sure many here have told you by now) and your hair can look masculine or feminine depending on you fix it. I think as long as your clothes and hair are styled in a feminine way, you will pass well. Also, I have found that makeup on any androgynous person will get people to assume you are female (source: am androgynous in appearance, get called a ""pretty girl"" by strangers every time I wear makeup).

Btw, I just want to say that you are very pretty.
I literally spent a minute trying to figure out which gender you were in the first pic before realizing there is a second picture. So I think clothes, makeup and hair style would make all the difference.
Not mean or disrespectful in the least. Considering that first picture was taken just as I got out of bed without any makeup or anything I think that's a high compliment lol. I was actually taking that picture for my girlfriend to show her how puffy my hair gets after getting wet, I do usually straighten it like in the second picture. I dont tend to wear a lot of makeup usually just a bit of concealer/colour corrector but I should probably start trying to get into that some more.
This is a really great answer.  I think you also look androgynous but where you could heavily play up looking cis-female with makeup and clothing that blends.  Odds are when you are dressed female in public people are looking at you because you look beautiful and interesting.  If you feel like you are getting ""clocked"" I would be inclined to say your style makes people suspicious of your gender.  You would probably want a larger bra to fit your chest size better, and to consider if you're really wearing clothing that girls your size/shape wear.
I agree with all this. I’d also just say, potentially just not quite yet. But with more time, and definitely with intentional clothing and things - you’ll get there. Look great tho regardless 😊
This, but keep in mind that ""doesn't pass"" does not mean ""isn't cute.""
Your sweet face is only gonna get sweeter I betcha
Months 9-12 are when the face changes really kick into gear in my experience! Barely anything happens regarding passability in the first six months tbh.
I second that
Thank you ;--;
Thank you!! I wish it was much longer though xD
This is a good tip!
That's a good tip thanks!
Thank you! ♥
Thank you and happy cake day!
Thank you! And yeah the hair growth is the plan, I've been growing it for nairly a year now. Slow progress
I was considering bangs
Ty ♥
u sound like you want to eat me 👀
Thank you ;--; ♥
Yeah I get that. My voice is pretty okay and fem passing. I think my voice actually saves me a lot as when people look confused and hear my voice I get gendered correctly.
Awh, tysm ;--;

&#x200B;

And yeah my style is very alternative/goth. That picture is actually quite tame xD
I wish I could see it this way, whenever someone stares at me I feel so shitty Dx  


Thank you for the very kind words though!
Thank you for the kind words sweetie. I do present fem everywhere I go just because boy mode was murdering my soul. The area is generally good for trans people I get some looks like I've said but no one ever gives me any grief. Which top? In the second pic? If so then I got that from [www.disturbia.co.uk](https://www.disturbia.co.uk/) :D
I asked if I pass not r/RoastMe lmao
A potato salad
>without any makeup or anything

Really? I really thought it looked like you had makeup on.
Yeah I do feel shit about my style, like I LOVE it. But I feel like It'd work so much better if I had longer hair. I am presenting fem full time now, I absolutely cannot boymode. The only reason Im in a boy-ish T-Shirt in the first pic is because I was wearing it to bed lol
Most likely a small bit of makeup (as op mentioned in a reply to my original comment) used to contour the face will help as well. But yeah clothing is one of the most important things, since usually people see that first and assume from it. 

For example 

skirt and fitting shirt -> most people assume the person is more feminine

More loosely fitting cargo pants and hoodie -> most people lean towards the person being masculine
Exactly.
I mean I've already seen so much face changes in terms of my skin being softer (Granted LHR will be helping with that too). Like I do not think I look 28 anymore lol
;--; ♡ ♡
No problem
nom nom
im in a similar spot, youre making great progress. keep holding out, you'll get there soon!
Looove that kind of style, dont hesitate to post when you put on one of your crazier outfits, im sure it will inspire a lot of us
Stare right back at them and make them break eye contact, I've been trying this out and it's kinda amusing, although it gets awkward sometimes.
That’s so great that your areas good. Yeah I’m the opposite here haha. Fem mode is Murduring my soul and I’m trying to look andronomous (non binary here) and damn would I kill to have your hair lol. Wanna swap? 😂 you can have my feminine as heck body and face and I’ll take your beautiful ness and then we both get euphoria. I’m glad you don’t get much Greif for it :) and thanks for the top!
then absolutely!
Nope I literally rolled out of bed about 10 minutes before taking the picture xD
owo
Power move xD
Whoo! Goals achieved! I'll tell my doctor I no longer need MRT (Mayonnaise Replacement Therapy)

Am I still valid of I wasn't GNC as a young child?	I came out to my mum a couple of times, once as non-binary and the second time as a boy (once I had considered my identity better). Saying she is supportive would be an overstatment, but she isn't hostile about it. However, both times, she brought up the fact that I wasn't gender non-confirming and didn't have any idea before puberty (although I was extremely insecure about my body) like many trans kids do. Now, I do have a lot of dysphoria (and euphoria) and I'm kinda sure of my identity as a boy, but sometimes I do kinda doubt myself because of this, even though I know my mum just wants a daughter. Am I still valid?	"One thing I have found is the more I start living as a guy the more dysphoric I get about things. Like before I had a binder of course I didn't like my chest but I didn't notice it so much.vut after wearing a binder I didn't want to go out without wearing it because I noticed how my chest looked larger. And since I've chosen a new name my old name gives me more dysphoria and I am way more disconnected from it. 
It's kind of just what happens. You don't necessarily get more dysphoria you just get dysphoric from things that you have moved away from like your name which sounds so jarring when you hear it after ending called a new name for a while.
Yes. While many trans people have histories of not conforming to their assigned at birth gender throughout their childhood, it is not a steadfast rule or requirement.
Short answer: your past doesn't matter, of course that's valid

Long answer: gender conformaty varies a lot in each trans person both before & after realisation. Some figure it out really young even before puberty or are oblivious and very non-conforming. On the other extreme some are so far in denial (and possibly but not definitively internally transphobic) that they subconsciously overcorrect [e.g. transfem denial beard]. Gender non-conformity is also not exclusive to trans people [e.g. cis femboys, mascgirls, tomboys, tomgirls e.c.t.]

Simply: all that matters is how you feel now, and how sure you are of that feeling!
Almost 40 and just figuring this out. As a kid I was fairly gender conforming. In college I got into theater, dance and so forth, but there were a handful of males doing that so didn't seem out of touch. 

So no, you aren't any less valid if you didn't rebel against your gender from the get-go. Anyone saying you aren't valid, ESPECIALLY from someone that is part of the queer community, doesn't deserve an iota of energy.
*sigh*
No one knows more about your identity than you do. Anyone who says otherwise is gaslighting you.
It’s almost as if puberty changes people’s bodies in ways they don’t like, so much that they finally notice they’re trans /s. Of course you’re fine, that’s how it goes for a lot of people
Yes, you are very valid.
I was really femme as a kid, wore dresses and wanted to be like disney princesses, but yet here I am: a trans man. Gender does not equal gender expression, you can dress however you want even if it doesn't ""align"" with your gender identity.
of course you’re still valid. :)

…also i relate to this hard. when i was little i didn’t quite care what i wore, even if it was mostly feminine clothing. i also had no clue i was trans until puberty when my brain was like “somethin aint right here” (and also i fell down a rabbit hole of lgbtq stuff). i get doubt too, but hey, im a boy and i know that now even if i didn’t when i was little :)
Same, my mom always thought I was a lesbian and was surprised to hear I wanted to be a boy because she “couldn’t tell” when I was younger.
Yes. I am a Man (FTM). As a child/teen I enjoyed playing with barbies, baby dolls, liked pink, wore jewelry and even tried makeup at some point. Today I have legally changed my name/gender. Have been on testosterone for nearly 2 years. Will have top surgery soon. This is who I am without a shadow of a doubt, I am very happy about all the decisions I've made so far. :) People are all different from each other, all of us are different individuals, and our experiences & self discovery and growth aren't all equal (this goes for anything).
You are completely valid and I say that as a mother. My daughter didn’t realize that she was transgender until she was 22 years old and she had never showed any signs of gender dysphoria. Now that she is on hormones and has transitioned socially, I can see how much happier she is.
I'm a trans man who was a pageant queen as a young girl. 

You're valid af.
You are valid, you are enough, not everyone will understand, that's okay
As someone who only really figured out they were trans when they were 38, and came out after turning 40... Yes you are valid.  
GNC behaviour doesn't have to be obvious or even present at all prior to discovering it within yourself. 😊
The existence of cis gender-non-conforming people tells us very clearly that there isn't a causal relationship between being GNC and being trans. Being gender-non-conforming is only about not fitting into the arbitrary boxes that society places each gender into, not about not actually being that gender in the first place. If a cis girl loves sports and hates makeup and dresses, we don't assume she is trans - similarly, if a trans guy hates sports and loves makeup and dresses, we don't assume he is cis. Also, if that cis girl in the first example decides that she actually does like being more feminine when she's older, nobody says that she isn't allowed to do so because she was more masculine when she was younger, so why should the same be true for trans people? Societal expectations of gender roles do not in any way define your gender and they definitely aren't static and unchanging parts of your identity.
I was a bit GNC as a child, but no more so than your average tomboy cis girl. Yeah, I hated dresses and stuff, but I wouldn’t cry in them. I would just be… awkward and uncomfortable. My mom was kind of the same way when I came out.

The way I explained it to her is that I didn’t know there was any language that could describe myself back then, so I did whatever I could to fit in with everyone around me. As I was AFAB, that meant occasionally wearing feminine clothes, having long hair, mostly friends who were girls, etc. In order to fit in, I stayed (for the most part) in hobbies and activities considered ‘feminine’, even though I had always wanted to indulge in certain stuff that was ‘masculine’ (I wanted to go out for football when I was younger, and almost did, but held back because it was ‘for boys’ and so I would get made fun of or whatever). What other people gotta keep in mind is that for a lot of us, or at least for myself, I didn’t get to explore a lot of stuff that felt more genuinely me because I knew people would be weirded out or upset about it due to my AGAB.

Obviously this won’t be true for every trans person, but a lot of us didn’t have the chance to even be GNC because we were afraid of what our friends, parents, and society would do to us.

Attempting to conform, as much as I could stomach as a kid, was a survival tactic. I wasn’t trying to get bullied or hated.
Totally valid, but I totally am experiencing the same thing omfgggg
In my experience with that kind of a mom (not really supportive but not hostile) they'll make any excuse to try to convince you that you're wrong and that your identity isn't valid. My mom is like that too and I did feel that way throughout my childhood (and I told her about it then) and she just keeps thinking of new excuses. Good luck and always remember nobody but you can tell you who you are.
When I was a kid I played with my sister a lot
We would play house and all these other things

But I also liked Beyblade and I collected them and me and my sister would play with those together

I didn’t like pink, because I was told it was girly and that boys weren’t supposed to like girly things, and I didn’t want to do the wrong thing

But secretly at the time I enjoyed girly things, I just didn’t want to be seen enjoying them by others. I did very much envy them, so I got into things like Littlest Pet Shop, Monster High, My Little Pony

To this day I love Monster High

And that was how I sorta coped with it

To everyone else they only saw the me who would put up this facade of being grossed out when I was just insecure about people seeing me engage with that
Trans girl who wasn't out til her 30s here! I was such a little boy and there was no getting around it, and I didn't want it any other way, why? Cuz I didn't know! It was the 90s damn
That’s most trans people, of course it’s valid
Just because you weren't immense distress as your assigned gender, doesn't mean that transistioning won't give you immense joy, only you know what the right decision is for you. There are a lot of trans people just like you, you're not alone, you're valid ❤️
You are definitely valid. Also, this might not be the case for you but for myself and most of my trans friends we've thought that there were no signs of it at a young age before remembering a long time later.
Yes absolutely id you werent then neithee would most if us.
I've heard an interesting take on learning you're trans specifically after puberty recently. Some people are comfortable as a kid before puberty but as they transition into adulthood sometimes the transition then makes them uncomfortable. Like an amab person may be comfortable as a boy but the transition into being a man isn't quite right. Like there are afab people who are called tomboys and as they go through puberty sometimes they more comfortably transition into being a woman but as a kid they weren't as comfortable with the structured gender norm assigned to them.
""Am I va-""

""Yes.""
I think this is a stereotype that needs to go away. This idea kind of reinforces gender roles with the concept of ""okay, since you want to transition, you should fall into the stereotypes of the gender you're transitioning to."" Not all women like girly things, and not all trans women like girly things. Wanting to transition doesn't mean you're going to start to like girly things. Enjoy what you enjoy, no matter what gender you are
 I'm a gay FTM and I liked cute stuff, but was still super GNC.

Liking guys could be considered GC as ""girls like boys"" but screw that!

A guy is just someone who wants to have a banana!

 You're your own person and you don't owe your parents zilch.
I have that exaact same problem. Imposter syndrome sucks but I assure you from one man to another you are definitely valid
Absolutely. I didn't figure it out until my 20s. Prior to that? I was a full on man all the time. Every persons journey is different. Many people and GNC from a young age. Many others, like myself, dive hardcore into their AGAB. Neither is right or wrong. It just is. You keep doing you brother and tell the haters to stuff it.
i guess just think of it like you probably didnt *know* you could do that (being more gnc/boyish/etc)

i know that i spent much of my childhood trying to do what i thought i was supposed to do and only reflecting back on myself am i realising how desperate i was to feel normal via emulating what i thought was ""right""
Yes definitely!! The media likes to only display trans people who showed clear signs since very early children, and while that can definitely be further evidence of one's transness, the truth is that what happened in your past really doesn't fucking matter. If you're trans, you're trans, and NOTHING makes you invalid.

It's very infuriating when cis people and even some trans people get the idea that all trans people showed signs from their childhood, and that all the signs that can be shown are obvious and visible to the parents. Fact is, that most trans people don't show significant signs that others or even themselves can pick up on. 

So I'm conclusion, yes, you're valid, and don't you EVER fucking forget❤️☺️🏳️‍⚧️
The idea that trans people know our exact gender identity with absolute clarity in early childhood was a story devised by gatekeeping doctors in the 20th century to decide who got to transition or not. While some trans people do know and behave as their true gender from early childhood, many of us don't figure it out until much later. You're super valid, and your experience is totally normal.
yes of course
Your mom isn't the judge of your trans-ness, only you can be that. Even if you go to a therapist, the therapist will as you how you feel. Because you're the only one who knows that. Your feelings about your gender are always valid.
Yep
You are SO valid! You've come out to her twice, what does she need, a gold-embossed letter from the Queen? You're trans and even if you never thought about becoming a boy for a single second before the age of 18, (and I find that difficult to believe but whatevs, that's totally okay if you never did!) you can STILL be Trans now. I believe you when you say you are trans. Why doesn't she? She is hurting you more than you realize or are letting on. Believe in yourself, even if she doesn't. Children outgrow their parents in a lot of ways that we aren't always ready for. Stay strong, and make good plans to get yourself out of her house. <3
yeah many trans people don't realize something's wrong until puberty
Yes, you were told not to be GNC all your life, it's not your fault you listened
Oh fuck yeah its still valid. I had a full denial beard, took care of myself, looked “good.”

But that doesn’t change ANYTHING.
you are 100% valid. i growing up acted pretty much like cis boys, and i’ve only started doing more stereotypical femme things after coming out
You may just be gender fluid. Like Loki in Norse mythology. Or maybe you’re still finding the pronouns that fit your identity. Regardless, You can change the pronouns you feel comfortable with as you see fit, and there is no point where you have to “lock them in” forever.
Yes.
You are fucking valid
I had this same experience! I came out to my parents as non-binary 3 times and they only listened when I asked my therapist to tell them I was ftm. You are def valid
My parents were confused too as I didn't ""show signs as a kid"". In reality I had a lot of desires to be gender non conforming but was very compulsive rule follower even when those rules are unwritten so I never felt like I could be gender non conforming.
of course you're valid. 💕

I've just been thinking something similar 

I'm just figuring out who I am - at 38 

my mother always wanted to keep me really feminine and it set in. like, she kicked off when I cut my waist length hair into a bob when I was 20! I was always that weird girl at primary school in dresses and a tiny handbag and ribbons in my (extremely long) hair 

obviously,  I'm not trying to insult your mum (mine's passed and it was a v complicated relationship for many reasons)

I've always had thoughts about transitioning but all the time growing up, I was being taught to be a proper little girl 

having said that, I also wasn't ever even a tomboy and yeah, that makes you think, ""am I really a boy? or someone else?""

I'm just starting to discover who I am and i wish you love and luck on your journey too
Of course you’re still valid!! I used to be a bit of both as a child, I loved dressing up like a princess but I also loved dressing like a cowboy! And like another person who replied said “your past doesn’t matter!” Your gender identity can change over time! I see it as a journey not a race :) for example I identify as non binary and trans masc and it’s taken a while for me to get here. I’m sorry your mum isn’t supportive but only you can live your truth! I’m sending u so much love on your journey ❤️
I definitely relate to this, it's kinda confusing sometimes lol. Thanks for answering
Totally relate and my friends wonder why I kept going in and out of the closet for a few years. It's a lot to commitment to mentally honestly.
Thank you =)
Thank you so much. I think a big thing for me was realising that being transgender was actually something you could be, and that it was alright to be. Applying things to yourself takes some time when you were convinced you couldn't be
saving this comment since you chose to speak facts
Aha, thanks
I relate so much to that bro. Literally exactly the same for me.
I'm happy for you! I can't wait until I can reach that point in transition. Thank you (:
You sound like a good mother =) 
Thanks
Thank you! And that's quite cool, actually. (Unless you were forced into it)
<3
=)
Thank you, good luck to you too
Thank you so much! (And I did think about being a boy before 18, just not before puberty, to clarify things)  the comments and the community are really helping my confidence in who I am <33
<3 thank you so much
Thank you! It's annoying how some parents don't trust their own kids feelings, they need someone else to tell them for them to believe it
Yeahh, I get that.
>""Don't do that, it isn't for your gender.""
>""What, you like wearing these clothes? Do you want to be the other gender?""
>""You can't play with that!""

>""Why didn't you show signs as a kid??""
Thanks! I hope you can achieve whatever you decide to do in life & with yourself. Remember, we are who we know ourselves to be, not what other people say we are. Good luck, friend. :)
Thanks! It was actually really cool. Young me had a blast.
Nobody knows everything. Please give yourself a break to ponder/waffle/question, you will be valid the whole time. I love you, trust yourself.
For me nothing was even said. I just had a sense of what was expected of me as a kid and didn't dare cross that line no matter how much I wanted to.
<3 You too
Nice!
Ah, societal norms and stuff. Humans have a desire to fit in and follow the rules. It's sad how much society pushes all these limitations on little kids just trying to explore. Even if it has bad effects afterwards

Suuuuuuuper cute😍
My hair does the same thing
Don't worry hunni, 90% of the photos in this sub are posted with faceapp.
It's just that you're more honest than most.
same
FaceApp makes me look so unrealistic.
Gaaad, lovely.
Good luck with your transition ❤️. Dysphoria can hit us all hard at times.
That’s better than what FaceApp does to me 😫

Is this gender dysphoria	So im pretty much sure im trans (mtf) and whenever i look at pretty girls i always get sad and wish I could wear what they are wearing and just look like them…it really hurts	"yeah, that's dysphoria. have you talked to anyone about it yet? I would suggest doing so if it's safe
that is gender dysphoria and you are trans. you are fully trans.
Yeah :/ does the same thing when I hear my friends talk about girls things. Like it’s dumb but even when they talk about periods, I feel like I wish I could relate even if I know it’s a terrible pain
Same here…. I think this is dysphoria
Sounds like it to me. What you can try doing, is make an account (or use this one if you don’t have any irl friends or family following you) and change your name and pronouns. I did that when I was first not sure myself, and I found I really loved being called a man, and that’s how I knew for sure. 

Plus it’s a safe way to test out names too!
Yeah i would think that's dysphoria... but I haven't even transitioned.
i got that for years before i truly accepted that i was trans. ive had 2 stop watching whole tv shows because ive gotten jealous of the women in them lol. i wish u best of luck figuring urself out!!! :]
I’m sorry about that I’m in a similar situation. I hope things work out and you can wear what you want. Much love <3
Yes, absolutely.   I wish you well
Yes it sounds like gender envy which is a form of gender dysphoria
Feels pretty clear to me, though I'd recommend counciling with a gender therapist if possible.  And we've got your back, sis!
So… to go against the grain here a little bit— it could be gender dysphoria or it could just be envy. And it’s important to understand yourself and the distinction between the two. I know we all wish we could have easy, quick answers and labels to everything but we’re much more complicated than that… don’t assume you’re trans until you take the time to understand these feeling and where they might be coming from. If you truly feel like something isn’t right about yourself and how you identify both in public and privately, then perhaps you might be trans. But I really urge you to delve deep into it because it’s the only way to truly know. Simply asking on Reddit what two vague qualifiers might mean about you won’t give you the correct answer. I suggest seeing a gender therapist and also expressing yourself the way you wish you could as often as possible to get a better idea. Don’t lean on online quizzes or ask a bunch of strangers to figure out you who you are. It may take time but believe me it’s so important to really know because it will change your future one way or another. Best of luck <3
Yeah thats me too. I'm sorry. It's horrible.
Sounds like dysphoria to me.  I felt the same way.
Same and yeah thats basically the definition of gender Dysphoria
Wishing you much love and support on your journey!
Yep sure is.
Yeah I’m pretty sure that dysphoria and that’s basically how I am too.

Idk how active you are on here but r/mtf is a place I use to vent. I use it specifically because sometimes I feel like I need someone with lived experience to help out rather than my girlfriend and friends who are as new to this as I am.

Idk if you’re in college but many universities offer counseling centers with help for LGBTQ+ people among other things some are even open to the community or free of charge. Talking to someone really helps and talking to multiple people helps even more because of multiple perspectives and what not
Ik how you feel *hug* and hopefully it will get better
Textbook
Definitely sounds like dysphoria
Gender envy. My stupid ass disguised it as the horny for years lmfao. Very much dysphoria. Have a hug, sister.
Everyone is shouting that this is dysphoria but clothes do nothing to define gender and I feel people tend to forget that. You can want to and even wear the clothes that women/girls wear without having to transition. Gender dysphoria doesn't begin and end with outfits and I wouldn't want you to get in the mindset that you have to change your entire gender identity just for clothes. Wanting to be female and wanting to look female are separate things, it's a tricky thing to define for a lot of people.
That's dysphoria, alright. I'm sorry you're experiencing those feels, they're never fun to deal with. But things do get a little easier as time goes on. If it's possible in your current situation, maybe try reaching out to a professional who can help you properly?
I'm in no way an expert, but I thought dysphoria was when you actively felt uncomfortable in your body, and not the wish to have the body like someone else.

But again, not an expert. I might be completely wrong.
yes
So it might not be News seeing all the comments here already but the truth is that it could be dysphoria. In general it certainly is a sign for it however there normally is a bit more to it. Do you only feel like you would like to wear female clothes or is there more to it? That was something my therapist asked me as well in our first session. Most of the times gender dysphoria is not only liking cloths that society would deem unfitting for a boy but often it is going a lot deeper. Like your own body or mannerisms. A lot of the time if you feel like you have to put on a mask or put up a show for others that‘s a quite strong sign for dysphoria.

In any case I would recommend to look for someone to talk to like parents, friends, or (as I did it) a local lgbtq+ support group or a professional (but I guess that depends on where you live and if you have an insurance that pays for it)
Cant, transphobic parents, and people around me just arent cool with anything lgbtq+…
I see…well this sucks (the dysphoria sucks, not being trans)
I sadly have no girl friends, would love to though
I guarantee you that plenty of trans men would gift their period/uterus to you in a heartbeat. Why can’t science make this a thing?
Ive been going by she/her pronouns and a different name online for a while now, and yeah, i love it
Neither have i, im pre literally everything
Aw man that sucks, glad you accept it now though, and, thank you!
I see…well ty
Alright. Yeah don’t think its gonna be possible rn, and, ty
Yeah, that makes sense. I have been going by a different name and she/ her pronouns online for a bit now, and when my parents call me he and by my birth name it just dosent feel right. And, ty for the help
Damn
Thanks!
Ahhhh why world
Aight I’ll check it out. And i hope it gets better for you! No groups that I know of as of now though
*hug* <3
Huh?
Damn
Im so sorry for the extremely fucking late reply, but yeah it is indeed. \<3
Yeah, that’s understandable
Alright, and its good to know they get easier to deal with. Sadly not able to reach out to anyone
Fair, from what i know theres many different types of dysphoria
Theres more too it. I look at myself in the mirror and wish i had boobs and stuff like that. And yeah ive talked about it with friends (online)
oh, I'm sorry. sending you some *hugs*
I have the same situation.
You’re not alone
Been there. Is there a way you could convince them to let you try therapy for “depression”? With some sly finagling, you might be able to suggest a therapist that supports LGBTQ+ stuff.
You could try talking to a therapist. It won't solve the issue of most likely being trans with transphobic parents, but it could help you deal with it without the risk of it spiralling into dspression.
actually, I kind of feel like being trans sucks. Does somebody else feel the same? I just wish I didn't have to go through all dysphoria... I wish I were born a girl so that my life didn't have to be spent on trying to be one..

Ofc sometimes I kinda like it, like the euphoria and stuff, but honestly, being trans can be tiring as hell.
Yeah. My boyfriend keeps saying it ahah. Periods suck ass
High fives for knowing you're trans but not doing anything yet!
no problamo!! :P!!
Your welcome
I am still not transitioning (yet) and I always get bummed when I see pretty girl’s especially my friends
They mean you have textbook gender dysphoria.
No thanks for the stimuli
And before this gets a comment saying otherwise, what I'm saying isn't trying to invalidate people who are/have transitioned because they want to wear clothes stereotypically associated with another gender, it's a valid reason to transition but you don't have to transition to wear those clothes.
I'm sorry to hear. But hey, it may not be a professional setting, but you did reach out to us. You have friends here 😊
<3 :)
can i has some too :3
Thats sucks, help it gets better for you
Good to know <3
I dont know…feels like itd be risky, because if they find out what im really doing, i dont think i’l have a place to live anymore
Nah I feel this, even just being born a cis male would have been better
Yeah, i feel that.
Thanks! If i could do anything about it though i would
<3
<3
Oh
Lol what
Yay <3
<3
sure, *hugs*
You too! Thanks so much.
1. What country are you located in?
2. Are you more afraid of the gambit itself or while you’re seeing the therapist?
Oh I forgot the comma. It's supposed to be like ""No, Thank *you* for the stimuli""
1. United Kingdom
2. The gambit itself
Oof. UK. Lovely./s

Maybe not depression, because that implies an inability to self-start and could be sus when you come to them with info. Anxiety might be a better fit as a veil.

There are two solutions to your dilemma:

First: even though he was emotionally abusive, I still learned a lot from my dad. One thing was, “don’t give away the recipe.” Sometimes, you don’t need to give everything away, specify every detail for people to accept your version of events. If your parents honestly seem to care, or like to pretend they care, besides being homophobic, you can go to them and say, “hey, there’s this thing I’ve been dealing with that I don’t feel comfortable talking to you guys about yet, but I need to talk to someone. If I found a therapist, would you help me get an appointment with them?” Keep that line in the sand if they dig, don’t let them cross it. If they’re passing the bare minimum of parenting, they probably won’t try, or will give up after the second time. 

Second: Rarely does transphobia come packaged alone; I’m guessing based on your reactions that your parents are also emotionally manipulative in some manner.

What I’d recommend then, is playing your parents’ game. Make them think you need therapy before you bring it up. While you’re looking up therapists (on private/incognito browsing, be careful), start “ramping up” symptoms. This might be kinda easy, letting down your mask in certain situations. Then, when you think you’ve milked it enough and their concern is at a tipping point, pick a person that also might be concerned with your well-being, someone that loves you. Talk to them beforehand just in case your parents call thanking them or some crap like that; don’t tell them everything, just give them the low-down: “I’ve been having struggles with things that I can’t talk to my parents about yet, can I use you as an out?” And then claim that you talked to them about your struggles and got the info about the therapist from them when you talk to your parents.

Alternatively, you could do a mixture of both, or something inspired by them yet having nothing to do with it. 

Good luck in whatever you end up doing! I’m all ears if you need them during this process, kid. Stay strong.
Alright, and thank you! Man everyone on this sub is so sweet <3
We’ve been where you are.

No one can tell you you are or are not trans. Only you can do that. What someone *can* say is that your experience mirrors theirs or that of those they know. Your experience, excepting your placement on TERF island, mirrors mine. I wish you well on your journey.

too short	So guys im Kurt, a ftm trans guy, 15 yrs old. I experience chest and hips dysphoria but another problem of mine is that im 5'5ish to 5'6ish (165cm) and it makes me sick thinking about how T wont change that. I could cry about it every second. Is there anything i could do to cheat me a little taller or at least seem talller?	"I just live with my height, but here are some suggestions: platforms, shoe inserts, cutting everyones legs off, using an illusion technic to appear taller by wearing certain clothes, slightly heeled shoes, levitate.

Two of these are jokes, not telling which ones tho.
[deleted]
Just remember that Peter Dinklage is one of the best looking men alive.
you know. i’m a trans guy at around 5’4 (maybe taller with the right shoes) and honestly. things you can’t change like height and things like that don’t matter to people. i had a gf who was 5’8-5’9 and she loved the fact that i was short. i was the first short guy ever actually for her. it made me realize that some people are gonna think it’s cute that your short, others won’t. that’s just preference. i liked short girls for the longest time and then i met my ex who was 5’8 and wow i really like tall women i found out. it’s gonna be okay, there’s someone out there for you. trust me.
I’m 5’ 1 ftm :/ it sucks
6'7"" MTF here. Wanna trade?
I’ve met a trans guy who was only 4’11 and he was surprisingly chill about his height. I’m 5’3 and experience similar issues to you in that department so you’re not alone. What I do is think of my under 5 foot buddy and see how confident he is and learn from him
I did grow after only starting T at age 18(like legit days after my 18th). I’m now 171cm (yeah I know it’s not massive) but I was 167cm from like 15-18 with no change and then, bam, ended up growing 4 more cm. So I’m not saying you’ll definitely grow but I did. 

Maybe you will be lucky too?
At 15 there is a chance T might give you a boost
Shoe inserts
5'5-5'6 is actually pretty normal for men! Even at my height (5'1 & 25 y/o, which I totally feel dysphoria over, so I get you), there's a lot of cis men that are in this height range. At 15, you might still grow some too. Try to keep in mind that the average dude isn't like all the tall actors and models, and also try shoe inserts, since I know ""well there are lots of shorter cis men"" isn't actually all that helpful with height dysphoria lmao.
i’m a 5’2 trans guy who is done growing, i feel ur pain man. don’t let that take anything away from you, short men are still men.
Gary Coleman was only 4’ 8”. You’re fine!
I'm mtf and 5'6 and have been told I'm too tall to be a woman so 🤷 Can't be too short really
my dad is about 5'6 (im 5'2 rip lmao) and tbh yea hes short but hes got this \*presence\* about him that it really doesnt matter, he makes men wayyyy taller seem smaller just coz hes got that \*vibe\*

tldr get them man vibes (as a man yourself, this shouldnt be an issue) and youll be fine, no matter your height :-)
Shoe inserts probably? Or just shoes with high soles? If it makes you feel any better, Brad Pitt is 5’7” and he is considered by many a conventionally attractive man. Martin Freeman is 5’6”. RDJ is only 5’8”.
Short kings are still kings, but if it helps you feel better, get shoes with thick soles.
I’m mtf, I was only 5’6” as well. Soooo many guys are that height, it’s honestly not bad at all. Some people (including myself) prefer guys in that height range! Honestly not even that short
You’re still young so there’s a chance you could still grow a bit. Just make sure to keep a balanced diet, drink lots of water, and exercise. Absolutely make sure you’re eating enough that’s the most important part
Just move to a country with a lower height average! You are the same height as one of our (cis male, if that’s not obvious) former presidents…
I think 5’6” is about average for a guy! Plus you’re only 15, so you may still grow taller yet. Try not to worry, Kurt! You can also try shoe inserts, ones that slide into your shoe over your sole.
hey man i’m 17 and only 5’5/5’6 so ik how you feel but just know there are so many short cis guys out there too
So what I do as a ftm trans man I get shoe inserts or platform shoes
Hey Kurt I don't have any helpful advice unfortunately  but I was also self conscious of my height in school and it made me feel like shit thinking if I might never get taller.

For me being confident made me feel just as tall as every one of my classmates because it's about projecting confidence onto yourself

Working out naturally helps with confidence boosts as well
If it helps any, you're at least taller than me! (5'3"" - 5'4"" depending on the nurse's mood when they take my height lmao)
If it makes you feel better all of the cis guys in my family are the same height or shorter. 5’ 6” isn’t a short height by any means. But I get it. Height is tough and it hurts to think about. I hope things get better :)
That's not so bad! i'm 5.6 and i'm AMAB and 26 years old,  i'm transitioning to female.
You're 15, you'll probably still grow for a while, I think hormones can affect your height (I feel your pain tho, I'm a 5'2 ftm pre T)  

Love on all the short kings!
Only advice I can give walk into ever room like your 6 foot, Don't be arrogant but be confident
shoe inserts are fairly cheap online! monochrome outfits (especially bottoms and shoes) make you look taller as well as tucked shirts and short/crop jackets. Also if it helps:

 wolverine is 5'3

martine freeman is 5'6

daniel radcliffe is 5'5

 and I think that's pretty neat!
Ok hear me out  
Shoes give a surprising amount of height, when you're wearing shoes you're probably 5'8 or so  
so just add height shoe things i forgot the name of and b o o m   
I'm 5'8 and I measure about 5'10 with shoes on so that's my evidence
Max height I ever got to as amab was 5'7 only thing you can do is yoga, have good posture and possibly add some height with shoes with bigger heels but that's all you can really do. I will put it this way though since I've been that height for roughly 20 years no one cares about height so much as they care about the type of person you are.
You're my cis dad's height. And you're taller than my cis wife and my cis sister, and my cis sister in law by a good margin. And you're only 1"" shorter than me (mtf). I think you're good. Best thing about this height is that everything is pretty much designed for people of our height and ergonomics. My wife is 5'-1"" and she constantly points out things that are made too tall for her.
Sir, please try to not let your height be an insecurity 💕 If you want to cheat, get some shoe inserts or a thicker soled shoe. Also, you’re still very young. People sprout up from your age until 18+ all the time. However, if you’re worried about someone being icky to you due to height- just ingrain into your brain that they do not deserve an iota of your energy. The men and women who judge attractiveness or anything else based on height are truly too shallow for you, or anyone else. If you feel that being your height makes you any less masculine or less of a man, I promise you with all my heart and soul that height doesn’t make a man. Height doesn’t make anything, honestly. How kind are you? How compassionate? Are you a good friend? Do you love yourself? Those are the things people who are worth keeping around actually care about. You design your life, and you’re living so honest and open. Don’t let something like height, which is completely uncontrollable, be a reason you don’t feel great about yourself and your life. And seriously, short kinds are everything🥰
I’m shorter… but in honesty there are plenty of short guys and most people don’t even realize it. As people said standing straight helps make you taller. If you want, some sneakers that have a thick bottom part can also add a good half an inch. I think the best thing you can do is accept your height. It’s not as short as you may think at the moment.
Ah dude, I *wish* I could be that tall. I'm 5' and it sucks. I'd need literal stilts to be on cis male level.
A camera that electrocutes everyone else in the photo to make you the tallest.
fwiw I'm amab and 5'6"" even, def on the short side but it's not that uncommon a height. knew a few cis guys that height or shorter
Remember that Prince was 5'2"" and he rocked it!
I’m a 5’0 (152 cm I think?) trans guy, and I used to haaaate my height. I hated it so much, especially because people would be really shitty about it. I’m 19 now, not an inch taller, and I love my height. After T, my voice dropped, I got top surgery and I look much more like what I see myself as (as well as buying platformer boots bc they’re badass), my height really doesn’t matter. I know you’ll get there soon! Especially bc you’re really not that short.
Dude I’m 5’2 and my current solution is just stealing everybody’s knee caps and just adding them to my legs. I am slowly working my way up to god tier height.
Im amab, and I'm 5'5 and older than you,
I know this isn't advice and it probably wont help but i still hope it does? <3
I’m 5’2” and so are tons of cis men. Prince was 5’2” and he was the baddest!
As a MtF who is 6ft 5in, I get it and understand why it feels awful, but you cant change it, so own it!
I'm a trans woman and you're slightly taller than me, even though I'm also older than you lol
5’6” actually isn’t that short. Maybe a little below average, but I know plenty of guys that height. It’s not uncommon.
My cis male boyfriend is 5'4, and so am I. There's some guys at my school who are shorter than that.

Don't worry. You're just a short guy. It doesn't make you stand out
I’m a 22 yr old ftm guy at a whopping 4’11”. I get mistaken for a little boy far more than I do a woman now so it’s an improvement but I get ID’d everywhere I go. 
On the plus side I’m into tall women. All women are tall when they are next to me. Gotta enjoy the little things so to speak.
Protip: make a bunch of shorter friends. The cis guys I lift with are 50/50 my height or shorter
Become Michel Reeves, he has a very special camera to help
I'm 17 and 5 foot due to a mix of genetics and disability. I don't have advice but as an alt person, platforms work :)
There are plenty cis men as short or shorter than you. Not everyone is going to be 6'4"" and that's fine. There are men's shoes that can covertly get you an inch or so but I know you will rock with your height.
Short king summer dude :D
You’re taller than me. I’m in my 30s and 5’3
Posture and confidence, even fake confidence. I’m 5’0 and nobody believes me until they actually look and evaluate my height. My professor once told me, “well you don’t ACT 5’0” when he finally realized.

Confidence (faked or real)>>>
My best friend's brother is 165, and he's a man.  
My cisgendered colleague is 162, and he's a still a man!  
So are you. Men don't need to be 180 or more.  


You can't really make yourself taller... Maybe some soles, or stuff like that, but there's no shame to being ""short"", dude.  
If you do feel the need to look more manly... Well.. Hit the gym I guess? Like my colleague. He may be 162, but damn is he ripped. That guy would be scaring the fuck out of people if he was 20 cm taller. He's a ""small"" mass of muscles, and he gets the girls, he's respected... He's just a short man.   


I know how it can feel. I'm a rather masculine looking trans woman, so sometimes it hurts to look at myself, but-.. I'm still a woman in my mind. Don't beat yourself over it. I always try to remember another colleague of mine... 180 broad shouldered cis woman... And she's still a woman even if she can pick me up and toss me 5 meters away.  


And ladies/gents can find it to their likings too! You'll do just fine. Stay strong buddy.
I know this isn't an answer to the question you asked, and I know from experience that this sort of rationale isn't always useful, but not all men are between 5'10'' and 6''. I'm AMAB and I'm 5'4'', my brother is 5'5'', and my dad is 5'3''. I know at least as many guys in the 5'4''-5'6'' range as I know around the 6'' mark. Some people are just shorter, regardless of gender, and that's okay.
Drink milk
5’6 transmasc here on T, most people assume I’m a dude and honestly I come across so many guys who are shorter than me and no one really notices my height. Since you are looking for tips though to make yourself seem taller be sure to work on your posture. Bad postures the number one thing that’ll make you seem shorter than you are. Depending on your style you can always get men’s dress shoes that’ll have a bit of a heel like oxfords or if you’re a sneaker person just look for ones that have a thicker sole. If you pick something reasonable no one notices the extra help, best of luck though and I hope you find what you’re looking for!
Hi, my cis husband is 5’7”! You might also not be done growing yet!
I don’t give a shit about height BUT do have a lot of back pain and relatively mild scoliosis (20° curvature) and have been using one of those spinning back massagers every night for a couple years now (“Zyllion Shiatsu Back and Neck Massager - 3D Kneading Massage Pillow with Heat and 8 Rotating Nodes for Muscle Pain Relief, Office, Chair and Car - Black (ZMA-25)” apparently) and recently a at the doctor’s office they measured me and insisted I’m 5’7” now?? I’ve been 5’5” for ages, but I guess working out some knots helped me be more symmetric. I stretch every weekday before work, too, just the basic stretches I remember from gym class and track practice. Mostly because of back pain and hoping to avoid injury, but it probably helps me stand more upright and definitely helps me stand more comfortably.
C H O N K Y boots. I'm 5'6 as well, I just wear big ol' stompy platform boots. idk if they make me that much taller, but they make me feel taller (and they're fun to walk in lol)
I’m 31, amab, and also 5’6.  I’m not fully presenting as feminine yet, and I’ll go as far as to say that I look manly.  You can be short and still be manly.  However, you can find boots with thick soles to add to your height if you need to.  Confidence goes a long way.  Hold your head up high, don’t worry about your height, and taking that extra weight off of your shoulders will help you stand taller.
5’5 is fine. I’m 5ft…it’s all about confidence
You’re only 15, right? You are still young, who says that you are done growing? Especially if you start taking T at 18. You, my little bro, still have a chance to grow and change. Me, on the other hand, I won’t be able to change my skeletal structure because I’m old, compared to you, at 35(36 in August). Don’t put yourself down, there are those who like smaller guys! Keep your chin up my guy.
Peace bro!
Lucian
been the same height since i was 12, 5’3. It used to bother me a lot, what didn’t help us that my brother is 6’0 and still growing. i’ve begun to like my height tho, i notice a lot of shorter cis guys and many of them are quite muscular, they’re like a short wall of muscle lol. that body type/physique has started to appeal to me and idk if it’s a gay thing or gender envy but oh well
When are you starting T? I started at 20 and grew an inch, so if you’re starting pretty soon you might still be able to eek out a couple centimeters. Obviously don’t count on it and don’t base your decision to take T only on it if you wouldn’t otherwise want to hormonally transition, but just so you know.
This was a major problem for me (5' 1"", about 154cm) before taking T. A lot of the proportions evened out, and I found that the change in voice and facial hair has mattered so much more to proper gendering and dysphoria than height and curves. Being a bit shorter I also end up looking more ""beefy""/muscular, so it ends up helping masculine presentation. As time goes on I get less dysphoria for hips and basically none for height anymore, particularly since I've noticed how many (probably) cis guys are about my height.
honestly mate most of my cis male friends are around that height if not smaller and i know another ftm who’s like 5’ and they pass as a cis guy so personally i don’t think there’s anything to worry about but if you wanted add a couple inches first there’s obviously wearing platforms but theres also a surgery in some country probably sweden or switzerland where they can make you up to 5’ taller
My cis brother is 25 and 5'4"" don't worry about height. Just carry yourself big and take up space. Being confident is key. If you want, you can wear platform shoes, I'm partial to Converse.
There’s plenty of short cis guys, and plenty of short trans guys that pass very well (if that’s something that’s important to you). I knew a few  cis guys in college that were shorter than me (I’m 5’7, but I was a bit shorter at the time). Unfortunately everyone has insecurities, and unfortunately insecurities often become worse when paired with dysphoria
Casually a ftm who's 4,11
If it makes you feel any better that is taller than my dad
Good posture, boots
oh no, i’m so sorry. i know how you feel, i personally haven’t gotten any surgery yet, and i’m 5ft with no hope of growing. you’re not alone
If it makes you feel any better I have a cis male friend who is 4'11 at 16
I'm 5'1 and my height was a major source of insecurity for me early on in my transition. Still is a bit of a sensitive spot for me. My way of coping was starting a sport and going to the gym. Learn how to use your size to your advantage.

No one gives you shit for being small when you can invert a chinup into a handstand. I'm still not intimidating, but it helps my confidence to know if someone tries to make an example out of me to boost their own stupid ego I can put them flat on their face.
I know there are shoes that are designed to secretly give you a few extra inches in height without looking like thick platform shoes
I don’t know how right I am, but everyone has the opportunity to express their opinion and I’ll probably use it.  Try working with a therapist about self-acceptance and self-love.  Hah, I understand you, I would like to be taller, but firstly, you have a margin of time, I will not grow up.  Secondly, even if this does not happen, it is not your height that makes you a good guy or not.  There are many actors for example who are not tall and are successful in their work and personal lives.  Believe me, even if you do not grow up, it is not fatal, it is not necessary and the main value in life.  Perhaps this is very important for you, but I admitted to myself that I had a complex and I accepted it, I accepted that I could not become taller.  It seems like height makes you successful and etc., but that's not quite the whole truth.
165cm Trans guy here too, but I have no chance to grow as I’m turning 19 too and still haven’t been able to start hormones. Most people in my country are taller than me, even women, but I always just think that there are also short guys and I will feel better when I’m at least more masc on hormones.
I'm also a trans guy and also 15 (almost 16) and I'm 1,59m... I really hope that I'll get a growth spurt in the next few years...!
I'm 5'3"" and NB genderfluid, AMAB. I used to be self-conscious but eventually got over it. All heights are beautiful.
I'm MTF and presented male while being 5'7"". No one ever told me I was less of a man due to my height (but there were other reasons given).
I have height increasing shoes to give me more confidence. I go from 5'4 to 5'6 or 5'7 and it makes me feel a lot better.
I shop tallmenshoes dot com, but I know their stuff can be a bit pricey. There are other options like height increasing shoe inserts that are cheaper as well.

While these will not obviously make you taller when you take them off, they help me when I go out and do social things. Just a bit of a boost. I wear my regular shoes when height isn't a issue for me, and the tall shoes when I want to look good on a night out. I got three different styles of shoes to pick from.

Another thing that helps is dressing nice. While it won't make you taller, looking good and having confidence really does trick people into thinking you are taller. I have trouble dressing well, but my confidence always makes people shocked to find out I'm shorter than they expected when I tell them my height .
There's Nothing wrong with being a short king.
I'm 5'9"". Wanna trade height?
Can we... Trade?
I used to wear boots, especially the cowboy variety to give me a little extra height. Also, hairstyles that push your hair up on the top can help too.
Wait wait I'm that height and I'm a fully grown transfem
You're taller than Charles Manson so there's that
hi i'm also a trans guy, 5' 2"" here 😀👍
i wear my platform converse every day lmao & surround myself w ppl that validate my gender
jealous of you tbh. lots of guys are that height.
I vaguely remember being your age. mtf here.  Similar issues but the other way around. Boys and Girls alike flock to a small stature guy.  Pete H was like 4'8 and a skater. He was a player with a capital P.  Everyone liked him because he was genuine and a solid friend. He had our backs and the whole school would have walked through fire to be there for him too. 
To borrow from a truly great human being....
Just not by the physical manifestation of the soul before you.  Judge by the radiance of that soul and the lives they have touched. 
I remember every feature of Pete's face 20 years later and still remember how his hugs felt and how he always smelled like  vanilla because he bought a special soap for his sensitive skin. He is one of the fondest memories I hold from my high school days. 
I'm also going to say that if you are a solid human,  people will say something similar.
And i am too tall 😢 i am mtf 5'9"" it's like very tall
I'm mtf and 5'7. I personally don't think 5'5 is too bad. I was stuck there until like 16. But if it bothers you that much try platform shoes
Stretch on your tiptoes and your arms up as much as you can, at least ten times a day.
i’m 19 years old and i’m 152cm (just 5’0). height is something i always struggle with and it is something that’s very difficult. i wear 4cm insoles in my shoes to 9 hour shifts in a retail store and come home with achingly sore feet and blisters all over. 
i want to reassure you that there are many trans and cis men that are shorter and becoming comfortable and confident in that is sadly a process that takes time.
you will get there! looking at platform shoes or insoles is always an option to make you feel more confident in the meantime.
sending you lots of support in your journey going forward :))
""Dad shoes"" would be my best bet. Old school Adidas, Nike, and other ""masculine"" brands tend to have more padding inside the shoe itself, thus making whoever wears them a little taller. Hell, even thick socks can provide a little height (speaking from experience here.) Hope this helps, good luck Kurt!
 I'm 5'10 but I appear around 6'1 because I have massive insoles for my super flat feet that give me an extra 2.5 ish inches. I'm mtf so I try to get the thinest soled shoes I can :(, but with insoles and a thicker sole shoe you can probably gain quite a few inches.

 Idk if you are into athletic shoes or not but Hoka makes a great running shoe with a solid 2-2.5 inch sole, and you can layer insoles in your shoes. I probably wouldn't go over 2 insoles tho because it can get a little loose.

Hope it helps!
Amab here, I'm 5'5"", don't worry about it at all you're pretty close to an average height
I’m exactly your height and honestly, I own it. I’ve embraced the short king status. I’ve always been attracted to shorter men and I know I’m not alone in that. 

Also, YMMV depending on the population where you live, but look around you, honestly, most cis men aren’t anywhere near 6 feet. I ride public transit and I constantly see guys who are within an inch or two of my height in both directions. It’s really really normal for cis dudes to be 5’5” too. 

I’m not trying to discount your height dysphoria, I just want to put it out there that short guys are awesome :)
You're 15, there's still a chance for little growth, talking a centimeter or three. Platform shoes could be good, also avoiding knee high socks and boots, not wearing horizontal stripes, even better wearing vertical stripes. I know it's hard but try not to worry about yoir height as much, 165 cm is a very normal height for men and appearing confident goes really far in influencing people's perception of you. Like if you check out [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-of-men-for-selected-countries?tab=table](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-of-men-for-selected-countries?tab=table) you can see there are exactly 20 countries where your height is above avarage .
Like half the cis guys I know are 5'8, one of thems even 5'2, it's not a major deal for most people, it's only because of the fact you're a trans guy that you even care about it
I'm transfem and I'm the same height in foots but somehow 10 cm taller? Idk who's whrong but I feel you, but the opposite, I feel I'm too tall
I'm transfem and I'm the same height in foots but somehow 10 cm taller? Idk who's whrong but I feel you, but the opposite, I feel I'm too tall
Well you are 15 and in theory you can grow until 21. Me and a friend of mine both were small with 15 and in a few years he was close to 1,80m don’t ask me how. I was okay with being short but even i grew I’m About 1,73m now and 23 y/o should say that I’m a trans woman and I’m on hrt since nearly 4 years now
Ngl I’m AMAB and I ended up 5’5 myself, this probably isn’t super helpful but there are a lot of really short cis men out there
platforms, high waisted long fitted pants make me look a bit taller but it doesn't work for everyone, shoe inserts, very tall hair.. idk man.

I used to have really bad height dysphoria, breaking down almost every night over it, randomly completely disappeared a few weeks ago however after realizing like the most attractive guy I've ever seen is also pretty short.. which somehow just deleted all that dysphoria for some weird reason (idk how that even works considering everyone was always like ""no its fine loads of guys are short"" and id still get dysphoria so.. idk shits weird)
Yeah- I’m kinda the same dude. Luckily I’m gonna get to 5’8 which isn’t to bad but I do get A lot of dysphoria from my height rn (abt 5’6 or 5’7) so I just do my best to appear taller. I usually wear shoes with a little bit of height and I make sure to keep my posture straight when I’m around people. Plus there’s some stretching you can do to reach kind of your full height. Also I’m not for sure on this but I heard that taking hormone blockers could make you taller-? Cause it kinda like blocks your testosterone and estrogen I think and taking either of those at a younger age would stunt your growth. Again not 100% on that but I hope it’s true- lmao. Hopefully any of that helps?

In spanish , sry 4 that.

Soy mujer trans , mido 1.73 , mi talle de zapato es 43 (13 woman) y mi espalda es ancha , mi nariz no es la mejor y no tengo un vientre plano como deseo , mis pechos no crecieron como yo quiero , mi pelo cambio mucho peor no tanto ... Como yo quiero... En pocas palabras paso muy poco de lo q yo quiero...

Entonces en medio de este problema , está dramática guerra interna q vivimos las personas trans y no trans , me encontré siendo egoísta y estúpid* conmigo misma 

De a poco aprendí a quererme , empecé a valorarme a medida q veía el proceso , no era el q quería pero entendí q era el q tenía y que de dónde estaba a dónde estoy .. si , cambie mucho y a partir de ahí todo fue creciendo y mejorando 

Hoy , todo lo q te mencioné al principio son parte de mi y amo mis formas , doy gracias por ser tan bonita y diferente al resto , por no encajar en lo q los demás quieren y sobre todo soy gracias por ser autosuficiente y no depender de la aceptación ajena 

Cosas q se aprenden , que son importantes y que ... Si , duelen aceptar pero cuando encontras el amor propio , creeme .. ahí es donde de verdad empezas a disfrutar el viaje. 

Espero q te halla servido de algo mi experiencia , se q es en español , pero soy muy mala con el inglés y era difícil hacer esto en otro idioma , palabras muy puntuales 


Te deseo lo mejor y mucha suerte
Wear clothes that fit you :) I’m 148cm yes, so I’m even smaller with being 25+ years old, I know I won’t grow anymore. Something I’ve noticed that I always do is wear clothes that are waaaay too large for me cuz if the dysphoria and not wanting my chest to be seen. I just tried trans tape out and I’m using it in summer with clothes that fit me and I look taller because it doesn’t look like I’m wearing stuff that isn’t supposed to fit me.
My boyfriend is also 15 and cis and he's shorter than you, my class teacher is also like 160-5 cm so don't worry
My dude. I was about your height when I was 15. I'm about 180cm now, aged 18. Things can change
i’m 5’2 buddy. shoe lifts is your best bet, sole inserts that can add height. other than that, you still have a bit more growing to do, but it’s not gonna be of much significant unless you hit a magnificent growth spurt. it’s just our reality, best to make peace with it sooner rather than later, height doesn’t mean anything
You're taller than both me and my grandfather (who's been his current height his entire adult life.) You aren't too short. A lot of cis guys are significantly shorter than 5'6. While height is correlated with sex at birth, it definitely isn't as much of an indicator as people think.

If it really bothers you, shoe inserts are always usable, or just wear platform shoes.
I'm 5'2, 140 pounds, and about 8 months on T. You can do it my guy, keep on pushing. you are currently at the hardest point, after this initial hill, it all soft sand from here.
I'm a 6'2 trans woman, so I understand the fixation with height. What we need to understand, is that people of all genders come in every shape and size. We're still valid, even though we may feel like our sizes don't help us fit in as easy as we'd like. I ""compensate"" by wearing wedges and heels. If I'm gonna be tall, I'm gonna be TALL lol. I know plenty of shorter guys that are also very masculine. Plus, think of it this way; if you're having symptoms of ""little man syndrome"", try to re-frame it in your mind with a positive spin. Only guys get little man syndrome. Think of it as being affirming, and you can take the power back. Stand tall and proud my dude. You're just perfect the way you are!
i'm only 5'1"" and i started low dose T at 20, so i get no extra height. it really just helps that there are plenty of cis guys who are around my height or shorter than me, so i feel like i kinda fit in.
I'm also a trans guy and I'm 3 inches shorter than you and have cis friends that I'm the same height as
Being short happens. Just accept it
I feel you, man, I’m about the same height and it is a pain in the ass a lot of the time. I’ve found that the best way to get around it is to befriend a short cis guy, I am also lucky enough to be taller than my dad by about an inch.
Im mtf, and im 5'5"". Short guys sure do exist! Dont worry too much about your height
You’re actually not that short (to me) plus your a teenager so you’ll grown maybe 2 inches more if your genes like you. Just know your not done growing yet! I’m 20 and 5 foot so i understand the dreading of being a very short man
Id say u could wear big sneakers too get some cm, and there is lot of short men so dont be too concerned abt that
I think 15 is still really young - you might grow a bit more. Also, do not take me up on this, as I dont really have my sources, but maybe its a good idea to do some research - I think I heard of stories where people grew a bit on T if they started taking it young enough
Some shoes can extend your height, I personally have the exact opposite problem MTF and too tall (5'7 predicted to be 5'9 ish)
dude, you're taller than me, and I'm a cis guy.

idk if that helps
Your nit too short at all im amab and im like 169-170 so its really not too short its actually pretty normal unless you live in norway lol
5'6 is average for a 15 year old boy!

&#x200B;

I don't really know how to help with this, you could try getting shoes that give you an extra 1-2 inches in height, thats probably the only advice i could give.

&#x200B;

you can take the lower half of my legs and stick them on to the bottom of yours if you want- i'm 5'11-6'2 so if you did, you'd be getting an extra 12-13 inches in height maybe
That’s an amazing height!! You may worry but if it helps in any way, some of the most powerful men to ever live have been your height or shorter. Lenin, Khrushchev, Genghis Khan, Yuri Gagarin, Victor Emmanuel III. It may not be any help but I just hope that knowing how 165 is a completely normal male height through some examples will help a bit :)
Why are all trans guys who complain about this always 160+ anyway, cmon youre not that short
164cm here, and I see guys pretty much every day who are just slightly taller than me or even shorter! Sometimes I worry about it, but if I get started on T, get my voice lower and get a little facial hair going, I'm sure nobody will even think about it, and if so it'll probably just be one of those things that your friends make light-hearted jokes about.
I'm 5'4 and in my 30s. Surprisingly few people care that I'm short.
I'm 5'6 or 5'7 FTM! My height doesn't bother me too much since I know there's plenty of other short kings out there (Hell, one of my older brothers is 30 and I've been taller than him for like four years now) but I got this one pair of sneakers that puts like, an extra inch on me too and it boosts my confidence.
I’m mtf with a similar problem exept I’m too tall
There's no such thing as too short but as an ftm 5'2 person myself I do get the feels. I've found that pin stripe trousers that are the right length for you, ending right at your foot when you're stood up help make you look a little taller (if you wear a lot of smart type things, I wear suits for work), I also match those with chunky soled smart-ish boots to add some actual height and a tucked in shirt cause that makes your legs look longer.

Hope that's helpful! 
And remember guys come in all heights cis and trans alike. My dad is 5'4 and my partner is 5'8, both cis men.
I am 4'9 and I'm 30 years old. I'm not growing any taller. But believe me I've seen cis dudes that short as well. We put the standard for us trans guys way too high. It's ok to be a short man.
Hi... I'm taller than my boyfriend, he's a cis man and is exactly as tall as you.... Height doesn't necessarily mean manhood.... To my eyes he is 35 meters higher than any other man I've been with... I hope my experience can be helpful to you.. a huge hug❤️
yeah as a 5'3 trans dude i can relate. i just stick to the usual tricks while trying to learn to live with it. you know, shoe inserts, smart clothing choices, wearing shoes with thick heels etc.
I know how you feel man,  i’m a 16 ftm guy and am only about 5’5-7. The thing i usually try to do is wear high-top shoes or some type of heeled boots. My personal favorite are Doc Martins boots, You could also try shoe inserts if you wanted. Much luck to you my friend.
I’m like 5’2 or 5’3 and I’m 21 so that ain’t changing. I always remember a cis guy I went to school with who was my height. Doesn’t completely take away the dysphoria but it helps to remember there’s cis guys out there that are our height
Oh boy, I'm 19 and only 151 cm. Don't worry, you can still grow a little bit 👍🏻😉
Hey man. I feel your pain, I'm a trans guy and I am 5'1...
Most guys are short anyways 5’6 isn’t that short tho
So I'm 5'2 and have pretty bad height dysphoria too. I used to use some shoe inserts in Doc Martins because they also tend to give you about an inch. Unfortunately, they hurt my feet so bad I can't wear them anymore (wore them for work) so my honest advice is to try and look at other men who are famous and around your height. But now that my voice deepened on T, I have relatively few problems passing at all, even with my height. Hope this helps!
as a 5’5 trans girl i actually adore and prefer guys near my height or shorter <3
You a shouldn’t worry about your height, there are so many guys who are shorter then you , I know cause I’m only 5’2”. I’m m2f now but being short is nothing to worry about. Just be yourself and people won’t even notice your height.
hey atleast the crotch punch is more effective lol

also that aint bad, just get some hugs from tall girls lol
Well as a fellow ftm I do look for same height/shorter cis guys and let me tell you that there are plenty at my school alone and being in last grade of high school there's not that much more height for anyone to get(I'm 169cm btw(yes I know and no it's not a joke)) so yeah you're a tiny little bit shorter that average
Well idk if this makes you feel better but 1. I'm pretty sure you can still grow a little taller, it happens and you're still young and 2. The average height is 5' 9 (at least in America sorry to assume) so you're really not far off. I'm afab and I'm taller than some of my guy friends. It isn't wrong to want to be taller, same, but remember: people come in all sizes so don't worry too much about seeming short to *other people* because people mostly will analyze your height based off of themselves if that makes sense. But anyway platforms are cool if you like them, they don't have to be super obvious! there's also shoes with a hidden platform. even if you wear big stompers it's fashion and height.
Dont worry, Im a 15yo 5""6 trans guy too and im still taller than my cis uncle. Height starts to seem trivial as you get older. You'll get through it my guy. As for recs maybe some show inserts that add height? or tall soled shoes in general? Also, Ive heard wearing black makes you seem taller and slimmer and hides your chest better too. When shopping for pants, straight legged work better because they taper down to your ankles and hide your hips especially when paired with a baggy tshirt that goes over them. Basketball shorts work too! Gl!!
*starts levitating* thanks bro
No but fr thy for the advice :)
Kinda similarly, depending on the style you are going for: cowboy boots often have a heel, and if you're into hardcore punk, engineers boots can have pretty big heels as well.  Platforms have a bit of a certain look to them that can be flashy but heeled boots can be a bit more subtle.
The leg-cutting has been working wonders! I'm now the tallest in my class, even taller than most teachers! It's a nice feeling, 10/10 would recommend.
You forgot gravity inversion.
Nothing will make you taller than confidence. You are rad!
Thx for the advice and your support :>
i couldnt agree more with this, as a teen (also age 15) i cared way too much about height; im 169cm and taller than a good number of guys.

height does not make a man, action does; thats how i adjusted myself xD (with more behind that statement, but its true nonetheless)
I'm 5'0 and I unfortunately realize I cannot grow anymore as I'm 18
seconding the confidence advice- when i started T everyone was convinced i grew an inch even though by growth plates were def closed by the age of 23 lol. the only plausible conclusion is the confidence and the joy i felt from T. I carry myself different now and i feel more whole. made me taller and ive never felt healthier!!
I'll add shoulders back and relaxed down from your ears
Yeah at my school there is a cic guy who is 4.3 (8th grade btw)
wow i’ve never thought about that but you fucking right
For real, and he has great voice!
i love your username.
me too!
I am also 5,1”. It’s painful :’) but when I see lots of guys shorter than me or the same height, it makes me feel better to know I may not look as bad as I do in my head.
i'll take like 10 inches if you don't mind
If you cut in line in front of my 6'11"" ass....
You’re making my 6’5 ass feel short! ;)
Gimme
Same.. And I'm also a vegan commie 😳
I’m 4,9 💀
Im 5'2"" and how I see it is that it's not something that can be changed (within reason) so either be chill about it or be sad forever

and anyways, I see cis men shorter than me all the time at the grocery stores
Oo that would be so cool, thy :)
Ooo that would be cool
Thx for the advice :D
Oh im sorry for people telling you this :(
Thy :))
Ye thx :D
Thy for the tips :> imma try those shoe inserts :D
Ye that sounds like a good idea
Yay :D thx
Thy :)
Thy for your help :D
Thx for your help <3
Thx for the help :D
Damn thats a really good idea imma try that :0
Im bad at helping people
Thx for the advice imma try to be confident :D
Thy for your help :D
Oh and maybe get gifts, I'm also 15 and i used to think that gifts would make me grow faster because i got em alot on holidays and birthdays and stuff and i was growing really fast at the time (i also ate ALOT at the time) now I'm 5""9, 5""10 ish (1,75 cm) and I'm obssessed with growing because i don't think I'm tall enough.
Thx for the advice :DD
Haha thx 💪💅
Ye sure ;>
No you’re good lol my sister is 5’10 and she loves it lol. She even wears heels to be even taller! Tall girls rock. Own it :)
Its not too tall :3 one of my mums friends is 6'1 and she slays hard :)
Thy for the advice :D
Thy for the help :D
Honestly any shoes that are higher (so not low cut like vans and such) but stuff like boots or high tops… pretty much anything that you’d be able to put orthotics in would give you the space to put a heel insert in them to boost you a couple inches. A lot of short cis guys do this (my dad used to lol) so there’s no shame in it. Optical illusions are great too. Vertical stripes make you look taller and horizontal stripes will make you look wider. 

You may also find you’ll feel more comfortable with your height as you go through your transition and the other dysphorias start to disappear. I did. I’m about your height and my brother is 3 years younger than me but is a foot taller than me and it sucks always having people assume I’m the younger one because I’m shorter but it’s gotten easier over time cuz I don’t hate every other aspect about myself anymore. Idk I guess it’s just easier to let something go when it’s just the one thing rather than one thing adding to a pile of other things. I won’t lie, it’s gonna be hard over the next couple years cuz you’re probably done growing but all the cis guys your age are gonna sprout but you’ll get through it. You’ve got this. And if all else fails, make lots of short friends to make yourself look tall
Oh yes i love cobowy boots, they make me feel like im murdoc niccals
I'm 6'2, wanna swap Hights???
He may be small but he has the personality of a King.
😳
Hahah I thought I was probably the only 6'7"" trans vegan commie lol.
masculinity and the self-empowerment we as men can feel from it isnt just stemmed from looks, whether through genetics or self-stylisation

""I am Man"", is enough :-)
Doc martens have a beefy base but don’t look like it btw
Dont say that :( your comment really helped me
Oii thank you for that!
But you know short girls are cute. And i wanna be cute :(
Yes please
that’s so true peter dinklage is honestly one of my favorite actors he’s so good, and honestly even as a lesbian my god that man is attractive
They are a dozen of us!! Maybe!!

Also I'm more like 6'6'' but hope it still counts
Omg of course!! :D
Yeah id say that counts  😊."	vcdt58	trans	387	0.97	2022-06-14 21:15:01
HOW MANY LIVES DID YOU JUST TAKE?!	"Most of the time I want to have a cute high-pitched girly voice. I don't think that it's some kind of revelation.

But sometimes... Sometimes I play Batman games, watch Batman movies and cartoons, and then spend my time shouting things like ""I'm vengeance! I'm the night! I'm Batman!"" or ""Where's the detonator?!"", ""How many lives did you just take?!"", etc. And I enjoy doing Batman impression. It's fun.

Even though I can feel somewhat dysphoric because of that. But it's not the same kind of dysphoria as with my regular voice. Like, I don't like my regular voice, so I feel dysphoric. And I like my Batman voice, but... still feel dysphoric. How does it work?

And I don't what else to say. Does anyone else have this kind of problem?"	"I do this a lot too haha. I'm a huge RvB fan and used to constantly quote the show. They seriously have a line for just about every situation in life.

One of the funniest things, for me, is doing a Batman voice but just saying mundane things like: ""Alfred, I'm depressed."" or some random shit like that. 

I think my humor is broken lmao
Yes, I want to sound like Geralt and Yennefer at the same time.
voice bad, impressions fun
YES I ALSO HAVE THIS.

I've trained my voice to be higher (still working on it amd making slow progress) but occasionally I'll just be messing around or some bs and I'll do a really (like super low) low voice and everyone just stares at me like wtf
I have the reverse problem. I’m trying to get a low voice, but when I found out I was a soprano my last year of choir, I had fun hitting those notes. I think everyone’s total vocal range is a lot broader than what we normally use to speak, though. If you train yours well, maybe you can reach a naturally high-pitched voice while keeping that impression near the end of your range
I like to sing along with metal songs, this also causes a little bit of dysphoria. It's weird how these things we've enjoyed become hard to reconcile with our identities.
I feel... Something similar about my voice... Like, I have a super deep voice by default, and I love it, I love having it, it doesn't causes me disphoria at all... What causes me disphoria is not having a high pitched, delicate voice... I literally cannot meet my internet friends over voice chat because they'll think I'm just an effeminate dude TT~TT 

A little bit contrary? Sure it is... May voice training solve the problem? Yeah, most probably... Why haven't I started yet? Easy, it's really hard stuff and procrastination is strong in this one x.x 

^(help pls ;u;)
I do the opposite lol. I used to be able to sing soprano but with voice training I am trying to lower my usual voice . But technically I can still go high. I can remember doing like anime school girl voices and feeling horribly disphoric but laughing anyways cus I am capable of doing it well and it was funny
Yeah but in reverse because I’m transmasc - sometimes when I’m singing along to a song and I’ll have a moment where I just hear myself clearly all of a sudden and be like, uhh why is my voice so high even though I enjoy it and it feel different to just regular talking voice dysphoria for some inexplicable reason. Doesn’t stop me though, and if you think about it I bet there’s loads of cis girls who love doing Batman impressions too :)
I've seen some vocally passing transwomen have fun doing full on viking metal roars from the back of their throat.  Cis girls do it too  https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-for-a-cis-female-metal-singer-to-scream-growl-like-a-cis-male-metal-singer-What-I-mean-is-when-a-female-metal-singer-screams-can-you-tell-if-they-re-female-without-looking-at-them-Is-that-always-the
Yes. Sometimes i’ll drop out of my fem voice and just see how deep i can go or just impersonate super heros or whatever. I have yet to do it near my bf as i can imagine it’d make him uncomfortable.
Me: I hate my ugly man voice, I wanna sing like girl!

Also me: I AM A DWARF AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE!
DIGGY DIGGY HOLE! DIGGY DIGGY HOLE!
Sounds like you would have fun with some form of acting as a way to express, experiment, and learn more about yourself. I hail from the land of musical theatre and have had a lot of confusing feelings about playing a character that's societally viewed as masculine while being trans. Though I've only performed as male presenting or androgynous... I came out during the pandemic so I haven't been back on stage yet. Partly because its just terrifying and I'm rusty... But also because of the dysphoric feelings and I'm scared about how people might view me. Though I'm feeling very excited about getting into voice acting, it's a dream to voice animation and video games and I think trans folk could dominate in that world.

Something that does make me feel better is that I know cis girls who can sing lower than me 😂 Sometimes I sing alto and they take tenor. The voice is affected by our puberty and hormones in a defining way, but when you start playing... the voice is truly boundless. Any human can potentially make any sound. Takes work!! And time to free things up, but I say try and lean into the fun and the expression and maybe you'll end up working through some vocal baggage, and end up feeling euphoric while making any sound you want.
It's the same for me. But I still get hecking dysphoric because my impressions sound like a dude and I don't want them to sound like that... Uuuugh
I've gotten my voice fairly feminized yet I can still sing metal in an alarmingly close impression of Jonathan Young. You get used to it. In fact, with impressions, you'll probably start to like that you can do them more than hate their masculinity.
My vocal range is probably wider than the Grand Canyon
I have something similar, I love singing and I have a great bass register. I see my singing voice as another instrument that I've learned, it's separate from my speaking voice.
can relate, I wish my voice was more fem and cute.

But I love to do a Dio (from Jojo's) voice sometimes but it makes me dysphoric but also not the same kind of dysphoric as my regular voice same thing for other characters.

I think it's just that maybe I know that the Dio voice isn't my everyday voice and I'm just impersonating a character. But at the same time, it makes me feel dysphoric cuz I'm better at doing an impersonation of a really masc character's voice that sounds nothing like mine, than having a cute fem voice that I actually want to achieve for everyday usage. 

So basically now I rarely ever do an impersonation of Dio or other masc characters anymore even if it's fun cuz dysphoria sucks.
Mood. I’m a trans guy, I relate: sometimes I want a light melodic voice, sometimes I want a deeper and tougher one, and sometimes I just wanna sound like an adult and not a prepubescent voice cracking teen. I get ya
Lmfao doing impressions is fun. All people can enjoy pretending to have a voice even if the opposite gender or even dif species. Just how it is. You enjoy it. No need to over think it.
Just watch Batwoman and carry on.
Yes this!! Vvv dysphoric abt how deep my voice is unless I’m doing a tony soprano voice then it’s fine
I feel this. I love signing along to Jonathan Coulton, Foo Fighters, Audioslave, and despite my best efforts I'm stuck singing in my old voice.
LoL I feel you. My normal voice is Andro but I love doing batman impression ""would you like to know my secret identity?"" 😂
For me it used to be the opposite though. I used to feel bad for having a semi high pitched voice as I used to get teased growing up. Back in my egg days I'd feel bad my batman impressions weren't good enough. Now I just have fun with the impressions ""where's the detonator!"" 😜. Nothing can ever be perfect, sometimes you need to just shut the outside noises and have fun.
god, i have it but with music skibabee is just to fucking good
I get that, doing impressions feels good because it’s fun for me but bad because it reminds me I sound like them if they’re a guy or don’t really if they’re a girl
I think it's because you're aware that the fiction esc voice is an impression and not reflective if your gender the same way your normal voice would be.
I usually get super dysphoric over my voice but I always love singing along to my favourite singer, Peter Hammill, dysphoria free, because his voice is so theatrical and fucked up sounding, it's just fun
It's kinda the same when I sing for me. I enjoy singing and it also doesn't sound too bad but my singing voice is really feminine and I can't control it in the way I can when I'm normally talking (even then I get usually clocked when I talk).  So it gives me dysphoria but often the joy of singing overshadowes.
I do similar stuff, but for me it's the really odd thing of actively not wanting voice training because of how much I love doing really goofy voices (I can hotswap between noticably femme / Joe Swanson), not to mention how much I enjoy karaoke (well, vocals on Rock Band and other type games)

But I mean, it doesn't make you any less valid if you don't get much dysphoria/enjoy doing it! Just look at all the cis female voice actors that play male roles!
Sister, I do this exact thing. I love DBZA, TF2, HUA, and so many other whacky shit. I'll quote them in my impression voice, but then jump back to my girl voice right after. It does kinda upset me, but also not?
I enjoy messing with the normies by busting out my own Batman impression. the looks on some of their faces is hilarious
I do do many random voices, especially when yelling random shit at my cats. It's sometimes a Lil dysphoric but not as bad as when I accidentally slip into my old voice.
I play quite a lot of Dnd on both sides of the DM screen and I find whenever I'm using the lower end of my range in character it's fine, same thing when I'm using it as a spontaneous character voice for a general dumb joke or whatever.  
But then when I'm just talking it's not fine.

For me it boils down to the level of separation you get when creating a character, it's not 'my voice' in that instance it's just the character's voice that I'm expressing.

Singing is sometimes iffy but I'm mostly okay with using my lower register for that mostly because I treat it as a technical skill and I know I can hit the higher notes if I want to.

Hearing recordings of my voice is always a big dysphoria trigger regardless of the context though which is kinda weird.
Just because you train for a different range doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have fun expressing your normal range when appropriate, especially if it’s unexpected. [My favorite example of this](https://youtu.be/1iqu5cWnqG8)
I know exactly how you feel lol

Mind you, I haven't started voice training yet, so I don't have any sort of feminine or girly voice, but I can do a REALLY good Scottish accent to the point of being able to quote Shrek and the ""DISGUSTANG"" meme xD

It's mildly dysphoric, but the comedy is so golden that it doesn't even matter.
I look forward to having my feminine voice, but being able to bust out my deep male voice and shock someone with it if needed XD
Just gonna say, that title got me goin' 15 different levels of *concern*
I was doing impressions of arthur morgan yesterday but I hate how easy it is lmao
Okay so either I'm a dunce who can't read or just a tired (please excuse my language here) ass mother Fulkerson who should go to sleep to understand what I just read it's probably (correct me if I'm using the term wrong) the ladder of the two
I'd like to get to a point where I could do impressions and accents in a girl voice just as well as I can do them in my regular voice, end goal for me is to have the potential to convincingly voice an entire world of people without any help.

And once I can do that, I want to be able to hit the high notes on Galactic Mermaid.
One of the things that I most look forward to when doing voice training is thinking about all the range of characters I can voice when I DM for my D&D group lol
Strange?  Maybe in the broad sense of our experiences are strange, but this sounds normal for trans women.  

I'm 7 years into HRT.  I'm told by friends and family I can't sound like a man anymore, even if I try.  

But I can still do impressions.  I Just sound like a woman doing the impression.  

Best of luck to you all.  Enjoy your voice as best you can, they are a wonderful gift.
""Alfred, I want a Pinkie Pie toy and ice cream"".
I like to do a Solid Snake impression and say random stuff like ""HRRRRNGH, COLONEL! My leg fell asleep! I can't leave the toilet!""

I've also been told I have an absolutely perfect Bill Clinton and that's what I use to reduce any attempts by people to talk politics into laughter and joking.
I'm still aiming to be full-time Jaskier, part-time Geralt or Yennefer. Please no one comment on how unrealistic this is 😅
I almost stole Yennefer’s namesake… Almost, she reminds me of me
no voice

only impressions
Yep this is me. I love joking around and I've always been a good mimic so impressions come naturally. It's only when I talk in my ""real voice"" that I feel like shit.
And how do you feel about it?
Same
I wish you the best in your journey to a deeper voice.  Euphoria is a fickle patron, but their blessings are indescribable.
I love making voices. I wanted to be a voice actor when I was growing up. I also hate being in full girl mode and approaching the greeter at Walmart with a mask on and as soon as she hears my voice she says, “how can I help, sir?”

I was afraid of losing my voice too, because it’s a very important thing to me. But I’ve been heavily considering signing up for voice training lessons.
I tried Jotaro voice one time.
I won't watch Batwoman.
But I'm reading Batwoman.
Shrek has Scottish accent?
(I never watched Shrek in English)
Omg amazing 😂
I am now broken and laugh crying, I can’t breathe after hearing the Batman voice in my head saying this 🤣
Good luck on the Path.
Unrealistic?  Maybe, impossible?  Definitely not.  

If you have not seen one of the videos that cracked my egg:https://youtu.be/t9-CS2v8wcc

""A Whole New World, but Nick Pitera""
This 🐶 I'll be like

^oh ^hey ^how ^you **DOING** ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

And then feel dysphoric about it because low 😵‍💫
Nobody expects the trans impressionists!
Very mixed. If I slip up in public it gives me dysphoria, because obviously it just isn't me and doesn't feel right, and that I can actually go that low in the first place. In terms of impressions/voice acting its great though, good at parties for a laugh.
This, is too feckin relatable.
I hate it and really wish my voice was different
Oh you bet he does xD

I don't know if it's available in your country, but you might be able to watch it on Netflix too lol
""Alfred, don't turn off the light. You know I can't sleep without it. Can you get me warm milk?""
I wish you well on your journey.
Well, Shrek is on seven streaming services, but not on the one i'm subscribed to.
Have you seen the [College Humor Batman](https://youtu.be/1byycwl8qgc) videos? They are hilarious 😂"	tqb0m3	trans	387	0.99	2022-03-28 14:50:30
I feel so ugly, I have no upper lip, my nose, brow, and jawline will always be masc and gross until I can get ffs. why do I have to look like this, dysphoria has been eating me alive lately. Im so sick of hating myself. (nearing 3 years on hrt, 21 mtf)		"I personally think you're stunning. I think the features you point out. Your nose, brow, and jawline frame yourself so well and make you look so beautiful. Almost stoic like a model.
I’m so sorry you are going through it. I know this probably won’t help, but you are a very pretty person, just on these few images. I know having to see the change as gradual as you have by living in this body every day, and knowing what the “before” picture looks like, it’s really hard for you to see what I’m seeing, but you are so pretty, and I hope that hearing it in this way helps even a little. Be kind to yourself if you can manage it 💖💖
girl you look so pretty, shut up
Girlie, you have to remember cis girls are often very disgruntled (if not gutted) by how they look. Thin upper lips. Masculine bone structures and brows. List doesn’t end there. These are things most girls find a way to beat themselves up over at some point in their lives. The world is MEAN to women! It expects ALL y’all to look perfect, and expects you to make yourself miserable if you don’t. But, there DOES, for many trans people, come a point where the things we think are worthy of intense dysphoria are really just the general high gendered expectations of society that everyone makes themselves miserable over. Sometimes I want to hurl myself into oncoming traffic until I go outside for a few minutes and see another man who is 5’5”. You would not have trouble finding cis women with your features.
You’re literally adorable though???
Yeah, thats all in yo head. Shake it out. All these nice comments should help.
You look so pretty! I'd kill to look half as fem as you
No honey don’t say that. You look beautiful. Facial features are gorgeous. You are blessed with natural beauty. Highlight those beautiful features with some makeup and get out there and grab the world by the ballz!
Girl you look fine, I can totally understand the dysphoria being overwhelming and not being able to shake the idea that you don’t look feminine, but believe me you do. I’m pre-transition and would kill to look as good as you do when I finally transition. Stay strong, stay beautiful
You look beautiful dear, its a journey. Keep at it 👍
You actually look a bit like a family member of mine. She's cis and has a similar facial structure to yours. She tried to be a model in the 80s because her look (like yours) was popular for models. 

Please don't hate yourself. I know it's hard. Trust me. I've been there. The mirror is like a nightmare. But I'm in my mid 30s now and I've learned that beauty standards are crazy subjective. No matter the gender. And that beauty is all about confidence in yourself and loving yourself as you are more than anything. 

It helped me to look at beautiful or attractive people that I felt I could relate to in art history. I know, that sounds weird probably... But by going back in time you really see how much beauty standards change. Like my family member who looks like you and had the model look of the 80s. But even back to ancient times you see all kinds of changes in what's considered feminine or masculine. And if you find something that you relate to, you can begin to see yourself as beautiful. Because art is usually there to present beauty (okay not always I know. But don't go poking around in art about dark subjects when trying to find reflections of beauty haha).
Was very surprised when I read mtf, very passable in my opinion 👍.
We are our worst critics. I (ftm) feel similarly about some of my features. I do think you are quite beautiful and your features are very feminine. Take that as you will from a stranger on the internet.
We really are our own worst critics. Girl, you're adorable!
You're not ugly!! It takes some ladies a tad bit longer on HRT to achieve the desired look. If you want there's always make up and ways to style your hair to look more feminine.
I'm nonbinary and my oldest is a beautiful trans young woman. 
Hang in there hun and give yourself a break.
Your face is very delicate and girly!
We can’t see your brow. Your jawline doesn’t look bad, I’m not even sure a doctor would recommend a lip lift. Your nose looks okay, a profile shot would help to be sure. 

If you think I’m hugboxing you, read my comment history. I’m not.
You're gorgeous!!!!
I don’t know how to tell you this but you literally pass.
We’re always our own harshest critics.

That which we see in the mirror is partly the worst part of our brain lying to us - it sees everything that’s not actually there.
NAH dysphoria is lying to you. You're cute as fuck. Not to overstep but genuinely this is a self perception issue and no matter what happens physically if you don't change yourself mentally you will continue to see your self as you do now. Therapy and self love exercises are a great start. I wish you the best of luck.
Omg you're so gorgeous!!!

Sometimes when you're bummed out you might need to take a look at the big picture and wonder if you're feeling icky cuz you got some work to do somewhere

Go get it, you beautiful little thing you
You pass better than  I ever will. I thought this was ""r/toastme"" tbh

Now, heres some hard truths--what you see in the mirror is absolutely not what other people see; you will always be harder on yourself than others. If people claim you look manly or masculine, they are lying and doing it to hurt you, but some folks will always do this and never acknowledge it or change their ways

Finally, that nose is femme af, because lots of cis women have noses like that. You might not match the you in your head, but you look like a cis woman. Get ffs if it can bring you closer to your dreams, but know that you're already there as far as passing
Look I’m afab that hasn’t gotten on HRT (I’m 16yp) and you look waaay more feminine than me, im nos exaggerating.
You’re fine, don’t worry, it’s just the dysphoria kicking you down! Appreciate your beauty 💞 keep strong friend
Dysphoria is such a bitch to distort your image of yourself so much! Seriously to me there is nothing masc about you, you look like a cute cis girl! 
But I know it from myself compared to how others perceive me how you can sometimes just not see it at all while totally passing to others.
I think you’re gorgeous, you look a lot like one of my exes, she had very similar features and I thought she was still really pretty & so are you !
Girl what are you saying? You're so pretty! I'm serious! I love your hair! And your face is very cute!

And please message me if you ever need a friend or someone to vent to okay? 😊❤
You have amazing cheekbones and a gorgeous jawline. Honestly, for what it’s worth, I wouldn’t have clocked you. You see yourself all the time, and it’s easy to be hyper critical.  I don’t know your story, but I’m wondering if you had to present as masc for part of your life? You may be seeing echos of that when you look at yourself now. 
Others only see you for who you are now.
How can you use the word Masc with that face? I don't get it. Hey girl, dysphoria is the mind but your looks are reality. The look of a young woman. That is all I can see in that photo.
You’re being hard on yourself. You’re not ugly or masc. stay positive.
You look to me like Jessica Chastain and she's one of the most beautiful women on the planet < opinion? >

So are you. Dysphoria is a mean little monster that exists to make us believe it's cruel little lies.

You are beautiful. Don't doubt that. Your lips? Beautiful! Your nose? Beautiful! Your brow? Beautiful! Your jawline? Beautiful!

Please don't hate yourself :(
GIRL YOU LOOK SOOO BEAUTIFUL
Nope, I don’t think so, u look very cute and feminine. Definitely a beautiful girl. ♥️
Honestly...its not giving masc its giving pre-raphaelite model! Just look up some of their features, theyre ethereally beautiful!
Some of my female teachers look just like you. You're gorgeous
You look feminine, I think you are being too rough with yourself
You look actually very similar to a friend of mine who is Afab, she has a very similar face. Even your hair is quite similar (style and colour)  


Just wanted to say that \^\^
I’m sorry you are going through a tough time. I think you look wonderful.
Mtfs will be like ""I'm the ugliest thing in existence, look on my hideous face and weep 😢"" and the picture will be Just Some Girl
Ermmm... you are gorgeous! Genuinely pretty
U look so cute 😍 think u being a bit hard on urself
Not the first girl I've seen with that jawline. Your pretty and fem I understand though disphorya is a beast
I don’t see it. You look very pretty
I think you look similar to Jessica Chastain. always remember, female faces are also angular
I am AFAB I have no lips no need to worry
You look like a girl I knew in high school. Don't beat yourself up, you're definitely feminine
If it helps, you look like an athletic woman. I've known plenty of female athletes that have VERY sharp jawlines and it's just because of how fit they are. You look great btw.
It's dysphoria talking - you are objectively not manly at all and I personally think you're a very beautiful person
I feel ugly, too. If it means anything, you're much prettier than I am.
You are beautiful. Don't let the dysphoria demons tell you lies.
I haven’t read all the comments, and have never had physical dysphoria so this might not help: (I’m skipping the you look gorgeous and feminine to me part, it’s true but probably not helpful)

Have you looked into contouring tricks with makeup? All of your complaints can be addressed with skillful makeup. I know my stage makeup training could soften your jawline, nose, and browline. It’s a lot of work, and the tools/good makeup can be expensive and it takes practice. 

By addressed I do not mean fixed. And it’s possible it could make the dysphoria worse, like you might feel clownish because it’s all fake. BUT!!! It’s also possible that the makeup will make you feel more feminine and more pampered and more yourself. Let me know if I should find some tutorials for you!

I’m sure you know this, still gonna say it: self hatred doesn’t magically go away when you look more like your ideal. It’s so easy for it to move around if you focus on just fixing what causes it right now. I hated myself for being fat for so long, then when that got fixed my self esteem didn’t get better it just turned to I don’t clean enough so I’m awful. Please work on self acceptance too!! You are worthy of self love!
You are cute honey. Really. Not just saying that to cheer you up, but honestly, im actually a bit jelly. 
Stay strong, much love 💜
Hey. I get it. I struggle too. Just know that to the outside world, you look way more feminine than you think. It’s just your brain messing with you. 

I’ve been on HRT for 5 years. I didn’t start until I was in my late 40s. I still struggle with dysphoria. I did have top sugery 6 weeks ago. A few days ago, my wife had me try on one of her sun dresses, and for the first time, I started to really see who I want to see in the mirror. 

I was so surprised, I had to look away. 

Don’t give up on yourself. Love yourself and give yourself time. Sending hugs and good vibes your way.
You are beautiful
i didnt know you were mtf or trans until you said so, you look really fem!
Girl, I thought you were cis at first. I wouldn't have know any different if you didn't tell me.
Hnestly u look gorgeous shouldn't put urself down
You are so beautiful. All I see is a woman when I look at you.
You are so pretty, you are nearly identical to my cis woman friend
Honestly,  you are one of the most passing girls I have seen here! And hella cute too! You set my goals :)
You look literally like my friends cis girlfriend
I think you look a lil bit like Disney-era Miley, which is pretty fem to me lol 

I hope that means something at least 😅
Why is it that every time I open this damn app I fall in love with another beautiful girl?
You are so beautiful!  Dm me!  I would totally date you
Holy heck! You are SO pretty! 😍 There is too much variation in human beings to label particular features as fem or masc. When I look at you, I see a woman, same as other beautiful women with strong features, like Geena Davis, Sigourney Weaver and Raquel Welch. 🤷‍♀️
Okay I was going to say like 17ish girl from looks you look great. Try not to be so hard on yourself
You are very pretty and I think that dysphoria is just being mean. 100% q.t. gf vibe
Well you can always save up for FFS! I understand what it’s like to hate your face, but the best way to stop hating yourself is to work to fix the problem. I can’t do anything about my condition, but maybe you can! Save up and you’ll eventuality have nothing to hate yourself for. Also about your lips: they’re fineeeee, don’t worry about it
You're amazing! Your nose is amazing and you do have an upper lip my friend. We are often our own worst critques so please know you're amazing! I see nothing wrong with you :)
I see an upper lip. Women can have straight noses without it being masc. my mom has a big Roman nose and she’s still lovely. I have a big boop butt thing on the end of my nose. And I as a lady who loves ladies, enjoy a strong jawline and solid profile. You’re beautiful and to me you pass. Your brain is lying to you. If you dislike your upper lip you can kinda puff it out a bit by resting it slightly over your bottom lip. I like the way I feel like I look when I do that.
I think you're the only one who sees that 👀

You look very feminin and beautiful ❤️
You're pretty so stop self hating please 😍
As you've said in another comment: dysphoria is a bitch. However, i can reassure you: from an outside perspective, you are not ONE BIT masculine.
 I’m really sorry you have to go through so much dysphoria to the point you can’t see how beautiful you have became :( trust me you are so stunning
i feel you sis. everything all of what you just said. it's hard everyday to look in any mirrors.
Don’t be so hard on yourself you are really cute
Contouring could help. There are many tutorials on YouTube.
You have a very athletic film look to you and it definitely works embrace it and love yourself everyone here seems to think you look amazing
Don't hate yourself hun. You look fine. One is always overcritical when it comes to oneself.
From my understanding it takes about 6 years for major changes. One thing you can do to less face dismorphia is style your hair and wear make up. It adds up quite well. Hrt will probably have some softening of your face with plumpness. Can also try to get lip fillers or FFS if you absolutely need to change it.
Girl wtf you look gorgeous 😭
You're so Beautiful
Tbh, i think i have a new transition goal 😅

You look great!
Nononono! That face is very kissable, give it here you gorgeous fuck!
I’m sorry you feel this way about yourself, but if it makes you feel any better I thought you looked like the animated Giselle from enchanted. Random comparison but I thought you looked similar 😊
You should try the face zoom on TikTok! Your face looks much different to others than it does up close like that. The angles get very distorted and harsh up close.
You look fabulous as I am sure many others have told you.
To be perfectly honest I would marry you like a shot.
All you need is a little confidence. Listen to what others say and see yourself as others see you.
Yeah, you're beautiful, gorgeous, and adorable. 💓 I love these photos--- they're honestly amazing!!!! 😃
You look cute
I thought you were AFAB???? Dysphoria is wild. You are beautiful.
I was afab, and you look like a young me/similar to girls I grew up with. So do with that what you will.
Girk, I have seen plenty of cis-gender women who look like you or similar to you. You are not ugly. I hope you have a wonderful day.
You're an absolutely beautiful person, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You have a nice beautiful twinkle in your eye and I think it's amazing. We are our own worst critics. We can be way too hard on ourselves. Instead of picking out what you don't like about yourself, maybe pick out the things you do like and focus on those. Learn to accept any imperfections cuz none of us are perfect. You're way too beautiful to be hating yourself. Learn to love and accept yourself as perfectly imperfect. But in my opinion there's absolutely nothing wrong with you. You're purely beautiful and you have nice lips. You're very feminine. Try see yourself in a positive light today. No matter how negatives your thoughts May be, focus on the good. Because a lot of the times our negative thoughts are not truthful anyways. Step outside of fear and learn to Love yourself fearlessly. You look amazing and great.
You are looking great ❤️❤️❤️
You’re not ugly, you’re adorable. Also nice jersey 😉👍
You are beautiful the way you are! Remember beauty as well is on the inside
I read this on my lock screen as soon as I woke up, and I instantly clicked on it as I feel the exact same way. I was expecting it to be a text post, but you look amazing. Remember that dysphoria make you see yourself differently than you actually look.
You are really pretty lol
You look like my super cute cis-lady friend who I have a massive crush on. (This is intended as a compliment btw) You look very femme.... also where is this brow of which you speak? I see none <3
I also hate myself
Thanks, idk, I just don't agree, I feel like I look like a man, I hate my features so much. Dysphoria is a bitch.
You look absolutely great! The delicate features are very feminine.
Así es y más con la segunda fotografía 👍
I try, my girlfriend always tries to get me to be kind to myself, but dysphoria just eats me alive. I can't stand myself most days. It sucks. I just want surgery already
I wish I thought I was pretty, everyone else is always telling me I look pretty or cute but I never see it in myself, I grovel at the way I look everyday. I hate dysphoria
Agreed like ya look amazing stop it and do the confiDANCE 💃🏽
This. I’m your local friendly cis lesbian, and I completely understand this. I have very masculine features (constantly get misgendered by FaceApp and filters lmao) and a thin moustache (which I have to shave) on my upper lip, both of which I can be sensitive about. You are absolutely stunning, and you look very feminine.
Best of luck,
- A
Thx, I just don't see it, dysphoria hates me
Thx, it's nice to see the support, I wish it made me change my perspective, if only dysphoria was beaten that easily
I'm sorry if I'm being selfish I know I've had lots of changes, dysphoria is just terrible to me a lot of the time.
Thanks, I try, but it's so hard when I always hate the way I look, no matter what I do.
I'm almost on 3 years hrt,  I got a new haircut and style 2 days ago and got my brows done, I still feel ugly, I don't have the motivation to get out of bed let alone do my makeup all nice and doll myself up, I wish I did, it's a bad mix of dysphoria, BPD, and bipolar depression. Especially when I get on my period towards the end of the month. I feel bad for my gf who has to deal with my antics.
Yeah that's my problem, I think my friends and family have unintentionally made it worse at times too, because I think I pass but I still get misgendered by my parents/ siblings sometimes, and it hurts, but no strangers ever assume I'm male, also my friends asking me really personal questions in front of people who don't know I'm trans and outting me, saying things that separate me from the cis girls we hang out with. It's hurtful. And I can't wait to move to Hawaii where nobody will know my past. It's so hard to have confidence in myself and love the way I look when people just boil me down to bring trans or not born female. When I'm so much more than that.
Aw tysm, you're too kind truly.
What are you a psychic, my father forced me to be masc my whole life until I was 19, anytime I showed signs of femininity I would get called names and beat, he's not in my life anymore, but he still haunts me, I see him in my face, I hate how much I look like him. It makes me feel gross.
Hmm, thanks, these are also pretty doctored and angled to make me look better, I feel like I don't pass, my family still misgenders me a lot.
No way, I feel like my masc features, especially my jaw and Adams apple are a dead giveaway.maybe it's just my dysphoria, maybe I'm just ugly idk.
I try, but I always hate myself no matter how hard i try. My gf gets frustrated from me being such a negative Nancy all the time, I wish I wasn't like this
Thanks, I disagree, but I appreciate it
Tysm. It means a lot.
Aww, thx, I disagree but I appreciate the support
<3
Interesting, kind of a vibe tbh. I don't think I'm nearly that dainty or femme tho, my shoulders and chest are far too broad and manly
Aww, thx. I'm sorry but I happen to have a lovely wonderful girl in my life already.
Omfg tysm that's so kind, I wish 😭😭🥹🥹
Yeah, that's why I put my camera a little further away and zoom in usually
This are just Brain Worms but yeah I have the same Brain Worms
I've noticed a lot of cis women that resemble their fathers. If you start looking for it you'll see there's far more variety in the middle of the spectrum. You do remind me of someone, just need to keep thinking about it.
Well you tell dysphoria it can eat an ass, because you look great! I'm not clocking anything in those pics besides a beautiful woman
Hey I'm transbian too!
dysphoria sucks, but trust me and everyone here, you are pretty
You are not ugly, you just are not your type,
Relatable, unfortunately. You are hella adorable though, and I can pretty much guarantee that what your brain is showing you when you look in the mirror is not indicative of reality. Dysphoria and trauma from dysphoria can be pretty powerful unfortunately.
You are not being selfish. But I want you to know that girls all over the world are having those same thoughts and feelings, whether they are trans or cis, and you are not alone. (It's part of why the makeup industry is so big and why contouring is popular.) When you walk down the street and see all the pretty girls, you should know that they have felt things like that too. The mirror lies to you. But it will get better.
Happens to the best of people. Confidence comes, I dress up as much as possible as it helps me
You are truly beautiful darling
I have BPD myself and when I was younger it was horrible, it does get better with age (I am 41 now) I take birth control and I am hoping it stops my cycle all together. Mental illness is no joke and hun getting help may not be a bad idea  hugs!
Oh that is awful and I'm so sorry to hear that you have to put up with that from friends and family! I bet that it makes a lot of things even worse... I hope you get to change it soon and I wish you the very best! 
Sometimes when it gets to much for me I try, as like a self care thing, to say nice things about myself in the mirror, like ""you're a cute girl"" or, when it's rough maybe only ""you're okay"" which sometimes help at least a little. I try to think of it like that the world out there is already so hostile to us trans people and at least we should try to show kindness to ourselves and it sometimes helps to view myself as a different person and go in with a mindset ""she tries so hard and puts so much effort in, say a few kind words to her..."" Maybe something like this can help you too? (:
I do my best luv! 😊❤
aww :(
everyone has doubts about things in there lives its natural. Your gf just cares about u and doesn't want you put urself down she loves u for u and all the ups and downs tht comes with it. What ur doing is being urself and not everyone does tht just have some faith things will be fine
Brainrot dysphoria is epic
There is some resemblance to a couple actresses I can think of, but sharing more than that might not be as helpful as intended. I like to tell my kids to only compare themselves to their previous selves. Comparing how you look or what you have to others can be dangerous territory. I wish you all the best! You are you. No one else gets to do that. Find your joy (to steal a quote from a certain gay teacher on tiktok)
Ty ☺️
Just hope it be, idk, I don't get misgendered in public but my family does it.
<3
I know 😭
No need to thank me hun! I hope your day is as wonderful as you are ❤❤
i hope everything gets better for you
We can get thru this together 🤝 💖🥹
Yeah... we can do this 🏳️‍⚧️💖

Did anyone else’s dysphoria get worse once you figured out you were trans?	"Exactly what the title says. I recently, and finally, accepted that I’m not cis, but now it feels like my dysphoria has been getting worse.

Has this happened to anyone else?
Thanks everyone"	"Yes and I think it's really common for dysphoria to get worse after realizing you're trans. I didn't have a word for my dysphoria before learning about being trans and I thought everyone felt the same way. I also didn't really develop social dysphoria until after I came out, it was mostly only physical dysphoria before then
Absolutely.  Before my epiphany I could say that I had to be happy as I was because it wouldn't/shouldn't change.  Now I have a self image I'd like to achieve and can't lie to myself.  Not just physically, but also realizing how much I've masked off myself because it wasn't masculine.  From the way I laugh too the way I show affection, excitement, vulnerability, support, it's all been changed to fit expectations.  The more I let those things go and be myself the farther I get from what people think is me.  I know it's how I've always  felt at my core, but other's see changing behavior and think it's new.
Yup.

Though looking back it was always there, just now it had a name and it was something that I could try to fix. Accepting that I was trans meant I had to confront the many things I'd subconsciously avoided since puberty, to determine just how far I wanted to go with transition.
Ever have that experience where you've never seen a car model (or something like that) before, and then suddenly you see one and its like the flood gates are open and all you see are those cars?

Thats been my experience of dysphoria. I didnt know that it existed, then i knew it existed but it was some foreign thing i could never understand because I was a cis man, and then i was told that a thing I experienced was dysphoria, and BOOM its growing out of every crevice I hit it in as a teenager and early adult. Perspective is wild.
Same, figuring it out for me made things worse and better, specifically after I figured out what dysphoria was. I use to just think of it as just depression and generalized self hatred, hence my avoidance of mirrors because I didn't want to look at myself. After figuring it out it got stronger but also more targeted, like still being in a maze but at least I can see the walls now. I can figure out the things that tend to cause specific dysphorias for me and either avoid or tackle as I see fit. Even if they feel stronger than before.
Yes. And the more I do to feminize, the less masculinity I tolerate. It gets rough.
Yes
Oh fuck yes. It ramped up like crazy after. Knowing what causes a feeling makes it more noticeable… :(

You got this 👏
i also knew i wasnt cis, but the two weeks after i realized i was a girl were fucking torture ohmigosh yess girl u are strong, u can do it
Yes mainly because I was more aware of it than I was previously
Yes. I think being in denial kept it locked up, and after coming out the beast was unshackled.
Didn’t get voice dysphoria until I started physically transitioning and it became the biggest clocking marker for me
It has. But it’s also come with a lot of confidence in knowing who I am— and making strides towards actualizing what for so long felt totally intangible?
Omg significantly, in the span of 6 months I went from “yeah the beard sucks, but it’s the only way I look decent so I’ll keep it” to “if I don’t shave right now I’m going to cry” 

Anyway point is, I went from feeling meh to horrid, so yes
Absolutely. What I’ve noticed though, is now that I can name the feeling, I don’t find myself turning to ways to dissociate and cope as quickly because I can name the feeling. But it feels infinitely worse.
Very much so. Once I knew what the situation was and knew there was a path out of it, dysphoria while waiting to begin hrt is sky high.
Haha yep. It’s like coming out of Plato’s cave.
I can’t figure out what I am. I’m male born but I defs have female moments that I don’t really seem to mind. When I feel girly I walk very different, my voice changes and all that. And I think for the first time I felt female for a few hours yesterday? It keeps going all over the place and I can’t seem to stick to one. I’ve told some people I trust but like idk what to do
Yes absolutely! Some things that I never considered to be dysphoric turned up that way. I think it has to do with finally being real with myself
Living with pain is bearable...until you get a moment away from the pain and discover that it is possible to be free of it.  When the pain comes back, it isn't really any greater than before, objectively, but what was once just a part of being alive has become a burden that can be overcome.  It becomes crushing as you are now aware of how much of your daily focus is used to just compensate for the pain.
I think dysphoria is very complicated, and every person will experience it differently. So it is completely possible for it to worsen after realizing that you are trans. Personally, I always felt that something was wrong with my body, and I was very worried that there was something wrong with me. But it was all very internalized and general, I couldn’t tell the difference between my dysphoria and self consciousness. After I knew, the dysphoria became much clearer and was more influenced by how other’s saw me.
Yes..
Yes. I don’t know what to do. I’m on my bed after being bullied about it.
Yep my dysphoria did
Absolutely
I had repressed it for so long that I didn't even know it was there.

So yea, when I finally addressed it my dysphoria was obvious.
100%
Yeah…mainly because I began dissociating less and less. Everything sucked more as I have been on a journey coming back into my body over the last 6 years. But I feel now. Feeling often sucks but it’s also a wonderfully beautiful experience

Lacking a defense mechanism is the toughest part.
Ignorance is bliss. Before i knew the effects were mild but nagging but how that i know they're in the front of my mind. it's a lot more difficulty to handle the dysphoria when you start to work on it, and there's so much to deal with. Kinda like picking up the big prices of trash to mop the floor. If you have that surface of trash you can't worry as bad about the floor. Idk if I'm making sence. When you transition you pick up the trash. And now you see the floor and it's a lot dirtier than first expected. Idk
Yes this happened to me and I’m a detrans 😀 so idk what that means for you lmao
Yes before I transitioned I had a moment when I would look in the mirror and say you know what I think I can be okay with a chest, after I accepted the fact that I was a trans man I realized that me feeling “okay” was some form of dysphoria not to mention the crying about growing a chest. Now I can’t leave my house without binding. My chest is the worst part.
Opposite, dysphoria lessened greatly.
I personally wouldn't say it got worse, just that I actually noticed it and had a name for the feeling.

I've overall gotten better with coping with it, and in certain aspects it's gone down overtime in general, but thats just the benefits of a supportive environment.
Mhm. Very much darkest before the dawn, kinda thing. Rhe dysphoria ramping up is what makes you question and then realize.... then having to act on that while being terrified only ramps it up more.

Even after a year, sometimes I feel 1,000x better, amd sometimes I look in the mirror and hate that I still see my old self looking back behind those eyes.
Yes. I had dysphoria before hand but it was so subtle it was basically unknowable. Once I found and explored my identity, the symptoms had a face that I could spot. Idk if they really got worse or if I just had the new vision to see them. Either way, it certainly FEELS like it gets worse. But, it did get better for me decently easy.
Dysphoria and Euphoria both got way more intense for me after I realized. There’s good and bad but the good starts to outweigh the bad once you become more comfortable with yourself. :)
Yes, because when you knew, you can't stop feeling about it or be blinded like before.
Not really, for me it was a relief. But I'm old, I didn't even know that being transgender was a thing until I was about 12 or 13. By that time I knew that my body was wrong, that I hated what puberty was doing to my body, everything made me very angry. Finding out was somewhat of a relief, but it also made me more angry because I had no idea what to do and my family was not supportive. When they found out I might be pursuing the idea, by reading a book called Conundrum, my step father beat me up and put me on the street, he then ~~used~~ abused his power as a police officer to makes sure I couldn't get any help from social services or get medical treatment until I turned 18.
yes. because u realize what exactly it is that has been making you feel bad. and now you know what you want but have no idea how to achieve it. and you just get reminded how far away you are from being who you are by just seeing just the slightest reflection of yourself. and reflections arent exactly uncommon. no even looking at other people can trigger that. atleast for me
100%! Especially when I'm out and about and not in the comfort of my own home. I feel like everyone looks at me wrong. And I somehow feel like my breasts grew bigger when I realized I was a man, but I'm pretty sure they are the same size and I'm just way more concious of them now-
I used to think I had really small boobs for a girl. Almost nonexistent. Now I feel like they are too big for a guy. I always notice them.
Yeah. Definitely. I honestly don’t really know if I felt dysphoric about anything, I just didn’t feel attractive at all. Then I figured out I’m probably trans and started being able to identify exactly what I didn’t like and now I can’t stop noticing it and it sucks. :/
Yeah, a lot.

Even though it had been ramping up for some years as I began understanding that it was a real thing and not ""just a fetish"".
yeah. really it's just that you tend to notice things more once you know to look for them. it's a psychological thing called the baader-meinhof phenomenon and it can apply to literally any information or stimuli. to give an example from my personal life, it can be something as simple as noticing a certain type of car on the road more often after your family buys one. with dysphoria, though, there's the added effect of the emotional distress compounding on top of itself and getting really loud in your head. it fuckin sucks.
I think I'm starting to get this feeling too.
Yep I don't know why but yep
I have always felt like something was off in my body, but the dysphoria did get worse after accepting that I am trans
Very much so. Part of it is just having the knowledge of ""dysphoria"" as an umbrella term that covers all those vague, bad feelings I've dealt with my whole life. Before I understood what it meant, I said I was depressed, or tired, or annoyed, or feeling out of sorts, or any of a hundred other terms. I didn't start putting all those pieces together, realizing that they were all part of the same puzzle that was my identity, until after I came out and learned what being trans actually was.
yes because i knew what it was and that was scary
oh yeah absolutely. i think part of it is bc i didnt know how often i felt like shit until i started actually feeling good. like, i was just so used to the overwhelming dysphoria every day that i didnt even realize how bad it was until i experienced euphoria from presenting masculine
My dysphoria wasn’t very painful compared to the days and weeks of first learning I was trans the pain of dysphoria set in hard after realizing what I didn’t know for 27 years of my life x.x
I mean you suddenly go from “yes I’m [insert AGAB]” and then you’re like “damn I’m something different” while looking nothing like your real gender.

Yeah we all get that shock. It’s ok. It gets better
Yes. Before I used trained skills to cope with it on a subconscious level. Since figuring out it got worse, especially with all the coming-outs. I am currently looking so forward to HRT, wouldn’t have imagined that 3 months ago.
Honestly, it continues to get worse. The more I transition the more I realize how much I hate this body…
OMG yes so much worse!!! I lived my whole life not knowing that the sad, sick, unspeakable pain I couldn't express was dysphoria all along. Once it had a name I could see it more clearly. 

Sometimes dysphoria feels kind of validating and freeing. I know what it is. I am finally fixing it.
Yeah once I realized I was trans it made more sense of why I was depressed and then a huge wave of what I was used to hating my body got worse since it took me so long to realize. Am finally transitioning and yet dealing with new versions of dysphoria I wasn't prepared for
Yes, the first time i figured out i was trans, i couldn't stop thinking about that i was a man because i looked nothing like a man, and that made me cry a lot of times, after that, my mind would enter in denial because of that and i figured out i was bigender (male and female), and finally, after a long time, i figured out i was in denial because i thought i was not enough to be a man and that i couldn't name myself a man, and today i still have dysphoria but im learning how to accept myself and i will start my transition even if my mother doesnt accept myself, i hope you can accept yourself as FTM of MTF or non binary (idk your gender), it will be hard, but i promise that it will worth it, good luck!! You're valid, you matter and you're enough.
I won't say this is universally true so I won't assume it's true for you specifically. But generally what happens is that we've either suppressed or just become numb to the dysphoria before recognizing that we have it. Effectively we've learned to deal with it by pretending it's not there.

Once you've accepted that you're trans you can't just ignore the dysphoria anymore. You have to confront it full in the face. And accepting just how bad it is will make it seem like it's getting worse. But really you're realizing just how bad it is.

It'll get better. You'll learn how to handle it properly and you'll learn how to actually reduce it. You'll get through it, and it's worth it.
Ita more like it crystallized. Years of incomprehensible sadness, despair, and anxiety are now something that I can see the direction of rather than It being a dark cloud hanging over me
Wow, significantly worse now that I think about it. The anxiety has been through the roof since I realized this in November. I had a chat with my therapist about it and he said it has something to do with knowing that I can start HRT soon. Having the knowledge that I can become who I know I am inside makes me so impatient with my outside.
Yes it did, because then I knew what it was, and I couldn't ignore it any longer. It's a normal thing to happen.
absolutely
That’s the norm I think and happened to me. Abated on hrt, really
Got knocked down with GCS.
Oh yeah, but now that I'm aware I of it, I can make changes to the things that cause some of it. Makes me excited for the future. Just take little steps towards what makes you happy.
Oh my yes. Before I figured myself out I just sort of emotionally disconnected from my body. I could logically recognize it was me in a mirror but never felt an emotion about it.

Once I came out to myself, however, I started having physical dysphoria and emotional breakdowns over my appearance.
For me it got more intense after I had to think about just what I needed help with. Here in Sweden, in order to start HRT and all that, I need to get a diagnosis. And there's a few places that does that. And in order to get seen by them you can either risk having your regular dr contact them or write them a letter. 

Which I of course did. That made me dig deeper down. I think it's kinda common, either when you come out, or around when you start to actually do something about it.

I think it's a ""can we already have this over and done with please??"". At least it is for me.
Yes, before figuring out I had almost an extra voice in my head trying to convince me to be a girl. And now some days I've got almost an extra voice telling me that it'll never happen and that maybe I should give up in the idea.

Very annoying 💔
Yes. My dysphoria got worse after transitioning. 

I’m a 51 yo MTF. 1 yr HRT, 4 months post FFS.

My biggest dysphoria was always my face. Now that it’s been done, and healing, it bothers me less. Now I hate my belly that has been stubbornly sticking around (for reasons). 

So it seems to me that I may never be happy with my appearance. Cuz after getting my biggest issue worked on, I found a new issue to hate. 

It doesn’t help that transitioning takes longer at my age. A lot longer. But I am happy with the changes I’ve seen. In a lot of ways my transition has been better than average. So I try to focus on the positive while being realistic about the negative.
Yes, this! As soon as I started to accept the possibility and currently for each step I take it seems to get worse. 

With of course the occasional dopamine accompanying euphoric moments, of course ...
Yep. My theory is that it's because my brain finally knows what's wrong. So instead of going ""oh, ho hum, same vague wrongness as ever"", it can now say ""okay, THAT SPECIFICALLY is wrong, why aren't you fixing it?"" Basically focusing the awareness rather than dismissing it as background noise.
No and yes. At first I was so ecstatic about a possible way to fix my lifelong feeling of wrongness that nothing could touch me. Eventually that wore off, new and different forms of dysphoria roared in, and internalized transphobia and impostor syndrome got the boot in as well. 

HRT, therapy, and coming out have made everything manageable for now, and I'm basically waiting for estrogen and surgery to make me as whole as I can get.
I'm not sure if it got worse or if it just got harder to bury as deeply so I feel it more. 

And as soon as one aspect improves, something else shows up and rears its head demanding attention too. 

It all still hurts but it doesn't feel as hopeless anymore, so I guess that's an improvement.
Only cause I was frusturated I couldn’t transition! Took 3 years to start T. Then 4 years after that to get top surgery. I was a very angry person that first 3 years.
Absolutely, though I also started to experience euphoria for basically the first time, so it’s been hit or miss
I think it happens to all of us, at the beginning you stop recognising yourself as cis, you start feeling dysphoria about your body and also yourself
It did for me. I literally posted this exact same question when it happened.

I didn't know what I was feeling before, so it went from a persistent unease and lack of self-esteem to an acute, constant disgust at my physical self. 

Plus, it shook me out of a lifelong state of emotional repression, so all my feelings were stronger.
Omg yes
Yes— because I now had a reason to hate parts of me. I hate my chest bc I want to look like a man, which is different than hating them for being there. I hate them bc they make people see me as a girl
Yes, this was one of the main reasons I went back in the closet before coming out again
Yes
Yes, after I figured out that, i tried to act manly (?) but there are times when my behavior become kinda feminine and that's when I hate myself and my existence
Yes, i would give a longer answer but I’m crying in the bathroom right now because of dysphoria.
Yes. I never liked my body but I was coming around on it. Like a ""I guess it's not that bad"". Then I realized I was trans and the dysphoria kicked my ass. 

Funny thing though, after realizing who I was I actually fell in love with my body somewhat. Like, I'm a big girl and I own that. The dysphoria is from wishing I was more feminine, not from wishing I was skinnier...so there's that.
Yes
Defo
happened to me
yes it has

i think thats the case for a lot of people tbh
Yah an it was pebis butter
I didn't really feel any dysphoria until after I came out, then it all came out of nowhere!
Yes, know I cry myself to sleep almost every night from dysphoria 👍
Yes, I didn't know what dysphoria was before realising I was trans. Thought it was just hatred at my body after seeing how society treats afab persons. Now I just want to cry every time because I don't have the body I want. I haven't done any medical transition because I'm scared it won't help
Yes, immensely.  I think realizing WHAT can give you anxiety over it.  Your mind now knows the problem has a potential solution too. Its overwhelming.  You can no longer go on as you had, not knowing what the heck anymore.
absolutely, i think this is a nearly universal experience for people who didn’t know they were trans when they were kids. anything later in life and it hits like a ton of bricks.
Probably.

Boymoding has always made me sad because I've been conscious of WISHING I was a girl/woman for almost as far back as I can remember, but actual feelings of pain and distress about it were pretty rare before my egg cracked about a year ago. Now the sadness is more common, but not *constant.*

For me, the confounder is that I also have **a lot** of fear and shame wrapped up with being trans as well as closeted (and I'm also just a general doomer about most things in life) such that I have a hard time figuring out what's actual dysphoria and what's just my *overall* misery.

And finally, even as a woman I don't think I'm SUPER femme (though also not exactly a tomboy?), so sometimes I don't get dysphoria about things I'm afraid that I should (*rationally,* I know that there's no ""should"" here, but it still makes me anxious).
I'd certainly say so.  I never really used to have a problem with my body, but since I came out to myself I've been growing more and more animosity towards it.

I'm pretty disillusioned with every part of myself these days, and it feels more and more like somethings missing.
pretty sure that's normal. i had minimal dysphoria before i accepted that i was trans, now it's off the charts. like i cant even describe how bad my dysphoria is
While mine got worse, I realized later on that a large part of ""worse"" was just me fully realizing that dysphoria was the source of a lot of my mental issues to begin with. I'm 3+ years into transition and looking back at all the depressive episodes, panic attacks, complete lack of energy, etc. I see that while a portion of it comes from me having clinical depression/anxiety/others a lot of it stemmed from dysphoria and knowing other saw me as male and the thought that no one would love me if I came out. Stay strong, there are many possible good futures out there for you.
Yep, it was awful for that first little bit. It’s kinda like starting a massive project when everything that needs to get done suddenly becomes overwhelming. It’s so much easier before you start, even though you’ve got that procrastination anxiety eating away at you. But luckily, once you get going, it gets much easier. It will all be okay :)
Like a lot of others here yeah. Once I cracked my egg the dysphoria got so much worse. I kinda like to think of it like a lot of the bad days I had before the crack had a I couldn't figure out what was wrong quality. But after I knew exactly what was wrong. I knew why I felt wrong.
I’ve always had dysphoria, but yes. It also did get worse when I learned I was trans because I knew deep down that a girl isn’t who I am. My dysphoria worsens with time, and as my dysphoria worsens, the more likely I am to become a statistic. (If you know what I mean.)
Yeah 1000% I never registered having dysphoria until I realized I was trans and then it was unbearable up until the moment I started HRT, at which point my dysphoria chilled out a lot
Well... I had depression for ages until I realised, but the depression was hopelessness combined with dysphoria that I didn't have words for.

I still feel shit, but now I know why and can act on it. 

Feel awful about my stomach? Meal plan and hit the gym. 
Hair got me down? Epilate that shit. 
Masculine features. HRT BB. 

Yeah, I feel more dysphoric than ever some days, but now I can take steps to fix it.
Idk whether it actually got worse, but it definitely felt like it did at the time iny experience. I think that it was (at least partly) just being able to point to dysphoria as the issue specifically, rather than just a general sense of feeling shit all the time like I had as a kid.

I also think that once you start transitioning and everyone still sees you as your AGAB for a while that can be more distressing than just boymoding all the time and being able to write it off like ""Well obvs they're gonna think that because I'm presenting as male"", so be ready for that possibility if you do oersue transition. It does get easier though, even if it feels like it won't sometimes x
Yeah, the moment I came out as trans my dysphoria and thoughts got worse.
Not immediately. A few months after I came out, I actually started noticing my Bottom Dysphoria getting significantly worse. It hasn’t worsened since, but it *has* stayed at the same level…
Oh yes. My dysphoria got really bad after I found out I was trans. And it’s slowly getting worse as days go by. When it’s that time of the month for me, my dysphoria SKYROCKETS and it sucks
From years of dissociating for some of us, we suppressed our desire to transition and dealing with it for so long. To a certain extend, we became numb. Like misgendering didn't used to bother me. But also more euphoria as you are more willing to try new things like new clothes, hairstyle or painting your nails... That's the silver lining. 💐
This right here. Started masking and suppressing my feminine qualities to fit in with the guys at school. Convinced it was just bisexuality and discontent with the way i looked that made me feel so awkward. Then, epiphany. Feel so much better abt myself since then
YES! Exactly!
can you please not tell someone that they might not be trans in a trans safe space, especially when you are not trans, thank you.
That's awful.. I'm so sorry that happened
First thing I remember changing was learning not to giggle because my GF at the time said ""it didn't sound right coming from a boy"".  I mean I suppose now I know why lol 😂
It’s an option and I’m going to say it! Detrans is always an option and it shouldn’t be demonized. It’s a valid step in many people’s gender journeys - it doesn’t just apply to trans-cis detrans people. It can also apply to people who detrans from trans male to non-binary or agender, since agender means no gender. Overall detransitioning is not a bad thing and it shouldn’t be seen as a “I’m transphobic” thing, because it’s not. It’s the same as transitioning, just in reverse because the person realizes that said method of transitioning didn’t alleviate any dysphoria.
I’m just glad it’s much less common today!
Lmao it really be like that tho, so many little things like that that just dont seem right comin from someone in a mans body that i wish i could let out

Trying to rock my natural hair Cos wearing my wig gives me dysphoria 🤭		"You look super cute
Omg I am melting, you're so beautiful and hot and I absolutely love your hair <3 

You're so goals
Looking really good
Wow, short hair looks so good on you! My hair looks so terrible that I have to wear a wig whenever I go out, even though I don’t like it.
Your natural hair is super cute!! I personally love short hair on everybody. I also love long hair on everybody. Anyways, you be you! You look awesome
Your hair is super cute!!
your whole LOOK oml, i swear i see yall with short hair while growing mine like “is it really that easy?!”
I think the shape of your face compliments your hair style very well! 😘✨
Love your short hair.  Look chic
You rock it don't worry about that super cute
Short hair squad. You growing it out too?
Woahh, you look great as fuck and totally pass with short hair, I'd just rock it!
It suits you well :)
Hot
You look awesome! <3
Girl I love my wigs but after awhile I just feel bald lmao 😂😂
Looks good to me
Oh you look really nice, and I love the boots! what are they?
I guess I'm not alone in the wig dysphoria thing. I like wearing it but when I look in the mirror or take a pic the dysphoria hits hard. Sometimes the photos are pretty good if I process them thru FaceApp. Thanks for sharing
That looks amazing! Is it any specific hair style, or just improvising?
Aww thank you so much cutie! X
Thank you! X
Thank you so much it’s just improvised tho , I’m always playing around with it to try find new styles that look decent"	jakqie	trans	379	0.99	2020-10-13 19:38:52
After 8 months HRT and 2 years being trans. I can now dress however I want without any dysphoria. There's a happy ending after all		"Living well is the BEST revenge . . .

❤️

And it's only going to get BETTER going forward!
Your real cute
I hope for this, it always makes me feel worse when I put on something I want to wear but I hate the way it looks on me.
Ayyyy, u look great💓
And that mask, Ahhhkkkbhhv I need it!!!
Nice mask! Looking great
The main thing is that you feel real and arrive in harmony with your body.

I'm happy for you.
:0 holy heck ur so unbelievably cute and I’m very proud of you
😄😄😘😘
You're. And thank you"	ik5ndo	trans	381	1.0	2020-08-31 20:15:29
I want to be a girl so bad	"But I can't because no matter what I do I'll always see a disgusting man in the mirror.

I can't put on makeup or nail polish because then it just makes the dysphoria worse knowing it's a *man* doing it. I can't sing since I'm reminded that my voice is too masculine. I can't even do anything since the depression and hatred for my life is all-consuming.

I don't know what to do. Life is an insufferable hell that I just want to escape.

(Pre-HRT also)"	"1. You already are a girl. Transitioning doesn't take a boy and make it a girl, it takes a girl and makes them aesthetically feminine

2. Mirrors are evil. Mirrors will always be evil. No matter how much makeup you put on, no matter how long you go on HRT, if you look hard enough, you will *always* see what your dysphoria wants you to see.

3. There's nothing wrong with men doing the things you've described. It makes them less of ""manly men"" but I really don't think that's what you're going for at all. Femboys exist and they're super cute.

4. There's nothing wrong with being a work in progress. You WILL NOT have the perfect voice after practicing for a single day. You WILL NOT be amazing at makeup your first attempt. Your sense of fashion WILL BE strange and mismatched the first times you try to put an outfit together. This should not stop you from trying. You run a marathon 1 step at a time, and with lots of practice.

5. Change for YOU and noone else. Don't change your voice so others will accept you as female, change your voice because you like how it sounds better in a more feminine way. Don't do anything for ""them"". Do it for YOU and do it unapologetically
I can relate to this over the last couple days hated the thing that was looking back at me to the point I threw up. We have to try break the cycle and build up courage to be who we are we will get there eventually stay strong 💪
i would rather be a happy woman than a sad man and as a result i have changed step by step over the last few years and on may 31st i finally have my first appointment at the endocrinologist to get hormones
Hi. I had the same feeling before. Transitioned late (started 42) and kept wearing guys clothes and avoided makeup until one day during first covid isolation my body started to look like very more feminine than masculine. And that’s where it all started for me, one year after starting hrt, thanks fat redistribution ! So, my advice, if you may, would be «  do it, but do it at your own rythm. Let your body decide when it’s time to take a specific step, never rush your body. » good luck
All I can suggest is try to shift your perspective. There is always another way to look at things~♡
Hey, I may just be some fool on the Internet, but for the past two years I was telling myself the same thing. I'm a fat ugly bugger! But now, after years of self reflection I am finally ready to become myself. All it takes is time, I think. It will hurt, but in due time I believe you will eventually come into yourself! 
Bottom line is; you may not he ready now, but with the passage of time I believe you will be! Keep fighting, you are a precious flower waiting for the right time to bloom! I believe in you! Stay strong!
IMO the best advice for you would be to try to see yourself as a woman doing it. I think that’s what helps the  for me, considering I’m 3 years away from anything. Constantly remind yourself you are not a man, and if it gets really bad maybe seek professional help. That’s just my advice, hope you get better down the road ❤️
One thing that I recently learned, my mental image of what a woman is (and what I was wanting to be) is very skewed by media, advertisement and probably a good touch of old fashioned misogyny (I've been working on that for years). Women come in all different *shapes* and *sizes*, not just the ""idealized woman"" that we tend to see everywhere in media, ads, models, etc.

This is a really hard one for me because of all the beautiful people I see everywhere and wanting to become that. Something that even most women wouldn't be able to obtain. Everybody needs to find a look that best compliments themselves and not compare it to whatever the ""idealized woman"" is.

This is a ***womanly struggle***, a result of the society we live within. Hang in there, help yourself by re-framing how you interpret yourself in the mirror and hobbies (and don't forget your potential).
Yeah, it's a tough state of mind to be in. I think the easiest way to get out of it is to detox your brain from things that may be distracting. Taking a stroll or doing chores around the house help reset my mind on things. I think it's important to realize that we NEED to make small steps and goals, and we don't have to change a ton overnight. That satisfaction in completing something drives you to the goal at the end.

I remember buying a skirt for the first time, no knowledge of anything, and I knew it felt right wearing one. If you can get HRT, I would try to. I'm not all that feminine either, but it helps being confident in your self. If you have friends that may be open to the idea, you could try coming out to them and ask them to use your pronouns.

or if it's too much, you can focus on one thing you need to do and clear other thoughts from your head, and rest.

I hope you do well, girl!
Regarding the voice. Have you tried actual voice training with an instructor? Some cis men and actually sound like a woman with training.
I’m sorry you’re going through this, I’ve been there, I call what you’re experiencing ‘Reverse Dysphoria’ where I always used to hate how I looked as a male but then I’d present female and put on makeup and just think oh my god you make an awful woman it’s almost worse looking at this pretend femme mirror monstrosity then the original sad dysphoric male.

You will grow and adjust and your self perception will change - maybe you won’t ever be a super model, god knows I’m not, but you will be *you* and that’s beautiful. Stay strong hunhun
That's about how I feel right now, don't worry girl. I always rry to remind myself that the way I look doesn't mean anything about my gender and that I am NOT a man. although its tough. That and imagining myself as more female looking while doing things, that helps me at least.

I don't know if you have a name decided on yet, but I always tell myself 'Olivia, you're gonna make it'. Something like that makes me smile.
Yeah. I feel the same way sometimes. Even if people tell me I can and am a real woman, I sometimes consider myself a foolish man trying to be someone else
Ask your parents to start hormones?
I am, unfortunately, so there with you. I have tried and tried and tried, started and stopped HRT, seen half a dozen therapists...and still all I see is grandpa in lipstick and that keeps me trapped. I'm sorry you're going through it too but if it helps at all, you're definitely not alone.
We've all been there, or are there, you're not alone. If doesnt take HRT to make you a girl... But i known what you mean and what you want. I get it, i get exactly how you feel right now. I went through the same thing, I wanted all the sweet good stuff, but doing it while ugly only made it worse. I get exactly how you feel right now.

Look at my post history, HRT is magical, hold out, because it WILL get better. It WILL get better. I promise, it just takes time. In the mean time: exersize! Do cardio and exersizes that normally women (squats squats babyyy) would do! It'll go a LONG way to help appearence and help with dysphoria because you'll know you're doing something that helps.

If you need another online safe space my twitch channel, and a friend's are both amazing and you can join his discord.

It will get better, i promise
Do it. The trappings of masculinity your holding onto aren’t giving you safety, they are chains. Even if your the ugliest manliest girl in the world, it will be better to be an ugly girl than a miserable man. Be yourself. Lies, hurt. Don’t live one forever.
Honestly the best thing I could recommend is therapy. Not just gender therapy but therapy in general. I’m enby and it helped me so much to get things off my chest and discuss things with a professional. They can also give practical advice to try and help you! I’m AFAB and I want a flat chest, I don’t have it. What I learned to try and think was that tits aren’t feminine. If you aren’t male then nothing about your body is masc if you don’t want it to be. You’ll be beautiful and valid at every step in this journey.
Remember: you are a work in progress. Like a canvas with some strokes of paint on it and you can't see the full painting yet. Brave the mirror every day and tell yourself out aloud: ""I'm a work in progress. I am working on myself. I am allowed to fail and learn."" Do this while applying makeup on yourself. Dare to feel confident and allow yourself to play. It's YOUR face. It's YOUR body. And I'm sure someday you will look exactly how you want to look. I hope this helps! 😊
you ARE a woman, darling.  you are a beautiful, valid, vibrant, and so very loved woman.
You are a girl. It may be hard to see it now but that’s your dysphoria talking. I know it’s hard and as I’m FTM, it’s hard for me to give correct advice, but it will get better :) please keep holding on.
Looks so NOT equate to gender. You are a woman even if you have hair everywhere and a voice like a lumberjack you are a WOMAN so kick out that voice that says it’s a man doing it bc it’s not
You are a girl
I related to this at first, i used to cringe when looking myself in the mirror wearing feminine clothes because all i saw was a man in a dress so i do know the painful feel. 

 If i can give you some tips i would suggest have your facial hair freshly shaved before wearing any feminine clothes this will help look less manly from our society point of view. Try longer clothes that would cover your legs and your arms to hide any body hairs you might have left.  If you want to try nail polish use a darker color like black instead of a bright pink. You could try a girl deodorant and see  if you like to smell cute or not.  

The man in a dress vibe is often internalize transphobia coming from our toxic society, toxic masculinity or homophobic/transphobic family.  Like you know you kinda want this but at the same time you dont want to be like this.

Speaking for myself body hairs including beard is one of my main source of dysphoria so i always need to shave before wearing makeup or anything gender affirming.

Hope this help and i know transition is scary but you are safe here and everything will be ok❤
So can relate. Women have it easier than guys too
Dysphoria is a BITCH, you r you and thats why we love you. Be as feminine or as masculine as u want, be who you want to be!
Me too me too
I would kiss you and love you if you loved me.
Such brillant advice! I read your words and they are helping me as well. Thank you!
Damn, i needed this
I- thank you. You don’t know how much I needed this
THIS
I love this so much
So eloquent... I think we all needed this
Amazing and eloquently put! 💋🦊
Ya id rather be a girl with a deeper voice than a depressed guy with no purpose in life
This is so true. Just be yourself.
I'd rather be a sad woman than a sad man
That’s my 20th birthday and 3 days before my 6 months on e
it already got really bad. I can't even do my hobbies anymore since they always remind me of my flesh prison.

I have a gender therapist and everything (I'm very, very privileged), but it's just awful since no matter what I do it always reminds me of my testosterone-mutilated body.
I’m never going to be a passable female but I’ll definitely feel more feminine than I did before I started HRT and sometimes I get brief moment of euphoria.
I voice train on my own and have a semi-good voice (it's still awful but I sort of like it), but when my body doesn't pass to me, even if my voice were 100% fem it would still sting knowing how I'm a man doing a girl voice rather than a woman.

and yes I know my body doesn't determine my gender, but I just want it to not be this mutilated abomination from testosterone.
I'm on the road to HRT, but it's slow and agonizing
[deleted]
well I mean both sides have it bad
Same.
madam just think of it like a work in progress. you don't open a box and expect a finished project, its putting it together thats the best part. there is a discord where you can get all kinds of advice on everything you listed above and i highly recommend you reserve judgement on yourself for a ways down the road after HRT. 

i am a straight man but i fell in love with a beautiful trans lady whom struggled to see herself as a woman until she got Bottom Surgery, but she was truly the most beautiful lady i have been with today and if it hadn't been for her dream job taking her overseas, i'm sure we would be together still.

One day madam you will look in the mirror and see the most beautiful lady and even if you don't see her, you'll find someone whom will never stop telling you you are the most beautiful person they ever seen and are happy to have you.

Take care and we are always here for you.
You may not pass as your own definition, but there is a lot more variation in humans, so while you may not achieve what you think you need to pass, you may actually pass to some people \~ or at some point it becomes moot (if society grows and matures more)
>I’m never going to be a passable ~~female~~ woman

Fixed that for you. 

I also felt like that, still do sometimes if feeling a bit down. Although about 10 months into transition (7 months HRT), some guy said I was beautiful and gave me his number. Not into guys, but damn did it boost my confidence.
I can only imagine the discomfort of waiting to start, here in the USA we have informed consent, just sign a paper and done. Hopefully you start soon and have a big smile when you get your first dose.
Internalize transphobia doesnt mean you hate transpeople or have something against them its more of a thing where you dont want to be trans or struggle to accept it. If you think i just made this up google it internalize transphobia is very real
It’s just all about living as yourself. Don’t let anybody else control who or what you want to be. In the more people that come out as transgender the better off it is for the community so join the club.
Yup yup yup."	maldnu	trans	373	0.99	2021-03-22 11:35:00

I am trans.	"My clinical psychologist told me to write a letter about how I feel. I've already told them that I'm wanting to transition (mtf) they told me that I didn't have to share this letter with anyone, but I'm sharing it with all of you.

I've had a lot of time to think about it, for a long time I've had this feeling of being uncomfortable in the body of a boy, being called he, and being called my name, I questioned it a lot before I realized but didn't really know, but I've finally realized a few months ago what this feeling was, it was gender dysphoria.

I want to transition and live as who I really am, a girl, this wasn't a choice, I have this feeling even though I don't want to, if I could choose to not have it and just be cis then I would, but I have to accept reality, and the reality is that I'm trans, I'm glad that I realized it at this time when I'm still during puberty, I want to go on puberty blockers and hormone treatment eventually when I can, please accept me for who I am, I'm not your son, I'm your daughter, I'm not your brother, I'm your sister, I'm not your nephew, I'm your niece, I'm not a man, I'm a woman, I am trans, and I've finally accepted myself, so please accept me too."	"Beautiful. Brought a tear to my eye. Good luck in the future. X
Congratulations! Good luck on what's next and I hope you become fully who you are inside.
Ahhh, that's a beautiful letter! Good luck on the rest of the journey, sis!
We’re with you too. Best of luck along the way
this is really swag, ngl.
I’m sooo happy for you💖💖💖 I wish to be as brave as you, I’m very scared, even to ask my mom to go to a therapist, it’s frowned upon where I live, and also I don’t feel “trans enough” to become a girl, the time is passing by and I’m struggling as my male features become more developed, some day I hope to be as fearless as u
i’m so proud of you!! you’ve reached a huge milestone and i’m very happy for you <3
Of course I accept you! Honey you are just as worthy as everyone here! I know what it’s like to be not accepted and bullied for my trans and other differences. 

If you ever need any friend I’m here for you! I know this pain only it’s FTM and I remember being so upset when mom put me in a dress before. I totally understand
If you're curious about why you where encouraged to write the letter. Its a cognitive excercise in making thought reality. Words are thought given form. So by writing the letter, you make it tangible. This same technique is used with traumatic experiences to act like a catharsis. Usually in those cases its encouraged to destroy the letter in some fashion, as an act of cleansing said traumas.

In your case, its to make your transition official in your mind. Hence why the letter was intended for you. It's really you, who you're writing to.

As others have said, congratulations. First step, into a larger world. Enjoy your journey.
Don't worry everything will be okay in the end 😊"	mu1guh	trans	368	0.99	2021-04-19 14:12:34
Being trans makes me feel so alone	"I am not sure if other people can relate to this, but being trans feels like I am just left alone and even when having rather supportive friends. I can never feel like I fit in. Always with dysphoria being there, always questioning why did this have to be this way and just constantly trying to improve and fit somehow in, but still just not feel like I am completely included.

It's not that others could be more respectful and understanding since even when I had great people, I still feel like I am not fully where I want. It feels wrong to be stuck in this body and I always feel like an imposter.

I have to constantly seek the support of others, resulting in making me feel bad, since it can not just be natural, like with others girls. My friends are supportive, but I don't know if they can fully understand or even help me with this. 

So, rn I don't know where I can really feel I belong and can fully be okay (though often it's not the people, but more just myself not feeling like I am fully myself with the restrictions I am facing with my body). I know I am asking for a lot, though I just don't have any other clue what to do except reach out and maybe get some help to manage this. HRT will already be good and it will be necessary for me to ever feel like I am not stuck in a reality I do not want to be in, but can actually enjoy.

I just want to be okay and have a life as the girl I am, not as a trans-girl, who was born in the wrong body and is **constantly** reminded by almost everyone and everything of that, even when almost always it's not intended and my mind just goes that way.

EDIT: I changed some things, since I realised some things might sound like others are the ""issue"", while in reality I feel it's mostly just myself and my mind feeling out of place and still restricted by my body."	"I feel you. I feel how the dysphoria will never go away.

Just this week we got a second (i think) trans woman at work. You'd think I'd be all yay about it but I'm not. Complete opposite in fact, since she's much much more passable. I hate it. I hate myself. And i hate that i have too hate myself and everyone around me. Being trans sucks.
Being *early in transition* can be hard. Being Trans isn't the problem. There is a whole lot more to being Trans than what you've experienced so far. It's not going to stay like this forever. :)
Yeah I get it. Feeling lonely right now too and also very early in transition. Sometimes I just feel I have nobody irl who understands. Feel free to DM me, us girls need to stick together  😉
Yes. Like nobody understands me. Plus I'm scared for my life to express my true self
As FTM, I absolutely feel this too, I found more me that I was extremely uncomfortable trying to *act* as much like a dude as possible. Not only was it new and strange for my friends, but I myself was awkward. I realized that ultimately they are my friends looking to hang out with their friend… and not some weird stereotype. Just like how you cant get obsessed with old male stereotypes, you cant let female mannerisms work you up like that. I suggest practice in the mirror or to yourself, but don’t be worked up about every little detail of passing when around your friends. You dont have to prove anything to them, your habits and mannerisms that are more girly will be natural in time. Hope this helps! :>
So far early in the transition (opened up 2 months ago to family and friends) it is kinda lonely even tho i have friends and family on my side BUT most people i’ve talked to says it can in the start like you’re still getting into the mindset who you really want to be. It will get better slowly but surely and hey you always got all of us in this thread we all love you and you’re so strong 💖
it'll get better hun just wait for hrt to start and you'll feel better I promise
I can feel your pain. Your story made me realized just how many of my 65 years I have felt the same way. Thank you.
We're a relatively small population, and it can feel very isolating. I went to a trans picnic event this summer in the Local Big City (seattle for me) and there was an estimated 300-500 of us there over the course of the afternoon.

Seeing so many filled my heart in a way I didn't know I needed. I'm part of a local support group, but it wasn't the same. 

We are there. There's other of us around. But it can feel isolating but know you're not alone.
Is there a local LGBT+ community where you live? I'm joining one myself for similar reasons. My friends are amazing and supportive, but they just don't ""get it"", and I don't think I can expect them to understand me either. My hope is that a LGBT+ community will be a much nicer space to share frustrations and discuss relevant topics than my other friends ever could be.
I struggled with the same feeling (and still do, sometimes) for a long time. The best thing that happened for me was making a whole bunch of other trans friends, specifically other trans women. Having a baseline of relatability like that did so much more for me than any other friends, even if they were queer in some way too. 

And, like some others have said, things will get better. As you get more comfortable you may find yourself totally blossoming and feeling like a whole new person.
I don’t think I have the words to help you because everything you said, I feel exactly the same. I just want you to know that in that aspect at least, you’re not alone.
there's a reason I only socialize online in vr these days. I found a group of amazing people and I talk to them every day, my best friends.

It really seems online is the only way to find truly good people anymore.
i feel that, hell most of the time when im just in casual conversation with someone i'll just have the sudden thought of ""somethings off. shit, it's me"" and then i kinda just get more and more distant as the conversation goes on. however i have found a way that sorta fixes that for me, and yeah this is gonna sound cliche af but i just sorta think to myself ""shut the fuck up you stupid bitch, the only thing thats wrong here is your fear of estrangement"" and then it goes away a little lol
I feel this so hard, I feel so sad and alone right now, I don't want to do to be honest with you, I'm not okay
Omg this, there's this person in my school who passes as girl and everyone talks about them, I don't even know if they're trans or just a femboy, anyway I feel like it's a competition and I'll have harder time passing.
Sadly it really does and I don't know how much you can improve it except waiting for surgeries or HRT. Though I know at one point the transition will be done enough, that you and I can be ourselves and not have to worry about appearing as feminine as possible at all time, so we don't experience dysphoria
Yup. No matter what, it's always there. The pressure mostly comes from within, scrutinizing every little thing that is different from the people that are born that way.

I never realized how much jealousy and envy play a role in being trans until I started to transition. Hopes and dreams are crushed when hormones do diddley squat to make you into the person you thought you'd be one day, because we're constantly told what a miracle it is and how it'll change us all. 

Then you can't help but compare yourself to those that have it naturally. We want it so bad and yet, it seems like for so many of us, we never get there and just have to accept that it is what it is. Inner peace is the only way through.
I hope so and I partly already know that in my mind, though it's hard to still deal with the beginning when so many things seem to be wrong
No the problem is definitely being trans.
I feel you both and I often am dealing with the same thing. I particularly live in a small town where is mostly senior citizens and not really understanding so I have to deal with loneliness and negative reactions all the time.
You can both DM too if you ever feel like taking! We would understand each other at least in trans related stuff and definitely to feel less lonely
I will if I find some time. Though sadly an issue with online is the fact I can not meet them irl easily or really have any close connection except over the internet. It's nice, though I want to finally be irl myself and have people that can assist and support me with being myself.
Same
Thank u for the nice comment and it does help a bit. Though I feel like mainly it's really just social inclusion, and I often appear out of place or not fully integrated by others, especially look-wise since I am pre-HRT. Still, despite most of my friends being great, the dysphoria and always that feeling of imposter syndrome makes me feel so excluded, even when I am included in a lot of things. Almost always they don't have much influence, except that my own mind is reminded and feels bad again.
It's alright and tbh I am not sure if there is something I can do, except be honest with my friends and reach out for the support and assistance I need whenever it comes up. I wish you a lot of luck and hopefully, we both can manage it better in the future.
yup. most cis men have a higher chance of looking female than I ever will.
I really wish that were the case for me. I'm fairly certain i have aspergers which has explained and further complicated my life. I'll literally never be comfortable, no matter what.
I feel that! From one stranger to another, I hope you all the confidence you need to relieve this dysphoria. Best of lucks!"	pum2ww	trans	369	0.99	2021-09-24 15:24:22
I usually don't post anything on this subreddit because I suffer from dysphoria and I'm afraid of someone judging me and I just feel so alone in this world.😔		"You are a beatifull creature, and this place is safe, plis feel free to post as much as you want
Dysphoria shouldn't be allowed to win when you look this fire!
You are so lovely! I wish I had even half your skill at winged liner, and your glow is just goals!
I judge that you look great.
Sweetie you are out of this world.  Your makeup is gorgeous, your hair is shiny, and your top is the perfect color for your skin tone.
So many of us trans people feel alone and isolated. So most of us can relate to you. But we're with you in spirit damn.  I wish that more of us could get together in person.
You simply look great, period. Be proud of who you are, not what others think you should be.
You are beyond beautiful i hope im as pretty as you at the end of my transition
You’re incredibly beautiful! I think that there will always be doubters and haters and the most famous people also have the most haters. 

Please don’t let anyone bring you down. You look so good! I aspire to be as feminine as you are 😍
I loved your makeup😍😍
Don't be afraid, we all feel the same around here
Ur so gorgeous!! 💕
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

the new pixar movie gave me dysphoria	"Yea, i know it sounds silly but im not joking .

One of the big themes is womanhood and growing up, and it gave me lots of existential dysphoria. I will never have a period and i will never go through female puberty.
I felt like i had no right to eatch the movie because im not a REAL girl and the movie isnt for me, and while i did like the movie, i didnt enjoy it as much because i felt so dysphoric.
Once again, i know its really stupid but i feel quite bad about it. Plz tell me im a girl in the comments"	"I'm a trans man, my roommate is making us watch this movie right now, and I absolutely hate it. I can't tactfully get out of this but I would rather get teeth drilled than continue watching this movie.
I actually felt the movie to be very empowering. Maybe you can think of it this way. The main character doesn’t even go through puberty or start her period in the movie, at least as far as we know. Her experience is different from the other girls, and she thinks she’s an unlovable monster because of it. But when her friends find out, she isn’t met with fear or hate, but with love and curiosity. They say she’s still her, and she’s still their friend, and she’s still a girl. It’s something they’re all unfamiliar with, but they learn and adapt together, and are all still just teenage girls together. She even is able to have some amount of solidarity with her family members who are like her by the end

I think this story could be interpreted in a very trans way, if this perspective helps, and it’s important to remember that the message of the movie is that growing up and your body changing is hard, and though they used a cis girl in their story, the same feelings of confusion, solitude, and fear are universal to most everybody’s puberty experiences, cis or trans. And of course the other message of balancing family tradition but also individualism, and how kids and especially parents have to compromise and learn, which could also have some trans interpretations but that’s not as relevant to this posts

Regardless, you are a real girl, no matter how this movie makes you feel. Women are more than a sun of their parts and functions. There’s no checklist of things you have to have to be a woman, you just are one. Everybody’s bodies are different, and that’s not even a cis/trans comparison. So no matter what other women experience or do, that doesn’t invalidate your womanhood
Hey! “Real” girls aren’t defined by their body, and neither are you!

You are a very beautiful girl and you deserve hugs and validation!
I know how you feel. Its soooo anoying that our brains cant  just ignore dysphoria but will ignore euphoria whenever they like :<
You Are A Real Girl. And while the movie is about puberty, there's a trans message there too, when all the other women in the family released their pandas, it was viewed as letting go of a curse, with Mei, she accepted that part of her. Aren't we supposed to learn self-love.

Trust me, the wish is still in me, to function and be like other women, but that's something I have to work on.
Weirdly enough, as a trans man, I actually really enjoyed the film. Maybe it's because I love Chinese culture and I also grew up in the early 2000s (plus love that aesthetic), but I thought the movie was relatable in a way. 

I also didn't realize I was trans until college, so I grew up pretty girly.

I think if I had watched this when I first came out, I would have felt massive dysphoria. It's been a few years since then, and I've definitely gotten more comfortable in the idea that I'm pretty femme for a ""typical"" trans man.
You are a GIRL, and you are beautiful!
The results from the gender lab came in and it's official. You're a girl!
I have no idea if this helps, but a cis friend of mine had an incredibly late puberty that needed medical intervention to even fully start. She can’t relate to coming-of-age stories because she lived a very different experience, and *she* feels uncomfortable watching movies like these in a *very similar* way to you! Both of yall are absolutely not unwomaned for not havingThe Puberty Experience TM. 

Im positive that theres *tons* of stories where other gals cant relate to these puberty themed stories ^^

>Edited for clarity
I absolutely understand this. when cis women talk about periods and shit I get really in my own head about how I'm not cis and I'll never experience some of it. it's really upsetting.

however - you are a woman, nothing, not even biology can change that. you are who you are and no one but you gets to dictate that.
It's not stupid. These feelings are completely natural and it's ok to grieve the childhood/coming-of-age you wish you had. The most important thing is to not let it consume you.

I'm not sure what movie it is, but you have as much right to watch it as anyone. You deserve to revel in your womanhood as much as anyone. If not moreso. Your feminity is so incredibly bright and strong it shattered the incorrectly assumed AGAB and screamed ""I AM A WOMAN"" despite every obstacle. It refuses to be denied.

I hope this doesn't sound invalidating, I absolutely understand how painful that longing can be, but just for the record female puberty and periods does NOT a real woman make. I went through it and I am most certainly a man.

This might sound a little weird but would it help to give yourself a few pieces of the girlhood you're wishing for? Better late than never? Buy a cute plushie. Make friendship bracelets. Get some cute glitter temporary tattoos. I suffered a highly abusive childhood and I find that giving myself some of the things I missed can be incredibly healing.
Oh honey, you are a sacred soul and as true a woman as I am. 

Hold that truth close to your heart and don’t let anyone take it from you. You are worthy and beautiful simply because you are a living being. You are a wonder.
You are a girl and always will be a girl unless you are to say otherwise so be true to yourself before you change into something you aren’t.☺️
Trans woman here, i avoid that movie harder than i avoid the virus.
I feel the same way and I’m glad for your post. All those things you watched from a distance, but will never get to go back and be a part of that club. It’s weird but it hurts.
Same except the other way round, I’m afab and it sucks
If you feel bad because of the movie, it's the movie's fault  
Now gimme a hug you cute girl <3
Same! Though for opposite reasons. I'm agender afab and I love the movie so much. It was really good. And I think it's awesome they brought up periods and puberty and stuff in the movie. I just made me feel dysphoric is all because I hate having my periods because it makes Dysphoric.
You are absolutely a real girl! Those experiences aren't the definition of girlhood. They are just a part of some girls' experiences. You are having your own girl experience tailored to the beautiful, unique person you are. Own yourself and be proud!
Honestly one of the biggest themes about the movie for me was becoming a woman (or who you’re meant to be). You ARE a woman! That’s who you’re meant to be!
You are a girl!
^(i totally understand)

I can barely stand the first 2 *minutes* of that movie...let alone the intro. Holy shit it hurts.Sorry, I also dislike dysphoria with a passion, ^(but also, Meilin turns into a red panda when her emotions are high. That doesn't immediately say she's on her period or whatever, she just turns into a big red panda when she's really upset, really happy, really sad etc.-)I feel so many 'grown up feels' with a lot of other 'harmless kid movies' too. No, I'm not going to list them, because that would entail I have to remember stuff-Sorry, got off task basically, I understand both pov's

What the hell do I understand? I couldn't make it past the first five minutes

but other than thatall I asked for was ^(some gay princess/prince action or literally anything OTHER than cis/straight propaganda)But NO^(OOOOOOooo)Can we just get some movies where a kid goes through their transition or a kid has respectable parents and uses they/them instead of she/her or he/him, why not make non-cis kids comfortable too?

Anyhoo, that was a lot, but big take away, You're a beautiful woman and don't let anyone tell you different\~

UPDATE: I tried to watch more of it, and it made me feel even more shitty. It's transphobic without meaning to be (or so i hope)""Only women have periods"" That's just cis people being stupid.Anyone born with a uterus tends to have periods, while anyone born without a uterus doesn't, that's facts. But I do understand that it feels like a gut punch when it's said over and over and forced in trans peoples faces. (trust me I understand)I also didn't like how they basically said it's not okay to have (romantic/sexual) fantasy's...most people do, minus ace/aro/etc people. That's just how human brains are, we all think about it.

We are who we are and no one can say we don't know, i know myself better than anyone, just like you know yourself better than anyone.
I got the exact same feeling but in the completely opposite way lmao, peoples experiences with their bodies don't define who they are take it from me. You're a beautiful girl, always were and always will be.
I can understand on some level, obviously I’ll never understand because I’m not a trans girl but I can empathize with being jealous of those being able to go through the puberty you were meant to. You will be able to go through female puberty one day and even without you are still a girl, you will be a woman and try your best to remember that
Hopefully someone will make a movie for trans girls and ur a beautiful strong girl btw
Periods have been stigmatized for centuries. Period huts, period poverty, etc..Let this movie exist without having to pick it apart because you don’t experience periods. Ffs. 💀
Yeah I feel the same way it makes it feel really inclusive to anyone feminine and not afab, it peddles a positive story but only applies to a select few individuals and even then enforces toxic beauty standards. it's just another soulless shitty piece of popular media cranked out by a big corporation and made by underpaid and overworked animators. All that not to mention the unappealing cookie cutter art style and half assed gags. It's just a bad movie backed by Disney and therefore is immediately inducted withing popular culture as a good piece of media. The sooner we stop praising movies like this and Disney movies in general the better
You're touched in the head, friend.
What film?
I don’t think it’s stupid, and is understandable that this movie made you feel that way. You’re a girl, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!!

I myself loved the movie when I watched it for the first time, on my own. Then I made the mistake of watching reaction videos to it(because I’m lonely🥲), and it made me feel so much dysphoria. I have never had a lot of dysphoria about my period unless people make a big deal about it, so I just found it relatable and funny while watching the movie. But then a lot of people watching it were making remarks of “this is so relatable for girls. Only girls can understand the difficulty. Etc” and suddenly I was like “I found it relatable, I have a period…But I’m not a girl!!”. So yeah, I still love the movie but thanks to reviews I don’t think I’ll be able to enjoy it again without feeling extremely dysphoric.
I haven’t seen it and I do t wanna see it unless I wanna feel like shit. I did see clips that made me dysphoric asf tho.
This is actually why I liked it so much, I thought the same thing.
This. We beat ourselves up WAY too much!! And hopefully OP can get to a place in life where she doesn’t need people to tell her she’s a real girl. 

You are.
THIS
Thank you so much i needed to hear that💜
Just reading this made me feel better about myself thank you
It's not really something all of us can work on. Realistically some of it is a type of body dysphoria which has no successful treatment. Transition is a good treatment to a lot of aspects of gender dysphoria, but some can't effectively be treated.

I've accepted that I will be dysphoric to some degree all my life, genetically compatible uterus cloning is just not going to be available within my lifetime and is needed for permanent uterus transplants, but that just means there is no effective treatment. Talk therapy can help curb the symptoms and give me space to vent but I am trapped by the limits of the era I was born into.

The limitation needs to be accepted, but that won't fix it.
Let me guess. You don't experience dysphoria? Dysphoria is a thing and it is NOT something we control. If you actually want to learn, here you go: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
Pretty sure they’re referring to Turning red

"""You're not trans if you WANT to be <gender>, you need to FEEL like one"""	"WTF is this bullshit? And most of the time coming from a cis person who has *no fucking idea* how to feel like ANYTHING other than their AGAB. Not to mention that this is invalidating to a shitton of trans people, some of which might then go ""oh I'm not trans enough"" and go back into the closet and live a miserable life instead of transitioning and living happily as themselves.

The last straw for me was hearing this from a therapist. And I was like BRUH?! You studied dysphoria, you should *know* what that is!!!

It just baffles me that some people see wanting to be another gender as something absolutely cis. I sense some deep denial here and I don't know how to convince them otherwise. Not sure if it's worth it either. I really wish this gatekeeping would just stop."	"It‘s frustrating when people ask for specific words or phrases, especially when you‘re still struggling for words.  

I remember wanting to scream when I was young  „Look, I feel like a boy! I‘m a boy, I just don‘t know why I‘m a boy!“, but shame kept me from telling anyone that well past my 20s birthday.
People with no argument will fall back on semantics in a desperate attempt to sound smarter than they are. Cis people's criticisms of our language should just mostly be ignored.
Not sure I understand, is there a scenario where someone would want to be a specific gender if they didn’t feel they already are?  Like I may hate myself deeply because of my features but I’ve still always felt like I was a girl/woman despite being AMAB.

Are there people that want to transition but don’t actually feel like they are that gender?
when i was questioning, i expressed my feelings to my friend group. i told them ""every time i see myself in the mirror, i just get this sense of dread and i wish so badly that i was a boy""

one of them told me ""being trans isnt ***wanting*** to be the other gender, its feeling like you ***are*** the other gender"" which is part of why it took me sooo damn long to actually accept myself. worst part? ***theyre trans too.*** 

they arent my friend anymore, thankfully. completely ghosted me and refused to tell anybody what i did, but for some reason they said i was toxic. looking back though they are definitely the toxic one and im glad they left haha
Well I DON'T FEEL like a woman and DONT WANT to be one either. 

Still valid? 🤣
To be honest, cis people have no idea what it's like to be trans. They should not be the ones gate-keeping you from transitioning. Other trans people can help you understand if you're trans, but cis people can only guess what it's like to be trans.
THANK YOU!

This sort of thing is why it took me so long to realize/accept that I was trans. I always felt like I was being disrespectful to trans people if I wasn’t constantly depressed and dysphoric. I DID want to be a girl, but that was because I felt like I was SUPPOSED to be a girl and it just didn’t match up. I didn’t care about my genitals, but I didn’t want anyone having ANY idea what was going on down there, I hated being even semi naked around people, and I gravitated toward “girl” in everything I did (characters in video games, playing pretend on the playground, self-insert OCs in my bad fanfic). I identified with being a girl and I didn’t even understand at the time that I did. I spent a long time not knowing being trans was a thing, and everyone around me just conflates it with being gay (I grew up in the South).

I was unsure, but ever since I said “I am a trans woman” and started to identify myself as such, I’ve felt so much better. I realized that everyone was just projecting things on to me because they didn’t understand the reality of the situation, and I was letting them, because I didn’t understand either. I feel like this kind of thing isn’t talked about enough, honestly.
Why do we even need to validate or prove ourselves to others? Why can't we just exist in peace?
I'm not sure there's a difference between wanting it and feeling it. Recognizing yourself in the mirror as your true gender is a different story, but that usually only comes with transition. I think the weirdest part of this argument is when you try to turn it back on the cis person. Here's a conversation I had with my mom son after coming out:

""How do you know? What makes you think you're a woman?""

""How do *you* know *you're* a woman?""

""Well, I just am. I was born a woman.""

""Ok, me too.""

The thing is, cis people also don't really know how to articulate what it means to *feel* like their gender. They just know it on a deep, intrinsic level. Their attempts to say why always comes down to the genitals they were born with, even if they believe trans people are their true gender, because they can't imagine the separating between physical and subconscious sex. They've lived with the two matching their entire lives, so they can't tell the difference. We also have a hard time articulating why we are or feel like our true gender beyond that we just know it. We just don't have the birth genitals reason to fall back on. So cis people demand some sort of proof from us. But if you asked them for proof of their gender that didn't involve sex assigned at birth they'd be at just as much of a loss.
i didn’t realize i felt like a man until i wanted to be a man
By that logic, if a CIS woman doesn't WANT to be a woman because her dad favors her brothers or her male coworkers earn more money than she does, then she is NOT A WOMAN?
I feel you, sometimes I feel like I need to have 10 years of experience working as a lawyer in court just to be able to talk to a therapist. I can never get my point across, and not get any weird counterpoint on their side that has nothing to do with what I was saying.

They are ALWAYS listening to every individual word that you say, and every word that you don't say. It's maddening going to therapy. Really hard to find a good one who doesn't want to feel smart by contradicting you with some word nonsense
hey, just to clear things up, I'm cis and not once have i ever thought that. idk why other cis people want y'all to prove yourselves, I'm sorry.
I definitely WANTED to be a girl before I realized I NEEDED to be a girl. Aligning my physical self with my spiritual self was a necessity for me
I recently came out to a trans woman that I finally accepted myself as transfemme a few weeks ago, something I've been repressing my whole life.  She replied with ""You're not trans.  You have to be on hormones and have surgery.""

I'm just glad I responded by blocking her and not letting it stop me.
If only it were so easy.

People don't feel like men, or women, or neither at all.  In order to do that, we would have know things that are inherently unknowable, understand experiences that *cannot* be understood theoretically.  The only thing that anyone can feel like is *themselves*.  Someone who says that ""I feel like a man"" is, at best, compressing a massive, disjointed set of observations through the abstraction of simple language resulting in a statement that is true in a sense and yet almost wholly fabricated.  When I say people, I mean *all* people.  Ask any cisgender person wholly secure in their gender identity to justify that identity and they are no better at it than we are.  They will offer vague bits of evidence, signs, patterns.  They might wrap them in compelling language that lends it an air of credibility, but the evidence is scant and scattered.

And how could it not be?  Identity exists below the level of executive function.  This is what I mean when I say that it is unknowable:  the building blocks of who you are are not assembled by intent, logic, and reason.  The truth of who you are is buried so deeply that you can only find the shape of it by indirect abstraction.  

That it is generally understood that a trans person *knows* what their gender is in truth is perhaps the most singularly damaging idea ever leveled at a group of people.  It supposes that we can do something no one else on the planet can and find absolute certainty where no one else can.  We can't, and that we can't hurts so god damn much that we have invented an entire pleasant metaphor to describe the soul-shredding quest we all feel compelled to make because *trans people feel like a specific gender.*

The closest to the essential facts I've ever been able to approach in my own words relies on all sorts of martial imagery.  I dig in and string out the barbed wire.  I'll be on the line.  My time after my egg cracked was a last stand.  None of these are objective truths or measurable facts, just my own inadequate attempt to convey something I can can never quite grasp.  And yet all of this imagery of battle and violence and desperation only ever addresses the struggle to define myself.  To stay with a martial metaphor, I can tell you how desperately and valiantly I have fought, but I have never once been able to understand *why* I needed to dig those trenches and string the barbed wire.  Absent is what I'm fighting.  The enemy has no face, no opinions, no ideas.  They offer no terms of peace or surrender.  I do this because it is visceral and evocative.  I do this because there *is* truth in the metaphor.  I do this because a phrases like ""digging in"" do a better job of conveying what denial felt like.  I do this because saying that I was ""in a last stand"" makes it easier to talk about a period of my life where walking off a tall building seemed like a pretty good idea.  I do this because a war story never requires that you understand the enemy.

I can't tell you, in truth, what the enemy even is.  Is it my identity?  Social expectations?  My inability to grasp who I am in full?  Some terrible alliance of all of the above?  I've no idea.  [What I do know is that when Abigail Thorn described how she always felt as if the fellow in the mirror, the one that other people saw, was someone else - someone that she knew and desperately wanted to be, but somehow couldn't.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AITRzvm0Xtg)  There are technical terms for that feeling - dissociation and depersonalization - and but we as a community usually just call it dysphoria.  Even here we don't see much in the way of defining what our identity is, only what it *isn't*.  It is fitting that this feeling of what we are not - however it manifests - is what lies at the heart of the technical classification of our experience.

Which makes it rather odd that a therapist of all people, someone who should well and truly comprehend that technical classification, would suppose that it requires an additional step of knowing who you *actually* are.  They work in a profession that exists in no small part because of just how *impossible* that task is.
What? That’s like, literally part of the definition
But if that’s true, then I’m not cis, which is preposterous, as I’m like totally cis and not at all trans
I have been a cis male my entire life. This new side of me just grew one day and it tears me apart. Do I want it, do I think it would make me happier, yes and yes. In reality though, who wants to lose their status as a man just to become a demographic the world seems a minority or less than human for that matter. I don’t give a fuck what anyone says, I KNOW WHAT IM EXPERIENCING, and I don’t need someone’s approval or validation to understand what I’m going through. I supported Tom Gabel, now Laura Jean Grace, and all I want in return is someone too do the same for me. Blows my mind people just don’t know how to treat people like people. You only need three things too be a good person: don’t judge based on appearance, treat people how they want to be treated, leave the world a better place than you received it. THATS IT! And we can’t even do that. I fucking hate this world.
Reminds me of how often we get people coming into this sub in denial about being trans. “I’m a cis guy but I’ve always wanted to be a woman, how can I ignore this and continue being cis?”
Who says that? ""Queer friendly"" therapists?

That's literally what gender dysphoria is!
Someone can tell me what is AMAB?
[removed]
Your therapist is technically correct but they are ignoring the consequences that you feel about their actions
True. And it's even more frustrating when the question is deliberately misleading. Like, I don't want to be a girl *or* a guy bcuz I'm an enby. But the question was ""do you want to be the opposite gender?"" And if I answer truthfully, then by these truscum rules, I'm not trans. And I can't be bothered to explain enbies to every truscum I meet.
As someone who aspires to be a linguist I FUCKING HATE THIS.

And almost without fail, their semantic arguments just fall apart if you know the slightest thing about linguistics or historical linguistics. 

They fall on prescriptivist arguments (which does have its place but only in specific areas that need to have specific meanings with no room for interpretation, like in science or air traffic control, not conversational speech), but those arguments are ALSO very weak because it just means “well this is what I mean when I say this word, so therefore everybody should use it similarly”. 

They ignore context, social differences, other dialects and regional verbiage, language change*, etc. Its usually either a very ignorant argument, or a dishonest one. 

*Ive heard people say that language change does happen, but it should only be “natural” change that isn’t guided by a conscious effort by individuals/political motivation. This is ALSO bullshit and ahistorical. Much of the English language’s history has been influenced dramatically by intentional efforts. I can only assume that it similar for most languages.
I've seen some people say things like ""I wish I was a girl but I don't feel like one, guess I'm cis"". So yes, I think that's possible.

There's actually a [good article](https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5) about this.
That’s me. It took me 32 years to realize I’m trans because I only ever heard the narrative that trans people “just know”.

I didn’t “know”, and even now, I feel more like being a man is the gender that suits my personality and interests better and I don’t want the social pressure of people interacting with me as a woman and expecting me to be womanly, but it took me a good few years before I really felt like i am a man
I’m confused as I personally have so much to loose- family,daughter,house,pond,pets,wife: she is deeply trans phobic. Currently I’m pretending to be a man but want to transition and still questioning if I am a woman as I don’t want to implode my life unnecessarily… 

I guess I feel more like a trans woman every day. Back to the question: yes I imagine their are people that want to transition without feeling like  that gender already…
[deleted]
This actually so me but the other way around but I'm still in the ""trying to accept phase"" but this definitely helps me a lot by seeing this...I've started by trying out he/him pronouns online and I must say it's been a positive feeling so far but somewhere in my mind I'm still full of doubt 😖
I think about that every day I get too nervous to further my transition. 

Why do people have to care? Why does it matter SO MUCH to people if I want to act differently? I get it can be a weird or uncomfortable concept to some people, but there are weird and uncomfortable concepts to me and it’s not like I’m looking down on them and dictating their lives. 

Man, I love humanity but it is cruel way way too often.
Same!
Which is why you find out the *reason* behind wanting to be a different gender. I would've understood if it was worded like ""You're not *necessarily* trans just because of that, there could be more reasons"", not straight up ""no u cant be trans bcuz of this one word u said"".
Allies like you give me hope. You're making this world a better place.
Wow. This was really long... and beautiful. I just felt the emotions while reading this.

Also, fellow Abigail Thorn enjoyer, nice. I listened to her story after I cracked, and that bit with not realizing yourself in the mirror was so relatable.
So that's kinda what I thought until I finally figured out at 49 that I'm actually an enby. 

The past year after realizing I'm not cis has been so freeing.
This is exactly what prompted me to vent about this. So many people are in denial simply because they think to be trans you need to be on HRT, or have surgery, or just... feel something they never even considered.

Being trans is essentially just wanting to be a different gender simply because it feels right. A lot of people don't seem to understand that, and I feel like cisnormativity is to blame for that.
*and then she proceeds to equate dysphoria with dysmorphia and says they originate from the same causes*

She was kinda willing to listen tho, so I'm thinking about giving her another chance. Am I making a mistake?
AMAB is Assigned Male At Birth

AFAB is Assigned Female At Birth

AGAB is Assigned Gender At Birth
AGAB/AFAB/AMAB are acronyms, AGAB is ""Assigned Gender At Birth,"" and AFAB/AMAB is ""Assigned Male/Female At Birth"" :)
Wait, how is that correct? Isn't wanting to be a different gender the definition of gender dysphoria?
sorry people keep giving you extra trouble for being nonbinary. Some day we will overcome this.
Yeah but that’s usually because it’s really fucking hard to feel that way when you don’t see the real you in the mirror.

Like, I get it, I don’t always *feel* like a woman when I see myself or hear my voice, but I do feel like a woman in the sense that I know it is right for me.

I think this is kind of like the dysphoria/euphoria disagreement.  Most people that say they don’t have dysphoria *think* they don’t have dysphoria because they have the impression that dysphoria means crippling depression and suicidal thoughts, when in reality is is way more subtle than that and the fundamental existence of euphoria means there must be some degree of dysphoria.  You suddenly feel *right*, *happy*, etc. whereas previously you may not have felt *wrong*, *sad*, etc. but you still know that this other thing is way better than what you currently have.  Also worth noting that as people transition they generally start to notice their dysphoria more because they got so used to repressing it.
I men if I’m being totally honest? They just sounds like someone who’s still in denial. Like how many people here said that same thing for years before finally coming out?
But you must have felt that *something* was off before, no?  Even if you didn’t recognize or understand those feelings, they still existed.
Why do you want to transition at all if you don’t feel that way?  I suspect you do, but like many of us feel the need to repress it.  I felt that way too until last year, but truthfully I’ve known all my life.
Difficult to explain if you’ve never felt a deep connection to being a different gender *and* a deep disconnect with your AGAB, but it‘s a deeply unsettling feeling.  Every glimpse you catch of yourself in the mirror, every time you touch or observe something wrong about your body, every interaction with others that makes it clear how they see you, all reminders of the thing you hate most about yourself.

You know transition is the answer because you know who you truly are.  Starting is a huge weight off your shoulders.  Every bit of progress made towards physical and social transition feels like a major milestone.  You finally start feeling comfortable with your body, both alone and with others.

To be honest, I’m kind of surprised to see your question here.  I’d have thought most trans people would understand this feeling.
thank you, i try.
Cisnormativity and transmedicalism. Sadly part of the problem exists on our side too. But yeah, it’s really hard to even understand what it means to be trans if you’re not trans and so I think a lot of people have a hard time accepting when they feel dysphoric it means they’re trans
Thank you very much
Thanks
No, There are  reasons to want to be a different gender that aren’t dysphoria. All reasons should be treated as valid tho.
That definitely defines me basically.

I don’t feel it, but I definitely want it. But most of my life i spent time repressing it though in my adolescence, i had really bad dysphoria.
There are feelings that are present, but I’m not so sure it always is “feel like a woman/man/non binary” 

For me, while I want the world to perceive me as a woman, I still don’t “feel” like a woman. I have no other point of reference to compare it to, and I flat out don’t understand people who do know definitely what they feel like inside (that is NOT to say that they don’t feel like “a man” or “a woman”which I hear some people like me say, I just do not know what it is they feel that they are so sure about.)

All I can say is that to social role and categorization of “woman” feels more appealing to me and my personality.
Same - omfg absolute same… known since junior school- just weighing up what my new life might look like compared to the one I have now… 

I think even though I’ve always known I’ve always tried to hide it… 🙈 now I’m coming out more each day… do you reckon I can do it at work? That’s the next big step for me but shall I wait till I have my face treated so I don’t have to shave…
Because I don't FEEL a certain gender, I AM a man. And that's why I don't really understand the whole concept of feeling. I do desire to be a better man, a better version of myself, but it's still confusing.

I don't have a deep connection with my AGAB and it feels right to be treated as a man, but for me it's more like people finally see me as who I really am when I'm called sir and stuff like that, like the whole misgendering was a joke that went too far and now that I'm with friends who see me as who I am, I'm back to ""normal""
I really don't understand the transmed mindset. What does it matter if the person doesn't completely match your ""trans criteria"", just let them be whoever they want! Or is it just transphobia in disguise?
Interesting.  For me (AMAB) it’s a strong feeling of connection to being a woman whether I’m alone or in a social setting.  The dysphoria never really went away until I started transition (and of course it still pops up under certain circumstances).  Hard to explain though as I’m sure you understand, difficult to put these things into words.
Ah, you’re saying the same thing but using different words to describe it, honestly.  You interpret “*feel*” as having a negative connotation, for me it’s a suitable term because it accurately describes how I knew I wanted to transition.

Either way, sounds like we have the same experiences but use different terminology to describe them.
It is definitely transphobia of a sort. It’s just people gatekeeping the community, they think that somehow acknowledging others who haven’t gone through all or at least some medical transition as trans hurts the community??? Idk it makes no sense. In the same way that TERF logic doesn’t make sense
Oh yeah, dysphoria is different for everyone. I do believe that everyone has the potential to feel it, including cis folk, but I think most trans people just understand it much better. 

I think I define myself in terms of social interaction (ironically, as I have pretty bad social anxiety and tend to stay away from people) so when I’m alone I don’t feel like any gender in particular, even if I’m super dysphoric. When I’m with people I I feel my gender a little more concretely, but even then it’s weak and dependent on the group.
Sounds like it. Being trans is so difficult to interpret."	x3en7o	trans	352	0.96	2022-09-01 18:20:05
Idk if this is weird but can someone tell me it’s gonna be alright?	"I’m sick of my existence being politicised and invalidated. I’m sick of being a hot debate topic and constantly being controversial. I’m sick of having to hide myself from everyone I know because coming out feels like a lottery for whether or not I’ll be accepted. I’m sick of having to justify my existence to cis people because they refuse to understand how I feel. 

I just want to be happy. I didn’t choose to be this way, but I have to do the best I can with the situation I’ve been given. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this and my dysphoria has been hitting pretty hard recently, so can someone just assure me that it’s gonna work out? I know it’s childish but I really need some encouragement right now.

Pls call me Talia, my pronouns are she/her"	"[deleted]
Talia, Talia, Talia,
Life is sadly hard, its hard for everyone, and sadly for minorities its even harder.
We exist, and we have to keep strong, not get down, I got down this week, I'm getting back up, I live in boymode almost 24h/24, 7d/7d per week.
But its not because people tell us that we do not exist, that we are just lost, that we just want attention that they are right.

Our lifes are incredible, just the whole point that you understood youself is a big giant step, and maybe you even accepted yourself.
We are much stronger than those people, the people that tell us that we are not valid are just weak.

Try to look out for a transgender network, most countrys have one, and if there's none contact an international one, I can't give any links but if anyone can please give her something.
Don't fall, stay up, don't be sacred.
Evrything will get better its just a mtter of time.
Stay strong,
Don't feel wrong,
You are valid, we are valid, don't take them too seriously and talk to us, here, we can help, we can give advises.
hiya Talia, you're not alone\~ <3

hey everybody let her know she's not alone
Talia it will be alright love will win and things will get better
Hey, T, It makes me sad that the world is like this, our planet is built on hate and theirs not much we can do about it.

Personally I have recently become very aggresive towards Transphobes which may not be the best way to deal with this but...

The world will understand us one day, when the old bastards who refuse to accept the tides changing die out and all that remains is people who don't care who you used to be and will love you for who you are, have faith. 💞
Hey Talia, I’m not trans so I can’t say that I know how you feel. But I can tell you that each generation is more accepting than the last. There was a time when the Irish were not accepted but that’s not true anymore. It’s hard to be patient waiting for people to realize their hatred is not based on fact, but if you wait long enough, all of those people will be gone and we’ll be left with more accepting generations. Things always get better eventually. The eventually part is hard but keep your chin up and know that a time when no one cares what genitalia you were born with is coming.
I understand, Talia. Thank you for reaching out when you needed support. - It will be ok. Life has been unfair for our people and I know it’s hard, but you are such a strong woman and are doing great regardless. I know you can find your people who will give you the love and respect you have always deserved. We can be your people if you need. You are doing an amazing job, please never forget that.  I hope you have a great day/night. ❤️
Hey, Talia, it’s all gonna be alright. There’s nothing childish about needing some encouragement, especially in these times. You’re doing amazing by just keeping at it, and you’re doing amazing in recognizing that hey, you need some support right now, and we’re happy to give it. 

We’re in a bit of a shitty time, with debates and the pandemic making things hard, and day to day grievances making life annoying and frustrating. But it’s gonna be okay. Days will go by, things will get better, and you’ll grow into the stunning and wonderful woman you deserve to be. Hang in there hon, we’re here for you
We're all in this together Talia! I had a rough day yesterday as well. But it will be okay! Progress is unstoppable; we can be grateful for the incredible work done by activists who came before and we can all work to make this world better for the next generation of trans kids! I know one day you'll start to see yourself as yourself and you'll start to feel better! I hope the people in your life grow to accept you and, if not, I hope you find your own family!
It used to be much worse for trans people. Things are getting better. If we can make it, you can.
Talia, we live in a society that can’t accept something that is different and when the realize that many dont care what they say or think they’ll try anything to get us to be silent
No problem for me, don't draw attention and feel accepted. They give me compliments, all the time, about my wigs coordinating outfits, I wear. Sorry, to hear you're having issues.

HEY!! 

Talia you are real, you are valid 🏳️‍⚧️❤️❤️ eventually things will work out fine ❤️❤️ just be your self and be happy
Sometimes I can things goodly, but this isn't one of those times. Talia, this time all I can say is it will be okay. Me, and so many others like me, will kick down barriers until the world is safe for everyone. It will be okay.
Everything always gets better. Stay proud girl. ❤️❤️
hey talia
im so so sorry to hear what you're currently going through
but i promise you these two things..you're not alone and things WILL get better
you WILL be able to transition into the woman that you're meant to be
it may take a minute, but you'll get there..you will reach your goal
and in the meantime..stay safe, stay strong
but most importantly keep being you 
Xx
Talia you're an awesome, beautiful girl and things will be okay💖💕
I feel the same way. In a way, I’m glad the issue was brought up to politicians, because now I can’t lose my job for coming out. But at the same time, that made the issue as controversial  as it is. If I know anything about politics, once this issue is out of the spotlight, it is going to be far less controversial.
When I feel that something I do or need is childish, I call to mind a quote by C.S. Lewis: “When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”

I had a phone interview recently. When my interviewer, the woman who's been in her trade for as long as I've been alive, asked me the dreaded question ""what are your weaknesses?"" I panicked, froze, then finally answered with ""I can be moody, like having bad days at work, you know?"" I did expect ""the weaknesses"" question, but I didn't expect her to answer my question.  She did know.  She told me that instead of going to the gym yesterday she sat in her car and cried for an hour, because that was all she could manage to do.

The very thing that my potential future boss, a well adjusted, world-experienced woman related to me was something that I had thought childish not even a year ago.  I did not know how to react, this was a situation that I had never been in before.  Regretfully all I managed was a weak platitude.

&#x200B;

Like feelings fear, dread, and panic, ""wanting to be happy"" is a feeling.  I get this feeling sometimes, and when I'm struggling to move past it I go for a long, long, looooong walk.  I don't always feel happy walking, but afterwards I feel as though I can be happy again.

Other times I go to my favorite coffee shop.  I sit and journal for hours, sipping liquid hugs and listening to the lives of the strangers around me.  I've caught myself eavsdropping a few times, and had to go to the (all-genders!!) bathroom after barely turning a laugh into a cough.

Talia, what do you find yourself doing when you are happy?  What do you do to be happy?

&#x200B;

It will be alright, Talia, you'll be happy again.
listen talia, its gonna be fine, it really will, you dont have to believe me, just hear me.

Question from an ally	"Hello!

I have a question for trans folk. I have many trans friends who are transitioning or have transitioned. Now, something I often do with everybody, trans or not, is telling people they're pretty and they look good. It's just me complimenting them. But something I've found myself doing a lot is especially doing that with trans people. Now, there's this guy I know who I seriously find cute, and I often tell him that he's attractive, and I have this girl that struggled with her transition and I often tell her how beautiful she it. These are just examples of trans people I often do that complimenting thing with. And I feel like I mostly do it to kind of hype them up about their gender identity, especially when I know they have had a lot of dysphoria in the past. What I worry is that it may come off as disingenuine. What do you people think? How would you take it?"	"That may vary from person to person but I find it really sweet of you and I don't see a problem as long as it is honestly what you think 😊
If you are genuine that's fine. We need that given that beauty standards are a very hard to achieve thing even for guess people however not achieving these doesn't mean I've doesn't look good. In our case especially if gendered provably usually will also invoke euphoria which is nice.
For myself and most trans friends I know, it can often make our whole day just from a compliment or correct gendering from a random person. However if you're mostly just serving compliments to your friends it can potentially come across as disingenuous if you do it too often. Not that I'm saying don't give compliments, but maybe focus on being a little more specific about the compliments to seem more caring, ex: "" oh I love your shirt, it looks great on you! Where'd you get it?"" or maybe like, ""That color really makes your eyes shine! I love how cute you look!""
I think it varies from person to person, I personally find very sweet and would probably flush every time because I cant take compliments.
I would love to have a friend like you although from person to person it may very how comfortable they are with it
If you do it out of a sudden, it's an automatic show of what you think, i'm used to do it too, and i do love the reaction, and, mostly, it's just what i think about the people look
That's nice of you but please don't feel like you need to treat us differently
Your phrasing makes me confused. Please tell me you don't call transmascs pretty.
If you’re friends with them you know their personalities so I wouldn’t second guess yourself. If you’re being genuine, then most people can tell and it won’t come across as fake.
For me, as long as you are being honest and not doing it just to make them feel better it's fine. I hate it when people compliment me just for the sake of being nice and not because they actually feel I'm worth complimenting.
my gut does tell me it would probably come off as disingenuous to me but idk how much of tht would be my own shit as opposed to it actually being disingenuous. just dont overdo it or make them feel like its out place
I'm happy to see that you are open and accepting of all your friends regardless of gender ID. I very much appreciate that, and more people like you need to exist in this world.
In my experience, I love when people complement me telling me I'm ambiguous, pretty, handsome, ect., but it can definitely change on a person to person basis.
I don't know for example I hate when somebody tells me I look good. I have probably a lot of self hate inside me, that I cannot believe that, or it's just general thing I don't trust people so I'm not sure which one of these is triggering that in me. So it might vary from person to person how the are feeling about that statements from other people.
Sometimes people don’t know how to receive compliments just a heads up, with trans folks we’re used to the condescending “pity” compliments so that adds another layer to discomfort with receiving compliments. However! That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Just as long as its respectful and your tone isn’t condescending. A quick and short “you look really nice today” is better that “yasss queen, slay! You look fierce today”. But even if you say it in a respectful way and someone looks uncomfortable it might just be their inability to see that they deserve it because they’re used to people making fun of them/receiving back handed compliments
Personally I like to be treated like a cis guy. I’m sure some trans people appreciate being hyped up about their gender, but keep in mind that not all of us want attention called to our genders
If someone only does it on the rare occasion that I dress up, full makeup, nails, hair etc. but not on the other 95% of days It it actually makes me feel crummy. I know they don’t mean any Ill will but it gives me the impression that they put more value on me solely based on those more attractive days and the others I’m just trash…the compliments on the other 95% of days. Just a thrown together outfit, no makeup, messy hair and scuffed nails are the ones that I really take to heart but those compliments seem to be the rarer of the two.
I don't know how to accept compliments, so I just freeze up and fail to say thank you
if you told me this even if it wasn’t genuine I’d still be happy as long as it wasn’t sarcastic
I do the same thing from time to time and sumtimes it all sumone needs to here ti mack there day better so keep it up good on you x 
Thow gust a person think I definitely prfer being called cute then beautiful feel it gust means a lot more 👉👈
These are concerns I have as well about complimenting other trans people, haha, I think you're fine. Nit everyone is super receptive to compliments if they really don't believe it though. Just keep in mind for some of us it can be really hard to accept comments like that.
so for me personally it depends on context and the specific compliments. i hate when people tell me i look handsome or masc bc i know i dont rlly pass and it feels like theyre just trying to make me feel better (which bothers me bc im comfortable enough in my presentation).
So far you are doing amazing what you are doing is making them feel accepted and loved which helps alot so as long as you accept them for who they are and help them through the tough times you're doing amazing
if it's genuine, then pop off as long as you get the pronouns, because that's sometimes tricky
I find it really nice though i may not still agree with it myself. Like i am pre everything and a few people have said i am pretty i appreciate it even though I don't feel pretty at all
Honestly I think most people will just take the compliment because so many of us are starved for that gender affirmation in these types of compliments. Especially if they know you to be a good person.
if you aren't sure if someone would like a masc or fem compliment go for something more neutral like ""you look really nice today"" or ""i like your outfit"" but i think a compliment is always nice i you mean it
Aw, thanks!
Yeah, that was what I was trying to know. Honestly, it makes me so glad to hear how these little actions can help trans people so much :)
Yeah, that's the compliment I usually give to friends. Unless I'm trying to kinda flirt, it's normally small things like that, like ""your hair looks amazing today"" or ""I love that makeup"". Glad to hear it can make you feel that good!
Oh, no, it's definitely not that, don't get me wrong. It's the feeling that maybe comments about their physique, despite being not mean-spirited at all and being positive, might be taken wrong by some people. I've heard trans friends tell me about how it feels weird when people they don't even know talk about their bodies, so I'm wondering if I should keep the compliments to myself or not to not cause a similar situation.
Well, it'sa special case. I'm Spanish, so I use ""guapo"", which has its masculine (-o) and feminine (-a) form, or a gender neutral one (-e/-x, but it's not ""correct""). That word works the same for everyone, meaning not really having the handsome/pretty connotation.
Also, sorry if it's hard to understand, English isn't my first language.
Awww, thanks! This is so cute of you, seriously. And yes, sadly not everyone has this same outlook.
Same here, compliments like that are wonderful and absolutely make my day. If I were to analyze it, I'd say it's the indication that I'm being seen how I want to be. Friends who do that are great to have.
Ahh I see, lol. That's perfectly fine then. Especially if you don't make a habit or point to do it more often to your trans friends than your cis ones.
No, your post was very well written. I think my brain zeroed in on that because I've been told I'm ""too pretty to waste by becoming a boy"" and that hurt personally
It's quite unfortunate. I've faced some bad hate from strangers as well as ex friends. Just glad to see some people who aren't necessarily trans support those that are. The trans journey is a hard road, but friends like you make it better.
Oh, damn, that's so bad, wow
Oh no, sorry to hear that 😓 hug
I swear this is going to make me cry, thank you 🥺
Muchas gracias 🫂
Keep being your open and supportive self 😊

The Trans Whisperer	"Just needed a place to vent. Someone made me incredibly insecure today and kind of down, let's call him 'the trans whisperer'. The conversation started pretty normally though we quickly started talking about me being a transgender woman.

Right from the get-go he told me **all** his trans friends really regret doing SRS, feeling it has mutilated them unnecessarily, and lots of issues with it. He kept giving me lots of helpful(?) advice; eating habits, physical activity, etc. We got to talking about my love life. He advised me again, telling me if I want to find love I should learn to outclass women. He called my face cute but with a couple of surgeries I'll look *perfect*. He has a trans flatmate and he says that his advice helped her with her gender dysphoria and from committing suicide and having great legs.

He made me a bit angry, mostly sad. I don't even know why. I just felt somewhat unpleasant during the whole interaction, I blocked him cause I felt he was doing me no good despite the great help he might have given to this trans flatmate and friends.

I don't agree I need to outclass women to be loved. I felt somewhat objectified and I did tell him that being objectified is a trigger for me for some negative emotions and memories.

Am I being hysterical by my reaction or have I just invalidated my feeling? And why can't I just easily let his words go? :(

[This is me, for context](https://preview.redd.it/n7lr2jxwsk871.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=afb66ab27616cb16e2f6bea41f5c9e94e595d6e7)"	"Wow. First off, it's rude to give unsolicited advice. Secondly, it's specifically bad for you and you told him as such, so he knowingly harmed you, at least obliquely. And lastly, it's misogynistic advice that is objectifying: your value as a woman doesn't come from your sexual attractiveness to his demographic, regardless of whether your trans or cis. 

And even if that is true for *all* the trans people he met, I think his behavior is probably exerting a very strong selection bias among the trans people he knows. As in, I can't imagine any trans people who disagree with this behavior keeping themselves around him for very long.

You're a beautiful woman! Don't fret about one man's opinion: it never did a lady any good.

EDIT: sorry, assuming your gender from context clues. But besides, you're a beautiful person and you have value regardless of who oggles you.
>He called my face cute but with a couple of surgeries I'll look perfect.

Woah woah woah..

🚩🚩🚩

That is the type language that a predator would use.
First, you are beautiful 😘 2nd, it sounds like he was projecting to me!
He is the one that needs to have surgery. He should have 2 ribs removed so he can blow himself.

You, you're fucking hot. Not that anyone's opinion matters, but I would rate you somewhere between ""what's your ring size?"" and ""where have you been all my life?""
He sounds really gross, and you're lovely. Shit reminds me of 'negging', incels trying to knock women that are out of their league down a peg. You're WAY out of his league.
I think this asshole was gaslighting you and I think you should take everything he said with an enormous grain of salt and assume that he was lying to manipulate and hurt you.
Projecting as in all the things he was telling you he wanted for himself. He is insecure. Had nothing to do with you. Does that make sense?
Is that ""transplaining"" ?
Oh honey, you look wonderful. You don't need to ""Outclass Women"" because you are a woman. (fuck you look way cuter that I do, I'm pre-everything) His advice may have helped a flatmate, but at the end off the day (I'm assuming) he's still cis. He doesn't fully understand the trans experience.
It’s called cis-splaining and it’s incredibly offensive. You’re absolutely right to feel violated. This person was not an ally, they were being emotionally abusive.
You are fine as YOU want to be. I would have argued back and walked out part way through his convo
Girl you are perfect the way you are!
Don’t let this asshole get under your skin. 
Everything he said is so cringy it makes me nauseous🤢 Definitely predatory behaviour. You made a good call by blocking this scumbag.

You are beautiful and let no one convince you otherwise!!💕
That guy sounds like a creep, the statement “your face looks cute but with a few surgeries it will look perfect” is a massive warning sign
Honestly, most of the things he said were *so* rude. An like they assume all trans people are the same. I probably would have blocked him early on in the convo. You did the right thing for you
trans whisperer holy cringe
You look bomb he’s a hoe
You were definitely talking to a chaser. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. The whole talking about being ""better than women and not getting SRS""
What a fetishizing asshat.
First of all, I wanted to thank ya'll for being so so supportive and validating my suspicions, that he's an enormous asshole. It's been a journey, a long and arduous one, to get to this point where such men just cause destabilize me and not fully break me down. I still have a long way to go to fix all the damage men like him done to me in my past.

I also wanted to thank everyone for letting me see the things I was totally oblivious to - the emotional manipulation and/or abuse, gaslighting, predatory behavior, being a manipulative chaser, etc. I have very little walls up, I guess I need to be much more vigilant then in order to make sure I don't let any bad actors in.

And ya'll are so right, I am beautiful and cute the way I am 🥰 I **like** being curvy and voluptuous. I don't need to outclass women and to wear so much makeup all day my face hurts or high heels until my feet don't walk no more. I don't need to be more woman than woman if I ever hope to find love, love's gonna find me and like me as I am or love can go fuck himself behind a dumpster for all I care. So thanks also for this confidence boost I was a bit lacking in today 🙏
Imma just say you look absolutely gorgeous. Sending virtual hugs 🤗
Lol the ""trans whisperer""? Nah, this fuckboy is the Trans Creeper.
Omg girl, from the first few lines that person is ""hidden toxic pile"" they try to shower with weird compliments/advice with random remarks to make you feel inferiour.
You are right. He is wrong. He is causing damage. You are trying to live your life. Nothing else is important. I hope you can heal <3
Sounds like a chaserloll
Sounds like he's a vapid biased asshole that thinks he knows everything. My advice is, don't take any of his advice and do what you think is best.
Advice is fine when it’s PROMPTED. That advice was rude, invasive and triggering. As for legs? Not gonna lie yours looks fucking amazing. If men don’t want you then those men can go fuck themselves.
The only helpful advice I can offer is not to listen to people who tell you that you are in any way imperfect. Those people have a lot to say and quite frankly are only doing it for their own benefit, this isn't some competition where you need to win anything. Even if you were literally the ugliest person on earth, you don't owe it to anybody to ""fix"" yourself or become ""Perfect"" just to fit in, especially under the excuse that's it's for your benefit and not theirs.
Also, the reason you can't let it go is because of anger. Anger always keeps you from letting go of unjust and unfair treatment, which is good, because it helps you remember what makes you a person that you care about over a person that they care about fir their egotistical or traditional or whatever other beliefs
Ew… he sounds like a narcissist.
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I’m glad it didn’t go any further but just the exchange alone I’m sure felt violating. He most definitely just thought you would be easy to manipulate and then probably would’ve tried to have sex with you. A lot of men do this to women unfortunately. Good on you for blocking his ass. I wouldn’t respond to him ever again if he tries to come
back on an alternate account, I don’t care how many times he apologizes or whatever he may say to get you to lift your boundaries. Dude sounds downright predatory just by you saying the subject quickly shifted to being about your transness. He knew exactly what his objective was before the conversation even started, I assure you.

As far as if you’re being hysterical.. no. Your reaction is normal. That is called emotional manipulation. The things he was saying to you were supposed to evoke a certain response from you. He was preying on your insecurities and I am so sorry about that :( 
People who do these kinds of things are deadass scum. 
Some things I think may help to try and get these thoughts out of your head is to surround yourself with positive energy, positive people. People that make you feel good or that care about you. It may sound cliche but do some positive self talk as well, I think it’s important to practice being kind to yourself and talking to yourself in a loving way. It’s easier said than done for sure but it’s something I definitely strive to be better at. 
I also recommend perhaps doing something stimulating that will distract you when the thoughts seem to never stop, something you enjoy. It will help keep you in the present moment.
You are perfectly fine just yourself. Don't let creeps like that tell you how you should be
Wow, nothing about that exchange sounds at all normal or appropriate. I feel really scared for the mental health of his flatmate and other trans “friends”, guarantee he is bullshitting you or even himself on how much he’s genuinely helped them if this is how he behaves.

I’d sooner believe he is the reason they “regret” srs, since he’s so critical of peoples bodies, choices and lifestyles, he probably says similar things to others. Imagine having to live with him? I’d say anything to get him to shut up, “guess I’m not trans anymore” included.
I find it best to never listen to anyone, positive or negative, when someone begins saying stuff just remember it's actually just an isolated brain firing off neurons (sometimes neurotic neurons) full of some isolated opinions...or just repeating things they've heard and felt comfortable repeating. But the trick is to ignore both, the compliments and the critiques. To be ""others-opinions-agnostic"" and reassert your own opinion and feelings as the only ones that really matter.

It's nice when people are supportive, but if you allow yourself to be too moved by even these, it's also giving yourself ""permission"" to be moved by the negative and hateful as well.  And all of that is just my own opinion isolated in my own soup of neurons influenced by my own isolated life and/or experiences.

EDIT: Another opinion of mine: You are fucking beautiful.
why the fuck are you listening to anyone with ""he"" pronouns on any of these topics fuck that motherfucker he's probably a goddamned chaser who wants you to keep the dick so he can get to it. nah sis ditch this fool.
I have no idea why men always feel the need to tell everyone how they should live, but you look fine to me sis. :)
Seems like this ""trans whisperer"" is on a big ego trip. I'm sorry you had to go through that.  He sounds like a total creep.
All his ""advice"" is bullshit I bloody PROMISE you you're the only actual trans person he knows and all his ""experiences"" with them are made up whole cloth. DO NOT IN ANY WAY allow that buffoon to make you feel insecure because YOU are the trans woman therefore in ANY conversation with a cis dude about trans stuff you are and will ALWAYS be the expert in the discussion. Understood?
Sounds like he's trying to control and/or manipulate you. Be careful with those types! I wouldn't take any advice at face value, without double/triple checking it and doing your own research, even from someone who you think may be trustworthy. From your post, it seems like he's not someone you fully trust, which is a huge red flag. Whatever you decide to do, at the end of the day you want to be sure it's *your* decision and not someone else's. Take care and be safe!
I like the thing on your door behind you. It makes you look like you have wings.
Jesus fucking Christmas NO you are not overreacting. That guy is a fucking C.R.E.E.P. Tall about mansplaining hot damn. 
Like, remove the trans aspect for a second. Do you think thats a normal conversation? Telling someone they need surgery to find love? Advising someone of their medical conditions that you have no experience with? 
Crazy!
What a jerk first of all! You are absolutely gorgeous baby!  I wouldn’t change a thing 
if I were you! Well, maybe one thing! I’d be in that picture with you! With your hand in mine, 
I’d be staring into those two beautiful eyes of yours and telling you how beautiful I thought 
you were and how lucky I was just to be standing there with you!
How do you get someone to stop giving you 1 million % unsolicited advice? They just are relentless and will not stop.
Thank you so much ❤️

I might have really paid him no mind but a few bad run-ins with men lately cause me to somewhat destabilize 🙈 hope I'll get better very soon, I have a queer quiz to host tomorrow, and emotional hormonal crying is not part of the show. 

And yes, I'm a transgender woman, you assumed correctly 🥰
Yes, THIS. That's negging/grooming language.
RIGHT?!
Oh, didn't quite thought of that. Sort of wraps that whole convo in an even worse light 🙈
Yeah the minute I read that about 50 alarms started going off for me. Who the fuck says something like that? There's no context in which it's appropriate to say ""oh just get a couple of plastic surgeries so you can look perfect for me."" That's majorly fucked up.
Thank you 😍

And projecting, as in he was projecting what he wanted to see me as or in me?
no u
I totally agree with you on the matter of him and on the matter of I, and thank you so much 🥰
That's what I thought as well.  He's negging, probably because he wants you to fall for him / want him.  It's a super shitty thing to do to someone.
Yes, this right here.
I will, I do now 🙏
Yeah OP he’s trying to neg you. Piece of shit probably doesn’t even have trans friends.

You know why he said the SRS bit? Because he’s a chaser.
I guess so, yes, it makes sense. Wouldn't be able to verify it though cause I ain't planning on unblocking him or talking to him ever again 👀 oh well, that's life.
It’s cis-splaining
Oh my gosh, thank you for pointing that out. I completely forgot about the “outclassing women” part. That was transphobic as hell. 
She’s a woman.. not some other subspecies of human or some kind of 3rd gender. Like what a creep..
Thank you 🥰 I feel quite happy being me, and I feel a bit angry at myself for letting him destabilize my happiness.
I guess the further I go along the process I'm going to actually encounter it more and more, at least now I have a name for it...
Sometimes I realize a bit too late when I'm facing some or any kind of abuse. I hope to do better in the future.
Thank you so much 🥰 for helping me see him for who he is and for your kind words.
😂 that's how I felt he was trying to position himself 🤣
Periodt
I understand this guy was absolutely an asshole, but what counts as prompted in advice-giving? I think I might be on the spectrum and I’m worried I’ll look like that, to a lesser extent maybe. Do they have to straight up ask for advice?
I understand you might’ve been hurt by someone exhibiting narcissistic tendencies, but please don’t use it as a pejorative. It’s a real diagnosable personality disorder, and it can be treated with therapy!

This guy in the story was an asshole though for sure.
That's actually a great advice and it makes so much sense to me, thank you for sharing 🙏 and also, thank you for your compliment 🥰
PERIODTTTT 👏🏽
That's my worst nightmare - I fall in love with someone (finally) and then after a few years when my appointment finally arrives he'll try to convince me to *not. go. through. with. it* 😰
Thank you so much ❤️🥰
Yeah, they really are! I don't really have a strategy aside from very tactlessly and abruptly changing the conversation. But hey, if you discover something, let me know! XD
Also the chances are that his claim of "" \*\*all\*\* his trans friends really regret doing SRS"" is total BS. [https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret\_after\_gender\_affirmation\_surgery\_\_a.22.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret_after_gender_affirmation_surgery__a.22.aspx) This is a pretty good article on trans folk's opinions vis-a-vis regret post op, but you can just read the abstract which makes it pretty clear that of the pooled individuals (almost 8k) less than 1% regret surgery. 

For most people, post op regrets come from realizing later on that they're nonbinary or gender non conforming in some way, not because it's ""unnecessary mutilation"". Hope this helps a bit.
Re-read your second paragraph, but imagine that his sole interest in you is dependant on you having sex with him and not having SRS.
My go to is along the lines of:

“Hmm. You think so? Interesting.” 

It genuinely is interesting to me how clueless some people can be.
It's even shittier still. I told him about my past with men and how I recovered most of my self esteem and confidence. I guess that opened up a door for him to just walk right in 😔
You look great by the way your friend is just so full of it
Keep doing you girl! Have a great holiday weekend ❤️🤍💙
Yeah. It happens quite a bit. People who don’t recognise their privilege tend to speak from that pulpit and never realise they’re doing harm.  But on the plus side, it gets real easy to tune it out after a while. And you always have the community to vent to about it 😘😘😘
I used to be but I’ve had so much of it I fight back now. This is what my daughter taught me, she got expelled from school for fighting with bullying boys at 10
totally, from the heart.
#truth….I can’t tell you enough how truly beautiful I think you are! 😍🥰 We’re too 
hard on ourselves, too critical, too self conscious! If only you could see what I see 
when I look at you!
You did nothing wrong. Hope you can take care of yourself after this horrible conversation, and know that you are valid, your choices are valid, and any medical procedures you decide to do or not do is only up to YOU 💖🏳️‍🌈
Thank you, you too! 💓
I'm so happy I did. I used to always lurk, never comment or post. Now I'm gaining a bit of confidence to connect and reach out 💜
It's amazing what children have to teach us sometimes. I hope she's OK, and I wish you both the best. Thank you 💖"	obiqcu	trans	340	0.99	2021-07-01 10:12:14
Do not trust the subreddit r/Dysphoriasolutions.	"I wanted to makw this post on r/Dysphoriasolutions, but I'm not allowed to. Please do not trut this subreddit and the treatment for dysphoria it tries to spread.

To every trans person who is member of this subreddit: please don't be fooled. Someone is trying to convince you to try a treatment that is not scientifically proved and which won't work. There isn't a magical cure for dysphoria, the only way of making it less painful is by transitioning and being your true self. 

Please, do not trust this subreddit mod, when questioned on the validity of the method, they weren't able to provide any scientific evidence and just removed the comments when they weren't able to refute arguments. This person can't show any scientific studies on this topic and I doubt they're a qualified doctor or neurobiologist.

Stay safe and get professional help if you need it to cope with dysphoric, but don't try magical cures you find online that don't have any scientific evidence to support it."	"lol they wanna take blood pressure medication to _erase memories_

sounds like a great way to accidentally off yourself, tbh

I take beta blockers for an actual heart condition, ironically for that sub they helped me identify and think about my dysphoria more because I could think about it without my heart rate skyrocketing due to disregulation and inducing panic. lol no

Thanks for the warning. Sounds like a scam/pseudoscience—or no science.

As a side note, I’m so sick of people trying to prey on us.
Thanks for the heads-up 🤗
I thought it was going to be something stupid like
a 12-step-plan, what I found instead verges on troll logic. A bunch of talking about treating fear, ptsd, memory wiping, and heart rate reduction and all of nothing to do with gender dysphoria at all!

Does the person who runs that reddit even know what gender dysphoria is? Because someone should probably explain to them that it's not a fear/panic disorder, it's not ptsd, and memory wiping isn't going to help because not remembering I am trans will not make me less trans... The first time I expressed a desire to be a girl was at 6 and I remember feeling something about that even earlier. What is the bad science solution being proposed here? Wipe my entire memory and start over hoping the dysphoria won't come back?

I mean dang... I thought this was going to be something that was strange and a bad idea but this is more like finding a manifesto about how we can solve world hunger by fertilizing iron mines with pesticides to grow delicious ironfruit trees; the individual parts are not related, most of them don't work together the way the writer thinks they do, and if they did they still wouldn't solve the problem.
All the BS of the suggested method aside- Love how they just assume that your doctor is just gonna prescribe you something because you asked for it. Actually, a crazy theory just formed in my head...

I've noticed that this seems like a personal project- there isn't any obvious corporation backing it and the account itself regularly responds to comments defending the method. What do you want to bet this is a very wealthy TERF who thinks they're going to change the world with their miracle discovery? They're probably a person who had their own struggles with gender identity, but during treatment on beta blockers(likely for unrelated issues) they got it in their head that the lack of anxiety they were feeling was a 'cure' for the dysphoria symptoms they couldn't get to go away. Made a bunch of associations with unrelated mental health disorders, had a couple of 'doctor' friends willing to back them up despite not having any actual online presence- and now they're funneling their own money into this campaign thinking they've got the Secret and will Cure Trans Forever.

Sounds likely to me- I'll wear that tin foil hat. And if it isn't true it'd probably annoy the heck out of them to hear so I'm fine with it
with only 11 members and all posts being from a single user (the main and only moderator), it seems likely this is the work of one or a couple trolls. Let's hope that nobody's fooled by this transparent one-man misinfo campagain. I personally have reported a post for misinformation and blocked the user.
I put my comment on the owner of the sub in there but I'm gonna copy paste it here because I think it's important

what this person is peddling is not transitioning it's to stay in the closet and lose the dysphoria

*I think there’s a disconnection between what you believe your medication can do and what trans people want out of transitioning*

I have ADHD and I am trans.

*you could fix what psychologically in my brain causing that ADHD and I could act more normal. But Im not normal, I am a medically induced state to be relatively normal. But I am still with that ADHD, especially when the meds wear off.*

*Being trans, can be fixed in the brain sure, but it wouldn’t make me feel normal, nor would it make me accepted and treated normally.*

*you could dull my brain so I wouldn’t worry about XY or Z but it doesn’t fundamentally change me and my dysphoria or distain for my body. Thats still there beneath the medication.*

*it is better to let people socially transition find themselves and become happy than forcing their brains to be happy.*

*yes there’s something fundamentally wrong when someone isn’t accepted by their family ostracized by the community and that leads them to kill themselves, one mental condition can influence the other or make them worse. Depression still exists and hurts these people.*
Wow, taking heart medication totally cured me! /s

Also, even if this nonsense worked what about social dysphoria, show me the drugs that make me feel good about being misgendered
Their website is illegally distributing medical advice. It should be reported to the police who can work with Weebly(their webhost) to take them offline because Weebly apparently won't do anything unless they receive a request directly from law enforcement.

I’ve been targeted with this too. Tried to comment. Couldn’t. My personal experience: I have taken propranolol - the proposed drug of treatment - for years. I took it for anxiety. It alleviates the physical manifestations of anxiety, such as racing heart and tremors, as it is a beta blocker. It sort of helped with my heart condition (SVT) but not really. However, it did not alleviate or cure my dysphoria. It’s pretty harmless to try it, but there’s no real evidence it does anything they’re claiming it does.
Have we learned nothing from the satanic panic and quacks trying to mess with people's memeories?
Just took a look at the subreddit

They think that memory loss is the solution? Seriously?
i think i’ve seen this as an ad before. awful
I've seen their posts as promoted on my feed before. How is that even allowed. Some messed up shit.
The most we can do is recommend things that personally help as advice. Such as gaffs are great
Sorry my original post forgot that I had blocked the person... my brain failed for a moment lol.  Since was mentioning how after checking it a ton of posts vanished, not comments. Then oopsie forgot I had blocked the mod who seems to also be the owner.
""accidentally"" nah that's intentional
>lol they wanna take blood pressure medication to erase memories

Pffft, everyone knows alcohol is how you really erase memories. 🤷🙄😜
I currently take beta-blockers and am in fact still trans. Actually transer than when I started 😳
Saved upvoted
So basically they are interpreting things the same way how the anti-Vax movement got its ball rolling.
Yeah, I hope these people get banned for misinformation tbh, it sucks :/
Also, I love your username, the picture of Dorian Gray is amazing.
haha dont worry, i sure hope that they delete their stuff, its just harmful to spread misinformation like this, be safe everyone
I mean, you wouldn't have the memories at that point so ""it works"" I guess?
My depression did a pretty good job of it too.
for me, it was CPTSD
Ah yes, my previous dysphoria medication before I discovered estrogen
Haha thanks! It’s because my name is Dorian, not because I’ve actually read it
Yeah there's enough shit going around as is, don't need another someone trying to exploit abuse folks like that.
Honestly, I have very few memories and my sense of time is all messed up.  I'm still stuck in 1997. 🙄
I'm amazed I haven't been diagnosed.  Though apparently I don't meet the criteria.  Could've fooled me. 🤷
LMFAO!  Too true! 😄
The first 29 years of my life are pretty much a blur...I remember major events, but I feel like I have very few actual memories.
This is pretty common but I don't know to what extent for you.

Maybe keep a journal to help in the future.

I have ADHD and when I'm on my meds I can recall things from my past I can't access when I'm not on meds.
That's interesting. When I get stoned, I can remember my past pretty well. In fact, it can get kinda intrusive and make me remember really cringe things I've done.

I’m just a little Emo man with dysphoria who is wearing a binder that doesn’t fit him(too big)		"Sucks about the binder based dysphoria, but you are looking real handsome dude <3 Best of wishes and apologies for the awkward compliment haha
You still look great man. Loving your hair and that outfit. Hope you can replace that binder to reduce your dysphoria <3
I love that hat bro, have the same one. Never seen a second in the wild. Virtual fist-bump
Love the hat, love the pin, love the vibe
If its a GC2b binder you can put it in a dryer on high for 15 minutes it shrunk mine up a bit and now it fits perfectly. Also that hats pretty groovy dude
Dude, you look awesome! You kinda give off the vibes one of the Polish operators in Rainbow Six Siege (if they were the Bosak brothers rather than sisters)! Fantastic!
Nice aesthetic and cute/handsome
You are a very handsome young man.

Is this transphobic?	"Every month, for some unkown reason, my school always organizes one day for dressing as something, or in some way. In February, it's gonna be as the opposite gender, which also sounds like they say there's only two genders.

I really am not fan of it, I'm constantly having suicidal thoughts because of not looking like a female, and then school decides to dress like that for fun?

That isn't the first time that my school has made my gender dysphoria worse, and it won't be the last time."	"Never blame on malice what could be explained by stupidity.
They're probably not trying to be transphobic, and to most cis folks, crossdressing in a context like that is funny and goofy. Not something meant to single people out. They could just call it opposite day or something. 
Honestly if my high school had that I would've worn my normal boy clothes and waited to see if anyone said anything
On the other hand playful crossdressing is a revelation for a lot of trans people.
I dont know if i would say it's transphobic. Personally i would have loved the school to do something like that so that i could have an excuse to present they way i wanted too. I think if it was different gender day it might be more inclusive. That way the NB and other gender could be included. I only no like 4 genders sorry if ignorant
I think it's ignorance on the school's part. Take the opportunity to present how you would like without the fear or judgement of others at school for the day.
No. It’s not transphobic. How on earth could cross dressing be transphobic
I don’t think it’s transphobic, but it may not be being presented in a very inclusive or considerate manner in regards to any gender non conforming ppl there. It would be nice to switch it to just a “drag” Day where students are invited to experiment with and parody gender roles and expression I think that could be a lot more welcoming. Tbh I like the idea of having some form of gender non conformance event involved with school because it gives students deep in the closet or unsure about their identity a chance to branch out. With the right structure it can really allow for that kind of exploration. I’m sorry it isn’t quite there for your school yet though.
(I'm afab btw) My school used to do that once a year (probably still does, idk I'm too old now), and seeing all the boys in feminine things and vice versa was pretty funny tbh, but they also really exaggerated the stereotype and did it ugly/sloppy on purpose and seemed very uncomfortable in dresses, bordering on ashamed.

I did nothing different than usual, dressed as masc as ever (wasn't out, just a ""tomboy"") and some people made jokes to put me in a dress instead. It was nice to be grouped with the boys but also I was pre-everything and super dysphoric anyway:( Now I am comfortable with fem and masc, but my body changed so it's easier
Use this to dress as agab for the last time then dress the way you want from the next day onwards
Well, the mere concept of crossdressing exist because somebody, somewhere decided that clothes have to be gendered. Obviously conservatives view crossdressing through a very binary scope, but the act of crossdressing in and of itself is an act of rebellion against gender norms.

However, I wouldn't count dressing as your true gender as crossdressing. Ergo, trans people are *not actually* crossdressing, but on the other hand, a cis dude wearing feminine clothes *is* crossdressing. Same goes for a cis woman wearing masculine clothes.

For enbies, it's kinda hard defining what constitutes crossdressing. There's no established enby fashion, so enbies will mix and match clothes that partially align with their identity and expression, regardless if said clothes are marketed as ""men's"", ""women's"" or ""unisex"". Tbh, I think that's a major power move! Do what you like, call it what you like!
I can definitely see how it enforces clothing binaries and ignores the non-binary. The name also certainly comes off as transphobic. That said, I don't think the intent is transphobia

I think the intent is to promote expression among cis folk. Events like this are also good for closeted folks like me who look for excuses to be ourselves. Think of it less of them making fun of you and more of them experiencing our culture. If anyone's disrespectful about it THEN that's transphobic.

My basic thoughts are: ""Is it transphobic when guys wear skirts for fun? Why is it different if it's officially endorsed?""
> which also sounds like they say there's only two genders.

If you take gender as a spectrum ranging from 100% female over Neutral (0% female or male) to 100% male, just mirror yourself to the opposing side of the axis. For people who are more or less gender-neutral, not much changes of course.
I don’t want to sound rude man but the world won’t stop spinning because one person isn’t happy. Take it on the chin and spend the day at home doing things you like. It’s not transphobic and it’s not stupid, it can be educational, a safe space, provide room for questions, and also, it’s just some of fun. Changing genders won’t ever go away, let people have there fun, you don’t have to be included
I'm old. Opposite Day has been around for a long time. 20+ years ago I neither knew, nor cared what a trans person was (despite unknowingly being one) and the spirit of it was fun.  
  
Is it phobic? I don't think so. And like one other commenter said, it depends on the spirit it's being 'celebrated' as. For us, it was actually kind of a fun social experiment. Dudes dress up as girls and we'd see 1) how clueless some of them are... 2) how astutely aware some of them are.. 3) and for some, who went the extra mile, how secure in their own masculinity they were to really put effort in.  Unfortunately what girls did on Opposite Day is something I don't remember.. I did not know or care about girls, really, so they weren't in my radar.
Short answer no it’s not transphobic
That was actually my favorite day as a kid. Bc it was the only day I could dress as a boy. (And my mom actually allowed it that day bc spirit week) I loved it. And my school literally had no malice behind it bc everyone did it for fun and no one was singled out
I don’t think it’s blatantly transphobic. I don’t think they r trying to shame trans and gender nonconforming people.
don’t go to school that day
My school had this and just called it ""Cross-dressing day"" back in early 2k.  They had the best of intentions to encourage us out of traditional gender norms and maybe have some self discovery.  Less than half participated and with varied degrees of effort.  Some just wore a skirt instead of jeans, others went all out; wig, make-up, stuffed bra, heels, and really had fun with it.

That said, I can certainly see how someone who already knows they're trans or nonbinary would not want to participate, but you shouldn't feel like you're excluded.  You just don't have to participate, but if you're that uncomfortable... Just ditch that day and take the heat, just be safe
We gotta stop with this woke stuff.  Im sorry if it makes your dysphoria worse and perhaps you should call the day off, but this school spirit thing is just silly stuff.  We ought to carefully choose our battles lest we risk damaging the entire cause
I think it would have been awesome when I was in school, some of my best memories of childhood were when I had an excuse to be myself. But I didn't really accept myself until way later.
I mean the idea of opposite genders isnt transphobic imo, but it makes it hard because where are enbys supposed to find computer costumes this far from Halloween/j
It’s more or so if you dress as fem dress masc and vice versa and if you dress adrongynous then pick one, maybe a bit ignorant but i wouldnt say it’s transphobic
It’s not intentional, but it is kinda a problem. If it was a celebration of gender non-conformity that would be one thing, but it sounds like the vibe is much more “ha ha crossdressing ironically 🫠.” Is there anyone in administration or any teachers tou trust to bring this issue up with?
They really should reframe it as dressing as a gender different that your own. You could even bring this up to whoever plans these things. They may change it to make it more inclusive.
Even with more than two genders male and female would still be seen as opposites
My kids’ school would not allow that but they’re very aware and progressive (thank god).
Honestly maybe I’m in the wrong but I kind of like the idea. It gives the eggs and boymoding trans people the chance to dress how they want for a day without the usual fear of early or pre-HRT anxieties of passing and coming out.
I mean it is obviously not a direct attack to you and I wouldn't consider it transphobic, it's just ignorance but that is everywhere. Btw, I would love my school to do something similar, just enjoy the moment and do what you want to
people be like: abolish gender stereotypes

then they go create shit like this that push the gender stereotypes
The fact that they would even allow, let alone encourage, gender-nonconforming attire makes me think it isn't intentionally transphobic. Implying there are only two genders is, but that is such a minor micro aggression given the clearly intended meaning, that I'd almost just let it slide in this case. Could be funny to cross out ""gender"" and write ""sex"" on some of the fliers, but thinking about it, not wanting a bunch of kids to see the word ""Sex"" on fliers in a school prob had something to do with the verbage they used.
There’s a difference between something being fun and something being funny. Having an “opposite gender” day because its fun is a celebration of GNC. Having one because it’s funny is transphobic. It’s up to the school and the students participating to decide for themselves which one it is, which can be a good and a bad thing. Allies doing it in good faith and advocating for us in the process, or transphobes mocking us. It will probably be a bit of both.

And for the record I think this sort of thing still works in a non binary context. I can walk to the opposite side of a room while still acknowledging and respecting the space in between and outside of the room.
Short answer: yes but not really

Long answer: It's definitely binarist and supports cissexism, but I highly doubt they're even thinking about that sort of thing. Then again, that's the evil of cissexism: it's normalized, so people don't even think about it as something they're doing.

That said, encouraging people to have fun with clothing and gender expression is good. It should help normalize gender nonconformity, so long as expression is allowed outside of these sorts of events. So I think it's a net positive.
Go dressed as a guy.  That would be appropriate 🤬...  Some people mocked me as a crossdressers (which I def don't identify as, I'm just a woman obv) and they were right in a sense.  I *was* crossdressing most of my life.  As a guy.  Not a very pleasant dress-up day to have, if it's every day of your life.  But cheer up, things can only get better! ❤️
School spirit is so cringe.
Can’t believe I don’t see more of this but um yeah it’s like opposite race day and I’m so sorry you have to face that.

And before I get torn to shreds if one single trans person feels something might be transphobic and harmful to them, it is. We’ve been gaslit to accept a lot of shit over the years
Incredibly transphobic
Personally I’d tell my principal that I’m offended that they’re doing that but then again I was a kid who was always “idgaf” so picking fights with teachers and principals wouldn’t have phased me. But then again by 16 I was living on my own so maybe my advice isn’t the best to follow.
My year tried to do this for one of the weekly free dress days, people complained this was problematic so they changed it to ‘your type’ as in people you are attracted to. I heard so many lesbian jokes and comments that day, many of which were not tasteful, and then people very rushedly trying to defend their straightness in response. Just ew
OP if you are having suicidal thoughts, please please talk to someone. I understand this situation is triggering but I am worried for you <3 lots of love
i think it’s just for fun i’m sure they aren’t trying to imply anything
Dress up like a sparrow.  Pick of the four genders. Get a fabulous hat with yellow stripes.

No. It's actually a good thing for eggs that are unsure about their gender to experiment. Idk why it affects you tbh just dress how you want
So at university (mid 2000s) i was involved in the SciFi and Fantasy Society (larp, tabletop, book library, cosplay etc) and the RockSoc. We had a fairly active social scene and there was a tradition of ""cross-dress-offs"" where a number of us would drag-up and go to the monthly big goth night. Whilst I didn't organise this it may have been partly due to my own clothing choices that this started.

I had mixed feeling about it because whilst it normailsied what I did a lot, and maybe enabled some people to embrace their identity in a low-risk setting, I think some my trans and out friends felt a bit trivialised by this. Non-binary wasn't as spoken about then, I didn't understand myself as that, I just kind of threw what I did in with ""gaaaaaay"" or ""queer"" and carried on.
I've seen a handful of schools do similar things and call them respectful things. It's usually just positive vibes and I'll always encourage cis people to crossdress given the chance

I personally learned I was trans from dressing as a joke, so I think it can be healthy if done properly.
I agree, but the problem *is* that it’s intended to be funny and goofy. There’s nothing goofy about changing gender (logically anyway) and it shouldn’t matter what we choose to wear regardless of gender. Historically so much abuse has come from making fun of transvestites, transgender folk, non binary and queers because it’s “funny”, allegedly because we aren’t considered the norm so it’s something to poke fun at.

A good documentary to watch that encapsulates some of this, is Disclosure.

Opposite doesn’t mean binary as such, although it’s kind of implied. I mean, a non binary person could dress as like agender..?? That’s where it gets confusing because gender and clothing aren’t representative of each other.
They should just do a funny dress up day. It doesn’t need to be about gender at all.
I love this idea. Opposite dress day. While I know this isnt the case for op, even if they did dress the opposite of how the usually do and were comfortable with that, if someone asked if they're dressing the opposite gender the answer is no. I'm dressing the opposite of how I usually do. This is me having a good time if clothes that look cool.

A rephrasing of that day would be better.

Cross dressing is a bit odd for me. My dad did it once for Halloween. I can see the humor only if it is a cis individual that clearly does not identify that way. Like this doesn't fit you because it is not your gender, and it is not an expression of who you are. It's only funny because it's not you nor is it who you are. Doesn't have to be gender related.

If it's them expressing their gender? Not funny. Go away. It's a fine line.

 Expressing yourself is a beautiful thing and deserves recognition as suck. Support that person.

Op I'm sure you are a kickass person and you deserve a ton of respect. If you need to talk about how you feel to people dressing up that's totally valid and fine. If they matter they'll hear you out.
my school has this stuff but only for the senior year. I'm trans and just dressed as my agab but in the most exaggerated way possible so that it was clearly a joke so I wouldn't be uncomfortable. most people exaggerated anyway. Idk how it would've been for someone non binary tho.
I am a trans person who, before I knew I was trans or knew the word transgender, was part of a class that initiated something Iole this. 

It was initially just our class. We had a teacher on the younger side who used to perform political drag and he told us he couldn’t tell us too many stories because it was inappropriate. (This was the 90s.) So we decided to pull a stunt. We figured out who could borrow who’s clothing and got there early to exchange outfits and so everyone’s make up/hair could be done (boys got full faces of make up, girls got fake stubble, etc) 

The school was not pleased but to my understanding it is now an annual tradition for everyone, not just one small history class. 

It wasn’t stupidity or malice. It was a bunch of queer kids protesting about gender expression that is now an annual event for well over two decades. I can understand such an event being removed from what we were doing in the 90s and didn’t have the language of today.
You Playing 5D chess here
You're an absolute MADLASS!!!
Schools in Czechia seem to be ignorant of the nonbinary and other genders.
The thing is that I cannot, mostly because of being poor.
Because I constantly am feeling suicidal because I cannot look like the gender I feel like, and then they just dress like the opposite gender just as it's nothing bad.
You worded this so much better than I could have
Clothes are one of the things, that actually don't need to be gendered, but for some reason are.

&#x200B;

This is just a humanity being humanity.
But it certainly can be seen as transphobic and stupid. There are multiple genders so simply having them say to dress as a different gender would be much better. There may be others who feel the same way as OP.
Technically, for my mental health it would be better to not go to school ever again, or at least not to the same school I've been going to for 4 years (I regret changing schools).
I think the intention behind this event is harmful because they haven't even stated what the intention is. All they've said is what crossdressing day is and when it's happening. The tone of the announcement seemed like they wanted people to find it amusing. 

If they had actually explained the purpose of the event, I wouldn't have assumed it was meant to be transphobic.
Exactly it's not the schools fault and it's easier to phrase it with ""the opposite gender"" rather than something that's slightly more inclusive
I'm going to see if there's a teacher I can talk to about this issue. I'm sure there must be someone I can speak to, or I can ask whoever is responsible for scheduling these strange days that happen once a month. Although the previous ones were fun, the one coming up in February is not good.
Actually, I am considering that.

&#x200B;

Them: *So, who's participating in this?*

Me: **raises hand**

Them: *But you aren't dressed like a girl, you still are dressed as a guy.*

Me: *Exactly.*
Yes it is. And once you get into the workforce, it still happens unfortunately. I wasn't excited to be in school and I'm not excited to go to work, just lemme do my job and go home.
I get where you're coming from, but there are TONS of terrible people, some of them trans. If I said that all femboys are transphobic that would be wrong, but by this logic it is now transphobic without question. Crossdressing is not transphobic by nature
I especially agree with the second part.
Is there any way I could do something about it? Last time I checked, there's an anti-discrimination law in Czechia.
The thing is that I cannot dress how I want.

&#x200B;

And even if I could, people would assume I'm a guy, which would hurt me a lot.
I hate how cis people cross dress as a joke, often to mock and berate GNC people. But I think you can take it in stride and play it up- point out the obvious fact that they're enjoying themselves. Go so far into irony that you're making them comfortable with it.

But it's a really complicated one. I've seen a drag show that degraded into a racist transphobic mess. The whole thing was a sad mocking of it all... Whilst simulatioualy a display that the person was showing a part of their true self. It's gross
Yeah in hindsight how much I enjoyed excuses to do full masc drag should’ve tipped me off… 

I don’t think it’s transphobic to have a crossdressing day, as long as it’s not being conflated with “haha trans people are a joke”. A lot of cis folks genuinely enjoy crossdressing sometimes for a lot of reasons, many of which are entirely benign, and tbh I think restricting cis people from crossdressing would do more harm than good (not least bc it would force any trans person who wants to change their presentation even temporarily to out themself first).

I am sorry it’s upsetting for you though, OP. I hope you can figure out a way to enjoy or at least mostly ignore the day (maybe as an excuse to dress how you’d like to without outing yourself?)
Yeah my school did something like that. I dressed up in a skirt and crop top with a bra that my bestie gave me and everything cuz “hA HA fUnNY” and then had a severe gender crisis when I realized I never wanted to stop dressing like that. Whoops
I have no clue what it's like in Czechia. From what I gather it seems like everything country is ignorant. I hope you can pull through and stay safe. It's tough being a trans girl.
Do you have any friends you can plan outfits with? Maybe borrow some clothes and accessories and help each other pick what you would wear.
Well it is “nothing bad”. Nobody else is responsible for your gender dysphoria.
I think people downvoting you is a little harsh. I can see where you're coming from. It sounds like what you mean is that: you can't be yourself openly because of the negative attitudes towards trans people-- but then they have this day where everyone will be doing what you *can't* safely do normally... and it's all for some cute little game. And that's frustrating.

Your reaction is valid and I think you're right to have those feelings of frustration. However, as others have said-- a cross dress day can be really eye opening for a lot of gender non conforming people. You can use it as a day to present how you truly feel. And maybe--as another user said I think-- point out to others the fact that it *is* fun to do, and that, therefore, breaking from gendered norms can be fun.

I dont know what your home life is like or what ability you have in this but, maybe you can fake illness that day and stay home if you feel like it will be too hard.

But as a personal anecdote. When I was in 3rd or 4th grade we had a cross dressing day and I dressed with a collared button down and tie and it's one of the first times that I discovered I didn't like dressing ""girly"" and it did change my dressing preferences.
That's not their fault people crossdress and it is a cool idea and if you're not out to people then enjoy the day of being dressed comfortably
Yeah I do agree, I’m not invalidating OP’s feeling. They have every right to feel the way they do. But I still stand by the world won’t stop spinning for anyone, no point wasting time upset over something that’s outta your control
yeah but you need to go to school, i said that to avoid that day
They might have just remembered it being fun when they were a kid.  Your teachers might have been my classmates.  The administration is a group of people so there may not be a sole intention and purpose.

I'm really sorry you find this so troubling.  I think the organizer of the event would feel the same way. It might help to talk the organizer and find out if they are friend or phobe.  Then you at least know the spirit of their intentions
It's not the schools fault? Then whose is it?
You’re right, I’m sorry. I don’t think that all cross dressing is transphobic. I do think imo it certainly can be and is in the context of OPs post. 

The administration likely had good intentions here and same with most of of the participating students but it’s having a very different impact.
It’s a trigger for you and your feelings are valid. 

I’m surprised most of the replies haven’t addressed that, though the nuance of what most people are saying is also valid and important.

One thing I would suggest is to send an anonymous note or email to the teacher in charge of arranging these events. You can share your personal struggle with it or you can cite the anti-discrimination law, or both. 

If you are worried at all that the communication could be traced back to you and that that could affect you negatively, definitely don’t include any personal info.

The schools where I have taught usually have a designated locker where these type of feedback notes can be left anonymously, but there are cameras in the hallways, so they can figure out who dropped it in if they really wanted to.

I assume there isn’t a teacher there like me that you can go to since I would have helped this “opposite dress” event come up with a more inclusive name, and also I always ran a safe space group for 2SLGBTQIA+ and allies. It sounds like you don’t have that and I’m sorry.

Another option, if it would be too much for you on that day, try to stay home or not attend school that day. Sometimes we have to pick out battles, and I certainly know that suicidal thoughts, when triggered, can be quite a battle. I’m glad you’re alive. <3
That's really up to you to find out. I'm not familiar with interacting with others in general
Yeah, crossdressing can definitely be done negatively. The idea that it's embarrassing and inherently funny is transphobic.

On the other hand, modern crossdressing feels very different from its historic context. Crossdressing is so common now that it's not even funny to regular cis folk.

There's also a very big difference between Crowder doing drag to be transphobic and someone dressing in drag for pure fun and entertainment. Because drag IS fun

Negative behavior is entirely case-by-case and crossdressing isn't inherently wrong for cis folk.
My friend and I cross dressed as a joke one time in high school and she came out as trans a few years later and told me that day was the first time she felt confident in her own body.
There is ignorance in every country, but it’s pretty unhelpful and kind of invalidating to say that every country is ignorant
Bit of a generalisation if you have no idea don't make assumptions
Another reason is that the people at my school are not very supportive of transgender people. If I were to dress as a female on that day, they would assume I am a male, which would hurt me even more.

And even if I would be able to dress as a female, I would still be treated as a male.
But it's not out of anyone's control, it could be changed or at least OP and others could attempt to change it. The world may not quit spinning for anyone about anything, but it is a very invalidating comment.

And as far as ""let them have fun"" comment. Let's not continue to normalize having fun at others' expense.
Although I do admit it that school is very important for me, I still think that it isn't good at all for my mental health.

&#x200B;

The school system seems to be built in a way that makes school not care about your well being and mental health. It seems school even ignores you if you speak about your mental health problems.
Its no one's fault
I agree with you, no need to be sorry.
It shows
Yeah I think it's a great way to experiment but I think the whole narrative around it is so confused and mixed in with hate. I am actually feel like I'm in the minority of trans people who think drag narratives are harmful/ offensive. It just feels like a mocking. But I'm still cool with it- just observing it's discourse
[deleted]
They weren’t saying every country is ignorant. They were saying that people in the country (as in rural areas) tend to be more ignorant. This is very true. People in rural areas tend to have less access to diverse populations than city folks. Therefore, “country” folks often have more traditional/conservative ideas. This is not true of every individual person who lives in a rural area, but you can this general rule is true by voting pattterns.
Why should it be stopped though? It’s not transphobic it’s a harmless activity that can prove more good then bad. It would be easier for OP to stay home and miss a day of school rather then put up a fight to stop people cross dressing in a safe environment.
‘At others expense’ is a very controversial thing to say. It’s like saying all swimming pools should close because somebody doesn’t enjoy swimming.. you just wouldn’t go swimming? what about the ‘expense’ of those wanting to have fun with cross dressing and experimenting or having a fun time with friends?
thats prob true
So it's nobody's fault that the school is having a day for people to dress as ""the opposite gender"", implying that there are only 2 genders? No one made that happen, it just was like \*poof\* and the magical opposite gender day was on the calendar?
You're kinda a jerk
That's kinda my issue with it; as a trans woman I see femininity as something in very high regard that I put a lot of work into fitting into the mold of. Some drag performances, especially the big, televised shows, feel like a buncha gay men mocking this thing I strive for. On the flip side I've seen local shows that are wonderful and encouraging! Like one performer, a trans woman who's a drag king; that alone is both funny and kinda its own commentary. 
The common conservative view of drag and trans can also be useful to us. Conflating the two, conservatives end up expecting all trans folks to look like drag queens, so they're not looking for me, the 5'5"" girl in a plain dress, or Lucy the tall lady at the pharmacy. Because we're trying to fit in with average women, the image of big hair and glitter beards kinda acts like a smokescreen for us.
In a sense, that is exactly what drag is. It's highly exaggerated masculinity/femininity, in part as a satirical commentary on gender norms in modern society.
That's not really how gender works
Not if they’re women dressing in traditionally feminine clothes, no
It's not harmless. Not only is it harming OP (and probably others), it is re-enforcing gender stereotypes as there are more than two genders.
You're analogy doesn't work. And I see no harm in what they want to do, just that they shouldn't say to dress as the opposite gender. Dress as a different gender would be more inclusive and would not alienate those students that don't identify as either male or female. 

It could still be problematic because style of clothing doesn't make someone male or female. Just because a woman is wearing jeans and a t-shirt doesn't mean she's not a woman, or that she's dressed as a man. The event relies on stereotypes. It would be like having a dress as ~~the opposite~~ a different race day. What do white people wear compared to black people or Chinese people, etc?
No I'm saying that the school doesn't need to spend a bunch of extra time making everything mega inclusive because someone's gonna be mad at it no matter what they phrase it as and it's also not the schools fault that OP has suicidal thoughts about being trans it's a fun idea to most people we have to pick and choose our battles bc if we fight everything that upsets us we're never gonna be truly respected
I'm okay with drag, but I really wish they didn't always lump trans and drag together. As I've been getting more comfortable with the fact that I'm trans (it's been a very slow coming out with all the insanity of the past few years and the toxic vitriol towards trans people..), I decided to look into a local LGBTQIA+ friendly bar, thinking it might be good to just go to some space where I could be myself, present how I want and not be judged for it beyond my lack of taste. I found out they specifically had a night for trans people, where they have drag queens performing.. Yeah, because I really want to come be myself with the framework of a male bodied person wearing makeup and feminine clothing being a performative thing at the front and center of it all.
They could put no extra time into it and show respect to the LGBTQ+ community by just not doing it. Solved. You know there's more than just OP at that school who has a problem with it, they're just not posting about it on reddit.

And of course they just put in the tiniest amount of extra time to simply change the wording so it's inclusive of all genders. Instead of opposite gender, just use different gender. Solved with one word change and everyone is included!

This may not be a battle you think is worth fighting, but others do. This isn't just about OP, this is about how the school is treating the queer community and being disrespectful."	103qxqm	trans	332	0.9	2023-01-05 05:42:14
Went out today with my dad and still feel like I’m getting weird looks :( dysphoria is telling me I look like a guy with long hair, I’d really appreciate some honest feedback on how I’m looking? (20 MTF 9 mo HRT)		"You look super cute! Maybe people are looking because you are really gorgeous, can it be?
Look 100% feminine to me
Girl you are STUNNING! You do not look like a guy with long hair. If they were looking, it’s because they were checking you out 😉

Not hugboxing, being honest. You look incredible hun
[deleted]
Tried to include pictures with different lighting and a couple with my hair back since I’m insecure about that. I feel like my hair and makeup both look not great especially the makeup and idk just feel like still at 9 months i just look like a guy with long hair.

Any feedback is appreciated and I’d prefer no hugboxing, just be honest with me so I can try and work on things thanks.

ANY MAKEUP TIPS ARE MEGA APRECIATED!
You look 100% female i see no masculinity at all you're very pretty
you're super pretty and like actually cis passing
You look great. Looking at those photos, I wouldn't even begin to supect you were trans.
1. You don't look like a guy with long hair.

That's it really.

You're getting looks because you're cute.
Girl, you are super cute! 😍 Tell that dysphoria monster to hush and keep on killing it💖💙🤍
You're a very beautiful woman.
You’re good :) had to check the sub
i think they are staring because you are beautiful 💜
You're gorgeous
Honestly, you look like a brunette Karen Gillan. That was my first thought.

Your chin isnt prominent, you dont have facial hair, and your apple is barely noticeable, so yeah, you definitely pass. Someone would have to be looking way too hard to think anything else.
You’re getting looks because you look like a beautiful woman.
[deleted]
I see 100% a female. You’re getting looks because you’re cute 😊 welcome to womanhood sister ❤️
You don't look like a guy, girl you're gorgeous!
I’m so jealous, you are absolutely beautiful girly. I know dysphoria sucks, but I would never have clocked you, Like you would have had to tell me for me to have known.
You look absolutely gorgeous! If I didn't know any better I would think you were a cis female!
If people were looking at you weird, maybe they were just thinking ""damn she be looking fine!""
Other than that, I've found a lot of the time it's just anxiety, people are usually too busy with their own lives to be overly concerned with someone else. I find it helps to tell myself that when I go out presenting fem.
But you absolutely rock that outfit girl!
Your dysphoria is a dirty little liar, all I see is a stunningly beautiful young woman! Maybe that's why people keep looking at you ;)
[removed]
Not in the slightest!! You’re goals 🥰
You look amazing! I see nothing but goals
Lookin fine !!
That 0 facial hair got me. I hope my lasers work faster :( I cant go out like this even makeup doesnt work
Ya you’re a hot woman
You’re very attractive.. all I see is a pretty girl 🖤
I wouldn’t clock you
Girl you’re gorgeous!
You’re getting looks simply bc you’re gorgeous 🥰
Dysphoria is lying to you
You look super cute and pass 100% imo
Stop listening to the dark thoughts they’re just lying to ya
You easily pass, probably people checking u out.
I can honestly say that if I hadn’t read what sub I was or your caption I would have never known your were trans. You aren’t just passing! You are killing it girl! 💖
I have a cis daughter in her 20s.  A lot of her friends have ink but you look like you could be one of them.
I'm getting Sandra Bullock and Clea DuVall vibes.  I see no man here at all.
Imma be straight with you, you probably aren't getting weird looks unless you haven't voice trained yet. You look fantastic.
ok look i need to be honest to you you look nothing like a boy i have meney female model subredits and i thout this was one of them so you look amazeing thay are checking you out and i hope i can look like you one day
MTF? I thought you must have been joking! You totally look like cis woman. Beautiful and delicate 💜 Keep on slaying this look! You're perfection!
You look like a girl ya doofus
Honestly anxiety is a bitch it's always telling you that people are staring at you for everything. In reality people probably glance simply because your an attractive girl then go on with their day. There's nothing that I would consider abnormal about you at all. You're looking great 👍
I'd hit on you if I saw you. You look female enough to me. I wanna cuddle you.
You look very feminine. Please don’t worry about what others think.  As a retired teacher, I would tell my students that the only opinions about you that matters are your opinions and the opinions of those that love you dearly.  Everyone else’s opinions are pointless. Be happy and joyful and that’s what people will see.
You tellin me that ain’t a cis lady? I refuse to believe you
Super attractive female! Wow!
You look gorgeous. They're probably looking at you because they think you're cute
Jesus I wish I looked like that
Have to ask: what do you do with your hair? Looks gorgeous.
100% feminine! They are not looking because you look like a dude with long hair, because you do not! You just look like a gorgeous girl!
I was confused as I read this as I thought you were a Cis girl. You pass just fine, hon.
Don't listen your dysphorie, it's bullshit, you look beautiful and very feminine!
I think that you look very attractive dear
You look like a pretty young girl to me.
You're so pretty!!! Also, you definitely look like a woman to me. You're rather skinny and your features seem feminine other than slightly broad shoulders- which, many cis women do have broad shoulders so you're not alone there. If I saw you walking by I would def think you were a girl :)
You are extremely lovely and people where taken back by how stunning you look. You rock Sister, now go out there and turn some heads.
You are Beautiful.  I'm sure if anyone is staring it's in admiration. You shouldn't have any trouble passing.
Sweetheart, you look absolutely breathe taking!
I only see a woman and a very cute one :)
Okay first of all you look fucking GREAT and secondly GIRL HOW DO YOU PULL OFF YOUR STYLE SO WELL GAWDAYUM
Those looks are just cause you are so so cute!! Really I wouldn't be able to tell you're trans if you hadn't said so. You look amazing.
I think you look great. I don’t think you look like a guy with long hair. You’re very attractive.
You look super cute! You definately look like a girl
[deleted]
You look beautiful to me
Hun. I’m jealous. You look super cute 🥰
Full honesty, you look incredible. I only WISH I looked this good, I'm about 9 months now too 😅 Trust me, just take deep breaths, keep your chin up, and let the confidence flow forth! You look so great!~
You look TOO FEMININE ❤️
You look amazing girl 🥰
You're nailing it! Any way  we get a part 2 of how your day with your dad went?
You pass very well and are very pretty!! I know I can feel like ppl are looking at me weird when no one is so maybe you have the same problem? I can see no reason as to why ppl would give you looks
Yeah if not for the fact you're on this sub I would have assumed you were a CIS girl.
Maybe people just have some hot takes about Los Angeles rally week, I can't imagine why anyone would stare at you in a bad way
You're so feminine! Also, your hair is just, mwuh! I wish my hair was as long as yours (and I'm a dude!)

You're rocking girlmode so hard, and if anybody tells you otherwise, they're lying just to make you feel bad.
I think you look cute af.
Dysphoria is lying to you.  Don't listen to it!
You look amazing. Cute young wan.
So cute! Love the hair pulled back so much!
They looking cause you CUTE
You honestly look amazing 🤍🏳️‍⚧️ something I used to struggle with a lot, and still do from time to time, is trying to decipher if people were staring at me bc they were clocking me, or if they were staring bc they thought I looked good. You already pass really really well based on these photos so the looks you're getting from people might be bc they thing you're cute ❤ and if it's old people staring at you then it's most likely them just judging young women in general in our generation for out skin-showy outfit choices lol
Oh wow you are cute! Would’ve never thought you were a guy before. Pretty nice looking ngl, just my type
You look 100% passing to me
Okay, so to preface this, I don't give false compliments. It's just something I'm against doing, personally. There's literally always something nice a person can say without lying or relying on ""well, if you look at it this way"" technicalities.

So with that in mind, I absolutely promise you that you look feminine AF, OP 💜 You don't ""look like"" a girl -- you ARE a girl, and an extremely pretty one, too. Anyone giving you looks is honestly probably checking you out, haha -- like, not even kidding, that's most likely why they're looking at you. There is nothing even remotely boyish or masculine about you, whatsoever.

You are a beautiful young woman and that's exactly what anyone who sees you in public is thinking 💜
Might just be that you’re tall. But you’re 100% girl to me.
You legit look like my sister’s cis best friend like girl you pass perfectly fine, just keep your head up and remember that dysphoria often comes with dysmorphia so you physically don’t see what other people see. Trust everybody here who is telling you that you look gorgeous and perfectly fine <3
You look great :) definitely passing
Sweetie you look adorable! And 100% girl!
I don’t see a guy! Only girl
Looks like a beautiful girl to me. 😎
You look gorgeous that’s why people are looking. Better get use to it
you a girl to me. A very young beautiful girl
You're very welcome. To be honest I wouldn't have known  you're MTF if you hadn't said.  Good luck with everything and try to be confident
Omg you’re absolutely gorgeous !!!
You look amazing and you do not look like a guy with long hair… at all.
Just having a second look and feeling attracted, thinking of things to explore together.
You genuinely look like a young cis girl with short hair
Thank you so much😅
Thank you!!
Thank you so much I really appreciate the kind words!
Thank you, I appreciate it, my anxiety gets the best of me a lot so hopefully that’s all it is :)
Your very pretty first off so don’t worry about that. People probably are just staring because your on the prettier side of people they see. I really like your hair too, it suits your face shape really well both forward and pulled back, but also have fun with it if you want, just because it’s nice don’t be afraid to do something wild for a change if your heart desires. 

As far as makeup goes, I’m not an expert but I’ve learned an ok amount, is there anything in particular your looking for help with?? Of course YouTube has great resources but sifting through that to find someone that has similar features and style can be tough. 

I hope the dysphoria can lay off for a bit so that you can get a good long look at yourself and appreciate who you are, you deserve that much at least.
In terms of makeup tips, I think your eye shape would look amazing with winged liner. You have these gorgeous, soulful, slightly down-turned eyes -- like, people would describe you as ""doe-eyed"", which is obviously inherently feminine -- and that kind of eye shape tends to work beautifully with winged liner. It takes a lot of practice to get good at free-handing it, but there are lots of tricks and tools you can get, like eyeliner pens that have a wing-shaped stamp on one end, so you just have to fill in around the stamp and connect it to the line on your eyelid 😊 I've found those super helpful!

Also, putting a powder highlighter or pale shimmery eye shadow on the inner corners of your eyes would look amazing on you -- it would really make your eyes sparkle, but still be quite subtle in terms of actual makeup. Also, if you're not confident with full-on eye shadow looks yet, starting out with just a light contour powder or bronzer is a great option. You just use a fluffy blending brush to add a light wash across your eyelid and up above your crease. It doesn't have to be perfect in order to look beautiful and it allows you to play around with different eye shadow shapes without doing anything dramatic or daunting 😊 And it's something you can do either with or without winged liner and that highlighted inner corner trick, too.

Hope this helps and please ask away if you have any questions! 💜 I've become a total makeup junkie, haha.

Thank you so freaking much for these tips!! Honestly I was worried eyeliner made my eyes look weird so maybe I was wrong about that :) and I love the highlighter shimmer in the corner idea! Thank you for the kind words as well and I may ask a makeup question in the future if I have one😅
i know right! super pretty girl 🥰
Remotely?
No problem at all!
Honesty I'm sure any attention you get would only be checking out type stuff.
It's still not overly great, but it's better than the looks of being clocked. For me it's almost affirming in a way haha
No problem :)
Good! You’re too cute to be sad and dysphoric
Well it looks great. As well, what'd you do with your eyebrows? Sorry for the questions, just that your goals for me rn ngl.
You’re very welcome!
😊
No problem have a good day/night
No way! You have a beautiful face!  

You've got some nice Star Wars posters too! Super cool!
6’2” here. Welcome to team Amazonian, shorty.
Just honesty hun! Try to keep your head up, dysphoria blows but we're all here together and we're all gorgeous no matter what our head tells us.🖤
Hey thanks so much sry I just saw this. Tbh for my eyebrows I just pluck them a little every so often but nothing major, mostly they are natural and I lost my eyebrow makeup somehow recently so in these pictures it’s literally my bare eyebrows. Sorry I know that’s not a great answer but I’m still learning myself😅
It's weird. We look pretty similar, same age, similar time on HRT. Lately been feeling bad about myself, but seeing you rock it whilst being able to see myself in you has been really confidence boosting, so thanks :)

And about feeling weird about the hair, don't worry, I've been there. It's long, but not to point where you can really *do* anything with it and it can feel a bit shitty.

Also, I get if not, but any chance you have Steam?
I’m glad it boosted your confidence :) and thank you for such kind words. And I definitely know what you mean about the hair, I feel like curling it doesn’t look good on my rn and it’s not long enough to do much else :/.

Also I do have steam but I’m gonna DM it to you cause I don’t need my steam on a post lol"	pdnnqq	trans	329	1.0	2021-08-29 03:12:44
Whats with hoodies??	"Why is wearing a hoodie so good at giving me gender euphoria? i look so much better in a hoodie than just a t-shirt! why doesnit work so well??


also what colour is your dysphoria hoodie??

Mines black and has a design from a video game!"	"Because they hide the contours of the body VERY well. They look virtually the same on anyone. So it's easier to suspend disbelief of the presentation problem. That’s my theory at least. I used to also wear hoodies and large clothing in general before my body started shaping up the way I’d prefer
To say it with the words of a meme I once saw: 

m2f's buy hoodies to hide the barren plains.
f2m's buy hoodies to hide the rolling hills.

I can send it to you through DM if you want to. 
But that's basically the reason:
You can hide the part of yourself that you don't like more efficiently.
With the sole exception of the 5 t-shirts I bought for actually presenting how I want to after I transition 

My entire wardrobe is hoodies. I have so fucking many.
Coz baggy. 

It was a major game changer getting a tight hoodie with a sideways zipper. I feel so thin and femme :O
Warm and comfy, hides face and bodyshape. I got a [cat hoodie](https://cdn.attitudeholland.nl/_clientfiles/King/17000084%20Poizen/084005252-L.jpg).
I lost my favorite hoodie :(
OH SO THATS WHY I ALWAYS LOVED HOODIES (context: recently discovered Im trans)
Literally same i like my body but in a tshirt it looks weird thats why i always wear zipper hoddies or normal ones
Hoodies are modern day invisibility cloaks.
They hide the dysphoric parts of my body very well

Mines a gray hoodie with a forest print on the inside. I also have an army-styled Patriots one and a dark blue crystal looking one. Planning on extending my collection
For me, love em cuz they hide my boobs pretty well! My dysphoria hoodie is for a local sports team :-)
mine is plain purple!! got it from the men's section too, so extra euphoria as a transmasc lol. i really need some hoodies with designs on them but i'm so picky lmao
I have a dark grey hoodie and my favorite is a burgundy one :) i look good in burgundy
Made me think of how i wanted to just wear a shirt and shorts today cus I felt lazy then I looked in the mirror and say how fucking wide my hips are and put on the largest overshirt I own to hide it.
they help covering things that look obvious that you hate, like boobies. as a ftm i get how suck they are. boi i love hoddies so much cant wait till its actually winter to wear them
I used to only wear hoodies, but I can’t wear them now because they just remind me of how I used to hate my body. Luckily I’ve changed since then so I look good enough in unisex T-shirts 😜
I have a few dysphoria hoodies, my favorite one rn is a light red with the gap logo on it. I also have a red sweater I got from when I went to see the grand canyon that I like a lot. As a bonus, I have a euphoria sweater, a red turtleneck that makes me very happy :)
I love hoodies because they do so well to hide my big tits that before I had a binder I wore a hoodie every single day to school. Every single day lol
Mine’s black, too. It used to have a design on it, but you can’t see it anymore unless you look closely. My brother left it at my house one time (after visiting from another state) and I wore it almost every day for a long time after that lol
I use to keep my boymode, unfortunately I live in a very transphobic town, and for security and work reasons I have to be in boymode when I leave my home ;(
Navy blue with a moon rabbit design on the back.
Dysphoria hoody is actually a set of four jackets with a gray base with black sleeves
mines baby blue because i think it's a cute color :)
I have two both have Star Labs on it, but one is much larger and silver, the other is much more older and the it’s faded but a Dark Green
they're good at killing dysphoria, because they hide well. Even oversized T-shirts make me slightly uncomfortable because it reminds me of my small wrists, small hands, and lack of a lot of arm hair. 

I have several of the same dysphoria hoodie in different colors, but i like my navy green and navy blue one the most.
Mine is a blue Mama Mia! hoodie I got when I saw it live in London
i havent worn a tshirt in public since 2017 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 hoodies are great
My dysphoria hoodie is a thick black slipknot hoodie from their 2019 WANYK tour, I think because it's thicker and heavier it makes me look flatter and feel more comfortable (ftm)
To me it's the youthful feel as well as bringing more androgyny to your appearance.

I have multiple, favs are light purple, light yellow, hot pink:)) <3
mines the white punz hoodie, tho i only wear it at home to not get it dirty, but also the blue one
What video game is the design from 👀

I just wear a basic grey
I use my only 2 hoodies that fit.

A playstation hoodie and a blue-white hoodie.
I actually just got a new dysphoria hoodie yesterday! It's mock jean ""vest"" with grey sleeves. It definitely shapes my body in such a nonbinary way. Gonna sew patches on it. 

Also I saw other people explaining the hoodie, just wanna agree that they're great for hiding any part of your torso/shape you don't like. And then it becomes all about the clothes, and you don't have to be scared of people staring at your body like a weirdo to figure you out. You're in a hoodie, there's nothing to look at besides the cool design on it.
Because nobody can make out that my chest pecs might be something else in a hoodie
Mine is green 💚 and it’s easier to hide my torso with it which is the part of my body I hate the most
Mine is a black hoodie from a band called archspire, it's got a golden logo of the band name and a sick design on the front
My dysphoria hoodie is really oversized and pink haha, so it’s actually helped a lot and I always wear it with some generic pants if I don’t feel like shaving my legs 😅
My dysphoria hoodie is actually a giant black t-shirt with a raccoon being abducted by a tractor beam on it lmao
Mine is navy blue and says ""Math - You Can Count On It""
Mines a black pokemon one. I also have a batman one I wear sometimes
Just wait until you start wearing that old dysphoria hoody as a stylish *euphoria* hoody. Its great and you're gonna slay
Mines a black leather biker jacket but I ride so I need it more than a hoodie
Hoodies are my safety blankets and like having a snuggle all the time. I have a lot of them and thanks to my last two, I'm learning I absolutely love oversized ones.
I don't know why they do, but I feel the same. Nothing better than an oversized hoodie in my opinion
My hoodie is like a burnt ochre colour. My sister gave it to me like 3 years ago for my birthday. I wear it daily, I can't leave home without it.
Hoodies are absolutely amazing! My dysphoria hoodie is a pastel orange colour! :)
Got Me-self a bomb ass pale yellow hoodie   
(imagine a sunglass emoji being used in an ironic way)
Mine is white and has some pictures of Niko from OneShot!
Mine gives me euphoria because of the long sleeves. I got 4 sizes up so I can spin in it. Also it has a witchy design which I absolutely adore ^^
Mostly what others said. I have more than one cause they are also really comfy. Black one with anime graphic, green one, blue one, and a pink one with a ying yang. Two have the thumb holes made into them.

I feel smol in them and I like it. It’s like a constant hug from my clothes.
I think it hides body shape really well, so your subconscious mind can imagine your body to be whatever it wants. 

Mine have historically been forest green because that matches my eyes, one of the few features I actually like about my body
mine is a John Deere green hoodie my dad got for me, he works at a company that sells John Deere equipment.

Edit:  forgot to mention that it has the logo on it too.
Mine is black, and used to have the blue lantern logo on the back, but that has washed away
And yet my gargantuan shoulders still show through my hoodie 😞
Why did you use 2 instead of t- now I'm imagining gender molecules like h2o
i see i see. that makes sense
i LOVE hoodies
Same I only have hoodies
Oh my fucking god I need that
Wow that’s awesome
Congrats on finding yourself
Its from a small indie game called ""Omori""!

Are you on hormones? They helped my neck and shoulders a good deal by just deleting muscle mass. Hell even my underbust is shrinking. I was 38in like 6 weeks ago and now I’m 36.5. I suspect mostly from back muscles deleting

Euphoria straight into Dysphoria	"I work a delivery job and about 50/50 get ma’amed or sired and people generally don’t correct themself, but a few days ago, I took one where this little girl came running up and was so happy. “The pizza girl is here” then her dad opened the door, corrected her, then apologized. 

Like bruh, let me be happy sometimes."	"Children are better than adults, it's a well established fact.
The other day I had just left the house with no effort, like I prolly just look like a boy all day and it’s fine. First stranger to talk to me, says ma’am do you have any change, then I talk and they said sorry Sir. I told them they were right the first time. But like shit, didn’t think I’d get ma’amed at all and definitely wasn’t ready to be sirred right after
i’ve found that a lot of children are more supportive than adults… crazy
Children will always be better than adults
I like that, “let me be happy sometimes”, those sons-a-bitches
think about it most of them are innocent, free of mental illness and untouched by political bias, not to mention as i child you dont have to work a job or pay rent or mortgage. i mean lets face it growing up suck (for the most part)
Same here! Lately I've had to wear bras because o started hrt and my nips have been sensitive and I feel like people in my area intentionally throw in extra sirs or dudes to be a dick. But I've also had so many awesome and wholesome interactions as well.
I was babysitting and the girl I was babysitting was like at my school there was a Father’s Day dinner and there was a girl who went but she wasn’t pretending. She was actually a father. It was so cute (I’m also ftm)
This is so true. Kids where I used to work called me a boy long before I started T or presenting as a man. One time this kid saw me and was like ""he's a boy and girl"" 😂 at the time I was identifying as nonbinary so I was internally like THIS KID IS RIGHT. Of course parents always get embarrassed and apologized but I always assured them it was fine with a smile.
The world naturally gets more liberalist over time. When we are adults our kids will (hopefully not) see us as conservative. Not that I want kids.
Nice! I'm not able to really openly socially transition in my workspace due to my carreer requiring me to work with right wing doufuses but my coworkers ""pick on me"" and like cat call and make fun of feminine aspects of my appearance in like a friendly flirting with the hommies way and thats just the absolute highlight of my day at work
This isn't true at all, progress doesn't happen without people fighting for it. Regression is entirely possible, especially with how hell bent conservatives in a lot of countries are on going after trans people.

Hopefully the future will be better, but it won't just happen on its own
History says otherwise.

Pre-Nazi Berlin had a thriving queer & trans community. Magnus Hirschfield basically pioneered modern trans healthcare at his Institute for Sexuality.

Then the Nazis came & burned it all.
>gets more liberal
So, you think the world is increasingly progressive?
I agree with all of this, but I just wanted to say that I think that last point is really important! While you definitely see progressive models of history further to the left (e.g. very strict/literal readings of Marxism), I don’t think it’s a coincidence that some of the most famous people promoting this narrative right now are essentially centrists or moderates with no real interest in even reforming the system (Steven Pinker types, I mean). I think it’s not coincidental that their view is one which makes political action seem unnecessary, or even somewhat foolish, in the face of the often systemic  failings of our day.
Yes thank you grammar.
Yes. Not quickly, but yes.
Because authoritarianism has been really hot lately in poliics especially by people that don't know what it is, or have never lived under it . Quite a few have said there's many parallels to 100 years ago. Almost frighteningly so. I mean to some extent I get what you're saying, but as a whole it's not really reflected"	txy5w1	trans	333	0.98	2022-04-06 22:33:35
Officially diagnosed with gender dysphoria!		"Looks like u already hav a good jump on things congratulations!!
Welcome to the club!
Wow!  The docs finally caught up with reality, huh?
Then let me take this opportunity to diagnose you with the cute. I'm afraid it's chronic too
But, do you need it to be trans?
Congrats. The Dr. has you off in the right direction now :)
Congrats! I hope you’ll get to start HRT soon!
Thank you!
Yes! But more like I finally got the  courage to be me. And a lesson to other trans gals, don't be afraid to seek help. Its probably easier than you think.
Thank!
No, you don't need it to be trans, but where I live you do need it to be able to start hormone therapy.
May I ask What else would you want to transition for if you weren’t unhappy with your birth sex?
That sounds like the worst. D=
I'll m sorry... 😔
To be happier with my body. I don't think I've ever really experienced dysphoria, but when I started HRT it was nothing but euphoria. So, I think people should be allowed to be curious and explore as long as they're being safe about it.
It is what it is, I  still did what it takes to be me.
But is it safe if you’re sterilising yourself? How did you know it would be euphoric if you were comfortable with the Male sex?
Well, I'm real happy for you!! you're well on your way! Best of luck on your journey!!! 💙💟⚪💟💙
Interesting point. I'm not sure I was comfortable with the Male sex. I just knew it didn't really ""upset"" me.

I didn't know it would be euphoric, but being born as a woman has always been a curiosity held in my mind. That's what lead me to trying HRT in the first place.

Don't worry about me being sterile, I was able to freeze my boys before starting HRT. ;D
You're the best. Thank you!"	e9ack9	trans	324	0.98	2019-12-11 17:46:54
can i be a man that uses they/them pronouns?	"I've identified as nonbinary for a while, and I still feel like I fit that label, but lately I feel less and less comfortable being associated with ""womanhood"". The only time I feel okay with ""being"" a woman is because of the outfits, and even then it kinda feels like I'm crossdressing (despite the fact that I'm afab).

Idk if medical transition is relevant, but if it is I do plan on starting HRT sometime to get more masculine features. Ideally I'd like top and bottom surgery too, but realistically that's not something I can get (and I think I can live without it, despite gender dysphoria).

When it comes to pronouns, she/her feels gross, but he/him feels awkward. I still feel comfortable with they/them, but I don't know if that makes me ""less of a man"" or not.

&#x200B;

I ""feel"" like a guy, but I don't relate to other guys (neither cis nor trans). Can I still be male? Can I be a nonbinary-man? not in a demiboy way, but more like a bigender way (even though I don't actually want to call myself bigender)"	"ya for sure!
Mhm, it's all a buffet tray, just pick the pieces you like and leave the ones you don't

You can literally mix and match whatever you want

It's your gender, you get to pick the toppings
Yes! Absolutely you can, m8!
Yep! Gender and pronouns arent equal
Pronouns aren't gender specific, u can be a man and use she/her pronouns! It really doesn't matter your gender, I am a girl and use they/them pronouns along with she/her pronouns
Yes, you can be a man who's called they/them. Pronouns don't decide gender. But also, you could be a nonbinary man, that's also a thing and there are different experiences of nonbinary men, so if that's what label fits you, that's good too.
Just like the song

Anything goes!
You can be whatever you want to be 8)
So I’m experiencing the same feelings about myself and just spoke to my partner about it. Didn’t post on here about my confusion but thank you for posting because not only can I get advice but I know that I’m not alone!! It’s reassuring. Thank you. And my opinion has always been yes, we deserve the same respect of pronoun and gender even if they aren’t as straightforwardly understood
Gender ≠ pronouns.
Men who use they/them are real and valid
This is the exact reason that even tho I consider my a trans femme enby I use she/her pronouns.
yes definitely! gender ≠ pronouns
Mate just do what works for you, what feels good for you and what you want to do. No one can tell you what you can and can’t do. 

If they them feels good to you go for your life, get your transition on and live your best life. You owe no one an explanation and no one owes you their permission.
Im in the same boat but reversed. I’ve known for a long time im nonbinary because i never associated with manhood. While i see myself more as a woman, it just doesnt feel right calling myself one - so they / them it is. Solidarity with the struggle. Hopefully we can both start HRT soon!
someone who switches between the nonbinary and ""man"" label and uses it/its

pronouns are part of gender presentation. like clothing you can use/wear anything
Yes
Absolutely! pronouns don't equal gender at all!
you can use any pronouns.

use she/her for all we care lmao

doesnt invalidate you as a man
Ofc you can
You can do anything and no one can stop you unless they're willing to shoot
Each of our own responsibilities is finding our own gender amidst all the millions of examples we see and come across in our lives and online. I would argue that is part of what reactionaries are freaking out about - we are each getting so much more information/example to base our own genders on as we grow up, so of course it will get more complex/convoluted on an individual basis as we each expand out the ""norm"", painfully slowly...  
The bravest thing we can each do is stand by our own gender even in the face of people wondering ""how you can"". You simply ARE, and you always have been! Their lack of understanding of it is painful but absolutely irrelevant :)"	up5sb8	trans	326	0.98	2022-05-14 00:51:07
I really really wish I'd known what trans people were as a kid	"When I was about 7 years old, I started to consistently ""pretend"" I was a girl online in various chatrooms and online games. This stopped when I was about 12 or 13 because my voice was getting deep enough that people didn't believe me anymore.

As a kid I'd also always tell people irl that ""if there was a button I could press to become a girl, I'd press it."" My friends and family have confirmed that I was saying little things along that line all the way through my high school years. ""If I could go back in time and have been born a girl"". But only because I thought girl's fashion was (objectively) better, of course /s.

In my high school years, there were nights where I'd cry after having measured myself and realizing that I was still growing taller. There was a time where I cried myself to sleep over the size of my adam's apple.

It's so painfully obvious that I was a little trans girl. And yet it took me 21 years to even consider that possibility. Now my body has been poisoned by male puberty because I simply grew up with no positive exposure to trans people. Zero understanding of what it means to be trans. 

So I really really wish I'd known what trans people were as a kid, but I'm also so happy that kids today are growing up with exposure to trans people and with the resources to transition earlier.

tldr: I was very trans years before I knew what was trans people were. If I'd grown up knowing about trans people and gender dysphoria, I'd have transitioned a lot earlier."	"This though! Almost 100% identical to my own story. I was trans before even knew ANY of this was a thing.
I had the ""girl in the mirror"" dream at age 8.

Started wishing I could be a girl at puberty and that these horrible changes would stop. At that point a lifetime of depression began.

Spent decades researching trans sexualism and gender surgery and hormone options at public libraries before the internet was available.

5 months ago at the age of 67, my egg finally cracked, and a therapist confirmed I'd been suffering from gender dysphoria for over 50 years.

I will have the letter that will let me talk with the HRT gatekeepers, a couple of weeks before my 68th birthday.
I know the feeling absolutely. The feelings for me came about when I was around 12. But I was really clueless to the matter. I was also going through a really hard time at school and had the idea that ""maybe"" I am thinking about being someone else because I am just going through a hard time.

So when I had finally told my parents and my aunt about 10 years later. She suggested the idea of taking a few months to think about it because the thought of being a girl could be sparked by the idea that I am simply unhappy.

At first I was like okay I can do that. Then after a week I am like wait WTF AM I DOING I thought for 10 years that I was just unhappy and that was why I wanted to be a girl do I really need more time to think about it again?

So I was just like sure I am unhappy but that is not because I am unhappy about the things happening in my life right now but because of the things I am not making happen in my life because I don't enjoy who I am or who I put on to be in public. After that I pretty much decided to act the way I had always wanted and decided to dress the way I wanted which eventually lead toward being a woman.

I had absolute serious anxiety before coming out as trans. I couldn't even apply to a job because I hated who I was to the point I didn't want anyone to see it. So when I had come out as trans. My confidence shot through the roof now I pretty much do everything as if I never had anxiety in the first place. And let me say defeating my anxiety and coming out as trans was probably the best thing to ever happen in my entire life since it entirely changed my world from being stuck inside afraid of everything to going out everyday with confidence in everything I do.
100%! I remember as a real little kid thinking that both boys and girls could get pregnant and have babies. And as a boy that didn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, I used to play pretend and would borrow my sister's clothes to make the game more real— until I got caught but that's another story. 

Always made female characters in video games because I identified more closely with them. And cried myself to sleep wishing I'd wake up as a girl the next morning. My parent's would have forced me to go through male puberty regardless, but at least I would have known what I was.

I'm so happy to be out now and finally know who I should have been all along, but there are times where I feel like I was robbed of so much time.
All that really resonated with me. :x It is very bittersweet to hear about people not having to deal with the wrong puberty or being able to go on hormones before 18 when the majority of us have already suffered through it and still struggle to find happiness and fulfillment despite that. Well, at least for those of us who have survived something so devastating and traumatic. It is without a doubt, steps in the right direction for us but it doesn’t make it hurt any less. 

Having an upbringing devoid of any trans narratives or where only the negative ones are seen and heard, becoming near irrefutable fact, is obscenely problematic. The Family Guy episode which aired in 2010 helped ruin my understanding of trans people at the time and compelled me to further repress myself while I was a budding teen, on top of having only negative and untruthful things told to me growing up about the LGBT community as a whole. With all that happening, I would have taken my life had the hospital I was at wasn’t educated in LGBT issues as well as precursors to those issues (ex. Having discomfort with one’s body because of going through the wrong puberty).
This hurts to read.  Every bit of it just echoes my own experience, and my frustrations with the limited understanding I had back then of what it means to be trans.

It took me until age 34 to \*really\* figure it out, but I stopped and considered it was a possibility many times over the years, and rejected it each time because of that same limited knowledge.  I didn't fit the extremely narrow view I had, so I disregarded it as a possibility over and over again... and I'm bitter about it.  Moving forward and enjoying my new understanding of myself, but bitter.
when i reexamine my past life, experiences, personality, it's so obvious. it's like one of those magic eye pictures. if you look at in just the right way it pops out at you. but the place and time i grew up in was the kind of place where queer people kept their heads down. i knew very few out gay people and no out trans people. ""man in a dress"" was just the punchline to a cruel vicious joke. i simply did not have the mental vocabulary to understand what i was feeling.

huh, why did i back then keep obsessively shaving off all my body hair. weird. guess its nothing.
Realised at 14, still can’t get hormones for many years
Me too!!! There was no positive depiction of trans people when I grew up (late 90s, early 00s). It was always the case that trans women were loud, flamboyant, tr-ps who trick straight men into having sex with them.

I could not and do not identify with that (no offense if you do, it's just not me...). So I never even considered being trans as a possibility for me. But I knew I wanted to be a girl so, so badly.

Now, I'm in my 30s and puberty has done its thing. This is the same (if not more difficult to bear) pain each trans women feels who's as old or older than me. It's just not fair.

It's not fair that society poisoned us with toxic transphobia, and kept us locked up in the closet. And it's even worse that, now that I'm out of the closet, that society wants to throw me back in.

TW: violence, lots of violence.

ETA: removed because I don't know how to hide text...

Ok, now that that's out of my system....
So do I. There were signs when I was little. I loved playing with my sister's poly pockets. I'd try her dresses on when no one was home. I absolutely hated having my hair cut and wished it would grow long. I used to watch a lot of shows that were ""for girls"". Dora the Explorer, the tinkerbell movies, some barbie movies. I always took the female option if it was available in video games and even as a kid I loved writing stories and almost all my leads were women. I had a panic attack once when a kid in my class asked me ""if my balls had dropped yet"" because the idea of going through puberty terrified me.

But growing up there was some sense that all of that was wrong. That it wasn't allowed. I was a boy, I was supposed to like boy things. I don't recall my parents ever saying anything bad about the LGBT community but I know I was terrified that they'd find out I liked wearing my sister's clothes so clearly I picked up on their intolerance even if it wasn't overt.

I told myself I was just scared ti grow up and maybe I was just a little odd but that was fine.

Took me seeing an episode of a medical drama called Royal Pains where this trans girl (played by trans actress Nicole Maines) has been having fainting spells (the show had a different medical ""mystery"" every week) for me to even understand what trans actually meant and it took me awhile to get that I fell under that umbrella. 

There were enough signs that I could have transitioned at ten years old. I could have gone through the proper puberty and been happy with my body. Instead I didn't start HRT till I was 24. That was a year ago give or take a few weeks. I'm so much happier now than I was back then but I can't help but feel resentful that I didn't understand when I was little and that no one in my family was watching close enough to see the signs.
Yeah same here. If I knew being trans was a thing as a child, I would have told my parents I was trans around age 12. I kept wishing I could be a girl. At the time, I concluded I was only having those thoughts because I was socially awkward and wanted to be popular.
How I was until I was like 14. For some reason alot of people have trouble knowing what they feel and either repress the feelings or something not good.
I used to pretend to be a girl on Omegle everyday after school. Then it went to actually pretending to be a girl at the mall after I was dropped off. This went on till I was 14, then something terrible happened, and I stopped doing it. It wasn’t until I was in my late 20’s I finally decided to do what I always wanted to.
It's so much the same for me... I pretended to be a girl so often on the Internet, not even trolling, just having normal conversations... And I didn't know that such thing as transgender (or anything lgbtq tbh) existed until last year... And I wish as well that I could have known way earlier...
So relatable. I'm transmasc, and I only knew about trans people a little while back. I spent so many years trying to be as feminine as possible because I desperately wanted to fit in with the other girls when I knew I didn't. If I'd known about transness as a kid my egg would have cracked when I was 3 years old.
Ik how you feel i was the same way not really telling family that i wanna be a girl bc i would of be disowned x) but I didn't figure it out till a few months ago and my timing couldn't of been any worse bc i figured it out about 1 Month before my first wedding anniversary 🤦😅 i did tell my wife and she was shocked at first but not mad ,she wasn't ok with staying with me and transitioning bc shes not attracted to girls but would be friends, but she did say she is ok with me dressing up but not going out with me till shes more comfortable and i will take that, im 26 and yes ik  i could still do it but, i fell in love with her the first time I saw her in high school and has been my best friend ever since and i couldn't give her up in the way i have her now, ik people on here will say but you will be living a lie your whole life well if thats how you see it fine but i ask you this how much does someone have to love another to be in a body they aren't fully happy with? That to me shows a unmeasurable kinda love and i can die happy with her knowing shes my best friend forever....sorry i got off topic slightly but just saying i completely understand your situation and u have ALOT more time so dont think bc ur 21 or even 30 ur life is over if taken care of yourself ppl easily live to 70+
this. I wish confused little 5 year old me had someone tell me that it was normal and okay. I wish they’d tell me why I hated being a girl so much. why I kept trying to talk to guys so I could feel like I was one of them. why I hated my name so much. I’m still pretty young, and could definitely avoid most of puberty. But everyone in charge is transphobic. it feels like I’m tied down to a passenger’s seat, powerlessly watching myself become a woman. a woman that I fucking hate.
I came here poking around because I have a 4.5 year old son who I’m trying to figure out how to have a deeper conversation with about transgender. He is generally quite feminine compared to other boys his age, drawn to girly stuff, nothing like my older boy. He recently asked if a boy can ever grow up to be a girl and I said yes and gave a brief answer, then changed the subject realizing I needed a better education before being a teacher on the topic…

I’m glad to read some of these stories to learn more from various perspectives. Thank you for sharing!
Hindsight does suck but sometimes it is best to just accept it and nove on.
From the age of 6 I wore girly cloths and acted like a girl a lot and my parents always thought I was gay or a very very fem-guy /femboy and I did the same I cried a lot wished I was born a girl (still do) but I’m turning 15 in 3 months and I’m going to be starting hormones ASAP after that and I came out yesterday but I’ve known I was trans for as-long as I can remember
How did you just start acting the way you always wanted and dressing the way you always wanted? I'm 20, still living at home. I finally came out to my parents a few months ago but I'm just like paralyzed with fear still about possible problems with relationships with family and friends both. I'm also worried about just having to deal with shitty people in a conservative area in general. I'm too afraid to even call to schedule an appointment with a therapist and try to start hrt. I want to push past this point so I can actually have a chance at being happy but I'm so afraid of getting hurt even though I know I literally can't avoid it and I'm hurting now too. I feel stuck and ridiculous and I feel so alone.
>on top of having only negative and untruthful things told to me growing up about the LGBT community as a whole.

So true. It would have been one thing to have simply been unaware, but it's really terrible to grow up being taught that LGBT people are going to hell, etc. I grew up Muslim, and so the very little that I ever did hear about trans people was very negative. It's really hard to unlearn that stuff. ""I wish I was born a girl, but I'm not like trans or anything"" is so silly, and yet was something I thought and said more than a few times in the year or so leading up to my egg cracking (despite having become pretty aware of trans issues and being a big ally at the time). And I've heard other trans people who had similar thought processes before coming out because we grow up internalizing so much transphobia :/  


p.s. I'm sorry for your struggles but I'm really glad you were able to find yourself in the end <3
Glad I’m not the only one who was lightly scarred by that Family Guy episode LMAO
Oof, this is me to a T.  Really struggling with the self-resentment lately.
""Not having the mental vocabulary to understand how you were feeling"" is a really good way of putting it. This is why I think its very important we have positive representation in media.
Yeah I was in the same boat.  I realized very young, came out to parents, got shoved back in the closet, had clothes stolen, punished etc. and couldn't transition for another decade.  Having the vocabulary can be liberating but it's also really rough to be fully aware of what you are and unable to do anything about it.
My parents definitely made a difference but I would say a lot of it was me being afraid of remaining the way I was. 

I had the idea that my life had already been written start to finish. Live from 1 to \[Number\] with my parents until they pass away and I would just become homeless. It was so terrifying believing that was how my life would end up being. So I always told myself I wanted to change. So when I had finally told my parents about me being trans I decided that I would do whatever I could and take leap of faiths like no other.

I was afraid of so much in the beginning honestly. All the same things like being afraid of making appointments, going to interviews, dressing the way I wanted. Because I was afraid of things people would say. But you get to this realization that ?sadly? and kind of great at the same time that nobody really cares. People have to much to worry about with themselves irl to say anything. I think (a lot of us not all) get slightly to wrapped up on how the internet treats us that we think it looks like that irl. I have dressed fem for the last 3 years and nobody has ever once mistreated me publicly or behind closed doors.

Now don't get the wrong idea I am not saying there aren't bad people out there and that you will always be lucky to never be mistreated. But, that most of the time honestly you aren't even gonna notice someone saying something or anyone staring and if they are who cares.

All of the best things in life are on the other side of fear and let me tell you that statement was so true. Everything I had feared going into being a woman as soon as I got over doing it. All those fears not only went away but also flourished me into the absolute most amazing person that I get to be today.

So I guess my advice... ignore other people and do what makes you happy take a leap of faith and you might be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately there is no magic things good and bad will happen but in life where good and bad things happen I would want to live that life living the way I want to."	qld4dr	trans	324	1.0	2021-11-02 20:15:36

can someone help me cos im so confused about whats going on (i called monday this week and they said they had referred me to a GDC - im 17 btw)		"You won’t be able to get into the child one while you’re still a child, basically. Therefore, in three years when you can get in, they won’t accept you bc you’re an adult.

Have your doctor refer you to the adult clinic
Hi, word of advice (also from the UK):

As stated in the above letter, waiting times of 3 years isn't going to change even if you join the adult care. You should still go ahead and get a referal but you are 100% better off going private. When I started, it cut down the 3+ years of waiting to 6 months... Big difference. 'Shop around', as it were, and reach out to as many gender clinics as you can. Get some quotes for treatment and decide what's best for you. In the mean time, do as much social transistion as possible, this will help things go a lot smoother for you. Google free deedpoll and get your name change if you haven't already, it's actually really easy to do.

Any questions, feel free to DM me. It's a hard process, but you'll get there.

Goodluck! x
So basically, they’re saying they’re booked up, and you’re going to have to probably go to the adult clinic as by the time they’re able to do your first appointment at the Youth one, you’ll be 18 or older
I hate to break it to you sis but most of the wait is a lot longer than 3 years, you’re old enough to be referred to an adult GIC, which have waitlists anywhere from 3 to 20 years, you can pick which one you get referred to, so hopefully it won’t be too long, but either way you should look into private healthcare (or r/transdiy) because the NHS will likely keep you waiting into your 20s.
As other people have said this is just because when you hit 17 they realise you might not get appointments for what your looking for until after you turn 18. Then youll be considered an adult and be seen in the adult one. This happened to me and they do keep into consideration any wait you already had. I think I was 16 almost 17 when I was referred by the time it came around I was advised the same thing and they took the wait time into consideration for me. I think I was finally seen at 20 but decided to go privately in the meantime
As someone who’s under Arden and gems, they’re transferring everyone to local services now (not sure exactly where as they haven’t specified), especially those under 18 (since GIDS has been dissolved and no longer exists). If you’re lucky, you may be seen in 2026.
It's saying by the time the child services can get to you, you will have aged out of their remit, so they are giving you two options to access your care in a different way by being seen as an adult.
3 years!?!
Idk looks like they are saying that you need to do to the adult clinic 🤷🏼‍♀️
At 17 you should be referred to the adults one already
 Nhs? I wish you luck. From what i understand American free health care is better than NHS for trans stuff 😬
You should look into genderGP
I’m not sure what route you’d plan on doing, but if I were you, if your going to college or uni, having a student loan would help a lot if you’re worried about being able to afford it. Or, alternatively, a part time job. Either way, you got this girl! 😊
Dearest Trans people, please watch a video on YouTube by philosophy tube on how she struggled to get an appointment in England.
She is an English trans woman, and she shared her experience with the NHS with her audience (it was not good). If you're looking for information, I just want you to know that you can find out alittle about how it works there.

I think it's titled ""I emailed my doctor 133 times"" or its on the thumbnail. Best of luck.
Damn 3 years waiting time, you guys over there in England are f*cked meow
you’re too old my guy
do you know if they have records of which gp i saw last time?
Ew private. I only say that as I have no insurance so that’s my problem. I don’t have the economic means to afford private care but I have no other option cause there is no government option for me. So I just get to be a chronically depressed person.
@-@

could my gp have referred me to a different one?
my plan is to do a bit of private if i can and cut costs of everthting down so i have as much money as possible for it :)
ik its stupid you have to wait that long 😭😭
ik i think my gp had a brain fart while filling out the form or smth
yep T\^T
I read this the same as the above poster. Its unfortunate but not super complicated. There might be another child service, otherwise you're waiting a year.

Its almost certain you gave them a referral letter with your referring GP's details attached.
Well, everyone's situation is different. Here in the UK, we have the National Health Service who provide free healthcsre for all including trans care. Trouble is, there isn't enough money being put in that sector which leads to things like 3+ years of waiting lists.

I'm sorry you're in a shitty situation but I'm just trying to give advice. I was once in this position too and everything is scary. Doesn't hurt to have some guidance.
No one has insurance in the UK that’s no how it works everyone gets free at the point of service healthcare on the NHS or you can pay out of pocket for private care. Private care is also not the ludicrous amount of money it costs in the US.
Im saving to move to somewhere with cheaphrt like norway or Denmark
Ask your GP to refer you to the adult one
Make sure to show your GP that letter when you ask for a referral to the adult clinic!!
Most private places want you to be 18, so it might be a good idea to save up until then, GenderGP do see anyone over 16, but they are quite expensive and not an ideal option.

If you’re having money issues, then r/transdiy is an option, very thorough research and caution is required, but it is very cheap in comparison.

Good luck with everything!
Not all adult GICs accept referrals from 17. The best thing to do is look at the websites for the ones closest to where you live. Ask your GP to ask them to honour the time from the original referral which A&G picked up.
*hugs* meow meow
i called the gp and they have a letter to fill in to refer me to the adult one but my gp isnt in atm and he was nice so im 100% sure he will fill it in as soon as he can so im gonna call in 7 days to see if there are any updates, fingers crossed i can start hrt next year or sooner :)
Oh yeah by any means didn’t meant to try and derail your point. I’m just personally not in best mindset but that’s the usual with chronic depression I don’t realize I’m going down a depressive rabbit hole til way too late. 


Just so easy cause to me I feel I’m being real and objective at the time. I’m US. I’m aware of some issue trans people face in UK thanks to philosophy tube.
they have already seen it 😎😎😎

Did it take a while for you to get used to your pronouns?	"I figure it's kinda normal but I've been out socially for about three months and it still feels a little weird when I hear people use my correct pronouns. It might be an mental health thing (anxiety/depression/dysphoria) but it feels almost like a surprise when i hear others use ""she.""

Did anyone else feel like that and if so how long did it take for it to feel normal?

edit: to be clear i love it :) just not used to it yet"	"I've gone from he/him to he/they to they/them to she/they and it's been a weird adjustment every time. But even if it feels weird, it also feels right 💕 and that's what's important
Absolutely. I’ve only been out of Reddit and the number of people who have been calling me “girl” or “sis” it’s been crazy and don’t get me wrong I absolutely freaking love it and I feel so validated but it took a while to get used too! I wasn’t expecting it lol! I think it’s because our Brains don’t like change.
100% 

A little imposter syndrome 
A little fear of self advocating 
And a dash of relief from dysphoria which often feels strange. Like suffering is my normal state. I don't know what to do when something doesn't hurt.
I still feel that way, and its been about a year now since I came out using he/they. Maybe its because I don't hear them being used often enough hah
Yeah it took me a while I'm use to it now but sometimes I still misgender/dead name myself in my head even after 2 years lol
Yeh
The euphoria omg
It is weird- I am kind of still adjusting to some friends using it, partially because I know they probably have to think about it before hey use those pronouns and that makes me uncomfortable
yeah
big yes!! felt very anxious and worried but it goes away now its just euphoria from she/her 🥰💕👍
Yes, definitely. The first couple months every time a friend used my correct pronouns my heart would feel weird for a second or two. I don't know how to describe it, but it felt like it skipped a beat for a second, like I got scared and I think it was my subconscious saying ""Oh no, they know my biggest secret, I feel very exposed right now"" and the second later a warm, fuzzy and comfy feeling would settle in and in a few seconds my brain would start processing again whatever they were telling me lol
Yes
Not so much my pronouns but definitely my name!
It did not.  That fact was once part of my argument for not being trans.  I'd get ""misgendered"" (referred to as female, AMAB and presenting as such) pretty regularly when judged by my voice and it never really bothered me.  It happened a few times face to face and I was mostly bemused and wondering how they'd come to that conclusion!  (Can't be trans if I don't mind being called a guy after all!  And if I conveniently overlooked not minding being called a *girl*...)

These days my presentation varies, and so sometimes I'll go out looking credibly female (with almost a year of HRT assisting on that score) and others as credibly male and my natural speaking voice is naturally pretty confusing.  Suffice it to say that I'll get a mix of them in my day to day.  If someone's first guess is that I'm male, I'll go with that.  If female, I'll go with that.  If they stick with gender neutral, that's also fine.  And if they actually ask, I'll sometimes explain, but usually I just say that I'll accept whatever pronouns they are comfortable with.
Yeah it just sucks having to restart that at a new job, especially when I haven't changed my name yet legally.
Yes, I'm still getting used to using them on myself. But I get really happy when my friends use them.
Of course. If you had new eyes/legs/fingers/etc. it would take you a whileto see/walk/grab/etc. Same goes for names and pronouns
I feel weird when it's someone i know that use the right pronouns and name, if it's a stranger it will just feel normal idk why
I still have a little trouble calling myself she/her, but I only came out to myself and online friends a few weeks ago. I quite often call someone they/their until I know for sure how they would like to be addressed
Yeah it’s been an adjustment for sure
My pronouns shift almost daily so no, no I haven't
I default to my deadname because of my family but feel physically repulsed when I have to use it. I'm trying to make myself think using my new name but still hesitate because I don't see myself as a woman yet.
I'm still in the closet so I haven't used different pronouns yet
Yes
I figured out my identity back in June last year and have been going by She/Her Pronouns with my friends and people online. It still feels kind of weird.
Not really. Even when I was a ""boy"" I was still incredibly feminine and flamboyant and its pretty common for people to use ""she"" in that case anyway before I even started telling people to not use he for me.
i originally came out as trans but it still feels weird to identify as a “woman” but then i slowly realized i feel a lot closer to just “a non-binary person who is transitioning” if that makes sense? i still see myself eventually being comfortable with she/her pronouns but for now i quickly started asking everyone to use they/them pronouns for me cause he/him gave me the ick and like i said, am not prepared to be she’d. being referred to with they/them pronouns feels both flattering because i am finally being given the respect i’ve craved my whole life (without knowing it) but it also has been hard to get used to cause i forget people are referring to me to my face. i feel like i notice when people use my pronouns more now. i don’t know if this is just a me thing but i’ve also been very mindful of the fact that i still present very masc since i haven’t started hormones and i don’t rly try to do any different either (even though my fashion sense is very gay and camp) and being mindful of my presentation has made it harder for me to center myself with my gender identity than before i was out. because before i was out as nb, being nb was just a me thing and i would just disregard whenever others used he/him pronouns for me. now i get to hear my preferred pronouns from others but i still have to make the effort of being mindful of my privilege as an amab person with cis-presenting privileges.
I’m still getting used to hearing my preferred name from my fiancé. We don’t refer to each other by our names all that much (usually it’s just mushy shtt like pet names) so it’s always a welcome surprise ❤️ 

(I’m not out to my family and I’m not bothering with my shitty workplace cuz I plan to leave there asap)
I had talked to myself with mixed pronouns for years before coming out. So once I switched to female only, it took me like 10 minutes to get used to it and it felt really natural immediately
I'm used to being referred to as he but sometimes my mum talks to my brother and refers to me as his brother and I get so fuxking confused like ""we don't have another brother?"" Before I remember o shit thas me
It’s normal! I went from she/her to he/him 7months ago and it still kinda surprises me when someone says something like “you look handsome“ or “sure dude” or even just saying he around me… it’s gonna be awhile before I’m used to it
yeah, it's like when the year changes. the new number sounds weird for a while too and you also sometimes mess it up
It's been several years ivl and 1,5 year irl, yet I'm still surprised and not completely used to it lol
Honestly, it took longest to start referring to myself correctly in my head.

I spent ages mentally he-ing myself, despite being referred to by she by everyone.
Big relate. I'm over a year into my transition and I still misuse my own pronouns. I've always gotten butterflies when someone else uses the right ones though 🥰
Yes absolutely! Same with my new name. 
It felt odd at first, good but odd.
Yes, I feel weird being called by my name and pronouns, especially currently as I need to let my facial hair grow to get rid of inflammation :/

But I got euphoria from looking at my twitter profile with unapologetic she/her pronouns as well.
I only asked some select friends to use they/them in the past few weeks, and it gives me crazy anxiety every time. It's like I almost feel guilty, like I'm putting a burden on them  or something. So far I've yet to hear anyone use the pronouns, so we'll see how that hits me when it happens.
Yes, I've been out for a few months or so and it's still so surreal but amazing to actually be called she/her. It almost feels unreal
Yeah, I felt that same way in the weeks after I told my parents and they used my pronouns
It’s totally normal
Its been 2 years, and I still sometimes get really happy from hearing the right ones, even though its so common. Hearing my name brings a smile to my face.

I don't recognize my deadname, and hearing my original pronouns sounds foreign.

Its not something I take for granted, nor will I ever again.
I haven’t had a chance to get used to them, because no one around me will use them.
A lil bit but since I'm newly out and now have my chosen name I misname myself sometimes lol
English is not my first language but i use he/hm mostly when im speaking about myself and to myself! ( in polish mostly verbs and adjectives have the masculine(he/him) or feminine(she/her) ending
It's hilarious because literally noone misgenders me anymore (except sometimes a grandpa with a fragile mind), but I sometimes misgender myself in my head - after like 3 years of being 100% boy mode.
Like when I narrate my life or when I think of how conversations could got with others.
But it really doesn't bother me lol. It's kinda funny.
personally, i was going by they/them (before i realized i was a transman) and they didn’t feel right for so long. i thought it was bc i needed to get used to it, but nah. it’s bc he/him was better for me.
I've been out for two years and I'm still getting used to them tbh, it always stands out as a sort of ""huh? Oh hey, cool"" anytime someone other than my mum genders me correctly lol
Yes. My internal dialogue is a third person narrative and took a while to change, I had to actively correct it each time until it made the switch on its own.

Your old pronouns may be uncomfortable, but they were familiar - you spent X number of years hearing them. Your new ones, while comfortable, will be unfamiliar at first until you settle into them. The same will follow with a new name.

Nothing to worry about, it’s normal and expected.
Yeah, for the first little bit I felt weird when people used my correct pronouns and name because I wasn't used to it, But I got used to it pretty quickly.
Im a year in now and its feeling more normal it gets mor normalized especially if i can get my work to use my name and pronouns it helped alot
yeah, its kind of an adjustment
It always caught me off guard when people would use the right pronouns when i first started transitioning, but it gets less surprising as you get used to it! still feels great tho :)
Yep, absolutely! I use it/it's, so I guess it's additionally weird, as I'm not used to it being used for a person, just like other people aren't used to it, so I'm always kinda surprised when people actually use them correctly. And having my pronouns on my profile on twitter feels a bit weird too, every time I see them, it always makes me question them. Until I have someone use them and do lots of happy autistic wiggles because I'm so exited about it xD
Yup
It took me like, half a year? Maybe a year or so. I've lost track of time but I'd say it took me pretty long.

Edit: but every time my friends or family used them I felt happy despite the awkwardness, that's what mostly matters.
Omg this exactly. I struggle to put it into words but you've done it lol
I still do this too. It really bothered me at first until I figured out the pattern. I tend to think of how other people will perceive me a lot, and realized that I was really only misgendering myself when I was thinking of myself from the perspective of someone who I believed perceived me as my agab.

That realization has helped me a lot in two ways: first it contextualized the internal misgendering, and second it made me realize that I need to work at centering my own perspective. While I'm still working on it I'm now less likely to misgender myself, and way less likely to feel bad about it when it happens.
I'm so very glad this helped!"	uluhc5	trans	317	0.99	2022-05-09 15:59:54

Federal appeals court says Americans with Disabilities Act protections cover 'gender dysphoria,' handing a win to trans people		"Until the supremes overturn it…
This might be bad. It means they see being trans as a disability, and excludes trans people without dysphoria.
It will be important to see how this effects non-binary people, but it's a step in the right direction.
I know, they are going to set us back decades of progress.
There's no current basis for them to hear the case. The SCOTUS hears constitutional interpretations, not laws separate from the constitution.

That's one of the big reasons progressives are pushing for the codifying of RvW, because then it would be beyond the scope of SCOTUS.

Edit: That isn't to say they couldn't... Just that it isn't likely.
[The Supremes, overturning it.](https://imgur.com/a/gUftwFH)

In all seriousness, whether the supreme court gets involved or not, conservatives are going to try their hardest to fuck us over on this, as they do on every other issue.
I hate to be the killjoy, but I grew up with originalists and they're going to look at the text, which [actually says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12211)

> >!(1) transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders;!<

are explicitly not protected. In practice originalism seems to mean ""interpret the words of a law in the most bigoted and regressive way that can be historically hand-waved."" So we're not quite safe yet.

The good thing about *this* ruling is that it looks at the effectiveness of physical treatment and says ""well, there's the physical impairment, this case at *least* deserves to be heard.""
Maybe we shouldn't have a supreme court.
The ADA or this new inclusion of gender dysphoria?
I think you’re seeing disability in the wrong light. There’s nothing wrong or inherently negative about having a disability, under a lot of definitions things as simple as ADHD are considered disabilities. All it really means is there are certain compensations needed to give them an equal chance at life, and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s not something to be “cured”.
Unfortunately, that argument could be used against us, yes.
Armchair interpretation (IANAL):

If your boss uses your correct name, you have no dysphoria in the moment and therefore no disability. So being trans is not a disabling factor.

Tomorrow the boss starts using your 'legally required' deadname or bathroom or outfit.
Now every time you encounter work you experience dysphoria, a potentially disabling condition(per DSM5).

From that we can argue that forcing bosses to use your correct gender identity is an ADA enforced protection.

Not all wheelchair users would say ""I am disabled"" but the ADA still functions for them as a guarantee of baseline social accommodation.

Someone fails at that accommodation, like knowingly using a deadname, we get to sue them for failing at basic citizenship.
Alright then, just tell the therapist or doctor or whoever that you have dysphoria. Whats the issue here?
I'm both shocked but also not at all surprised that all those ""sexual behaviour disorders"" are categorized in the same way.
Women unable to produce their own estrogen or give birth certainly sounds like a physical impairment to me; same for whatever the men are unable to do… seems ridiculous to just limit it to intersex conditions or “other sexual behavior disorders,” wtf is the latter?
Beeby does not believe they are saying disabilities are bad—they are saying that not all trans people will be covered because not all trans people experience gender dysphoria. Also, usually, bigots view disabilities as something bad, Beeby thinks that is what they meant—Beeby isn't them though, so not sure.
I am disabled. You don't need to talk down to me.
This language is using the DSM-4 (and earlier) language. With dsm-5 they recategorized gender dysphoria away from those, which are still classified under ""paraphilic"" disorders
And not categorized as ""these acts are criminal"" but phrased as ""these types are not worthy of our governments protection.""

the very existence of the section is bigotry.
The Party of Evil has hated the ADA for decades (how dare people with medical needs feel entitled to reasonable accommodation?) but they used to have a non-extremist right-wing, so that language was a concession between those people and the absolute goblins.
As am I, in a multitude of ways. It was not intended to be condescending, if that’s how you perceived it I apologize, I just wasn’t fond of the implications.
I'm glad they (kinda) fixed that but I still think it's shocking that somehow all of those where in the same category.

Comic I made about dysphoria (I'm ftm, I just use this character to vent lol)		"I relate to this so much it's hard to love and accept myself because I have alot of self doubt and imposter syndrome
Make it suuuuuper big. More comfy and more “feminine” in my opinion.
My obsessive love for hoodies and then attempts at countering that by wearing button shirts and sweaters and then discovering how I despised the look, only to return back to hoodies should have been a sign. But here we are
I like hoodies for comfort. The only problem is that they’re a bit shapeless and don’t go with anything.
that’s something i’m still struggling with, i want to wear t-shirts and jeans but i feel like i’ll look too manly even if they’re from the women’s section
Well, that's surprisingly accurate.
I feel that, it just feels like ur constantly faking and ughhh but we just gotta keep working at it
Omg my two moods are hoodie and button up XDD
I know I just try to remember all the times I felt dysphoric and the times that are obviously trans and try to do things that might make me feel happy like earlier I painted my nails for the first time and even though it looks kinda bad it felt nice
its not that I dislike button ups, its just that they emphasize my shoulders a bit too much to my liking and well they make me look like my dad
Yup that's exactly what I do too lol and if I can't think of anything, I've usually got my friend who will just LIST everything-
Ah, that is completely fair
That's great I just know being a girl makes me happy and the thought of transitioning makes me really excited so I don't know why my dumb brain keeps making me feel like that"	p2zqst	trans	306	1.0	2021-08-12 13:23:28
I feel like trying to exist as a trans person is a pointless battle against the world.	"Almost nobody accepts us. Of the entire world it's only specific parts of the west where we are accepted but even then most people still don't accept us.

And it's not just the alt/far right. It's the moderate right, centrists and a good portion of leftists aswell. Those leftists will normally hide it but will easily side with right wingers when theres an argument about trans people in sports for example. 

I personally wish I could transition so badly. It's a pain being stuck with gender dysphoria without being able to lessen the pain by transitioning but it just wont work. I will be ridiculed, harassed perhaps even assaulted. Nobody will accept me. I'd rather be dead than live like that. This is a pointless fight I feel like.

Sorry for the vent. i'm just at the end of my rope."	"You are right that transitioning comes with many struggles. The key question is: would you feel worse after transitioning than you do now. For me, transitioning was a matter of survival. I’m visibly trans and will never be accepted as a woman. But transitioning greatly reduced the continuous negative emotions I was experiencing.
When you are the end of a rope, you tie a knot and hold on to it. - Winston Churchill
Loud proud trans girl. I've been clockable since day 1  I ts me finally being me; it's also support for other trans people to show we exist. Stares a few comments, some people have laughed - the first few months - now it's usually just double takes can see their minds ""gir.... Oh wait. Ah she's trans."" Some guys though battle hard like they like me lol but damn.
Difficult?
Very

Pointless?
Never
As somebody that came from the south and met trans people before that were having an absolutely dog s*** experience. Finding your family is still a important thing for you to do The people that will accept you for who you are The people that enjoy you for who you are. And if nothing else soothes you the Neo-Nazi party. The new Nazis. The people that were viewed as evil by everybody during world war II. Have found family. If they can find people they agree with then I am absolutely sure LGBTQIA Plus people can do the same and we can do better. Because quite frankly the bar is really low to do better than Nazis
Stay the course, this all shall pass. -John C. Bogle (Founder of Vanguard)

The pain and bad mood will not stay with you forever. Right now they feel like permanent, but like the bad weather, they will not stay. Sunlight and rainbow always come out after a bad storm. (Pardon the Pun).
I’ve boy moded and girl moded.  And today I started going out visibly trans without attempting to pass.  To be honest, going out visibly trans is the easiest.  People look at me, put me into a box in their mind then try not to look any longer because it’s rude and they’d seem transphobic.  When I present full femme including wig and full makeup, I get people staring.  Not sure if it’s because I’m hot or because I don’t pass well enough and people are trying to figure out what I am.  Either way, if really discovered today that visibly trans isn’t that bad after all.  I’m going to start doing that more.
This is what they want - for us to fear being ourselves, so we’ll have no choice but to conform to THEIR morals, NOT ours. 

We cannot let them have even a foot, for they will take the entire mile.
I accept you ❤️ - cis girl in nyc
I believed the same thing, and truly convinced myself that this was reality. I was wrong. Once I put the phone down and spoke to people in real life, it felt like the whole world was tailor made just for me. You don’t know until you know. 

What you see on the internet is not real life. Before transitioning I hated the world for what I thought it was doing to me; but I was actually allowing myself to be held back by the expectations and insecurities of others and not my own. It was comforting living a life where I didn’t have to take ownership of any of this. It was always someone or something else’s fault as to why I couldn’t come out. It was not easy accepting that my view of the world needed to change in order for me to grow because I lack the power to change the world in my favour. It turns out the grass was much greener than expected and a much wider world is open for me to explore.
sometimes I want to dissapear... I feel for you.
I actually prefer trans.  It was a big moment for me when I realized that I’m transamourous.  My gf is trans.  And she’s the love of my life.
I feel this daily, you aren't alone
May vary geographically, but this was far far worse in my head than in reality. I am an out very visibly trans woman (3weeks yay!) and have had only one blatantly rude interaction and it was just a slur yelled at me from a moving usps truck.
This is far from pointless. I agree that it's not an easy win. The fight is still difficult and there will be losses of course. But I'm gonna spend my life to do as much as I can for this world to be a better place at my own scale. I'm gonna be a teacher. Meaning I'm gonna be in touch with the futur generations, giving the cis a way to learn about it and the trans a person to freely talk about their questions. I'm gonna present as a proud trans to people around me, giving them the opportunity to learn from me, taknig critics and trying to send back knowledge. I know I'm gonna fail a lot. I know many will just ignore me at best or harasse me. I know the risks but they are a price I am willing to make. Not for me. Not for my own confort. But for others people to have more peace. You'll never known what would be the consequences of the stone you throw in the lake. But I'm willing to throw enough stones to get ride of as much hate as possible.  


Please keep the strengh. I don't ask you and I will never ask you to take as much will as me to change that. But please don't end everything. Seek for what makes you happy, and it can be at your own scale just thinking about yourself and nothing else.
The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people.

Randy Pausch, The Last Lecture
I validate your feelings for sure. It may not be your choice to be trans, but it’s your choice to transition.
Somehow relieved to know that someone who is probably far across the globe shares my exact mood right fricking now. I live in god damn russia, so i don't have any illusions about how open and tolerant society would be towards me. Hate this feeling of being stuck - can't be happy and productive when not giving in to the changes that dysphoria demands, but can't really be sure you're gonna take whatever the society is gonna throw at you if you will give in.

Sending hugs. I pity anyone who doesn’t accept trans people living as their full selves because those haters do not have the honor of truly knowing some of the most wonderful souls. It’s so frustrating that so many people choose to spend their energy making the world a more hostile place.
We are making a way for the next generation, don't say is pointless to fight!
What you're saying is not wrong, and being able to transition does alleviate gender dysphoria, so it still has a great advantage to it. But you should read my latest post. You might find it interesting, depressing, or maybe even expected?
[This book helped me, tbh.](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3403095/mod_resource/content/1/56ViktorFrankl_Mans%20Search.pdf)
Visibility and representation are what change the minds and culture of the next generation. The reason why so many communities around the world on the different political spectrums are transphobic is the same reason why they are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, abusive to their families, have extreme poverty, and stay silent when they should be speaking up. They grew up learning to stay in the status quo, do what they're told, and then become the next gatekeepers to continue the cycle. You have to break that cycle. A lot of people around you are going crazy too and want to be able to just be themselves without it being a marathon race to the finish. As someone who had to leave their family behind in order to safely be trans, it was worth it and I never wish to go back. If those around you won't learn to change, then you keep walking down that road and leave them on the curb.
When faced with hardship you can run away or choose to dance with it.

I hope you dance!!! 
Stay strong I live in a deep red state and have been out for a long time it has come with very heavy cost, in financial hardship, marriage Hard ship, all friends gone, totally worth all the shit and piss I have had to drink because there is something to be said about loving yourself!!!!!! 


Stay in the game, life is worth living as you see fit because whether or not you believe it you are the god of your reality. Everything about your life can change through your own will. Smile there are people out there that will love you for who you really are, the ones that don’t never mattered anyway. I think of those people like a video game NPC they just there to populate the world we play in.
I think all trans people ultimately end up at this question,  I may always look “trans” but is the stigma and social ostracism worth living your truth.   For trans women, we did have more privilege living as a man, we could walk through life seamlessly unburdened without the headwinds of bigotry and sometimes disgust.   But is that really living?   I had all the benefits of living as a man but that was the performative, that was the lie, that was me dressing up everyday as something I wasn’t.  I was in therapy for years before I could say out loud, “I am trans”, (AND I AM REALLY TRANS!) that’s how deep the internalized doubt goes.  I like to think I pass now but at 6 ft tall, I had to come to terms with the fact that I would always be seen as trans.   When I got divorced a girlfriend of mine said “you have to decide if the pain of leaving is greater than the pain of staying.”  This also served me well in the decision to transition.  Is the pain of being seen as trans greater than the pain of living a lie? I was not the person people thought I was and that pain eventually became so great that transition was my only path, stigma of being trans included.  And honestly I can now say that I wish I had done this when I was in my teens because my life is a million times better now.  Not materially better, I have lost just about every friend, family and asset I ever had, but better in my head.  In spite of the losses I have never been happier in my life and when I die, I will know I had truly lived.

Yes there are! By simply focusing on yourself and your own well-being first (physically and emotionally speaking). Screw all the hateful comments! Screw gender dysphoria and U.S.'s BS politics and this shitty society! They don't deserve our attention anyway. Pay no attention to all the haters! We are 1.5 million strong and growing by number. Not to metion LBGTQ community brothers and sisters, supporters, allies, teachers, family, neighbors, friends... The real number is much larger than that!

I wish I had such a mindset.

But really all I think about is wanting to kill myself. Because I just want to stop being in pain.
Thank you for posting this. The nihilism has been consuming me lately, but I want to light that flame again. I’m tired of just lying down and rotting.
This this this, let the rage and sadness fuel you to fight back. Your very existence inspires those who haven’t felt brave enough to see themselves yet and is a symbol of resistance against the systems that paints us as “less than”.
I get you and I wont tell you not to feel that way. Lord knows I live in a glass house so I cant throw stones. But it hurts me to see kin folk in pain so I gotta say something to you. My last supervisor called me a crossdresser (repeatedly) so I had to quit for my own mental health. I have 2 years sober, I've had to drive friends to rehab, look for friends in the ER, reverse od's with narcan, I've intervened in attempts and got in fist fights with men who have it out for us. It eats at me every day. Idk why I keep going, but I do and every day I take a breath and thank god I woke up from all my od's. If you take away all of your chances at happiness, you'll never get to see what is possible. So far me, or any of these people i know have attempted again. I'm sorry your life is this hard, it's really not fair.

Do you need dysphoria to be trans? ——>		"tbh when you have dysphoria and already been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, you'll often catch yourself thinking 'am I trans or just depressed?'

or, if you use drugs and alcohol daily, you might think 'am I trans or just messed up?'

or, if you've experienced trauma (for me, a major death),  you and your doctors could think 'am I trans or am I coping by escapism?'

the best way to figure out the answers (for me) was that I A) was out for 5 years before I really sought medical transition, B) told my doc's everything without giving a damn, bc I C) got sober and stayed sober for a year while also being on the proper medications and therapy regimens. There's a lot of hard questions when you get ready to transition. The only person that you need to reconcile your questions with is you; it your body, and you're the one living in it.

{6 yrs out, 1 yr and 2 months sober, 1 month on T}
Honestly? I don't really have dysphoria. I'm transitioned 95% of the way I want to be (like maybe 1-3 specific surgeries would be nice but I'm vibing pretty good without em) and the only gender feelings I have are euphoria. I sometimes have issues with how my body is, but that's few and far between and not really gender related. It's a good time.

This post helped me a lot, thank you so much for taking the time to make this...I have been struggling with a lot of these thoughts lately
This sort of leaves Nonbinary people out, but we experience similar variety, so I guess it still applies, without actually mentioning that there's more than two genders
On the 6th page

The first 3 are basically Dysphoria and the last one makes *zero* sense. If your fine being in your natal gender why transition? There's no such thing as ""preferring to be a boy that a girl"" (or vice versa). It's called having Gender Dysphoria to the point of greatly affecting your quality of life and transitioning in order to alleviate Gender Dysphoria and be comfortable in your body.
I'm new to reddit, what does vote mean?
This about made me cry (good cry don't worry.) I'm still figuring things out, and this post really helped. Thanks OP.
This is so good!! I hope you get all the updoots
I'm actually curious about this one.
Gender euphoria is also some kind of inverted dysphoria. When you neither feel bad about your assigned gender nor good when thinking about living as the opposite gender, there is no reason to transition 🤷‍♀️
Amen. We need more messengers like you on this sub.
That’s so great!!
I think you missed the point of the house analogy. If one option is just alright but not that great, and another option represents you and would make you feel great, why settle with the first just because you were assigned it at birth?
Screw off transmed
Note: I hit the up button just because this helped
Basically, upvotes are the ""Like"" button of Reddit, and downvotes are the ""dislike"" of this platform. When a person gets an upvote, their Karma increases, which builds their reputation. Hopefully that helps.
you settle with the first house because it would cost thousands. i’m nowhere near being fully transition and have already spent $8000+ on treatments, plus with bottom surgery going as high as $100000. If i had the choice to not transition and be happy with myself, trust me I would. The hassle of transitioning is exhausting and stressful and i don’t understand why someone would go through with it if they’re perfectly content with their birth gender
No I read the house analogy. And while I think comparing Gender to a House is the one of the most irrelevant things I heard in my life. The difference is that if your already in a house your comfortable in, why go out of your way to pack up your belongings and go through the hassle and tedious process of moving if you aren't in any dire need. You WANT a new house. You don't NEED it. Its called keeping your priorities in order.
Because the ""house analogy"" is flawed. You aren't actually moving, you aren't even actually changing houses. If anything what you are doing is RENOVATING the house, but you still would be in the same house in the same area; and there would be things just like in a renovated house you just can't change due to how the house was built. If we were talking about an actual full sex change then ""getting a new house"" would be more appropriate. But not in this case.

Plus in many regards you would be DOWNGRADING your house. For one you can't have kids, then you have medical issues that can affect the sex you identify as on top of the ones born with (such as a trans woman having increased risk of breast cancer on top of prostate cancer), then there are the social hardships, medical costs, and so on and so forth.

So from the outset this sort of argument fails.

How a female only meeting ruined my day.	"So, I'm mostly at peace with ~~not being a woman~~ *EDIT: my dysphoria*. Sure, there are stuff in my body I dislike and would prefer to be different, but who doesn't? Sure, there are situations that are painful and that probably will be painful, like going through pregnancy with my partner, but I can prepare myself and handle that pain.

The problem is, sometimes you don't see this things coming, and if RPGs have taught me something is that surprise attacks are always effective.

My place of work is rather inclusive, and has a surprisingly high percentage of female workers considering the field. It has a number of policies in place to make it welcoming and diverse, which I appreciate a lot. It shouldn't have caught me this off-guard then that there are female only meetings, that's a rather frequent policy, but it did. I'm devastated by the feeling of being left out and despair at never being able to completely fit in.

It is nobody's fault, my gender identity is not public knowledge at work nor am I planning to make it so, just sharing and kind of reaching out. I will be ok tomorrow, as long as I don't catch another sneak attack.

Thanks for reading."	"Sorry to hear this. Made me flash back to being left out when all my female friends as kids would have sleepovers and talk about how fun they were and I had to pretend I didn't care. Hang in there!
Just out of curiosity, and I apologize if this is out of line (I'll delete it if asked to) but why not come out at work? From the body of your post it seems like a very tolerant and LGBTQ friendly place so why put yourself through unnecessary emotional turmoil when you have the opportunity to alleviate it ina safe work environment?

Again, I apologize if this is out of line. I'm just trying to understand your thought process regarding this.
I’m sorry to hear this, it does feel really bad missing out on things like these. I hope you’re able to take small steps towards the future and be your true self. ❤️
In the closet or not you are still a woman. Sorry you don't feel like you can come out and are in an unsupportive country. I remember how much it hurt to not be out and not be able to be in women's spaces where I belonged. I hope things change for you, but remember trans women are women regardless of being out or not.
Been there. Sucks. And it wasn’t even intentional of them, like you, I’m not out to them yet. So, I can’t blame them, it’s just too early.
yup. my highschool has a ""Girls who Code"" club aswell as a lot of feminist clubs.

I obviously really support the message and the clubs in general since it's designed to empower women for fields which are kind of still male-dominated. just kinda hits when I realize that i'm not actually a woman and can't really join it. then my dysphoria all comes and reminds me how fargone I am from ever reaching that ""goal"".

though it's not that bad since being suicidal over that for a day is better than being shot for coming out, so that's kind of the silver lining atleast lol
At my old job it was very in frequent, but there was a once a year thing that was only for women, which was… I mean I wasn’t out to myself fully at the time, I just have thought about it a lot and it caused me sadness without me really totally consciously understanding, but… Yeah, that was kind of hard.

I would think to myself “well, I understand why I’m not being invited and it’s OK… And I don’t like social stuff anyway so…” But still, I wanted to just be able to be perceived correctly, look right.
Thank you. I think everyone around here can relate to it. That is sad, but it also means we can support each other.
Fucking same. Or all the jokes that came with being bad at football and having mostly female friends in school.
TL;DR: Maybe eventually over something more serious, when I've already made closer connections with my coworkers.

Not out of line at all, but there are many small reasons that pile up.

The first one is I'm not sure it is that trans friendly. Many people (at least in my country) are LGB friendly and tolerant and have not a clue about what to do or think about trans, and I'm not mentally in a place I can afford to be the ""standard bearer"" for the issue. We are still quite invisible here, and TERFs are a powerful voice in my country's public opinion.

There is also that even when the agenda of the company is towards inclusion, I wouldn't expect my coworkers to easily understand it. If I become a bit closer to some of them I might come out to them individually and little by little come out at work, but it's not even been a year and I don't want to jeopardize friendly, normal work relations. As hypocritical as that might be.

And lastly, if the issue was more serious, such as a coworker being openly transphobic, I would come out and take the consequences anyway, but the meeting thing is something really petty. What would be the outcome? To be allowed to join in a meeting that doesn't really interest me and have to come out to a lot of women that, while working for the same company I do, I do not know personally at all to explain my presence? That doesn't seem worth it.

The emotional turmoil doesn't really come from not being able to join the meeting, but from being reminded of my ""unwomaness"" without expecting it. The damage is done regardless of wether or not I attend the meeting.

Thank you for your concern.
Good catch on my transphobic self-talk. I didn't know I needed to hear that, thank you very much. I'm very glad I made this post ♥
If we don't, who will?
Thanks for being understanding of my question and giving sucj a thorough response. I understand better now.
If you are mtf you can’t be excluded from female only events
It'd be pretty shitty and weird of me to make a post to share and reach out and then be offended at people's curiosity and concern.

Still, one can never be too careful or considerate, and people can definitely be shitty and/or weird when upset, so thank you for being a wonderful human being."	pz5b30	trans	298	0.99	2021-10-01 10:37:28
Rare reddit W, posting in a non-trans subreddit about the trans experience		"[removed]
I commented in a popular hair loss subreddit, where the members often joke about taking estrogen to treat hair loss. Opinions may vary on the joking, I think it is cute, especially because my input was well received.
Any subreddit about personal style I'm in is hella friemdly with trans people.
Things have been getting a lot... safer?.... in comment sections lately. I stopped trying to 'hide' I was trans a long time ago, and I've felt a huge shift in how people vote and comment on things that give me away.

It's been hella nice.
That sub will never not surprise me with how often it violently pendulums back and forth between incel catastrophizing and sincere progressive idealism.
I did see the original post… made me laugh and I agree, I was surprised by how well it was received.
I love that sub! I think it is important to remember that not everyone is hostile and/or ignorant.

We have a lot of very real challenges out there, but there is good too.
that's a good one. trollx is good as well. twox less so. blatantmisogyny is pretty good

one of the best is witchesvspatriarchy
Yeah, the hair loss community on Reddit is nice to trans people. It's mostly cis guys, but they're curious about the effects of HRT and stuff on hair regrowth, and often joking about how the best regrowth method is to get on estrogen and become a woman.
Yes! I have noticed, too
Me too. I liked how someone posted that if the OP did do that they would get to experience the joys of gender dysphoria. Or how sometimes sacrifices have to be made for a nice full head of hair. But nothing was overly negative towards trans women.
too much woo for me, but yea i lurk there often because it's a great community to read through.
I’m glad I’m not the only queer person who’s not into woo-woo shit. My girlfriend has told me that if I ever want to date additional women, I’m probably gonna have to put up with that because a lot of lesbians are into astrology and auras and crystals and shit.
it's even worse cause imma rock-hound too. i love going crystal digging."	11demrr	trans	294	1.0	2023-02-27 15:32:17
Do you feel the same?	"I feel terrible when I don't have gender  dysphoria (ftm) and when I'm fine with my body cause maybe it means I'm a fake and everything I thought I was is a lie. 
Do you feel the same?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qy3qg9)"	"Dysphoria comes in waves, sometimes the “calm” periods are just as painful as the rough times
This post is a bit confusing to answers because the title is ""do you feel the same?"" While the description ends with ""am I the only one who feels that way?"" 

For me is Yes, I feel the same and No, you're not the only one who feels that way. I was a bit confused to which one the poll was referring
I remind myself that this is literally dysphoria about not having dysphoria, which then makes me feel better as I am therefore very trans.

I'll just add here that this is a coping mechanism and not strictly true or right.
Hot take and prolly gonna be downvoted to oblivion, but you don't need dysphoria to be trans. You know yourself better than anyone else. You're valid.
It comes sometimes but i know it isnt there because im cis. When i ever feel like that i just Tell myself that i am *deadname* and immediately i know that i am not a cis male😂😂😂
I voted yes, but I meant no. Excuse moi 😔🙏

You're not alone
This is called ""imposter syndrome"". I have it too.

But also, you don't need dysphoria to be trans. Like, ever.
Whoops, hit yes because I was answering the title.
I'm genderfluid myself. I don't feel a huge need to transition (but I'm certainly not ruling it out) so I'm not sure if it's helpful for you, but for me it's more social dysphoria. I'm not uncomfortable in my own body, but rarely connect with ""guy behaviour"" for lack of better words
I feel exaclty like you tho im mtf
When puberty first came around I felt a lot of dysphoria.
But then I guess l ""learned how to live as a guy"".
So now that I know I want to transition, I don't have much dysphoria.
If this makes any sense :)
Wait, fuck. OP. The title says “do you feel the same” but the post says “am I the only one who feels this way”. I read the title and answered yes before seeing the second question. I don’t know which one you want answers to—

I often feel that way. I think our brains try to gaslight us into believing what others tell us—that we’re wrong, disturbed, faking, etc.
If you are on HRT or will be hopefully that doesn’t cause dysphoria.
aaaa sorry! Meant to vote no
My dysphoria is honestly very minimal most of the time if it's even there to begin with. I mainly feel Euphoria when dressing rather than dysphoria when not dressing. I'm not sure where I fall exactly but you are no less valid depending on how much dysphoria you may feel at any given time.

I had a lot of doubts when I first started thinking about who I truly was and hell back then there were moments of crippling dysphoria... The moments where I was just fine felt fake. Over time I slowly stopped feeling dysphoria which seemed odd to me at first. After a while though I just started to accept that I like feeling feminine and don't dislike feeling masculine.

It's only when my facial hair starts getting out of control that I really start feeling unlike myself. A lil bit of facial hair actually gives me a bit of euphoria at times o.o. Lipstick and clean shaven also gives me euphoria though so i think its mainly tied to me taking care of myself more than anything. Validating myself despite my depression trying to hold me back.

At the end of the day I honestly don't give a damn what people think of me aside from if it affects my income, I am kinda forced to care just enough then 😂😂😂

Just be your beautiful self and things will fall into place naturally!☺☺☺
Sometimes dysphoria can be unmanageable, but other times it can be a distant ringing in the back of your head, or even not there at all! 
Every trans person has different levels of dysphoria, different ways it manifests, how often it manifests, etc

You aren’t faking being trans because you don’t feel dysphoric constantly, you don’t even need to have dysphoria to be trans as long as you have gender euphoria. Gender dysphoria is confusing and has a habit of making you doubt yourself, if your dysphoria is fluctuating a lot, here is just a reminder that you’re just as valid as any other trans person :)
hot take/PSA: you do not have to experience dysphoria in order to be trans, and rehashing discourse that happened on tumblr 7 years ago isn’t productive for our community ***at all***
Wut?  So your saying that you DON'T have any kind of dissatisfaction or unease when you are the opposite of your assigned gender?  That's a good thing though.
You don’t need to dysphoria to be trans. It does not matter if being trans is a choice or not, if it’s what makes you happy you should do it. You all need to stop looking for truscum and terf takes that will make you doubt yourselves, their opinion means nothing.
I'm sorry if people were co fused by this post... As I said in a post, I wrote it without thinking, just with my feelings so I didn't notice it was so unclear. My deepest apologizes😔
No, but it's definitely understandable that you could feel that way. Bringing up confidence in yourself will possibly help
I think the title and the end question are varying the results differently. But i said No to the last question- you're definitely not alone. I feel extremely fake sometimes like ""who am i kidding thinking i can call myself a girl- what gives me the right to say im one at all in place of an afab cis girl? I'm so fake, listen to my voice- why do i bother trying""... The list goes on.
I feel the same.
That's not a very cis worry to have, anyhow
I’ve found that when I’m feeling the most physically dysphoric is when I’m in a situation that I feel people that should aren’t seeing me as my gender, even if the “realization” of that is subconscious or irrational. Myself counts as a person perceiving me, ironically. If I don’t feel like a woman in the moment, I am very anxious and depressed. However, if I’m in boymode for a reason, any reason, it only just simmers below the surface.

I understand the sick validation we can feel from dysphoria too tho. It’s like a toxic friend that says, “You need me to prove you have a problem.” What you’re describing is the Imposter Syndrome that a lot of trans people talk about. The realization of the above helped me out of giving myself that toxic validation, which is why I led with it. I’m surprised that so many people clicked no, tbh.

Wish I could hug you and tell you everything will be alright, brother. Unless you don’t like hugs. Then I’d give you a salute or fist bump. I’m proud of you for looking for help and solidarity rather than simply retreating into yourself.

—Sophia, AKA Sketch
Even having no dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re “faking it”, let alone only having it sometimes. 

The “am I just faking it?/am I just looking for attention?” and other self-doubting thoughts are pretty common though, even when you know you’re not. Internalized transphobia sucks.
i know how hard it is your not alone 💚
i wanted to say yes
This was the reason I went back into the closet for 4 years. I thought I wasn‘t actually trans (ftm) just bc I loved wearing skirts and liked my hips.

I‘ve since come back around and realized I‘m most definitely a guy, but I still love my hips. I hate my chest and will get top surgery at some point, but I don‘t think I‘ll ever go on T and I don‘t have to. I would like a bit of a deeper voice, but more because I know people would misgender me less and not really because I truely want to
In between. I hate my hardware as fuck. I don’t look into mirror or take my own photo. I wear layered cloth in 40C to hide it. But never have crippling depression from it. And I choose my career over myself.
youre not alone, i feel the same way, im nonbinary transmasc and sometimes whenever i dont have dysphoric episodes i feel like im faking my identity despite getting super euphoric whenever i wear masculine clothing and have people use my preferred pronouns and name
I think its something like imposter syndrome. You convince yourself you don't belong, that you're not 'trans enough'. I sometimes do this for months at a time and then feel guilty about feeling guilty.
You don’t need to be upset with your body to be a valid trans person. If being a dude feels right? Heck yeah! That’s all you need, no suffering is needed, do what feels right to you
I used to feel this way before I started experiencing dysphoria. Now I’ll take any dysphoria free time I can. I think we should define ourselves by the things that bring us joy and happiness, not misery and suffering.
I’ll speak for my experience, but I doubt I’m alone. Dysphoria will wax and wane, and perhaps be none at times. However, the absence at one moment doesn’t take away from the other times you do feel it. 

The faking it feeling sucks. I would tell myself, if I was actually faking it, then I would know, not be wondering if I was. Actually, the further along I went in my transition, the less often I had those thoughts. 

Hang in there!
Tbh i have barely any dysphoria, but i know I'm valid cuz when i wear something that makes me look rly masculine, my euphoria just skyrockets
It's probably dead split because the title is ""do you feel the same?"" but the post says ""am i the only one?""
Dysphoria isnt the only indicator, if you feel happier presenting masc that’s a pretty good indicator of you being trans. Being content doesn’t make you less valid 💛
If you feel terrible when you don’t have gender dysphoria… that is gender dysphoria.
I'm sorry I'm a bit confused, are you asking if we feel the same or if you're the only one who feels this way.
I definitely used to feel this way, but as I begin to understand myself more and become more comfortable in my male identity, I don’t tend to mind as much
Sometimes, but then I think about being referred to as ""girl, girlfriend, etc...."" and my disgust usually confirms that I'm a dude for me. Still end up feeling a little awkward though
Oops, meant to vote no.

You're not alone.
actually i already felt like this, now its just physical dysphoria everytime so thats better /hj
Dysphoria isn’t a symptom of being trans. Transness comes from euphoria of being called preferred pronouns, dressing how you like, your preferred name and a plethora of other things. Dysphoria isn’t the be all end all of being trans. I’m sorry your dealing with this imposter syndrome.
To each is their own and every path is different but equally valid
i said no meaning you’re not alone. i’m non binary but presenting cis isnt an issue most of the time. but sometimes i get a glance at myself & have the horrible realization that i am real & i exist.
Society tells us we need to be so desperate for change before we are allowed to. Trans people are othered, and the only socially acceptable way to be trans is if transitioning is a life-saving step. That's the problem with truscum, transmed, whatever. It reinforces the idea that we must be tortured souls to earn the right to be happy, when really if transitioning would just make you happiER that's enough. If it's something you want for yourself, you have the right to do so. It's called autonomy.
You're definitely not the only one, I feel that too very often
I said no, which is to both questions. I don't feel that way myself, but you're not the only one who does.
A lot of people seem to think that being transgender means you must have dysphoria. Please don’t hate your body for what it is not. We have an opportunity to not only love it but cultivate it. You don’t hate a child for not being able to read right away, or talk or walk but we love it for the possibilities of what it can be. This process is journey of becoming. You get to build yourself in way most people can’t. It hard to think that way, I know! Hell I have problems but I’ve learned to fall in love with  going through puberty again. Transitioning does not have to be all dysphoria all the time or I’m a sell out. Rather you do or don’t comparing your process to someone else’s does not invalidate or invalue yours. Hey the beauty of life is that you can find whatever I say total bullshit and you’d be right too. All love to you bro!!!
Yeah, I've not started transition, but on days that I feel more doubtful about being trans I feel so bad that I might be lying to myself, people close to me, and I might regret it. 

Then other days I'm like, JUST DO IT!! 😅😁
Cis people are never afraid of not beeing trans. Have trust in yourself you know who you are.
For me the purpose of transitioning is to lessen dysphoria. The more feminine I never (mtf), the more comfortable I become and the less I feel dysphoria.
No I don’t get this. The only times I get sad and dysphoric is when I’m reminded about features I cannot change, like my height, my hips, my voice. Otherwise I just exist as I am, not even thinking about my gender or anything like that
I feel terrible when i have gender dysphoria. It's just pain.
lol yes dysphoria from not having dysphoria for like 1 second 
and it’s usually that i’m just not thinking about my appearance then? which is actually good
no, but dysphoria comes and goes for transgender people.. am not transgender.. am bisexual.. & i am so sorry if every trans person is going through this.. i hope that you all stay strong💪♥️
For me, it’s more that I get dysphoria when it comes to everything. Being too masculine? Dysphoria. Too feminine? Dysphoria. And the times that I don’t like feeling masculine, made me feel like maybe I’m just a girl, but then I realized that I just don’t really fit in with any gender, so now I identify more with being non-binary/agender. I thought I was a trans male for a while since I felt comfortable with being seen as masculine, but I realized I hate being seen as a guy. I mostly just enjoyed the fact that people weren’t seeing me as a girl.
as a MTF I have weak dysphoria, but it certainly does exist still. however to me, gender's nothing but a concept and I am still a long way to managing my appearance as a woman. I've seen many cis woman break traditional appearances such as growing more facial hair and stuff, so they know it's a concept, it doesn't have to be followed. in the end, you're still the gender you identify with because you believe in what and who you are. it all dives down to how you express yourself. dysphoria doesn't govern your appearance, but I can understand how it could leave an impact.
I had to come to terms with this feeling myself as mtf. I look at myself and think things are cool and I’m actually really attractive and I could live like this but then it creeps in and I realize what I’m missing. I only feel like I can accept it because I’ve lived and accepted it for years upon years. You revert back to a sort of comfort because this is who you were identifying as or in some cases forced to identify as. Just because you don’t have dysphoria all the time doesn’t mean you’re faking it, what matters is that you have euphoria when identifying as a man and that this is who you want to be above all else
I answered no because I do get dysphoria for a lot of things,  but that in no way invalidates you. Everyone has different tolerances, perceptions, interpretations, and pathways to discovering that they are trans. What may be dysphoria to me may be a simple lack of euphoria to others. Nobody can judge anothers sense of self.
I said no. 

But my dysphoria is so repressed that it's almost like a constant low level of depression and anxiety.  (Its my euphoria that I rely upon).

But I still sometimes feel imposter syndrome.
All the freaking time, one second I’m super sad bc I look bad, the next I look at the mirror and am like “huh, this is kind of ok, maybe it’s all bs” then I remember I already started hrt and even though it’s “ok” it will be much better in the future.
Maybe you are just gender fluid and not trans and maybe that's ok.
I present very androgynous so I’ve never felt dysphoric and it makes me feel like an imposter or like I don’t have a right to compare myself to other trans people
Being trans is about your experience with GENDER not your body. Being dysphoric and unsatisfied with your body can of course be part of that experience, but what really matters is how you view, evalluate, change, and settle into your gender identity. Your presentation and body do not have to match the gender norm. What would be the point of being a community and challenging the concept of gender if we forced ourselves to uphold the norms and status quo of sex = gender. It's what we've been trying to get cis people to understand for ages. 

You shouldn't have to look the way people expect a cis man to look just to appeal to norms to be considered ""valid"" or ""real"". You're trans if you feel your gender is not what you were assigned. It's as simple as that.
I'm happy to see that even after me being 7 months into hormones, I guess it's normal to feel this
Which is why I hate transmedicalism. It harms more trans people than it helps because even though the goal is to eliminate dysphoria, I guilty without it.
personally I can kind of relate, but never to the point where I don’t have dysphoria at all. some days are worse, but not having it at all would be an absolute dream
Feeling that way is its own kind of dysphoria.
I used to feel that way, I remember talking about it to my therapist. In the end you need to understand that when you are not feeling dysphoria for not feeling like girl is because you are just being one
Dysphoria cames and goes. And you can feel gender or social dysphoria. Don't worry when you don't feel it, it's something normal, I feel the same :)
I don't get much dysphoria, but I also haven't come out to myself as trans for very long, so maybe it's just yet to come.
>sometimes the “calm” periods are just as painful as the rough times

Oh... So true
it's the eye of the storm.

and like the eye of a storm, it's equally as terrifying when you look at what's surrounding you and how eventually it's all going to come back.
Damn, that hit deep.
Yeah sorry I realize now. I just wrote this post without thinking about the sens but more about my feelings... So sorry for the confusion
same here!! i didn’t read the post fully and voted before understanding the last sentence, sorry op
When something that's been with you for so long, it can feel really concerning when it's not there. Like a comfort blanket that's suddenly taken away.

I get the same feeling when I feel less depressed. Like, things shouldn't be going this well! My situation's the same, yet I feel... Okay? This isn't right! Give me back my depression!!!
Needing dysphoria to be trans is a transmedicalist take and it's very gatekeepy and exclusionist
Why would this get downvoted?
Je t'en prie. It's my fault my post is a bit confused
Imposter syndrome suckkkks. But yeah, I just focus on my euphoria and know that when I do gender affirming things and get those butterflies and calmness that it’s way better than dysphoria and it helps me feel valid that I’m trans.
That is the most accurate metaphor I have ever heard
That makes a lot of sense. It's kinda the same feeling for me when my depression subsides: I know it's going to come back, because I know my problems haven't been fixed.

It's the eye of the storm. I like it!
No worries with me, just warning you that the poll results may not be accurate for what you seek.

But as long as one person answers that they feel the same you will never be alone in feeling like this. Stay strong
i feel the same way, so you are not alone
This is me too.  You're not alone.  FWIW, you could redo your poll to get more accurate results.
No-no! It's my fault
Believe me, I get it.

I'm just the sort that tries to be positive and offer solutions.
Because some people are so despaired for validation. they take all the dysphoria they can get because even when it hurt a lot, it defends them from de pain they think they will feel if the were to find out that it was all fake.

Those people would downvote
Every morning I admire how great my hair looks and do finger guns in the mirror. 

👈👈😎
Thank you so much
Oh, I get you. That makes more sense now that you say that.

I didn't mean to try to contradict you, I was trying to add to the discussion. It does help to think positive!
I think unfortunately that I belong to these category but I wouldn't downvote a comment wrote to support me
Lol too cute! That’s great. Luckily, I was blessed with pretty thick hair and I’m growing it out too. Going to focus on positive aspects like that to try to override negative feelings of my boxy shoulders and barrel chest. Starting to lift a lot of legs too to take attention away. Sometimes you have to focus on what you CAN control.

Dysphoria got me feeling like crap, do I look like a guy with my long hair?( I can’t cut it) (he/him)		"Hell yeah. Ive had long hair i wore in a ponytail most of my masc life. Dudes rock it all the time
without being able to see your face, you look like peeta in the hunger games movies
You look like some of the dudes that work in the construction site my brother works in. Amazing!
The coolest guys have long hair. Everybody seeing this pic would have instantly thought “ah a guy”. You have nothing to worry about. You got it.
From what I can see, yeh.

I part my hair starting from the temples & around the back of my head and tie it up. It exposes my temples more and makes me look (or at the very least, feel) masc. Also, I have this exact jacket in green
You definitely look like a dude lol
This maybe off a tangent. If you are under 18, look up mewing. It can made your face more angular without hrt, it widens the face talk to your orthodontist about it too. It is a relatively new thing. 

Never did it but had a palette expander and my face is now wider and a sharp jawline smh. Im mtf all my dental was done prior to transitioning.
Cant really see your face but if I saw you at an angle where you looked exactly like that then you just look like a younger guy to me.
Cant see your face, so i cant really tell tbh
But your pose, your vibe etc looks pretty manly to me
I can’t tell without seeing your face. 
Without seeing your face yes. But you’re wearing masc presenting clothes and without a face and just a side view it’s hard to discern whether or not the entirety of you looks masc.
""can I look masculine with long hair"" 

Dear sir, have you not seen Jason Momoa

Also, nice drip
Well.... Hopefully this helps..... I'm obviously MTF, but.... I am also obviously still seen as a man, and have had long hair and double earlobe piercings(since 2014) for a few years now like this. Can check my profile picture. Not one word has ever been said to me in those years about any of it. You just have to finally say this is what ""I"" want to look like, and not care what anyone else says. It's such a waste of life to not live free. I have done this for years, and it just eats you alive eventually. So be a man with long hair, or a woman with short hair(also this is for anyone). You will do just fine with whatever you have going on in your life. Please take care, and don't stress 🙂 I really hope that this helps you out.
[deleted]
Honestly I kind of thought you were mtf maybe only a few months into hrt until I read the post.
Yes, absolutely
awesome. you kinda look like the type of guy I'd see working in a forest with his hair up in a ponytail. it's a very attractive look on you
Yes you do.
The way you styled it makes it look masculine

Masculine forehead, that's for sure
I think it looks dope

Have you considered a mullet? Maybe what you have could be considered one, but is making the sides shorter a possibility? It can really help with the dysphoria while also rocking long hair. I had a mullet for about a year and miss it a lot. Everyone told me it was hot, also I would wear a cammo jacket (similar to your style here) and pass very easily. people see the cammo + mullet and are like, wanna talk about cars? will you come lift this for me? lol
I’d say so. That jacket‘s doing a lot for your dad vibes in my opinion
It’s hella masc, dude. Man buns are the best, I have to say. I do my hair that way too.
Truth is lots of guys have lots of hair.
For heck yes you do...
Lookin' good bro
You def look like a guy. A cute one! ❤️
With your face covered you kind of look like Kit Connor! /pos
If you can, get an undercut, that wil really help. If not, you can put it in a low (man)bun with pieces hanging out. And btw, the way you weart it now, slicked back like that is also fine.
What’s up, Evan Winters?!
There's hairstyles you can do (without cutting it) to make yourself look more masculine. When I had long, I was able to find ways to make myself look masculine without cutting it. Mainly because I wanted to look like Keanu Reeves lmao
yee you do \^\^
honestly yeah it’s pretty masc
I thought this was someone amab. Your hair, even though it’s long, is styled much like my masculine long hair was styled.
I want you to know I am being totally serious when I say I thought you were an amab guy until I read the title. Ur killing it bro, looking great!
personally, without seeing ur face I can say it's really androgynous.
Idk sometimes it just don’t look masc on me. It’s like my face shape or my height. But thanks!
Peta, the horse is here
Ong I love you lol
The reason I only gave side view is bc I know my face looks feminine and so when I go out I usually have something to cover it up, like a mask and my glasses
I’ll definitely try that. And yess dickies jacket for the win! It’s so comfortable
Lmao that’s smart about the camp. I might be able to but idk my mom won’t even allow me to get it trimmed lmao
It doesn't have to... Are you going to take T? It'll masculine that hair right up for you no matter the length😁 also sorry, I'm not saying it isn't masc, I'm just saying
5’4” (23) over here, rocked hair past my shoulders for half of college. I surprised myself with it because it was never something I thought I’d go back to when I first cut my hair off as a teenager. The slicked back look is great for this length, it’s a classic look. Classic looks always help for passing because there’s an immediate association that people see to masculinity and when the goal is to pass, this always helps. Keep your head up, it’s rough to be at a point in your life where you don’t have the control to move forward in your life/transition in the ways you want but you will get there.
The horse is waiting Peta
lmao you actually do though, especially when they're in the capitol and he has his hair combed back. he's pretty hot imo lmao
Ah okay, well that was purely a suggestion bc i love mullets. it looks great as is, very masc
Yeah I am planning on taking T soon
Lmao fr
Well, I'm glad to hear that you sound like you know what to do. Just don't worry about your hair too much please🙂 take good care 😁
you just admitted you're hot lmao
I just did lmao this is some reverse psychology bs lmao☠️

Dysphoria is. ....	Shaving three times a day...ugh	"And having to take pauses because of wounds from shaving irritated skin. Hate it
These damn tiddies
... Every time that i open my mouth and talk...
I hate my voice!!! (But i am working hard on it).
Dysphoria is...   ...so annoying
I feel lucky that I’m not a hairy person. I only have to shave my face with a small electric razor once every three days, and my legs only once every 2 weeks. And the hair that grows is thin and light. I’m so sorry others have such a hard time dealing with hair. It sucks
dysphoria is stinky
SO THATS HOW YOU DO IT?! (Multiple times per day?)
I thought I was just awful at shaving!

Laser hair removal asap, screw this!
Dysphoria for me is....
Sitting down in the shower with my arms around my legs.
Not doing exercise because of how much i hate my body.
Looking in the mirror with slightly long hair and wanting to kys.
Wearing hoodies 24/7 because I dont feel comfortable without one.
Walking slouched over and being in constant pain.
Never feeling happy because of my birth gender.
Trying to avoid showering and getting in trouble for not having one.
My voice and feeling like no matter how much voice training I do it won’t be enough so why bother at all?
Oh god that reminds me. I’m a trans man and I’m gonna start T soon and I really want facial hair and my family keeps saying “you know, you’d look really weird with facial hair. When you start testosterone you better shave twice a day so we don’t have to see that” and now I’m worried about it. I really want it but I don’t want criticism from my family
Try to avoid all the mirrors in a day to avoid ruining it... To avoid seeing my flat chest, my messy hair, my face, my masculine shapes and these unkillable facial hair I try to remove every darn day
I have dysphoria but at the same time I’m terrified to take any gender confirming treatments like the thing that makes your voice deeper. So that’s fun…
I still have a patch of chest hair and my forearms that really make me feel bad.
LHR is probably cheaper than you think. If you shop around, you can literally save thousands. 

I paid $200 (plus tips) for 8 face treatments. 

Start now. It takes forever to see the results. But, I’m really happy with the results so far.
Why is laser so expensive and like you have to go out into public to get it.
Looking in the mirror and seeing a face that disgusts you
Like a lot of you, shaving does it for me.
we can trade faces
mind numbing
A nightmare that is turning into my dreams coming true after starting HRT in June. I went 35 years hiding my feelings not telling anyone I wished I could wake up a girl so yeah it feels like a nightmare at puberty I would use toys and pretend it's the other part lol. Puberty was not fun I hated my body super jealous of girls never really had a relationship over a month or so trying to fit in. I neglected my own life skipped school I did pass high school never tried college
Body hair is the worst.
Dysphoria is pure hell.
This is literally the only thing that gives me dysphoria. It is a literal nightmare since my body hair grows so fast especially on my face to the point I have to shave it so much. And, I am not even good at it so I can never get everything no matter how hard I try. It is absolutely frustrating to the point it makes me want to cry.

In fact it got to the point where I don't use razors anymore because it just hurts my skin on my face since I have to shave so often. Now I just use um some hair removal veet stuff. Its like just put on and wipe off and the hair just comes off. Its not perfect but it beats using a razor and achieves the same result for me.

But again its not perfect so it still bugs the ever livng heck outta me.
I'll never get a father daughter dance at my wedding.
Getting horrific dysphoria from shaving but then getting horrific dysphoria from having any facial hair on me

It’s a catch 22 situation of shaving dysphoria 😾
Dreading he/him
Dysphoria is a bitch.
Ripping all my facial hair out by the roots using an epilator and tweezers.
And then finding out you missed one spot
not being able to tell if I hate my birth gender, the concept of gender overall, or I just get annoyed that I’m not allowed to be the kind of amazing person I should be. Passionate and incisive and the smartest one in the room. That no one would bat an eye about if they saw me as a man.
reminds me of [misery was](https://youtu.be/n__42UNIhvU) 
,i hope to once read, dysphoria was
I stopped shaving in the morning and now do it in the evening when I can be myself - have only come out to my wife so far. But I'm with you there: for quite a while I shaved up to three times a day as well. But even then my beard shadow always shows. My facial hair has become the number one source for my dysphoria. Plus the fact that I'm bald and have a huge head with a round face and any wig I've tried so far makes me look like a male carnival clown :-(
I guess dysphoria for me is saying something, then immediately realising I have this horribly deep voice and keeping quiet for half an hour while crying on the inside
Isnt it possible to use a laser hair removals that kills the hair bulbs?
I always try to make myself look either androgynous or feminine, so I know the pain...
3 times a day?

Im closeted transfem and I shave full body 1-2 times a week
dysphoria is.. not being able to come out of the closet for 6 years because of your height.
Dysphoria for me is being misgendered/deadnamed on purpose
Plucking your facial hair, just to have it regrow in 2-3 days
Homophobic
Sometimes, it's not even enough :(

(my electric razor prevents me from shaving deeper)
When my face begins getting raw from shaving I use  ""Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence"" from Corsx. It's so good I keep it around in case of emergencies. It even helps me if I have a reaction to cosmetics I am testing out.
This. Part of the reason I think I’m gonna start LHR as soon as I can.
I have such bad razor burn that I’ve been waiting a week to let my skin heal so I can use nair. Razors hurts and itch so bad and so far I’m not allergic on the test patch I did on my arm
I have such bad razor burn that I’ve been waiting a week to let my skin heal so I can use nair. Razors hurts and itch so bad and so far I’m not allergic on the test patch I did on my arm
My alternative is not look in the mirror and ignore my pain
Exactly like why are they so big
Mood
Right, even when I bind you can still tell something is there 🥲
Same girl! I gotta work hard to make my voice pass, then i’ll probably feel safe to actually change my clothing style and stuff
I agree with you there sister, even with a lot of practice it's too easy to default back to your other voice you were trying to leave behind.
Fuck… you just described my entire high school experience…

Probably should’ve been able to figure this out before this year…
That's what my issue is ;-; 

I'm fine with everything else about me, so far anyway. I just don't like my voice, I don't think I can physically reach a point where my voice could be like a woman's ;-;
I'm sure you are going to look great with facial hair :) and if your family is not able to see that they will have to get used to it. Pls don't let them worry you that much
Ugh why would anyone say that to you… I mean it’s cool that they haven’t just thrown you to the wolves but like, why be shitty about T?
I'm absolutely certain you'll look great with it. If you wanna keep it then you keep it, its your face not theirs and its a damn work of art - not all art is for everyone but that doesn't mean it doesn't look good, uou should make it for your own reasons. Grow that beard

Sorry for that :( ❤️ but you’re soo pretty!!
Right??
mine are small compared to my friends but its honestly just the fact that their *on* me
I'm still in high school. Dysphoria sucks
Yeah they’re being shitty about it. Hell, it took me half a year to get them to understand that I’m serious about this and even then they’re making me earn it. I have to make sure all of my grades are at least a B and that my room is clean. Why tf do I have to earn medication that two medical professionals have specifically said that I need?
Everyone that uses it warns other people against using it but they still continue to use it so I feel like I should say not to use it
Makeup is a hell of a drug
Wishing for the days I was still an A 😢
Why couldn't I get tiny tibbies?? Tf did I do to end up with almost double ds at 15😭 like which God did I piss off in a past life?
I luckily have small ish one but I look at one of my friends and wtf how can she deal with that
That to! Like even when they were small, it just felt wrong that they existed on me. It's another inconvenience that they're huge
Because we still live in a backwards century where neither trans rights nor minors’ rights are afforded the gravitas they deserve.
Appreciated, I‘ll tell you not to use it once I have used it

A metaphor for what being trans feels like pre transition for cis people.	"Think of a small annoyance that you encounter in your every day life, a snoring spouse/roomate who keeps you up at night, a broken air conditioner, noisy neighbors who keep you up till 3am, a beeping fire alarm whose batteries are low, a broken garage door you have to manually raise and lower each morning, annoyances that are tolerable in isolation, but become intolerable when you encounter them every day, making each passing day just a bit worse than it could have been if that problem weren't  present in your life.

Now imagine you had to deal with any of those annoyance constantly, at nearly all times of your everyday life, thats what being in the wrong body feels like.  You can try and ""live with it"" just like you can try and live with any of those annoyances, but each day you do, your day will be worse than it could have been if things werent that way. 

Being in the wrong body is tolerable in isolation, I don't think I've ever cried about being in the wrong body, asides from maybe the night I cracked (though that could have to do with my dysphoria making my emotions numb) But when you have to deal with it every single day, it drains you. Each passing day just is missing something, its like eating food thats always slightly overcooked for the rest of your life, rather than just eating food thats properly cooked and you enjoy. Thats what it feels like.

Thats why we transition, because we want to fix this underlying issue in our lives,"	"I always say “imagine being in a costume that you can’t take off and nobody believes your wearing”
I like to think of it like a pebble in your shoe. Sometimes that pebble is barely noticeable, and you can walk just fine. Others it's big enough to effect you with every step. Sometimes it's big enough that you can't even stand up, much less walk. That pebble is dysphoria. Other people don't have that pebble in their shoes, and they can't see it when you try to point it out. They just wonder why you walk funny, or why you think walking is a struggle. Doing your best to walk normally with the pebble is like staying closeted, silent pain with every step. Limping with the pebble is like coming out, and acknowledging that you have that pebble that makes you walk different than those without it. Transitioning (in whatever way works for you) is removing that pebble piece by piece. It takes time, but that pebble is eventually so small that there are days you even forget it was there in the first place.
it's like having a gangrenous toe. you want the toe gone because the toe is harming you. you'd rather have 10 perfectly healthy toes, for sure, but you can't magically cure gangrene, so you have the choice of having 10 toes like everyone expects, and hurting every day, or getting it amputated and healing from the pain

as a cis ally, I'm trying to learn whatever i can about you amazing people, so thank you for educating me.
I always say ""imagine being a different gender, but everyone constantly deadnames and misgenders you.""
That's a pretty personal belief about being okay in the wrong body I'd rather be dead personally even if I was the only human left
For me its a very physical feeling. I get a flash of ""somebody"" in my mind, followed by a terrible feeling like I'm in two bodies physically stuck inside eachother and being ripped apart from the inside, and twitching all up my arms. Then i have a very physical feeling of a hole in the middle of my chest that needs filling. It fades, but it comes back just as sudden and just a little bit worse each time.
imagine being in a restaraunt and mildly dehydrated. you ask for a glass of water. you and your friend are served two identical-looking glasses, but when you taste yours, you notice it tastes excessively salty. you watch as your friend softly gulps the drink down, silently baffled as to how they managed to drink such an unappetizing drink.

you take sips and sips of it, feeling nauseous, but feeling as though there's something wrong with you. you take a look around. everyone seems to enjoy their drink. but you don't.

the more you drink, the more dehydrated you feel. the more parched and the more foggy your brain becomes. you start to slowly feel your mind occupy with how thirsty you feel. but no matter what you do, no matter how much glasses you drink, you just feel worse and worse.

you try and think of an escape. but there isn't one. dinner isn't over yet. you have to wait until you finally get the chance to leave the restaraunt with your friend in order to get some actual water. you start feeling as though you can't make it. all you can think about is just how much peaceful it will be to just...leave...and finally feel yourself freed of this pain.

you feel like a freak. because nobody will take you seriously. ""it's just dehydration"". ""people have it worse"". ""stop being a baby and suck it up"". people will call you all sorts of nasty things. the restaraunt where you were sold the fact that it would be a great experience has turned into nothing short of a scam. you feel as though it's a curse. the curse to enter the restaraunt. the curse to be there, choking on your dry throat, with the dehydrated cells feeling as though they were grits of sandpaper rubbing against eachother.

you just wanted it to end. that's all your visit has become now. you, staring at the clock, sobbing at the fact that you have so much time here still. you feel jealous of those checking out. you feel so jealous of those who had a good experience that you never got to have.

transitioning is like going up to the waiter and finally figuring out what went wrong. it's finding out what water *actually* tastes like. it's figuring out why everyone handled the disgusting concoction you shoved down your mouth for so long. it's learning that your stay at a restaraunt really can be great.

it's people yelling at you and screaming about how you don't deserve to complain and how it's their business. it's people telling you that you get what you get and there's no changing that. it's people deliberately trying to add salt to your drink, purely out of spite, because they couldn't dare imagine you finally enjoying your stay there. sometimes; they might even add the salt because of jealousy, and because they aren't able to remove the salt dissolved in their own glass.

it's watching as people try to make sure children with excessively-salted glasses of water never get the issue fixed, because doing so would be child abuse and endangering them. sometimes even politicians. letting them suffer and rot in the agony you lived with all that time.

it's the years of the experience that got lost simply because you didn't know what went wrong, or because you were too scared to get a waiter to assist you.

it's the fact that, no matter what, you got the relief of a good, cold, glass of water. the relief that got magnified 100x because of how long you suffered without it. the closure that, finally, even though you got fucked over by the kitchen, you were still able to make your experience enjoyable on your own terms.
God this is so true! I am weeping because I hate my chest SO MUCH I am years from affording top surgery.
See this is throwing me for a loop... like half of the trans community says you don't need dysphoria to be trans and that that's not the sole indicator but then I see stuff like this which makes sense but I can't relate to fully. What's yall's take on that?
Oh my god, this. Some days I just feel like I'm suffocating inside my own skin, and I want to claw my skin off, to get out of the ""costume"".
I always compare it to laying on the floor, cause it starts out fine but the longer you stay on the floor the more uncomfortable it gets, until you want to get up and walk to the bed but everybody looks and says ""look you're perfectly fine there on the floor""
The big difference is that anorexia is extremely obvious to people, on the other being trans is often impossible to tell for you or anyone else. In this way I think is very understandable people sucide when faced with it, life stops having any colour and you don't even know why
Heya CIS straight woman here, and firstly let me say I have no true understanding of what it must be like to be trans but I absolutely know that it's real and has been apart of humanity since our conception. But I disagree with that analysis, it strikes me that obesity and anorexia are mental health issues that can overtime be treated and normalcy restored to an extent. I don't believe that being trans is a mental illness, it is a state of being no different than being CIS, (Of course cis people don't have to go through trauma of trying to be validated and we don't have to explain who we are to society). I think the costume explanation is pretty good.. I also think it sucks that the trans community still has to spend so much of their energy educating us. With love and good will
They are *not* analogous. Body dysmorphia arises from a distorted self image;  gender dysphoria arises from the incongruity between one's gender identity and (accurate)  body image. The two are *not* treated the same clinically (gender dysphoria responds well to affirmation,  body dysmorphia does not).

Making this comparison leads cis people to think that conversion therapy is an appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria, which *it is not*.
Oh I mean like a day in the wrong body is tolerable on its own in isolation. I think if most people here were offered $10,000 to go back to their old body for a single day, and be returned to their current body the following day, they'd take it unless it would be mentally damaging. I mean I think most trans people are able to keep going because of the promise of transitioning, that some day they will receive a fix. if there was no end goal there would be no point since the torture would never end.
Best way I've heard it explained is that gender dysphoria isn't necessarily body dysphoria. You know you have gender dysphoria if, basically, you want to push the button the imaginary genie offers you to magically change your biology to match your mind, even if it means everyone remembers you as always having had that biology. Cis people wouldn't push that button.
Mmhmm, and I imagine most cis people can imagine that too
I would like to add as a trans person with an eating disorder, anorexia and eating disorders are NOT “extremely obvious” to people. Even really seemingly obvious behaviors can go on for months without people noticing, and on top of that, MANY people struggle with disordered eating without visibly losing weight or becoming noticeably sick because of it
[removed]
Ah yeah I did misunderstand what you meant. Apologies. Didn't mean to be so dramatic and dismissive
I would smash that thing with a hammer if it meant I woke up with my ideal androgynous hottie body with luscious long hair
>Please be careful about spreading misinformation.

Rich, when you called (or at least heavily suggested) gender dysphoria a form of body dysmorphia. They are not. They are classified differently in the DSM. We *know* that conversion therapy - which is the logical outcome of treating gender dysphoria like body dysmorphia - *does not work*.

>Actually, there is very limited evidence about the efficacy of affirmation, especially long-term. I recall seeing one long-term study that showed that there was a short-term improvement that reverted to the baseline after a few years. 

It is true that there is still relatively little research in the area. At the same time, GAT *is* the only scientifically supported clinical treatment - which is why it is almost universally practiced. *I* have seen studies suggest it is beneficial long term -- but more important than your or my opinion on the scientific literature, health care providers and standards setting bodies agree it is the best available approach, differing from the approach one would use for dysmorphia.

> I've also seen a few retractions of studies claiming that affirmation was beneficial.

And? A study whose broad conclusions are true can still be retracted for any number of reasons. Are you going to claim that *all*, or the greater share,  of such studies are significantly flawed and deserving retraction,  and the the field of medicine / psychology is mistaken about the nature of gender dysphoria?

Please be careful about spreading misinformation.
Oh hell yes. I'd crush that magic button with all the force in my being. Too bad I haven't found the gender genie :(
[removed]
I note that you have not tried to disagree that gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia are different.

\> This is a false dichotomy.

I admit that, on reflection,  it is not logically necessary that, under the assumption that GD is a form of BD, GD should be treated in the same way that other forms of BD are (so ""logical outcome"" is a misstatement). However, it *is* what most people would take away --- and that \*would\* be a form of conversion therapy.

If there is some ""third way"" of treatment between affirming someone's expressed gender identity and denying, that the medical community is considering, I would like to hear it.

>That's not true. A growing number of medical organizations are recommending against that. (I don't remember the specifics of their recommendations or which organizations so I won't try to remember them here.)

I am going to need a source for this. But if it is only small minority, then the only modification needed to my statement is say that this is the current consensus (not ""universal"").

>The retractions that I saw said that the \*conclusions\* were wrong.

When I said ""broad conclusions"", I meant things along the lines of ""GAT generally improves the wellbeing of trans folk"". The criticism you cited says that the conclusion the authors drew (which affirms that general claim for the particular population that was studied) was not warranted from the data they analyzed. There is a difference, e.g., one of the main points of criticism in the summary you linked says that the *methodology* was flawed:

>*Given that the study used neither a prospective cohort design nor a randomized controlled trial design*, the results demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related health care visits or prescriptions or hospitalizations following suicide attempts in that comparison

Of course, if in a large body of research the only studies that show long term benefit are flawed, that suggests there is no benefit. But, as you say, there is still little long term data, so one inconclusive study isn't particularly persuasive when we at least have a better understanding of short-term outcomes that affirms the current model of understanding and treating gender dysphoria.
[removed]
Thank you, I will review these shortly. In the meantime, I will ask you again concerning your claim that there is a trend in medical organizations recommending against gender-affirming care -- I could not find anything to substantiate that.

Should someone with depression be able to have access to gender affirming care?	Say you're diagnosed with depression and gender dysphoria. After 6 months of thearpy and anti-depressants with meaningful progress would that person, providing a stable mindset /lifestyle, should be able to at least get a gender therapist?	"Yes, of course!
Of course. I’ve been seeing my therapist for over a year and she specifically noted my depression in my letter recommending top surgery. Depression is not a barrier to care; in fact, it might be all the more reason for it because dysphoria at best doesn’t help and at worst makes it worse.
Erm, yes, cuz it’s may be a good foundation to threat those things too
gender dysphoria can be a major cause of depression, so yes absolutely let them have necessary care
Oh girl don’t even worry about that part. I’m diagnosed with *big breath*
OCD/OCPD (symptoms of both), PTSD, anxiety, depression, dysphoria, and ADHD (I might be forgetting a few)
This is kinda fucked up but I feel like most mental health issues make it more likely for you to be able to access treatment. I mean they don’t want you to hurt yourself so they want to prevent that with treatment.
Yes! Often the depression can be linked or made worse because of dysphoria. It won't solve all your problems, but it can make a very persistent one go away so you can deal with the rest
Yes, I've had anxiety, panic attacks and very close to depression. HRT has resolved this, but it has taken some time. Now I'm almost year on HRT and all these gone. Big improvement is also visible how I'm able now to handle stressful situations, it's like nothing usually I can cope with issues without much effort. Before HRT everything was stressful even normal basic stuff.
Context for answer: academic training on/in psychiatry, esp. depression, though no clinical training. Trans, formerly(?) depressed, experience with interacting with both mental health and gender identity services.

Gender transition services and psychiatrists typically prefer that people come to them primarily about gender dysphoria, and not for or with peripheral or unrelated mental ill-health issues. Assessment and treatment of dysphoria may be significantly hindered if a patient also has, for example, untreated or undiagnosed psychotic episodes.

However, if other mental ill-health issues are being (sufficiently/successfully) treated and monitored, then in theory it shouldn't be an issue, although this is for the clinician to decide.

As others have mentioned, depression is hard to disentangle from dysphoria because the symptom pools and diagnostic criteria definitely overlap, and because a causative relationship is highly likely. Comorbidity is to be expected when one (dysphoria/gender incongruence) is very likely to directly cause the other (depression). That said, it is still better to attempt to address the depression first. Of course, doing so may well highlight dysphoria as a causative factor!

I don't think practicing gender clinicians can realistically expect a dysphoric trans person to be WHOLLY non-depressed if they are seeking treatment. But, nonetheless, gender identity clinics will advise treatment, stabilisation, or management of depression prior to seeking gender identity clinic services, largely just to eliminate the possibility of complications and make the treatment pathway easier.

Unfortunately, the advice typically given by other trans folks in this scenario is generally to downplay or not mention depression when first being consulted. More specifically, many advise not to mention intense, pervasive, or - most importantly - current or active suicidality, as this will often be a blocker to care. Suicidal ideation poses a potential immediate threat to life, meaning that (often, though not always, depends on context) it must be addressed and prioritised if mentioned to a clinician prior to seeking treatment for other issues.

Please note: I DO NOT SUGGEST LYING TO YOUR CLINICIANS THAT YOU'RE NOT SUICIDAL IN ORDER TO ATTAIN A DIAGNOSIS: If you ARE actively suicidal, that NEEDS to be addressed first. Rather, it should be emphasised that -unintentionally overstating depressive symptoms MAY negatively impact prospects for gender care if your treating clinician is particularly cautious-.

tl;dr - historic, managed, or treated depression without pervasive suicidality? Probably fine. Untreated depression or active suicidality? They will probably advise getting other help first before discussing gender dysphoria treatment options. And that's pretty understandable, really.

Disclaimers: I'm not a doctor, your mileage may vary, these things differ location to location, doctor to doctor, etc.
I see a lot of comments that gender dysphoria can cause the depression,  and this is absolutely true. What isn't mentioned is that the reverse can be true as well, that ones depression can be expressing itself as gender dysporia. The trick is trying to figure out which caused which or if they are even related. Gender affirming care should certainly be provided while trying to alleviate the depression. I would suggest staying away from surgical routes until it can be determined with some confidence that the dysphoria is the cause of the depression or is separate from the depression.
Yes!!!! I was in a downward spiral with my depression over the final few years before I cracked. Just the simple reveal of figuring out I was trans brought enough relief that I was able to start processing emotions again, and that alleviated a significant burden of my depression. I was able to ride that wave of relief for a few months until I was able to start on HRT. My journey since then has been about digging through and discovering some of the baggage I had been carrying for years, recognizing how it all fit together, and slowly coming to a point where not only did I accept myself for being trans, I was also able to stop actively trying to defeat myself through relentless self-doubt.

I was able to switch from “Am I trans enough?” to simply, “I’m trans, and that’s enough.” That’s enough for me to embrace all of the positive lift which has come from finally running on the right hormones. My god, the sky has never been so blue. :)
Have you ever considered going the DIY route?
No
as the other comments noted yes you should be able to. you mentioned that you have already ben diagnosed with gender dysphoria, by your current therapist?? Have you talked with the therapist about a gender therapist?? You have made meaningful progress, therapy is about talking maybe talking to them about what you feel are some issues and what they can assist with
Absolutely. Full stop.
Yes.  lots of transfolk, especially people who have not started transition, experience depression.  If depression excluded us from treatment a lot of us would be excluded. ^^;
While I think it should be, I get that if someone is severely depressed, maybe gender affirming surgery in particular should be held off on. Just because of after care and how important it is, so if you’re severely depressed to the point where it’s impending your every day life, you won’t be able to properly care for yourself after surgery. Post op depression is a real thing that isn’t talked about really. Your mind literally need time to adjust too. So if you go in in a bad headspace, that’s not a good start.
Gender dysphoria literally was the cause of my depression
I've been on therapy almost all my life for depression, it was my therapist for the last 4 years who suggested hrt exactly beacuse the depression and for me it did wonders, I no longer Say I have depression beacuse ir doesn't feels that way anymore (still have those random sadness Moments)
Let me get this straight: you are asking if someone with depression, which is a very common symptom of gender dysphoria, should be able to access care that treats their gender dysphoria?
I have depression, anxiety, ADD and PTSD and not only was I able to get HRT, but it actually alleviated most of the symptoms. I'd already been on medication prior that I no longer need 8 months on T. Unless you're so unstable that you literally can't make your own decisions you should be fine!
Absolutely
Absolutely.  For me, it was affirming care like HRT which made the biggest improvement to my mental health.  Saying you need to have depression fixed first is like saying that you need to be fit and healthy before seeing the doctor.
I had severe depression constantly for 15 years prior to transitioning.  It was caused by the untreated gender dysphoria.  It did not stop me from getting into HRT.
Yes, often it's the only effective way to treat depression for transgender people
100% yes. I had depression pre-transition but that didn’t disqualify me from seeing a gender therapist, it’s probably encouraged
Yes, in fact gender affirming care often helps people with their depression.
Sometimes depression can be caused by dysphoria. Gender affirming care might not “cure” the depression, but it might help a little. Therefore, yes I think it should
Yes. Gender-affirming care also tends to help with depression, in my experience
Yes
Gender affirming care  cured my life long depression in 3 months. Whenever I'm off my HRT meds I get debilitatingly depressed again. Cant get out of bed or eat properly. Back on the HRT I feel great. This isn't true for everyone but is true for A LOT OF PEOPLE
you mean there's some who don't have depression? Impossible. perhaps the archives are incomplete.
Absolutely. Almost certainly an element of cause & effect.
Lol. I was full on depressed, diagnosed, and started HRT before I got my antidepressants. Guess what though, once I started the depression was almost entirely gone as well, and only shows up in a lesser form on bad days.


No matter your circumstances, people should be able to receive the care they need.
I have depression, anxiety and dysphoria. I have been on HRT for over a year with no issues. So yes!
It sounds like those things might be related. I'm no therapist, but I get the feeling that you can't treat the depression without treating the gender dysphoria.
Absolutely. HRT is the thing that saved me from depression, as well as halted my disassociative episodes.
Often, the root cause of various mental illness for a lot of us is going without treatment for gender dysphoria. It fucks up your brain in all kinds of ways
Of course! Gender dysphoria was / is still a big source of depression for my gf, not being able to take it made her depression MUCH worse. It'd be like a parent taking away someone's electronics to improve their grades: it's just going go make things worse not being able to transition.
I had/have major depression and when I went to a therapist who said “let’s focus on the depression before the gender stuff” I left her and went to someone who realized the two were connected (at least somewhat) and needed to both be worked on in tandem.
i mean, depression can be a biproduct of your gender dysphoria, so yes
Yes.
Yes, ofc

In my own experience, I was told to try to treat my depression first, got on antidepressants for a year and a half and I still felt really bad.

Finally managed to start hrt 4 months ago, I haven't needed to take my antidepressants since and my depressive episodes (they still come and go) usually end up as just low moods rather than the despair I used to feel before.
TLDR: Babe/dude, yes someone with depression should be able to access gender-affirming care, and anyone saying otherwise is being lazy. 

Dysphoria and depression are often co-morbid. Sometimes the depression is the prime symptom of the dysphoria. Sometimes they're related but not directly connected. 

My depression has been around for 20+ years of my 30*cough* year long life. When I socially transitioned 7 years ago, my depression changed too. After a few years living authentically femme, I realised that a lot of my difficulties weren't directly linked to my gender so much but were symptoms of undiagnosed autism and adhd. I'm waiting for assessments for both now.

People (and healthcare professionals) want to deal with the various components of Personal Stuff one at a time in a nice neat line, but if someone's got a couple of different things going on then it'll present however the hell it wants, confusing and obfuscating what's actually going on. Healthcare professionals don't like this, and the bad ones will demand you magically only present one condition at a time. All of your parts deserve care.
I'm kinda nervous that I may never be able to gain access to gender affirming care due to a string of mental illness issues. I'm more than willing to go through the process but I feel like all I will face is denial after denial
Took the word outta my mouth
Edit: meant to say it's helped symptoms of anxiety and depression, the other two things are still a thing lol
Depression IS a reason you SHOULD get it.
Gender Dysphoria could very well be the cause of your depression.
You will get someone to believe you, just because you're mentally ill does not mean that you cant know if you're really trans.
I am a gender affirming therapist in private practice.  I can tell you that all you have to do is look on one of the listing websites and search for affirmative therapy.  Or search by gender of the therapist.  A lot of these sites have options to search lgbtqia identities of the therapists.  I can also tell you that in my practice I routinely write letters of support for my clients and the only barrier to entry of my practice is that you identify as not heterosexual.  That’s it just don’t be hetero and you’re in the door.   I consider gatekeeping by therapists to be a sign of incompetence and homophobia.  If your therapist or doctor is being a gate keeper then it’s time to find another one.  

TLDR:  The listing sites I can say are good ones to use due to experience are:  psychology today
Good therapy,  therapy den,  inclusive therapists, open path collective and ofcourse there are others. There is also a website called: Outcare.  You can search affirmative medical providers by state and specialty.

If you’re looking for hormones you can access them via PLUME.  This organization provides telemedicine options and can possibly get you hrt SAME DAY.  You can also look for your local LGBT canter in your area and they might have resources for you it’s good to ask anyway. 

There are good affirmative people out there docs and therapists too, you just gotta find them. Don’t give up.

Good luck to you!  You deserve better than it sounds like your getting.
Ive got much worse than depression going for me (just check my comment history), and starting my medical transition has been a huge help, and surprisingly has even helped me stabilize my moods better. Mental health can improve by leaps and bounds when you start to feel more connected to and confident in your own body. 

Plus, honestly? Lie to your endo. You do have to tell them about any medications youre on, but tell them that youre more mentally stable than you are so that you can get the care that you need.
I understand the fear. I was diagnosed with dysphoria and incongruence and referred for hormones (now on a waiting list), while suffering with a heightened case of anxiety and depression from my complex post traumatic stress disorder. I'm not saying it can't count against or be used against you, but depending on who you see how how able to trust them you feel (or advice you can get from people who have seen them before) being honest about your conditions could be beneficial (unless more specific advice counteracts this). Love and solidarity ❤️🖤
I just get this fearful feeling I'm going to have to run through 7 hoops just so I can get someone to help me figure out (what I assume) are dysphoric feelings. I don't mean to trauma dump tho, super sorry. Just, nervous about being a trans woman
Does this mean going the more traditional route will mean I'm more likely to be gatekept?
Getting a gender identity therapist was the best decision I ever made. They helped me navigate my feelings and helped me set reasonable goals to figure myself out and how to progress once I decided what I wanted to do.

I wouldn’t be anywhere close to where I am now if I didn’t. It’s not about being made to junk through hoops, they aren’t there to tell you what you are or are not. It’s about finding a way around your own mental barriers in a way that isn’t harmful.
Are you in the US? If so look at informed consent.  I am on three anti depressants, and the only issue they had was making sure there were no negative interactions.
Hey, you need a place you can do that, and this place is an ideal space for it - for people to support you.

Your worries are understandable, gatekeeping of trans people is a real thing and is totally shifty

I would advise you look for a clinic which is informed consent - far less gate keeping in that. All you need to do is sign consent forms to treatment, and go through blood tests to make sure your body can safely handle HRT
I was scared of this very thing but for me I walked in to my doctor's office told him I was transgender and needed to discuss hrt. He said he didn't have the training but knew someone who did. I went and saw her and after one more appointment I had hrt and a referral for gender confirming surgeries. I called to set up my consults for those surgeries the next day.

I have been on hrt for 7 months and my first appointment to discuss top surgery is next year. I had a few issues with insurance affording hrt but eventually it was approved. Go for your happiness OP.

My advice be prepared if you need to suddenly cover the cost of hrt out of no where. Mine was $133 and I had to suddenly foot the bill twice. My doc did offer to give me a shot to tide me over until the insurance covered it but I wanted my gel. Don't let this scare you, just have it as preparation. I have severe anxiety and depression and I was scared for years I wouldn't get care because I was afraid I wouldn't be believed. I found overwhelming support instead. If your doc behaves differently find another one. You deserve to be happy, seize it.
It means you have the right to seek out care that’s right for you and that this care is available
There is this whole thing going on with my insurance where I have to go through my provider in order to get coverage, that's what scares me the most. I feel as if I'm going to be picked at like some sort of science experiment, just analyzed and not actually heard. Only to be denied, gatekept, and sneered at for even questioning my gender in the first place. I'm not looking to immediately start HRT I just want to talk to someone about my options and express myself in an environment where I don't have to be hyperanalyzed.
I would definitely like to start HRT in the next 2-3 months but not immediately."	tt5lem	trans	279	0.99	2022-03-31 17:58:00
I FINALLY HAVE A DATE SET DOWN TO GET A CONSULT FOR STARTING TESTOSTERONE! (cw: mention of dysphoria)	"I'm so excited! But also? Very nervous. I'm a trans-masculine nonbinary person (they/them pronouns, please!). And I've been wrestling with whether or not i want to go on t or not for YEARS. Finally i decided I'd just go for it and see how I feel just microdosing. 

Maybe it's a normal thing, but now that i have the appointment scheduled and everything I've wanted to change about my body is now somewhat within reach, i feel more dysphoric and more doubtful that this is something i should go through with. I've heard a lot of people say the same about top and bottom surgery, but i wasn't expecting this for starting hormones. I'm very excited and i KNOW this is something i want, but there's still that small part of me saying that I'm not gonna like the changes and that I'm gonna regret it. But I'm excited to finally feel at home in my own skin."	"Good luck that is awesome!
Good job on getting the appointment in order to start your T! When I started E I was very nervous about it ""Changing who I was at a core level"" and ""Maybe I am mistaken"". I know it varies for everyone but in my case taking my starting dose helped with my dysphoria rapidly and helped me grapple with the true nature of my dysphoria over time. It can be hard to know how the difference in mind/body communication is/can be on new hormones, and even harder to describe from a first hand account.   


I feel as though the questioning of ""is this what I truly want? how do I know?"" Is valid; and I think starting your T and discovering those answers for yourself will be great for you. I remember the fear of being wrong as a huge hurdle even though I had thought of starting HRT for years prior to actually starting it.   


I am excited for you congrats again on taking this step, I know it's a lot to grapple with.
Not quite got a date for starting yet myself, but I know what you mean, what helps me feel more certain about my decision to go on is thinking whether I want to have the body I currently have or not? I hope that helps you in some way!
I totally understand this my appointment is tmw morning and I was able to finally go to a Ross and pick out new clothes without actually feeling like I was gonna cry because of dysphoria and I was able to convince myself that I was aloud to spend 50$ on teeth whitener to fix the stains from not brushing due to depression and I was able to clean my entire room for the first time in 3 YEARS. I haven’t even started yet but I feel so much better like everything is in reach
I have mine mid October and I totally get you. Cheers! 💜💜
Thank you!!! This makes me feel a lot better, knowing that others have had the same experience. Something that ive been telling myself is that it is always possible to stop taking the hormones or adjust the dose as needed, so it's not a one-and-done-no-takesies-backsies kind of thing. Which has helped me a ton. I'm so used to medically related things being a permanent result of two drastic potential outcomes that i think that fear of loss or further damage is has bled into this as well. But all in all i know it's the right decision and will make me happier over all!
Yes that's it! It does help, actually! 

I think part of it too is that i also have a very complicated medical history so there's some residual trauma from that that i need face in starting hrt. But it's still very exciting nonetheless!"	ploj80	trans	277	0.99	2021-09-10 16:32:42
Dysphoria from a dream	I’ve never had dysphoria about this before but, I had a dream where I found out I was pregnant and I was happy? Obviously I can’t get pregnant irl cos mtf, but it was weird that I liked it in the dream and when I woke up I was weirdly sad, has this happened to anyone else?	"Yes I get those dreams ever now and again. 😢 It makes me sad that I may not ever have a child by pregnancy. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't have kids or a family adoption is an option.
In India they are trying to do a uterus transplant for a trans woman so maybe carrying a baby one day will be possible for you if that’s what you want 💜
 I once had a dream I was super pregnant (7-8 months) and just living my life.  Holy fuck I was so happy and content; I've had rough dreams before, but never about that. I wanted to die for like the next month straight.
Before I transitioned, I frequently felt sad after waking up from dreams where I was a girl, though not specifically about pregnancy. I did start to feel kinda dysphoric about it when my sister was pregnant, though, which is weird, cause I don’t even really want kids, but somehow the fact that I *can’t* have kids at all is a bit of a sore spot anyway.
Nah i remember one time i had dream where i was girl (i didn't know it was dream , it didn't felt like one ) than sadly i woke up .
Yes but kinda reverse, Im ftm and i had a nightmare about being pregnant and it messed me up for a couple of days after
Yes it’s so upsetting but like others have said adoption is always an option. And who knows what medical breakthroughs will happen in the future
Similar. I’m FTM. Sometimes it’s a yk what kind of dream and I have the genitals that I want to have. Then I wake up and cry 🥲
Yes , I have kids and there are many days where I had dreams about being there mother, but sadly woke up to reality. Life does send very mixed messages
I had a similar dream the other night, I dreamt that I'd just had a baby and was somehow pregnant again. (I'm amab and fluid, so this was jarring). I woke up very sad and dysphoric and just wanting back into the dream.
This rings a bell. I think I had a very similar experience at some point in the past but I can't recall.
Oh, totally. That's what cracked my egg. It was a dream where I had boobs, but yeah, the joy within the dreams, contrasting with the utter desolation and disappointment upon waking up to no-boobs was just an indescribably severe whiplash of feelings.

I had no way to explain why I would have either of those feelings unless I was trans.
Had a dream that my mom went with me shopping for underwear and said no hun you should pick those theyre packing underwear, even of youre not gonna pack it's best to be sure and i woke up not fully knowing it was a dream and when you finally realize it youre just heartbroken
Oof I’ve been there. I’ve had dreams where I’m being my happy lil trans masc self and then waking up to my fucking body like it is screws me over.
I actually have a pal like this. They very much would like to be able to conceive but they have no uterus. They're enby and lean pretty heavily femme. But their deepest desire seems to be that they wanna be pregnant and a lesbian. It's a lot more common than folks might think.
This happened to me this morning bro
I had this dream where my parents woke me up and told me “you’re not a girl, so stop acting like one. And put on some clothes, we’ll be having people over in an hour. And please for the love of god, could you at least stop being gay? Just for today at least?”
I had a dream about breast feeding and I looked into induced lactation. When I had a baby on the way I tried it and I'm very glad I did.
I had a dream before I knew that I was trans that I was a man. The entire dream consisted of me forgetting I had a penis and sitting down to piss.
Adoption or meeting someone with kids.. divorce rates are like 50% so the odds are there you can meet someone
The dream that cemented the fact I was trans for me was I dreamt I had the biological body of a female and I never felt happier or more at peace with myself in my life. Then I woke up :(
Well for me I had a dream when I was a girl and I had really nice long hair and now I enjoy watching videos about hair styles and stuff like that
I woke up crying a sweating like crazy after having a dream where I voluntarily cut all my hair off. I instantly started grabbing and feeling If All my hair was there. I felt completely shook up
Yeah that’s always an option
I’m in the same boat, the fact I can’t have them if I wanted them hurts
I get that a lot, it sucks waking up
Yeah I know that feeling, I've had dreams like that so much that inside my dreams I've started telling myself, ""finally it's happening for real this time!"" Aaaand then I wake up disappointed again.
Those dreams are always too short.

Had a lucid dream once, and got so excited that I could be a girl that it woke me up. Been trying to chase that high ever since.
Same. In my nightmare I ended up walking inside a web (I’m arachnophobic) & I fell down the stairs and started drowning
God this. This dream tortured me for years while I was still repressing things. Still get it from time to time. Still kicks my ass. Not far off starting HRT now though, so hopefully not for much longer!
Yes of course the system makes it hard on us, but it's worth going through what the system has in place if I could provide a family, love to a kid/kids.
I get it. I don't *want* any, and my wife and I had decided over a decade ago if we ever changed our minds we would ABSOLUTELY adopt rather than pass down some of the health issues we have

Even still there's sometimes dysphoria knowing that the *choice* to not have kids isn't really even a choice in the first place. Weirdest dysphoria ever lol
On the plus side, my sister made me the kid’s godmother, and that baby is goddamn adorable. I love him so much.
Yeah the system sucks, hope you get that one day
I hope so too."	vzmt5r	trans	278	0.98	2022-07-15 11:52:57

todays starbucks rant	"so i have a nametag that says samantha, the cash register says my name, and the receipts also say my name. my voice is feminine unless every person ive asked has lied to me. im wearing a mask at work because covid issues in the store as well as dysphoria so there isnt really a way to discern my gender via face. and yet a lady came in and said the wrong pronouns multiple times even after her friend corrected her (ive always been too afraid to correct people; i have a people pleasing problem). she leaned on the counter where i put the drinks, far enough to see everything i did. she stared at me while i made the drinks and stared at the drinks while i was making them. i hand her the two drinks and she goes ""did you remember the raspberry pumps?!?!"" i go ""yes ma'am, i did. i put three pumps in both drinks"" she responds with ""this doest taste like it has the raspberry in it but okay"". she watched me pumping it in so idk what the dedal was.

&#x200B;

TLDR: please be nice to food service employees because we dont get paid enough, stand all day and (in my case) arent allowed to sit for multiple hours, and we deal with bullshit constantly. also i dont know why im getting missgendered if theres nothing about me screaming MASCULINE"	"I'm so sorry you had to go through this, that's absolutely demeaning. My best guess is that this person was just trying to find a way to channel their transphobia / hate and had nothing better in mind than mention the raspberry thing. It's honestly unbelievable how much some people walk around with all that hate bottled up inside them.
I’m in a very similar boat. I’m non-binary and have my pronouns written very clearly on my name tag. Yet I still get misgendered constantly at work (also a coffee shop) by both customers and coworkers. I had a lady in the drive-thru call me “madam” the other day. I was so angry, but when I tried to vent about it, a cis coworker told me a story about an angry customer calling the store after someone misgendered their daughter.

I want so badly to stand up for myself, but I’m so tired of correcting people. I wish they would just get it right.
I’m sorry you had to endure this Karen on a power trip desperately in need of those raspberry pumps. I hope it didn’t completely ruin your day and let’s hope something ruined hers or at the very least her friend gave her a talking to once they left the store about how ridiculous she was behaving.

That sounds awful.  I’m so sorry that happened to you.  People can be truly awful to one another.
Jeez. Sounds like 80% of the customers I had when I worked at Starbucks like 15 years ago. I mean, I wasn’t out then so there was no misgendering. But def people screaming at us and just belittling the people trying to help them. This one lady would order an extra dry cappuccino with an extra shot every time. So like a Grande with three shots of espresso or whatever is would be. Then throw an absolute fit every single time that it was too heavy and we were terrible at out jobs and how dumb do we have to be to get it wrong and blah blah blah. She would literally watch us spoon the foam into the cup and hand it to her, and then start yelling about too much milk and she wanted all foam. Only way that one would be happy is if I saw it coming and only put one shot in before she was looking and then let her watch me spoon the foam in. And by happy, I mean, she was still nasty. Like, “it’s still heavy, but better than you usually try to serve me. I’ll take it this time because I’m in a rush” kind of comments. It seemed then that much of the clientele regarded themselves as high status and felt the need to make sure we knew that we were lowly baristas and not worth the dirt on their shoes. That’s why I quit, actually. My team was rad, and the actual barista-ing is kinda fun, but I couldn’t handle the inflated sense of self worth those people carried with them. Well, that and the horrible pay that came with verbal abuse from customers all day every day. Anyway, there are just people out there who care more about what brand names are on the things they buy than learning how to be a decent human being. Starbucks just happens to be one of those brand names, so those interactions are inevitable. If that is an isolated incident, you are soooo lucky and I sincerely hope you don’t have any more like that. If your store is anything like mine was, leave. Please. Nobody deserves that kind of toxicity in their lives. Especially someone already fighting for the ability just live in peace and equality.
I feel this. Working in any kinda service industry while trans sucks. Back when I was a manager at a thrift store I had a name tag and pronoun pin and people would read my name, look at me and say “Ezra huh? Weird name for a girl” LIKE NO SHIT BILL.
I used to work at Starbucks and I swear to god that people come in to Starbucks specifically just to start shit.

If you aren’t reliant on them for your healthcare, (which is a whole different convo), I’d highly encourage moving to a smaller coffee shop with wholesome coworkers/managers/owners.
Her deal?  She is a Starbucks customer :/.  I work for the siren as well.  I say ""not a sir"", and ""It's June(my name) now"" like 400 times a day and I only work open to 8:30 am.
I wonder if people like this don't actually clock you they misgender in the hopes to maybe sniff out some people to offend. Let's be honest, we are way more sensitive to misgendering. I imagine a cis woman would shrug and go ""that lady was weird.""

Anyway, OP, I've been in retail service and I've always had big sympathy for anyone that deals in food, y'all definitely deal with some of the worst stuff. ❤️ sorry you dealt with such a crappy person.
Sounds like you had an unfortunate interaction with a nasty little TERF. They’re just miserable garbage people, more to be despised than pitied.
Sorry you’re too damn pretty to be misgendered wtf. This person was obviously a tyrannical bitch. You don’t have to be mean when correcting someone. It’s just like telling them they gave you the wrong amount for a bill. (Not that it’s that trivial) but you can politely with dominant poise tell them the proper pronouns and end it with a sweetie! They tell you to kiss their ass, just look at em smiling (bend over and tell me which end honey) she’s not even worth a second thought afterwords. I just hope I can do it when it’s time, be as brave and kind as you were.

Oh hell no tbh I think that’s someone that knows you who sent someone during your shift to give you a hard time. Sounds to me like you’re nonclockable only way for them to know is if someone told them your t sis. Either way fuck her and I’m so sorry
I go through the same thing at work but by management. For a long time they would occasionally deadname me, even though my name tag clearly says my name, and two of them have misgendered me on multiple occasions despite people using my preferred pronouns in front of them. I’m a trans guy (almost 9 months on T) and stock on 3rds. I literally can do everything my cis male coworkers can do (in some instances even better) but because i don’t have a penis my managers think I’m incapable of doing what my cis male counterparts can do.

I kinda wish there was a law where they have to abide by your pronouns in the work place. People never see misgendering people as a big deal but as a trans person, it ignites my dysphoria and erases any confidence i had before. A law wouldn’t even be necessary if people had the courtesy to ask instead of assume.
Totally agree...

Except for being able to lie to one's self. I lied to myself about being trans for 30 years. 😂
i work at a grocery store with a starbucks in it. i dont really do anything with the grocery store tho. other than the customers, the jobs great. i even have some friendly regulars. what i hate more than anything else is when someone in the store asks me where something is (and i have no idea as i work at starbucks) and they get pissed at me for no good reason. the pay is better than my last job but still not amazing. im staying till the end of the year cause i  need money before i move
I never knew how terrifying the phrase ""open to 8:30 am"" would be... Like, when do you get out of bed?
its def an experience lol. its super fun and i love mixology but its hard AF mentally
Shut up you have hemorrhoids
Seems kinda like you found words, but they're completely lacking empathy.
You realize the ""trans"" in the sub name doesn't mean it's about truckers, right?
honestly its crazy how idiotic people can drive near anything bigger than a delivery truck. my father drives a decently big delivery truck and hes had people break check him in tiny cars. if he didnt swerve he wouldve crushed them. but there are idiots everywhere and workers of all jobs have to deal with them
No problem.
oh yeah. i met an old neighbor of mine who had moved out a few years ago. he mistook me for my sister the whole time and telling me to ""Sent pics of your little brother cause hes grown up"". massive euphoria on my end and then this happened and it was gone.
A decade ago, I worked as a former partner. I was at a licensed store for 11 months, then a standalone corporate store for 6 months and then to a different location for a month. 

I had the worst experiences with customer service was when I was a barista. One lady had a very complex version of shots on ice & I was working alone. She had me re-make her drink FIVE TIMES and berated me and got nasty the entire encounter. She eventually left, but not before exclaiming that she’d report me to my supervisor!

The entitlement and disgusting behavior from Starbucks customers is next-tier. I’m so sorry, Sam!
I spent some time working a Cafe in a bookstore a few days a week. That wasn't near the kind of foot traffic a Starbucks would get though. xP"	w1puci	trans	272	0.98	2022-07-18 03:58:07
There's been a lot of dysphoria posts lately. Instead, what gives you feelings of euphoria?		"My chest hair. Shaving my head. Wearing nail polish. Confusing cis people.
It's really dumb and I know it's stupid, but the fake elf ears I have that I wear for Halloween. I can't wear them anytime, and I know I should not like wearing them, I don't even like admitting it.

Honestly the things I like I can't really wear naturally so I'm kind always depressed.
Wearing a wig, there's just nothing like the feeling of having my hair run down the side of my face and resting on my chest, and running my fingers through it is just so comforting to me (kinda in the same way a kid cuddles a stuffed animal). God I can't wait for the day my actual hair grows out that long
I had a very queer mullet for the first time earlier this year. I loved it. (AFAB NB)
My outfit today gave me major euphoria. Just had simple light purple hipster panties, bright purple & white striped socks, dark navy high-rise skinny jeans, and a Stars Wars t-shirt that’s done in like this cool pointillism style. I just felt super freakin’ cute all day. 

Evening rolled around and I wanted to get comfy, but really couldn’t bear to take to all off. So closed the blinds and spent the night in my panties, socks, and t-shirt. 

Only thing that brought me just a little down was that I don’t have anyone to tell me how cute I was while we cuddle on the couch.

Can’t have it all I guess.
Euphoria, I hardly knew ye.. 😆 But seriously, when my daughter excitedly texts me 'guess what? The entire stock of name brand cosmetics that were incorrectly bar coded was in the break room, for a buck apiece. We were compensated by the vendor. I got you an ass load of stuff'. 

Euphoria is, when I go dressed as a female, with my wife and kids, to a nice restaurant and have a great meal.

Euphoria is, when my Muslim lady doctor laughingly tells me, 'I suspected you for the last 6 years. Next time I want you to come as your true self'. I did, and then she immediately referred me to the Endocrinologist with my consent.

Euphoria is, not giving a flying fuck what others think. Going wherever and whenever I please, dressed in clothes what I identify as.
Feeling my beard and how much its grown in the past year. Seeing so much hair on my chest and stomach. Being called “young man” at work.
I just started T and am already growing more hair! Here's to being a hairy and chubby trans guy
Stupid af but.. me as a male presenting sim in sims 4 or sims medieval xD
Y’all
My leg hair! I didn't realise how much euphoria it gave me until I had to wear compression stockings consistently (after having top surgery) for almost a month, and when I was finally able to take them off my goodness did the euphoria roll in.

(And also, the top surgery. But the leg hair is a little more accessable)
Skirt go spinny
MY NEW GUESS HANDBAG YAAAAAAS

Here is it: https://imgur.com/a/sQ8rlAz
Being called “girlie” specifically
I got called a good girl for the first time today, felt very euphoric
My hair is growing out and it makes me physically jump up and down in excitement.
Being called ""Sir"" by a stranger despite me not presenting as overtly masculine. Happened to me a couple days ago.
feeling my long wig on my back or just feeling it touching any part of my body
Booba… My doc recently upped my estrogen and holy jeez these puppers are bursting on to the seen 😱
Also euphoric but annoying is that I’ve finally got the cuddle hornies… I hate/love it.
Wearing my first dress right now
Being f*cked
Ornaments on my wrists, big loopy earrings, ✨chockers✨, tying my hair in a ponytail, high waisted shorts, crop tops, looking myself in the mirror and going ""damn i look hot today, cooking and being good at it lol my gender is housewife. Stuff like that
Standing up in heels
My black tights and my black and white T-shirt dress.
Dreams.
The weight of earrings when I have a nice pair in. My hair growing out and starting to curl.
I got new earrings, pin, and nametag with my recently updated she/it pronouns on them! Made by a local queer! :D
I noticed yesterday that I've developed way more of a figure than I used to think! That's made me really happy.

But I think the most consistent one is how jiggly my booty is :3
My nails, my hair and being called a princess. It's all so nice and makes me feel fuzzy inside 🥰🥰
Weird thing for me. A weird homeless person rambling incoherently on the street as I was driving with my mum shouted at us ‘Hey ladies!’. It was creepy yet euphoric that he assumed I was a woman. :)
Mhhh…. The skater boy aesthetic/style, when I talk and my voice cracks(especially because I’m pre t), the idea of having a boyfriend(weird, right?), when strangers call me a boy, hum…. That’s kinda it.
When I was really early on in my transition, still in the ‘am I making a mistake’ phase, I had a teacher who would call me “young man” and I always really enjoyed that.
When I ask if I lean fem or masc and someone says I look gender neutral.

(enby here)
The hair on my arms & the peach fuzz on my fsce. Specifically. Don't really care for hair elsewhere, just that. Makes me happy, lel.
I bought fem pajamas today for the first time and that made me feel euphoria! It's the little things honestly
Working on an outfit in FFXIV online, and having friends and strangers give me compliments on it! Makes me feel feminine <3
Cuddling with my fuzzy purse. Both because it was the first one I had and because it reminds me of my cats at home.
I have a hard time identifying euphoria and dysphoria, but i always feel better after shaving my face, showering, and a good nights sleep. There's something about that that just clears all the icky stuff out of my head. Like yeah I know that's just basic hygiene but it makes me feel a bit more human and I can actually focus on being me instead of whatever my dysphoria is making me center on. Kinda like an emotional reset button if that makes sense? Idk also stuffed animals and cooking makes me very happy. My euphoria and dysphoria are kinda tied to my other emotions so something that makes me happy normally will also probably make me feel gender euphoria. It's hard for me to explain but i hope y'all know what im talking about here lol
The biggest right now is having socially transitioned and hearing my name in casual discussions. School life as an adult is unexpectedly enjoyable - I mingle with other guys, people are cool with me and being a pre-T trans man is just one thing about me, not THE thing. That makes me feel incredibly normal and validated. I don't pass and have no way of passing before HRT, but still, social acceptance has turned out to be one of the greatest mental health boosters and I am incredibly grateful for that.

Also those days when I look amazing in a suit, shaving my face (tried it once, got hooked), finding the perfect cologne (Armani), lifting things at the gym (no matter small the weights), wearing a wrist watch (even though it is just a Fitbit).

Thanks for making me reflect this, it's good to focus on and appreciate the positive amidst all this.
When the older lady at the service station calls me “darl”
A friend gave me some clip on earrings she had made herself last weekend. Wearing them was the most euphoric I've felt since I tried lipstick again and found it was fine
I just spent a good few minutes making girly piccrew characters, which is sort of silly but it made me feel a little better!
Hair braids! 😊
My beanie. My fave already looks more fem then it used to but the beanie just gives it a bit more.
Everything except my genitals.
my new coworkers not assuming my gender :) i started working there a week ago and so far they’ve used he/they and my name even though i’m afab. feels good
Weirdly enough, T shirts that have sleeves that end at my mid  bicep. It makes me feel buff.
Getting my makeup just right and getting better at it, selling my man clothes, creating my new identity online and letting it slowly replace my old one 🥹🥰
Being clean shaven. 
Blush. 
Hair day (curly hair. Day 1 is best)
Heels. 
Eyeliner. 
Being treated like a woman. 
Being gendered properly.
this specific sweater with a specific hat
Being called “bro”, fist bumps, compliments on my baby beard, cis dudes hyping me up
The fact that officially on Oestrogen blockers and Micro T!! (FtM)
Skirts, my black lipstick, my new wig. The sweet young lady at dollar tree who smiles and asks me how my makeup is going and compliments my look
Getting cat called. I know it's not necessarily a good thing... just the fact that it happens now is just bliss ,euphoria validation
It's make me euphoric that we live in a time where Trans people can be helped in medical terms. Means that life still can be great, even if ur born in the wrong gender.
simply a skirt, and thigh highs if i havent shaved my legs recently
When my wife calls me “good girl”
Finally seeing the breasts I’ve had this whole time on my body makes me feel really great 🥰 as does putting my hair up into a bun or painting my nails. But weirdly, so does one or two days of facial hair growth
Honestly, I find so much joy when my hair is in a ponytail
the noise heels make on concrete, i always giggle stupidly when i hear it it really puts a smile on my face
Wearing a cute skirt and tights and seeing dudes faces turn red. Doubling checking my make up and fixing my hair in the restroom
I got gendered correctly at work yesterday by a customer, called me sir not once but twice was very refreshing and I couldn’t stop smiling. (ftm enby/transmasc, they/them)
Sooo super stupid thing but since it has gotten cold I will take a hot hand and stick it between my boobs in my bra (Lol my boob pocket)
Wearing my tailored suit
for me i get a lot of euphoria seeing how much my hair has grown since i started taking growth photos, i think it makes a huge difference in how much more feminine i look
Going out and trying on new skirts gives me euphoria. Makes it awkward sometimes though lol
Wearing lingerie and fake tits
My boobs have been growing a lot lately and it's been pretty sick.
Every time I dance, I get compliments about it, and I feel like a force to be reckoned with with my other fem beauties, I post videos on Instagram of me dancing and there’s so many affirming comments as well, when I do my makeup I feel like the baddest bitch, sometimes(most times) I feel so womanly in the outfits I pick out 🥹🥹
wearing makeup, dressing femme, my legs, how my body is shaped
When, as a trans woman, I feel confident enough to just wear an A cup bra instead of a bigger one with padding, and then knowing ist all me.
VENENO
Walking in the park (fall is beautiful) and knowing I am beautiful despite what anyone thinks...
Skirt spinny
Pretty much nothing
For some reason wearing really beautiful perfume does it for me!
knee length shorts, white sports socks and trainers. lads. i’m telling you, it’s impossible to be misgendered in this fit.
Grabbing my massive fucking ponytail
Button up shirts! I normally use eyeshadow the same color as my eyebrows to thicken my eyebrows too  
and whenever my moms(one is transfem and the others genderfluid) call me their son it always just makes me happy
When my boyfriend calls me a good boy. Gets the happy wiggles going.
Simply when someone calls me by my name.
When duolingo tells me I'm a man
Makeup :3
People still using he/him when I'm presenting fem (I'm transmasc but I still like feminine things)
Wearing my leggings
Getting all my documentation updated!  Really gives people no excuse to deadname or misgender.
Doing my make up in the morning - going to the store and nobody who is noticing me.
clothes/accessories  - my wig, my new black dress, tights, the denim shorts and tights look. My new knee high boots with heels. Painted nails. Practicing makeup.

Body - pre everything but my legs and hips were always a bit feminine, and now that I'm shaving my legs, wearing a waist trainer and losing the gut, they are looking even more so

Social - being called bitch, girl, etc, being told recently a friend can already picture me as the tall badass goth chick I'm gonna be, a thousand other little ways said friend already treats me as a woman. Being called Cassie or Cassandra.

Mindset - the feeling of seeing my real smile in the mirror when I first saw her there. The feeling of towering over everyone in heels. And the biggest one for last: The feeling of confidence I got the first time I went for a walk presenting as a woman. That confidence is the most important one and the biggest thing I want out of my transition.
Wearing that 1 shirt that doesn't make my boobs stick out
The flattening effect of a new binder compared to a three year old one, how I can sing along with lower pitch songs now, and snakebite piercings that I've wanted since I was a kid. Also celebrating 2 years on T today  ✨🦇
Weardly my ankles, I just look at then and there overtly fem in my eyes.
wearing cute stuff under what i normally do, growing out my nails, playing with my hair, and hanging with besties

My navel piercing. It was the first crack in my egg
I have a green coat that gives me euphoria for some reason
When I walk around with my baby and people think I’m his mama :)
Button up shirts with goofy patterns
Having smooth, hairless legs
my partner shaved my back recently. looking in the mirror, it was the first time i didn’t feel like a samsquantch
I changed my name on my Facebook accounts AND my name tag at work
YESTERDAY
Is it weird that I love my period? Like the level of emotional vulnerability it brings me is like… It’s oddly validating
Good positive vibe, I love it!   I get euphoria with those fleeting moments when I catch my reflection and see her, or the potential of her.  They are those glances where my hair is just so and the angles and light come together and for a brief couple or three seconds I see a woman.  Those make my heart leap.
Yesterday I put on women's panties with a bra and it was so cool!  I don’t have breasts yet, I don’t take hormones yet, so realizing that I have now become even closer to who I really am, I cried with happiness
Hearing my name said by someone else.
Tight clothes and foundation on my face, and my long hair

I look to look mostly androgonous and leave ppl guessing :)
I learned how to tie a tie a couple of days ago (at the ripe old age of 22!) and while I've still yet to have anywhere to actual my wear it I keep getting out my first and only tie to practice for a hit of euphoria.
Driving with one hand on the wheel!
Stuff like 'handsome' make me feel really euphoric but also picking masculine avatars in games!
Going to a gender neutral bathroom. I just entered a gender neutral bathroom for the first time at my Uni and I didn't imagine how happy it would make me feel. I don't know if what I felt is euphoria or not but I'm happy even though I can not go there everytime.
When little kids call me sir or ask if I'm a boy or a girl
skirt go spinnnyyyy
My girlfriends conservative step dad calling me “son” despite me being pre-op with big boobs. As far as I know he doesn’t know I’m trans and him never questioning it gives me so much euphoria. It feels very reassuring hearing him use he/him for me without hesitation. Of course my beard is hard not to notice so that may be why but still him not questioning me in a world where waiters still do is so relieving.
mmmmm I cant experience most of it so the basics make me happy, hearing my name and stuff helps a ton \^\^
Okay weird one but seeing my cis female friend’s arm and seeing a considerable amount of hair on it. Makes me feel better about like body hair and stuff.
Darkening my peach fuzz with the male hair darkening stuff from the store >:)
Facemasks… lots and lots of nice relaxing facemasks
Being barefoot.
Wearing knee length high heels. I'm transmasc btw 

There's just something about heels that make me feel like a pirate. I adopt the 'captain sparrow walk' after a few steps and I love it. 

It's the weirdest but also the strongest sense of euphoria  I get.

hearing people talking about me and using the right pronouns :)
My bare skin on cloth, my long hair tickling my neck, how feminine my face looks when I smile now
my green hair :> and my boobs
When my boyfriend calls me good girl and when wearing collars
Euphoria is a big cable knit sweater so that I can feel like a cute girl in the corner with a book at a cafe
Outfit planning. I have a few pieces of clothes in my Amazon whisk list and I feel cute just thinking about wearing them!
Friends calling me Lukas

Wearing clothes I got from my best friend’s brother

Using a comb
my voice and hair! I've been doing pretty good with voice training and my hair is just so annoying and gets everywhere I love it
For some reason the very specific clothing combination of skinny jeans, sweater / thick jacket, and platform boots is peak euphoria to me- idk it just makes me feel so tall and masculine
fem clothes that fit my body shape even the tiniest bit.
When ppl I've never met address me as a he

Every time after the interaction I do the hyped up fist pump and under my breath go  ""hell yeah means I finally pass""

Seeing my hair get longer, and longer, and longer. I wish my changes were as fast as my hair grows. Reached 5 months on Sunday!
My face shape and handmade wolf fangs
Eyeliner. I put that shit on even if I'm not leaving the house at all.
being around other trans people tbh

seriously nothing feels better than being around people who see you for yourself
Wearing a nice snug bra, my favorite top, my mid length black skirt and a nice pair of stockings
A man told me last month that my face looks like my mother's. I'm not out publicly, and that felt great.
Using FaceApp helps me, truly hoping it’s accurate  😅😅😅😭😭😭😭
When people call me ma'am at work. It just makes me feel warm and nice!
Shaving my legs and wearing fem clothing 🤘🏻
Confusing cis people who come into my work for food
Also I got my ears pierced two days ago
Shaving body hair is the most common form, but sometimes, when my brother is not home, I wear my skirt.
Nothing?
It's really simple, but getting compliments for my makeup or outfit.
Filling up my car with gas gives me the weirdest sense of euphoria every time.
My pube stache
Shaved legs, makeup, leggings, crop tops, eyeliner. Oh and being called ‘good girl’ by my partner…makes my heart flutter!
When random people on discord use she/her pronouns to refer to me. It makes me so happy.
Dressing masc (I'm a trans woman)
Okay might sound strange, it’s not exactly euphoria because I haven’t had that in years but when I’m wearing my mask and my hat and a big scarf in the bus, I feel like my gender doesn’t matter, that I’m just an entity in hiding and this feels so nice

Also just wearing cool clothes that make me feel like myself
MY FLANNEL OMG I LOVE FLANNELS
Wearing a bra lol. That shit feels just.. so good lol😅 feels like the cherry on top
Feeling stuck as a male because I have kids and a wife. But then one conversation with my therapist changed everything. In short, she gave me permission to be me, the woman I feel inside. I left my appointment feeling so unbelievably happy. Felt like I could fly..
tightsss!!!🥰😇
Wearing makeup and/or my very high platform heels 👠
when i catch my mom calling me her son while on the phone with other people :’)
Confusing cis people really is it's own reward.
That's not stupid. Your choice of style is not stupid. You gotta stop beating your self up about it. Just wear whatever feels right and don't let anything stop you (not even yourself!)  (:
Elf ears are cool :)
You do you and what makes you happy! I love my raccoon tail and ears and wear them proudly sometimes :)
I love elf ears I've even had a consultation with a plastic surgeon to get them done !!!  Probably have them done in the next year or two just have some other things I want done first surgery wise hips and butt  augmentation surgery
in my country there are many girls wearing them and almost nobody care
My boyfriend
You should wear your elf ears - to heck with other people.  I wore a long Tom Baker Doctor Who scarf through most of my teens, even to school... and w io oath a bran fedora.

Then I grew up and decided I needed tonrwpreas that playful, theatrical light, lest I be harshly judged.  

In my experience, I am the one who most keeps myself from doing those things that make me happy.  I judge and beat myself up just a little more than the way I assume others do.  A
Wigs look amazing and you can customize them! good luck with growing your hair out! I'm rooting for you!
me too :)
I'm sure you were very cute! Especially the Star Wars shirt, it sounds really awesome! I have one of my Star Wars hoodies on today :)
You heckin' go girl!
Not stupid at all. I play a lot of AD&D computer games. If the main player and npc portraits are customizable, I play a female character always, and all female npc's are also different portraitsof me in their respective gear (rogue, druid, mage, ranger,  etc.,) Here's a few of my game portraits: https://imgur.com/a/kX6YNw9
I totally get it! I switched my Stardew Valley character to male and almost cried I was so happy! All the little villagers call him sir now.
Yo I had the same thing too. Was playing sifu and when I was playing as a woman I felt so fucking powerful. At least after the first couple.hours when I was still very shit at the game.
Aww 🥰
Hope your top surgery went well mate!
Genuine question, what made you have to wear compression stockings? I'm nowhere near able to or educated enough to get top surgery yet, but I hope to one day.
I hope you get called girlie a lot this week :)
OMG CUDDLE HORNIES. that's such a good term for it!
Also using IPL on my chest, amazing feeling zapping those pesky follicles 🥵
Dude that's awesome! I bet it looks super nice! I need to get me one of those.
I can't wear them almost any day is all
I work in healthcare so I can't wear that stuff
I can't wear them because I work in healthcare. I'd basically be seen as insane
if rooting was meant to be as a pun I salute you
Aren’t you sweet. 🥰🥰
Thank you! It went very well. I am about nine months post-op by now and feeling great!

I'd also like to add being called ""mate"" to my list of euphoria things.
They're supposed to prevent blood clots (I think). My surgeon recommend I get them, because after surgery there is a lot of sitting around resting.
Yes tf you can- just do it
Doesn't have to be at work, can make running errands better for hanging out with friends :)
It wasn't initially. My comedic genius is beyond me. 😎
I can't, I work in healthcare, I'm perpetually in school all day or in clinicals, and I have no place to wear them outside of it. They fall off constantly and don't feel real anyway so it's alright
I can't do that either, I basically work and am in school at all times
I wear cat ears every day, even to school. Andsomehow, no one has even called me a furry! ;3
I'm sorry friend :(

am i boxy? i have a hard time seeing past dysphoria	"I feel super boxy w/ my shoulder to hip biz but I genuinely can't tell if its in my head or not 🥰🥰

The funny part is that I've definitely gotten some hip growth cuz last time I topped I fit different w/ my partner of 5 years 🤭🤭 Still don't see it tho 😅"	"you may not have a hourglass body shape but still many cis girls have the exact same body type!!!
Your body shape is just like a lot of other women, if that what's you mean. You're not an hourglass, but most women aren't.

A good term for you to search is ""rectangle body type"" - that'll turn up advice on how to make your waist stand out more (and hopefully help you feel less dysphoric - there's lots of advice because lots of women are shaped like this!)

You've got a pretty normal body type as far as girls go, especially with the hip growth you mentioned. If you weren't posting this on r/trans, I wouldn't have immediately thought you were trans.
Cis girls / people come in all shapes. Your body looks great, don’t let your brain play tricks 💕
You may not be curvy. But boxy? No. Definitely not.
You should look up your body shape on a fashion tips site. I'll paste a link.

marked nsfw for the second pic but no nudity 💕💕
The idea that cis women have equally proportioned hips and shoulders is a pretty big exaggeration, with most cis women having hips that are slightly narrower than their shoulders until later in life/after childbirth, which can cause a pretty extensive rearrangement of the pelvic bones. Even that isn't close to a 100% thing. Point being, it's normal for women to have shoulders that are slinlgntly wider than their hips, and the beauty standards that say otherwise are based on statistical outliers.
You look like a Scandinavian women's volleyball champ
People come in all shapes and sizes regardless of gender. In fact, you have the body type a lot of runway model’s have. Take [Liz Seibert](https://youtube.com/shorts/Ep_nkgJF0mg?feature=share) for example.

Just because you don’t have Jessica Rabbit’s curves doesn’t mean your any less of a woman than anybody else!!!! YOU define what your OWN vision of femininity is, nobody else. And no, you aren’t ‘boxy.’ ❤️
You are neither boxy, nor curvy. I'd describe you as lean.

You look healthy and fit.
Definitely not, girl.
You look so good. Your perfect!🫶🏽
Nah you look good, and whatever you're seeing won't prevent you from passing in this case :)
it’s not a damn hour glass but it’s by no means boxy
No. You are not boxy.
In fact. I've got this belly thing going on, and I am jealous of your abs.
Hello hotty
No, you look like every other girl that's your size. If you want to make things a bit more pronounced I would suggest getting a corset.
I thought you meant “Boxxy” and I was hoping I’d get a cute eyeliner selfie lol. Naw girl you’re not shaped like a box, you’re just slender and lithe
Less boxy than me haha 🥲
You are beautiful even if you don't think so and sometimes our eyes play tricks on us showing us what we don't want to see.
You look great!
i wouldn't say super boxy at all. as a trans man, your figure is pretty similar to what mine was before T lol
Awesome abs !!
You look amazing like that, I know cis girls who would kill for that figure!
No not boxy at all! (:
Not at all, cutie 🥰💕🥰💕
Gorgeous, you go girl
You’re simply amazing!
Oh my god you’re seriously beautiful and my jaw dropped.
Ya look grate hun
You're a perfectly lovely looking woman. I would rubberneck if you walked past me. I envy your figure. I wish I looked more like you and less like me.
You look OK.
You are somewhat box shaped. but that is better than being pot bellied like me. You do still in fact pass from the neck down.
You are gorgeous and very fem. Boxy is the last word that would come to mind if I were asked to describe you.  If I saw this picture “in the wild” so to speak, I’d never even question your gender in any way. Just be like “oh yea, she’s cute af.”
This is random but you’d look awesome with a belly button piercing 🙃

You're a boy if you say you're a boy. End of

Thanks for your perspective 💕💕 I don't really trust my eyes cuz they're usually telling me more negative opinions lol
I'm just worried my hips are too narrow for my shoulders really  - and literally tysm for that link I really appreciate it 💕💕 That's a really good resource
Ok thanks - I'm working on getting myself to see past my dysphoria/dysmorphia so I appreciate your honesty 💕💕
My eyes are definitely tricksters 😅😅 Thanks for the support 💕💕
They've gotten softer on hrt but I'm really happy w/ how toned I look 🥰
Ok thanks! I'm just hoping I put on more weight on my hips - so far all my weight has gone to my thighs and ass 😅😅 (not really complaining tho)
Thanks 💕💕 I feel like sometimes I see it and sometimes I don't so i appreciate your perspective 🥰🥰
Thanks I'm trying my best 💕💕 I went out in a skirt for the first time last week and it was a lot of stress but I had a good time ☺️☺️
Thanks 💕💕 I'm really happy w/ my transition I'm just hoping I can at least put some weight on my hips 😅😅
Thanks 🥰🥰 I really appreciate it, I'm only recently starting to feel comfortable in my body and its been a lot of work 💕💕
Tysm 🥰🥰 I'm happy w/ my transition I'm just a little worried I'm clocky if I go to like a pool or something 💕💕
Ok 💕
Lol thanks 💕
Your shoulders are much more slight than a lot of women I know, both cis and trans! You have a cute little figure and your hips will continue to fill out if you’re on HRT. 💕💕
No problem, girl. We all need a pick me up sometimes.
Give it some time then you should be fine

To all the trans girls/women in this sub…	Just in case no one told you today, you’re all really beautiful. I’m sitting here scrolling through all of your pictures, and it warms my little trans man heart to see all of you living unapologetically YOU. Whenever you don’t feel pretty, just remember that so many people think you are and that you’re gorgeous no matter what society or your dysphoria says.	"Thank you, I really needed that <3
Our sisters are beautiful and deserve all the love and support
Thanks! 🌸💙
I keep comparing myself to other gals on this sub and like ""How are they all so pretty?!""
Thanks. You just made this trans girl, me feel really good about faerself.
Aww thanks, have a hug!
Thank you even tho I don’t feel like it
Thank you, this girl needed it 😊
keep slaying, ladies. you're all really pretty :)
You're going to make me cry, bro 🥺
tyty 🥰
Aw, thank you (:
wow... this is is the best community evar
My crush doesn't like me, others don't like me, I don't like myself trans or not.
Enby here but thank you for spreading some joy to our sisters
Awwwwwww💕☺️
Thank you so much! Even though I'm pre everything and still look completely masc, today for me was filled with lots of anxiety and dysphoria. 

This was just what I needed to hear.
Thanks, really <3
I’m definitely not, but I appreciate the sentiment
Tysm ❤️ I'm sure you're very handsome aswell
Awww thank you! So nice hearing this from a guy, especially one that gets it. Though I’m like horrible it’s nice you know
aww thank you <3 that means so much
Thank you so much, that means more than I can say right now. Sending love and hugs to all our trans brothers out there too!
Sitting here, feeling awful today and your words just broke through like a sunshine bath of kindness... thank you, OP <3
Thank you, king. You have a beautiful soul and I thank you for spreading a bit of love and cheer.
For reals that is soo true!
The truth is that all trans girls and women are beautiful. That's how we're also pretty.
This.. I don't come on this sub often because it makes me super dysphoric but I know I'll get there eventually
Oooh, nice neopronouns
Im so sorry. It seems like alot of people in the trans community go through similar things... I hope things get better for you soon.
It's scientifically proven that statistically we are all beautiful
You're there now, you just haven't realised it 😉
Thanks!!! I like them and they fit me really nicely
Soonest it could get better would be once the school semester is over and I can leave this garbage town for good and never see her again.
Yeah for reals. That's the kind of science I like"	110oc9m	trans	274	0.98	2023-02-12 19:43:46
Do I Pass? Any advice much appreciated. Been using dressing up as a coping mechanism for my growing dysphoria, isn’t helping much. Any advice? (Pre-Everything, in the closet, breast forms, hand-me-down sports bra from friend)		"Hugboxing (genuine): you’re definitely looking good! Especially pre-everything.

Advice: I’m ftm so idk how breastforms work, but if possible I’d lower them a little so they look more natural. Chests looking ‘pushed up’ can get some girls clocked. And I guess some workouts to tone thighs/butt so your hip:waist ratio is more conventionally fem (the exact opposite of what I’m doing lol), though that’s not too necessary since your body shape is already pretty good. Honestly, with E, determination and a little time you’ll have no problem smashing that dysphoria, I promise you. Hang in there and good luck!
Stand up a little straighter perhaps, pull your shoulders back a touch? There's not much to pick at but I feel you wanted constructive criticism rather than hugboxing haha
You look amazing!
Body isn't too bad, but it's also hard to tell because of all of the black clothing imo. (consequently, this is coming from a girl whose wardrobe is like 80-90% black lol)

Dig the hair length so far. How long have you been growing it out/what's your goal length?
You look fine to me 👍

If you're able check out the clearance rack at Walmart for bras I've gotten like 5 in different styles all less than 3 dollars ranging from super sexy to super comfortable
If you color block with a lighter top then it should help your hips look a bit more prominent and balanced. Probably one of the few good tips I picked up when I was still presenting female.
Lovely curves :) you def pass imo, although the goal should be for you to feel good in how you look rather than what other people think (I know it's easier said than done)
I’m getting a real 80s chick flick vibe off of you here, definitely looking good for pre-everything :)
Only reason I would know you were born a male is you said it. I understand dressing to fight dysphoria. I will never pass though. You look great 👍
Looking so good!!
Omg girl!!! You look amazing and great shape 😍😍 I wish I could upvote more then once.
I think you look great actually
Keep expanding your wardrobe. Keep things that don't fit you. If you take hrt, your body dimensions will change so just get things that fit you now and if you get something that is a little too small or a little too big just put it up in the closet. It takes about two years to get a full functioning wardrobe if you are shopping and or picking out things that are given to you with discernment. If you happen to be interested in makeup, start watching tutorial videos and practice. It took me about a year to get good at it.  Most importantly, don't be hard on yourself. Try to take it one day at a time and focus on your accomplishments. It's easy to drive yourself insane focusing on the future
Yes u are!!
You look great!! Definitely passing. 

Your posture looks a bit forced but I mean when does it not for a photo haha? But if that’s how you normally are, I’d just recommend relaxing your shoulders. 

Also I don’t know what your wardrobe is like, but like others have said try out different kinds of bras. As a cis-woman, I find that sports bras give me a more “masc” look, which is a good look for women imo but probably doesn’t help with dysphoria. I think a-line skirts/dresses and flared pants would look really good on your figure and exaggerate your natural curves!
Yes
You look amazing!!
non't
Yes
[removed]
Hugboxing is fine 😊 I’m already too critical of myself
Thank you 😊
I’ve been growing it out for 2.5 years now. I’ll probably keep growing it out until I have an idea of what to do with it. Maybe Mermaid hair length
Thanks for the advice but I sadly live in Australia 😥 Last time I tried to go bra shopping I freaked out and couldn’t even walk into the store (I was in my regular clothes in *boymode*)
That’s what I’m finding difficult 😔
Thanks 😊 I think you can
Do your research. Understand what Gender Dysphoria is, then come back. It's not affected by environmental circumstances. Anyone with the slightest hint of intelligence will know that.
That's fair, I am too. I just get a lot of hugboxing and I feel it holds me back, y'know? You do have the makings of a great figure though! If you go that far, HRT will do wonders for you.
to answer your question you do pass i would say your #goals
Nice! Just keep in mind that once you hit 3 years you're legally required to start seeing a therapist to get on HRT if you haven't already. It's in the handbook somewhere. Trust me. lol

I also grew my hair out pre-transition. In hind sight I kind of wish I had started transitioning sooner, but at the same time I don't think that I would have had as much confidence to come out as I did if my hair was on the shorter side (hella tight curls so it takes a while to show length).
I understand that but sis I'm bout to (maybe blow your mind) give you the best advice I can for buying girl stuff in public... 
 Just act as if you're buying something for your ""girlfriend"" and you can take it a step further and if they are trying to help you pick something out just say ""well she is about my size and build"" (hehe) I've never gotten even a slightly funny look and I've bought everything from dresses to panties heels makeup you name it and to REALLY drive it home ask where the tampons are no one second guesses a guy buying his ""girlfriend"" presents while she needs tampons and plus tampons cost like $1.50 so well worth it
Do you have a cis girl friend you could go to the store with? Pretend like she’s shopping for bras and you’re just with her and then you don’t have to worry about people as much!
[removed]
3 years? What handbook? I’m confused 😐
Get some sources that say that then. I'll be waiting. By the way, it explains what you think is proof in the Causes section. I can Google search too. It seems I can retain interest though.

You should really go back to school.

Edit: by the way, this information has been known and developed since the late 1920's.

By the way, if bullying causes it, then how come I'm trans, yet I've never been bullied? I've had a damn good life so far. Everyone I know is accepting of me now, and I'd say I'm pretty damn happy. I'm excelling in my education and I'm off to university in less than 5 months. I don't affect you. I'm not hurting anyone. But sure, go off on one. It'll just highlight how unexplainable your behaviour is.
I do believe they were joking.
3 years of growing your hair out. And it's in Maddie B's Guide to Arbitrary Trans Rules That She Definitely Did Not Just Make Up (written and illustrated by Madison Blackheart).
[removed]
That's a bingo. lol
Read my whole comment. I'm off to university :)

And by the way, there are people who have been severely bullied and show no signs of gender dysphoria. Why? Because they don't have it. Just like how intersex people are born with the wrong genitals or a mix of them, the same can happen to the brain. People aren't perfect. It's just the way it is.

Bullying can cause body dysmorphia, but not gender dysphoria. People can confuse the two, and make a hastey decision to define themselves as trans, but it doesn't mean they are. This has already been proven time and time again, and you'd know that if you spent more than a glancetresearching one source

You can also say ""fuck you"" to me, but I've still done nothing wrong. You're the one who wants people to he unhappy.

And yes, it is stupid. That's why we have treatment for it :)
[removed]
Bullying can't cause autism. Buying can't cause dyslexia. These are errors with the development of the brain - meaning they're just the same. And we know they're just the same due to the lack of definition as a mental illness, rather, it's got the same identification as those.  You're running out of arguments and really focusing on this one point. Sure, bullying can cause a lot of things, but there's also a lot that bullying can't cause."	bb6ciw	trans	263	0.97	2019-04-09 10:36:28
something im proud of	im 3 days self-harm free. all of my self-harm is related to dysphoria in one way or another and while i've had some horrible sleepless dysphoric nights i havent hurt myself once in the last 3 days. I don't know where else to post this but im just smiling cause im proud of myself. luv ya	"That's amazing. I'm happy to hear you've been doing better the past few days.
Keep going, you can do it!
Good job!

I used to self-harm too. Thankfully, I was always too much of a chicken to do anything serious, but boy do I remember those urges.

For me, I think those urges were more related to some repressed sexual abuse I'd suffered. Once I un-repressed that and actually dealt with it, the urges went away.

For you, maybe the urges are more related to the stresses of dysphoria. I hope you're able to transition as quick as you want, and that your urges fade away too!
I'm proud of you! Keep going and fighting to be the best you!
I'm so fucking proud of you girl 🥺👏 You've got this!
Good job! Happy things are better now :)
I am proud of you 🖤 please keep going :3
i am SO proud and i hope you can start transitioning soon!

Congratulations!

Ur amazing 🥲
god i thought i was the only one fed up with us trans men taki g collateral damage as a result of that statement u til now. glad to see im not alone.
I am so proud of you, there will be hard days but if you stay strong then you can look back and see all that you have accomplished, and even if there are days where you fall back that’s ok just get back up and try again, I have been self harm free for a little over a year now, and I don’t crave it nearly as much as I used to, it gets better I promise, if you ever need someone to talk to, even if it’s just for a distraction, I’m always here"	twmi77	trans	271	0.99	2022-04-05 04:23:50

How does your dysphoria works? Is it normal to come and go?	"So since I'm currently questioning myself a lot these days, I wondered how dysphoria was for others? Basically mine can come and go and because of these times when I'm 'more or less' okay with my body I feel like it's not at all valid and that I'm faking it cause 'I need to have dysphoria 24/7 for it to be valid' kinda deal?? or maybe I really am not transmasc and just a girl who can't accept who they are cause they hate their body for other reasons? HOW do you differentiate that dysphoria from the other??

I'm very confused and I don't know what to do, so how's your dysphoria, how does yours work?"	"Sounds very similar to me. I get bouts of dysphoria that last for a few days or weeks. It has always ended though and I’m left with a feeling more like indifference towards my gender. This can also last weeks. So I really don’t know where I’m at! 

I’m just coming out of my longest dysphoria phase yet. They do seem to be lasting longer each time.
one that sounds like you could be gender fluid or gender faun if that helps my dysphoria is similar sometimes i am fine being in a male body but sometimes the thought i will never have a period makes me wanna die
I am pretty well-controlled about it most of the time except for when I shed hair. Nothing triggers me harder than hair loss; in 2019-2021 I watched my hairline recede into a pronounced widow's peak until I finally got on HRT. I am 8 months on finasteride, Spiro, and depo E and I remain paranoid that none of it is working despite the fact that I am demonstrating tangible changes and I don't think the hairline has receded any more. But every hair lost and every glimpse of my hairline underneath immediately cause intense anxiety and senses of loss that can last from hours to days.

I am not good at dealing with this one.
There is also this one constant sort of dysphoria that I have: I will look at my body in the mirror and be like 'ok this is a body' without seeing it as mine, and then my eyes shift to my face and I get a sinking feeling paired with the thought 'why is my head attached to that body??'  
And Istg its almost every time I look in the mirror. Is it depersonalization? dissociation? dysphoria?? it's pretty weird
I feel like my dysphoria works in two modes. When I have to present male, I’m more or less okay with it because I’ve had to do it for 21 years. But presenting fem makes me actually happy to wear clothes. I care about what I’m wearing and how I look vs normally I throw on pants and a hoodie and call it there.
Completely normal. Don’t sweat it. It’s somewhat related but I have purged all of my clothes, shoes and makeup over the years more times than I can count. There can be a whiplash effect that’s slight or extreme…and all points in between.
I feel you a lot. I think about why something bothers me and more often than not the things I don't like about my body I don't like because they are on me and make me look female. Now I'm not thinking about those things 24/7, though specifics like my huge hips are on my mind a lot because I just see my reflection a lot and my tank binder rides up a lot.

But of course it doesn't always bother me the same amount. Sometimes I'm ok with how my body looks because that's just how it is now and I can't change much about it in a single moment at least. But then other times I break down because of the body I'm stuck in, last time I even had a panic attack because of my hips.

So no, you're not a fraud or anything for not being dysphoric 24/7. You even said you were ""ok"" with your body at times, not  ""happy "". Even then you could find your body good but not as your body, for example. 
If you feel the need to be trans, you're probably trans.

I struggled with accepting my gender for two years or so.. I've been questioning for around 4 years and haven't even picked a new name. It's okay to take your time.
I'm really secure in my identity now to the point I can finally explore my expression without feeling invalidated in my transness and manhood. I still get second thoughts from time to time, it's normal. It's a huge, scary, and sometimes dangerous decision to live as your experienced gender, but if at the end of the day you think it's worth the shot, then you should do it.
Idk, comes all the time nonstop, especially this last week
I basically had dysphoria only once so far, it was when I dressed up feminine (dress, tights, wig) for the first time and just couldn't see...her. She was hidden under a big layer of fat. I realized I need to lose some weight, regardless if I'm trans or not.

So for the last couple of weeks I've been working on getting back in shape and some other stuff to feel more attractive. 

Tbf I had body and confidence issues since forever and accepting that I'm trans has finally given me enough motivation to work on those and stick with it. 

I did feel strong euphoria when I shaved my legs once and they felt super smooth in the bathtub
Back and forth is also common for me
When I wear a binder for long periods of time and then go without it for a day I feel fine as far as I know. But then the next day when I put on my binder again I realize ""fuck man, I really hate not wearing a binder, it's not me. Now I feel really dysphoric because I didn'twear it yesterday"". That's one example on how my dysphoria works, absolutely no logic behind it.

Most days when I look in the mirror and see my face I want to throw up, I think it's about half half body dysphoria and body dysmorphia. Because I hate how I look, but I also hate that I don't look like a boy with a beard etc. I don't have an answer for you sadly, but you are valid no matter your identity, even if it turns out you're your agab.
It eve and flows.  Some days I can’t stand it.  Other days I don’t even think about it.
I'm 2 years into transition. Honestly dysphoria being wavey is pretty common even now (though obviously my dysphoria is a lot less), and I think that's true for a lot of the community in my experience. I sympathise though because it does fuck with you during questioning. I think of it similar to depression in that you don't feel sad all the time forever (rare anyway), you occasionally have better periods - doesn't mean you don't have depression or it isn't impacting your life. My take anyway 

For reference I'm a binary trans woman - I did initially use gender fluid and then non-binary early on though
I knew I was agender since I was 14, but was really dysphoric about it maybe once or twice a year. Nowadays it fluctuates a lot more, but it definitely comes and goes
It comes when I’m reminded that I’m a girl not a boy
In my case is more like I'm totally okay all the time, then I see what other girl's body's look like, i see mine doesn't look like that, i get sad, i cry, i tell myself I'm pretty and girly and forget about it.
My dysphoria comes and goes as well. One day I thought I could present femme and be indifferent. So I wore a dress. Big mistake. I almost immediately got hit with another bout of dysphoria.
Dysphoria can definitely come and go. As someone who lived with it for nearly 40 years. If you feel you have Dysphoria at all, it's worth evaluating.
Mines weird bc there are things that always make me feel it no matter what and then there’s times where I usually don’t feel it unless I’m feeling an excess in negative emotion (anxiety, mental exhaustion, depression and stuff like that) and I rarely feel it for my body anymore bc i have like a complete disconnect with it as a whole, bc of Dysphoria
I personally get 24/7 dysphoria which is deadly af but ik for most it can come and go in waves from just 10 minutes to a few weeks.
1 day I feel like I a girl and then dysphoria comes
24/7
I feel exactly like you sometimes my dysphoria is so bad I will hide away so nobody can see me and just cry while other times it isn't that bad and although it's there it's quite mild. I too am also really struggling with doubting that I really am trans and not just 'doing it for attention'. I really hope that you are able to find your true self and live authentically!
For me it's comes and goes like someday I have very little disphoria and some days I have so much I can't handle it
for me, dysphoria is constant, as i’m always somewhat uncomfortable in my body, but there are definitely times where it is less bad. 

no matter how you experience it, you are valid!! everyone’s experience is different and you don’t have to have constant dysphoria to be trans.
Not sure about other people, but, when I look in the mirror, I feel shame because I look so much like a man. It breaks my heart knowing that I will never be pretty and that people will constantly misgender me and treat me like dirt all because I'm ugly.
I’m afraid I don’t think I’m of much help other than saying that I share your confusion and swings. In the end, uncertainty is a part of life. It’s how we manage it that counts imho and that’s where counsellors can help.

For me it’s been years of detachment followed by an euphoric speedrun followed by a sudden crash.

What I’m doing is that I am clinging to all of the intense feelings I’ve ever felt and using them as validation for what I am and what I am not.

Because nobody can deny your strongest feelings, regardless of how often or sustained they are. The fact they exist repeatedly is proof enough of who you are and anyone questioning your validity can stuff it.

My €0.02.
Also trans masc, my dysphoria comes kinda randomly and isn't always present. Some days it's worse than others, some it doesn't even exist. You're hella valid, though I get how the questioning phase feels. Just know that you are valid and you, most likely, aren't faking. 

Sorry if this doesn't help..
Mine comes and goes too. Some days are better than others, some days I feel amazing and then other days my dysphoria hits me like a sledgehammer to the face. You are perfectly okay with how you are experiencing this. Besides, just like any other part of the transition journey, yours will be different but similar to anyone else. Just trust yourself and your body
It's different for everyone. Everyone has different experiences. It's in those experiences that you have to do some inner thinking and differentiate between actual dysphoria and more dysmorphia. If you'd like to discuss more, I have a bachelor's in psychology and may be able to help you a little more personally. I tend to have a better understanding of these things haha
It depends on the person as it is unique to them. For me, every time I look at myself and don’t see a beautiful woman I shut down. I hate things such as facial hair, my chin, strawberry skin on my thighs, my waist, and my hip dips. Sometimes I just get mad over how fucked I think my face looks. Even when I pick out clothes, or go out and don’t feel like me, I get uncomfortable. Thats mainly what it is, uncomfort. If anything makes you feel uncomfortable or invalidated, thats dysphoria.
Im boyspike, so it's kinda weird, but my dysphoria comes in flashes, not often, but when it does happen, it's honestly immobilizing.
I felt this, especially when you said that it feels fake or not valid because you don't have it 24/7. I actually don't have dysphoria (more like, there's a 1, 2% chance of me having it every couple months.) I'm just really confident in who/what i am so much that i don't really see myself as anything else, if that makes sense?
That sounds real similar to my experience as a transman, n I wish you the best!

Some points for comfort though, remember that you do not need dysphoria to be trans! There are many trans people who don’t experience any dysphoria at all, and are very valid! Soo simply not having much dysphoria one day doesn’t have to be an indicator that you’re any less your trans identity!
I def get some variance. I'm non-binary (maybe demi-boy?). I sort of tilt along agender, androgynous, trans-masc. I think it's worse on days I'm misgendered and when people don't use my chosen name. Like my body starts to carry that weight 

With this, it is hard for me to figure out if I want to medically transition. Like, I THINK i might be happier as a feminine man, but...I don't know. I'm mostly fine? And medical transition is a big commitment. Might try some he/him and see how things go. I am also very confused

Also, obligatory reminder that dysphoria isn't required to make you trans
Deborah: Our system is girlflux and cassflux (cassgender is not feeling like your gender is important to your identity with Cassflux being that but fluxuating), so we don't know if that's normal for those that aren't cassflux but it certainly seems to be normal for us. Besides gender euphoria is a much better indication of transness.
right? they do seem to last longer and longer. the one I'm stuck in currently has been going on for such a time now.  
And yeah, it really is 'I don't care/ I don't acknowledge it' to 'dysphoria' and it's such a confusing trip.

I'm glad I'm not alone though, thank you
yeah, for years I was just agender cause I dissociated too much from my appearance and gender in general. But now that I'm exploring it, I definitely fall more towards transmasc. I might be genderfaun too who knows,, I did not know about that term! I am never really 'fine' in being in my body, it's just something I need to learn to love, I don't even know how to be a girl, if that makes sense, so its just confusing!
Same here i started losing my hair towards the back where my cowlick is and its given me so much dysphoria over the years but luckily i started finasteride and hrt so im being very hopeful that it will get better. I found a hair product called toppik that is a powder that puts what looks like hair fibers on your head that works to cover up spots like this and its helped alot to calm me down. My next thing to fix is my beard shadow that really gives me intense dysphoria.
I think it's depersonalization, or at least partial depersonalization.

And yeah, it coming it waves is super normal. Sometimes it might even be dissociation from your feelings as dissociation and depersonalization feel pretty alright, but they are pretty much responses by your brain to keep you safe from it becoming too much to handle.
oh yeah that feels true to me too, how are you after the initial euphoria? I end up seeing all the flaws and feel like an imposter or someone trying too hard so it's mixed for me, there's this big euphoria with newer clothes but ones I'm used to can get me pretty dysphoric,   
if it's alright for you to share ofc! no pressure
thank you ,it def helps a lot to know it's normal. I did also made some similar stuff so I feel you 100%
you're so right, thank you so so much for the kind words, they help a lot
yeah now that I'm more accepting the fact that I'm trans my body and confidence issues are more a subject that needs to be addressed rather than pushed to the side ( I do tend to just, dissociate from it all and try to live day by day but that's not sustainable) so I get that motivation too! thank you
thank you, I'm glad to know it's not uncommon!
thank you, it's very nice to know it's not and uncommon feeling. and thank you! you're also super valid!
ooo that depression similarity is very good, you're very right,,   
It makes questioning so hard you're so right, thank you for your words, im glad your dysphoria is a lot less than it was!
haha yes it does hit hard when you see people with your desired body type, I almost had a breakdown at work when I saw a customer walk in one time cause of that, we just gotta say we are good and pretty!
oh no I'm so sorry to hear that ;; I do have some similar experiences, where I think I'm good wearing something, feeling masculine and all, goes outside and after an hour I'm freaking out
yeah I'm in the process of finding a good psychologist for this! thank you!
I also have this big disconnection most of the time, it's such a weird feeling, like, you're alive but the body you  control is not yours? if that makes sense
thank you so so much ;o; I hope you'll be able to find your true self too!
thank you, that's a thing I need to remember!  
I think I have body dysphoria and dysmorphia or smth like that? I'm not sure if these are the same thing but,, when I'm not feeling like 'it's not masculine enough' I have 'I'm too fat and awful' so it's a weird thing to live. I do have some parts I'm ok with, so I try to stick with those
aww gosh, I'm sure you're prettier than you think! you are very good and valid, best of luck to you in your journey
very true, I do remember the first time I cut my hair short, and the first time I wore a binder, both were such euphoric moments, both of them help me through my questioning. thank you, it's nice to know I'm not alone in this fluctuation and questioning, it helps!
thank you so much, it does help a lot, knowing it's alright to feel how I feel is a huge thing.
the sledgehammer part is so true lol, it did make me laugh thank you,  and thank you so much, I do need to trust myself more!
yeah I am very confused trying to know which one is which, I do struggle a lot with my body in general, finding myself way too fat and not at all how I want to look, so it's like a ball of spaghetti where I'm trying to untie the knots. I do plan on seeing a psychologist specialized in sexualities and genders to help me get through it, what would you say the main difference is? if it's alright with you explaining them a bit more? thank you so much for the offer
you're right, it's really uncomfortable and hard to live with, I hope it'll get better for you in the near future, you deserve as much joy as anyone else, you're very valid
it makes sense yeah! I do have a lot of confidence issues, so those probably don't help at all with all of this, I hope one day to be real confident and not care about what others think! slowly getting there xd
thank you so much for this kind response, I think I needed to hear that, wishing you the best as well!
I honestly went for Agender for so long, now I'm really, so confused and I might just be transmasc or angrogynous, or something along those lines.  
I have the same fear for the medical transition, commitment is a scary thing for me and this is a BIG commitment but, will I be happier with this?? instead of just, living in dissociation and dysphoria. thank you so much for the words, it helps a ton. I hope it'll clear up for you as well!
I should try to concentrate more on euphoria then,, see how it goes? I don't really know the term cassflux and girlflux
Last month I was convinced I was trans and had started going through the acceptance phase. And now this week I’m not sure again. My solution though - I’m looking for a therapist!

I wish I could offer you more advise but what you’re doing is a good start. I’ve found this sub to be good for those ‘does anyone else’ type questions so keep asking. You’re not alone.
Thanks for the suggestion, I'm definitely going to look into that Toppik stuff! The hair stuff is what finally pushed me over the edge to acknowledge myself and begin transitioning, so I really do appreciate it!

Unfortunately, estrogen can only stop male pattern baldness and is unable to restore lost hair. The ultimate solution is to get a hair transplant, for which I got quoted around USD 13k. Ouch!

Mini rant: some people have said they managed to get most of their transition medicine and surgeries covered, but everybody who manages that seems to play coy about it. Some FFS procedures include an honest-to-goodness transplant, so if we could get coverage for FFS we could get coverage for a hair transplant, too. What gives, ladies, spill the beans! D:
I see yeah, I'm gonna keep this in mind for when I find a good psychologist, I'm sure it'll help!  
thank you sm!
No problem. I get euphoria when I firstly put my stuff on, and after that I can’t really describe how I feel other than “normal”. When I present fem, I feel like I’m more me I guess, so I don’t tend to try and nitpick myself. I used to be hyper critical of myself and I spent a lot of time correcting that thought pattern, so instead of “oh I missed a patch of hair when I shaved my face. I can’t even be me right.” I’ve forced my thought process into “oh I missed a patch of hair when I shaved my face? I need to take a little more time and make sure I get that next time I shave.”

I’ve found that a LOT of the self-respect and self-love work I’ve put into myself over the years really helped with the dysphoria. I’m at a point where people misgendering me doesn’t bother me anymore. I am being me and if someone 1)wants to purposely misgender me, I don’t really care what they think about me or 2)accidentally misgenders me, well it was an accident so I’m not gonna let that affect me negatively.

I’m 100% okay with talking about whatever, so if you want to talk more feel free to keep replying here or DM me.
Yes, we gotta say we're the prettiest
Yeah that’s kind of it, it’s more just, actually yeah that’s pretty much the best way to describe it
Thanks 😊
For that specific example, it's what you feel when you see yourself in the mirror. Do you see yourself as ""I'm fat. I have fat rolls and really wish I lost weight and were skinnier"" or more of a ""I wish my fat roll was gone so I can be more curvy"". Sometimes it can be one or the other, sometimes it can be a little of both. It depends on you. I've wanted to lose weight since forever, but since my transition I've added motivations of getting curves to my concerns when I look at myself

When thinking of your concerns or worries, think of it as a ""is this a normal thing for anyone in general, or is this more me wanting to appear with different features""
Thanks for the kind words
I'm glad it helped. If I get the courage, I hope to hit up a trans masc support to group to at least explore whatever I might be. I've also heard other people's gender shift over time, maybe it's that? Who knows. Either way, I hope things clear up for you, too!
Girlflux, aka femmeflux, is gender that fluxuates between something woman aligned often binary woman and agender, Cassflux is cassgender (a xenogender label for feeling like gender your sense of gender isn't an important part of who you are) except it fluxuates involuntarily. So for us we run the gambit of being agender and still wanting to present hyper feminine (if of course that's what the alter on front is into because system), being agender and like using it/its pronouns because we desperately don't want the gendering, being Binary femme and not caring how our presentation is read, to being binary femme and just absolutely hating our body.
it does help a lot, making a throwaway account to ask these question is such a good decision on my part, I'm glad I did it (I'm closeted and don't want to use my real account) thank you so much!!  
I am also looking for a good therapist for help, its a journey I should've started way earlier to find my true self, but I'm glad it's moving now. I hope you'll find yourself!
gosh you're very right for that, I'm very hard on myself and it's been a struggle to change my thought patterns, but I know I'll be better once I accept how I am and who I am. I will keep that positive attitude for people misgendering me, I'm sure it'll help. I suppose instead of finding the flaws I can find the good things, Like today I wore a hoodie that was quite masc, and while it was a bit tight for me I did feel good form time to time in it, I'll celebrate that little victory!  
thank you so much for the offer, I'm a very anxious person so I probably won't dm, but just knowing the offer is there is very kind of you! and thank you for elaborating, it's very helpful!
 I see, well  it's probably this one '""I'm fat. I have fat rolls and really wish I lost weight and were skinnier"" more for like, its way more androgynous and doesn't have all those curves..  so yeah I think it's more, me wanting to have different features, there is also some mix of wanting to lose weight cause I just see myself as fat ( I mean I am but many people say I'm not, I guess overweight is more the term ( I'm 6ft and around 200pounds to give an idea))
Just remember to be kind to yourself, and you do deserve love and respect. Most importantly, you deserve love and respect from yourself. Take care friend.
I'm 5'10 and 200. I'm not fat, but I have a huge muffin top that I hate, especially since it ruins any curves I might have. Who knows. If you lose the weight, you may have those extra feelings of wanting more curves
thank you, I think I needed to hear that, and ofc! take care as well!
who knows! losing weight its such a journey on its own, I hope it'll help me down the road!  
thank you for your help!
Oml don't I know it. I have a gift where I can eat and eat and I don't put on a lot of weight. But it's also a curse, because I can workout and workout and eat less and healthier, and I won't lose it either.

Of course! If you ever need any advice or anything just hmu
ahaha yeah it's not easy! I'm on the same boat xd"	uby8ts	trans	260	0.98	2022-04-25 23:10:22
I have felt the best and worst since becoming trans	"I am not sure if other people relate to this, but realising I am trans made my life a lot better and worse at the same time. Thinking about change, feminisation, clothes, hormones, voice training and all of that make me extremely excited. Especially trying out things and planning what I can do makes me happy. To that, I feel a lot more confident, comfortable and happy socialising. I feel more comfortable with myself and my personality. Everything seems a bit better with the possible change and future.

Still, my mental stability has suffered a lot through the constant pressure of my mother and other things. So, I am just often trying to somehow manage my mother and make her stop using my dead name and being toxic. Since despite her not stopping me, she still is far from helping me and makes a lot of things harder, more exhausting and generally worse. To that, my dysphoria got a lot worse since I noticed what I didn't like aka. my biological gender and what made me often uncomfortable in the past but only noticed now.

So now, I am constantly switching between very happy, gender-dysphoric, stressed, pressured, excited and everything in between."	"I feel you. I feel much happier and put together on my hormones. But the anxiety my parents give me is crushing me.
All I can tell you is that you don't need permission from women to be one. It is why ftm trans also struggle with being masculine. Try to remove your programmed desire for approval from women (specifically your mother) and you will find more freedom and less concern. You aren't alone.
Oof, I feel this on every level...

I look forward to the day where I can reflect on this version of me with kindness and love, and let me know that things will work out and that we will be okay.
The thing that you told about you mother is actually a mental abuse. If somebody drops a small amount of poison to you food, not enough to kill you but enough for you to not feel well - it is abuse, even if it is unconscious. Try to talk to your mother about that she may not realize that by herself.

If all the words you hear only gaslighting your mind - it is abuse! 

It is a reason why I haven’t been told my mother yet (and I am not teen for more than decade and live my life for years separately).

And yes - my life becomes much more happier and easy and much much more harder and depressing at the same time! 

The only thing I know for sure - I will be more happy as a “sad girl” than a “sad boy”! 

Wish you luck and all the best. 

P.S. there are a lot of buzz about youtube channel “philosophical tube” and you should definitely check it out.  There are several interesting videos out there, also a dedicated to abuse and also about trans coming out. Highly recommend- it made my life as trans a bit better!
god same, since coming to terms with my identity i constantly switch between happy and excited and like, drop dead exhausted.
Thank you for sharing. I'm sure all of us are going thru ie have gone thru similar issues.  I, like you just read and comment on others posts but it helps soo much to see so many beautiful lady's posting the same things I deal with.  I am looking for a website to order hormones from since the fake estrogen I've been taking isn't doing anything.
The first thing I'd recommend is to start looking for somewhere to move to. From my own personal experience, living with toxic parents is a hell in itself.
Unfortunately some people who see that being Trans. Is a movement - wether it is or is not at all, May relate it to mens rights movements as anti circumcision/frenectomy and as a challenge to the medical and pharmaceutical and many other industries or organizations that profit massively from the act and resources from foreskin (skin grafts,luxury face cremes, training, reduction in required distribution of educational resources for care of the male prepuce, lowered rates of divorce,ptsd etc, etc it unfortunately produces (in the case of unconcented instances); 

Furthermore it has been conceptualized that people ""assigned"" male at birth who transition to female etc may challenge the role/expectations of natal women... It is also an increase in competition for natal women aswell as a reduction in resources for the primarily male occupied work industries ie:Skilled Trades etc...

I digress....
Maybe that's why I gained weight and my emotions are all over the place.
I sadly don't have hormones :C but yush, I understand that and I hope it works out. Eventually, there will be a solution, just it might be hard or not so nice, especially if it means separating or trying to avoid certain people.
I know and I am happy being me, just my mother is just concerning and hard on me since it's just annoying to deal with that almost every day
I hope it just gets better, but I somehow know it will, just there is still a lot in the way and a lot to go through
It might be, but it's just hard since I am unsure and it's more complicated than just her being bad since she also tries in a way, but it's not working and she still keeps on with her opinion. Still, I am looking for a therapist and that I can talk with them and my mother about it to maybe make her realise some things. And thank you :3 I will look into that youtube channel if I find time since currently, I have college classes
I feel the exhaustion. I need some vacation from being at home
Oh, I would really not recommend hormones online, since hormone therapy can cause serious side effects if not done properly under medical observation and correct medicine."	njwvt5	trans	262	1.0	2021-05-24 12:32:21

I kind of stole it from the person who stopped me from >!committing suicide !<in 2020.  After she helped me to get help, I felt obligated to offer her my affection, and she ended up using my affection to manipulate me. As a form of petty revenge, I stole her name...
