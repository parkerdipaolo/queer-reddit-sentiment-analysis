Has anyone here experienced Broken Arm Syndrome with your healthcare?		"Yepppp.. dislocated my shoulder. Doc tried telling me my shoulder was weakened due to lack of muscle because of HRT‚Ä¶. Doc, I‚Äôm 215lbs and in the gym 2-3 days a week lifting. I promise you there‚Äôs muscle on my shoulder..
Literally today: went in to SIGN A DOCUMENT, doctor ended up doing a battery of tests on me. I asked why, they said ""oh, just in case"". In case of what, that your signature gives me a disease?
Not healthcare, just my parents, very quick to diagnose everything as a side effect of hormones. Tired, hormones, headache, hormones, stub your toe, hormones, make a stinker in the toilet, hormones.
This has definitely happened to me. A good while ago, before I had changed of any of my legal information, I was well into hormone therapy and presenting very clearly as male but my drivers license still said female. I was camping with my family in a rural area and was not careful enough with the hatchet I was using to cut firewood. I cut straight through the tip of my finger, cutting it clean off. Hand wounds bleed a lot. There are a ton of blood vessels and nerves in the fingers so I was bleeding all over the place and I was in a ton of pain. It took us half an hour to get from the campsite to the tiny little hospital that served the entire county. Upon entering the ER I calmly showed them my hand, explained what happened, and passed over my driver's license so they could put my info in their system. I think the person I was dealing with had never seen or met a trans person before. It was like she didn't know that we could exist. She looked at my drivers license and said, ""This isn't you."" She proceeded to argue with me about how I was clearly giving her a fake ID and I clearly thought she was an idiot because I clearly was not a woman. I appreciated her recognizing that I am not a woman, and I told her so, and politely pointed out that I was still bleeding and in need of medical attention. I don't have any idea exactly how much blood I lost but I completely bled through the T-shirt that we had wrapped around my hand. It was completely soaked in red and dripping onto the hospital floor. She carried on for about half an hour about how unprecedented the whole situation was before she managed to get me checked in. She later apologized and mumbled something about them having problems with ""foreign scammers"" trying to get free healthcare and I have an accent so she thought I might be one of them. (I could not resist the opportunity to point out that in the country where I got my accent, we had free healthcare until Americans toppled our democracy in a shadow-coup.) I am very thankful that it was just one finger, because I think this woman would have let me bleed to death in the waiting room to accommodate her own ignorance.
Damm so how soon after starting hrt does your arm fall off? And is it possible to get a new one in a secondhand shop? üòÇ
It's famous for a reason... I know a friend of mine goes to a Planned Parenthood where they have a referral list of doctors who are good to go to. After that it's just whether it's just in-network or not.
That's when you report the doctor to their professional society. Ignorance of this level is either incompetence or malice, and neither can be tolerated in a practicing medical professional. You should also ask them to put this on your chart, so that they have to record their stupidity for a permanent record.
I have bipolar disorder. It got way worse during the time my diagnosis got delayed by a year because my psychiatrist blamed everything on my bottom surgery‚Äîeven though I'd clearly had symptoms (and told her about them) well before. I honestly believe I'd have never had psychotic symptoms if I'd have just gotten treatment when I needed it.

Fuck transphobic doctors.
Similar issue I complained of severe pain, constant stomach issue and pain for 9 years before I had a doctor take me seriously to find out I have a severe case of endometriosis üò™
Only with one doctor in a fairly conservative area. She wanted me to quit T because of my blood pressure which is controlled with the lowest dose of meds available. My doctor and most others I‚Äôve encountered are all really supportive of the trans community and advocate for better care. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky.
I had this once when I came in for pelvic inflammation. They asked some reason pointed questions asking me if I was was injecting heroin. I said no and they kept pushing me not believing me, implying me being on T means I am a druggie. I don't even inject and if I did, that doesn't mean I'd go from a reconstructive substance to a deadly substance like wtf.
Yes, I was having a lot of stomach problems and gastro said it was because of HRT. Turned out to be lactose intolerance.
I have had a lot of people really confused why I take estrogen but not much bad blood really luckily.
The experience for pretty much anyone going to the doctor who isn't a cishet white man!

*""Well, I see you are* ***\[X marginalized identity\]?*** *So everything you say will take a back seat to my 1940s-esque stereotyping of you and why whatever this is is entirely the fault of that.""*

Cause you know, only cishet white men get sick or injured. Anyone else is just complaining about their self-imposed sufferingü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/s
I got a psychiatric evaluation a few months ago and the psychiatrist was asking me questions related to me being trans but instead of trying to understand how the incongruence between my gender identity and AGAB or biological sex would cause me issues and make me feel bad she was trying to understand how my transition would bring me these issues. In other words, instead of trying to understand my gender dysphoria she was trying to get evidence that it actually was my transition that was the problem. I quickly noticed this pattern and that all her questions went into this direction and started complaining because I didn't like what her choice of questions was implying about what she was looking for. I had to make it clear, a second time, that my transition was making me feel better, not the other way around, and that it's my dysphoria that was what made me feel unhappy regarding my gender identity.

This was totally a case of broken arm syndrome because I went for the evaluation for issues related to anxiety, depression and adhd but her first reflex was to try get evidence that my transition was the cause. At the time, I was primarily worried about symptoms related to ADHD because they were causing the most trouble and had already been diagnosed with gender dysphoria by another health professional more qualified than her to do this. I wasn't there to evaluate my gender dysphoria and that was something that I made clear when we started the interview.

A few other health professionals also tried to imply here and there that my transition or HRT could be the source of the issues I was discussing with them. One time I complained to a laser hair removal technician that the treatment had not been as effective as anticipated and she replied that maybe it was the HRT that was causing laser to be less effective. Yeah, sure, because blocking testosterone and taking estradiol will make me grow a beard and a mustache back. Gosh... They're sometimes so desperate to find excuses to make transition and HRT the scapegoat for everything that make up BS like this.
Similar things for being obese. ""Have you tried not being fat?""
Yep. Fucked up my whole life and transition. 

I started HRT at 16. I hadn't gone thru a lot of male puberty and felt incredibly fortunate. I was on hormones for over a year and a half and I passed really well. Then, I went thru a bad breakup, ended up in the hospital for mental health, got put on antidepressants that turned me into a zombie and they tried pressuring me to come off my HRT. Eventually they got me off cyproterone and I was on E monotherapy. After a while of my mood not improving, I was taken off HRT altogether with the zombifying SNRI upped yet again. Been over a year since I've had HRT. Male puberty hit me like a sledgehammer and passing is all but a distant memory. I can't even make my voice pass anymore. I got diagnosed with ADHD, I know my depression stems from my lack of proficiency regarding executive functioning, yet because of broken arm syndrome, it must be because of the HRT, even tho I haven't been on it in a year. 

Can someone just take me out with a semitruck already?
I'm not transitioning yet. And i remember when i tried to tell my psychiatrist about my depression caused by my gender dysphoria he was saying ""no, you're girl. Your PTSD is making you think you're a boy"" fck this
It's called medical gasligting 

Some er nurse told me that my colitis is caused by hormone replacement therapy. 

I still haven't figured out what's causing it, most likely a chronic infection, but the American medical system is a joke.

They are liars and murderers.

I have been undiagnosed for almost 2 years now. Disgusting.
Something like that. I'm FTM, and before I started T last spring, I had been diagnosed with PCOS, but, obviously, I never did anything about it because I LIKED the side effects (facial hair, loss of menstruation, etc.). However, I did suffer from seriously intense cystic acne. I went to a dermatologist about it and she told me that the only way that she could cure it was for her to put me on estrogen. I freaked out, explained to her that I was an FTM trans man and was uncomfortable enough with the amount of estrogen my body was making and it would be very emotionally damaging for me to add more to it. She then told me that there was nothing she could do for me: either I went on estrogen or continued to have acne. I chose to keep the acne... Now my face is all scarred up, but at least my appearance matches my gender.
Had a weird rash on my ankle and made the mistake of telling the walk in clinic I'm a trans man.

They immediately concluded that my testosterone prescription was causing my leg rash and I had to stop it immediately.

It wasn't my fucking testosterone. It was athletes foot.
I had a doctor bring up something about stopping my HRT one time. I told them that if the choice is between transition and death, I'll just die. 

They never brought it up again
I had a dentist continously stab my fucking gums with a hook, and I told her to stop she said she ""wasn't"" and that my gums were ""Made too sensitive because of the estrogen""  


She was fired for harassing patients.
Request from office for not just your records but their documentation of your records. The doctor will have to sign it over to you but you have the right to it. Some get uncomfortable with the idea of someone using their lack or professional documentation against them. 34 amab, never been even asked about a prostate exam in my life. Kinda wondering how they filed that info to my insurance company.
Yes I got my nipple infected because of a bad razor and she said I have to stop hrt immediately, lmao. See another told it was just a ¬¥ normal infection ¬¥ ‚Ä¶.
My former cardiologist tried to tell me that my dizziness, chronic fatigue, and migraines were probably caused by my testosterone gel. He said it again even after I told him that I‚Äôve been having migraines since elementary school, the chronic fatigue started in high school, and the dizziness started a couple years ago (at the time  I went to that appointment I was less than 1 month on T). He also referred to me being trans as ‚Äúsexual problems‚Äù
YES. my depression diagnosis is being super delayed and pushed back because they can't prove it's not as a result of hrt despite it having been an issue since way before I started
Is this more common for transfem people? It seems like something a transphobe might try to use as an excuse for what trans women need testosterone (and yet cis women's arms aren't falling off from their lack of male-level T, I wonder how that's possible ü§™). 

I've personally never experienced this, but I do hear a lot about people having bad experiences in healthcare. I have had some of my own, but not like this. Just doctors being ignorant. Especially in the ER or walk-in clinic.
Post transitus ergo propter transitus.
Can someone explain this a little more to me I don't understand the joke
This reminds me of when my mom had to go to the hospital after her arm broke. They never gave her the clear diagnosis of broken arm, they only told her they wouldn't give her pain meds. She was drinking when she fell, but that's not the point. She kept asking: ""Is it broken?"" and they kept replying ""You're not getting painkillers."".
Nor related to being trans but this is what dealing with any mental health ""professional"" is like.
Oh my god. When I first started T, I let my doctor know, because obviously it was a new medication. First he's all, well, I don't know anything about trans issues, all defensively. I told him he doesn't need to because I'm seeing a different doctor for that, I'm just letting him know I'm on T. Then he asks how I'm taking it and he *flips out* when he found out it was self injection. Tells me it's way too dangerous for patients to inject their own meds (apparently he's never heard of insulin before) and threatens to get my other doctor's license removed. I'm like, you just told me you know nothing about trans healthcare and now suddenly you're expert?

Anyway, obviously I got annoyed with him, and he tells me the testosterone I'm taking clearly is making me irritable. I'm like ""I'm irritable because you're being an asshole!"" I asked the reception to get me a new doctor after that. He had always been an asshole anyway. No matter what I came in with, he said it was my weight, and he also made inappropriate comments about my employment status. So fuck that guy. 

(Also the irony there is my father also saw that doctor and that doctor had no problem prescribing my father the exact same T in the exact same dosage for my dad's low T. So apparently injecting hormones is perfectly safe as long as it's a cis person doing it)
Not yet but maybe it‚Äôs bc I work in healthcare so they know I wouldn‚Äôt put up with that shit
I have with my weight and I am before transition. There is a part of me that is afraid to even pursue it here since I am afraid I will be trapping me in a none ending stream of medical problems stemming from bad care.
I showed up to the ER with severe testicular pain.

Once they ruled out testicular torsion, I was asked, pointedly and repeatedly, about ""what outcome"" I was looking for.

""My testicle to stop hurting.""

They seemed to think I was trying to sneak in an orchiectomy under the radar or something. Or maybe they figured I was faking to get pain meds. Whatever the case, it was pretty clear they didn't believe me.
I just dont tell em im trans unless its relevant to the issue. Im legally labeled as my correct gender and thats what the doctors see
Yes, I've definitely dealt with this. It's gotten to the point that I have to go in figuratively armed for bear to keep them from attributing my symptoms to my HRT.
Those pesky hormones cause so many problems!
I'm assuming the original was about weight?
Not HRT specific as I haven't started, but I have gotten similar things about my weight. Had really bad eczemas and went to my general doctor and she put it all on my weight when they had literally nothing to do with weight.
I always thought I was the dumb one. I went for an allergy test and I got redness on my skin and all the symptoms. He didn‚Äôt let me get one. So I asked some things like I feel warm all the time, my nose is stuffed, I have allergic reactions. It‚Äôs because you are fat. I am a bodybuilder, with some fat but not really fat. Kinda hurt me that my allergy wasn‚Äôt taken seriously.

Edit: when I told him my weight, he told me fat and that I should be 60kg on my length. I think it is somewhere like 150lbs. I am 90kg‚Äôs
I've had the opposite experience, and I hate that it feels like bragging to say that.
This is exactly why I‚Äôve been terrified of going to the doctor (even tho I really need something checked)
A transwoman trying to see a doctor in the Bible Belt.
If any doctor ever tries to do this, simply remind them who they work for and that you can find another doctor I'm a heartbeat.
This is why I just don't go to the doctors anymore
Yes, you see, people have just started popping apart like legos.
Not trans related *(Though I'm sure I'll get some in the future, ugh)* 

I remember having a doctor trying to pin the symptoms of a bad respiratory disease on my social anxiety diagnosis. I confronted them about this, to which they acted as if I was stepping out of line. Ugh.
I seem to be in the small majority who have received above and beyond healthcare. I‚Äôm pretty recluse and don‚Äôt leave a lot but when I‚Äôve gone to the hospital, they always ask about my pronouns. One time, a nurse asked about a pregnancy test which made me giggle but other than that it‚Äôs been great. 

This is at a hospital that when asked about HRT oversight, they replied with ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that kind of thing here‚Äù

Everyone else there is fantastic. Especially the nurses :)
There are 2 kinds of Dr.s... this isn't the one I want.
I‚Äôm not trans but I always get bs like this in our health care system. I‚Äôll tell them what‚Äôs going on and they want to make sure it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm depressed or anxious. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, my heart rate being through the roof isn‚Äôt anxiety I have a heart condition. Now can we focus on getting it back down so I don‚Äôt pass out?‚Äù

I wish doctors would learn to keep their biases out of their work. Because it seems like it‚Äôs all it is. They don‚Äôt think people should transition therefore they look for any problem they can to be that ‚ÄòAha‚Äô evidence for them on why it‚Äôs bad. Even if they don‚Äôt do this consciously it‚Äôs still super messed up.
Yes, but because of my weight
weirdly, no? despite having lots of medical issues. the only things blamed on hormones were actual hormonal issues. i've been on T long enough that it's almost ignored by everyone (except for the doctor that prescribes my hormones) because it's not that important to anything.

i'm not excited about what might happen when i get top surgery though...

also, same with mental illness and neurodivergence? idk i must just have good doctors....

also sometimes if i have to go to a random gp (not my normal one) and they want to know my meds i'll leave the T off the list. if i have a sore ankle, it's not relevant.
Yeah, this bothers me. I just got Cigna health insurance and I am currently trying to find a PCP who is not a transphobe in Dallas TX. I guess we will see how it goes...
Saving for later this is gold
Quite the opposite, as soon as I started HRT I had a bunch of symptoms and the dr was like ‚Äúoh no way it‚Äôs the hormones, you‚Äôre fine and we‚Äôll run more tests‚Äù
Don't you just hate it when you wake up in the morning and your arm had fallen off. It sucks. Luckily I just put on a new one. Being a manakin is great! \^\^
Something similar keeps happening to me since I became a vegetarian.
oof that's rough... i haven't experienced anything like this, me and my doctor get a long well. the entire clinic i go to is great ü•∞
I always found doctors to be entirely uncooperative long before I even knew i was trans. I eventually just stopped going to the doctors, the only reason I started back up again was to get HRT. For most medical needs you don't need those overpriced buffoons anyways, I performed 3 minor surgeries on myself, and fixed my dislocated arm once.
A year ago I was taking a bit of cough medicine along with pain relief. Then one day my gut wrenched and cause me massive pain. I didn't know what caused it and had scans, change in diet and finally they concluded that I had non alcoholic fatty liver disease. The cause was high glucose in my diet but most of all my cold medicine had glucose. 

They want to eliminate and test what causes you to be sick and sometimes medication, especially hormones, are effecting you. They usually ask you to take an alternative to see if it's better. Like most medications there are more than just one type that you can take to treat your illness. Hormones are a medication
Yes, but also i want to point out that this is a comic that was originally about medical discrimination for being fat, and it has been edited to be about being trans here. Tbh it‚Äôs frustrating to see this topic coopted in this way, especially because fat trans people face far more medical discrimination for our body size than other trans people do, including complete denials of hrt and surgeries and dangerously botched procedures. 

Erasure of fatphobia awareness and of fat bodies is a major problem in the trans and queer communities that harms and kills us and honestly, i really don‚Äôt appreciate the message of this comic being LITERALLY erased. It‚Äôs not a meme image, and there are plenty of images out there which are and could have been used to illustrate this point.
I don't understand
The first doctor I talked to about HRT put the reason for the visit down as depression.
Forgive my ignorance here, my only experience with healthcare is through the VA. Does this actually happen?? My doctor is the one who prescribed me HRT and wouldn't ever suggest that it would be a problem or the cause of some other ailment.
Reading some of these comments makes me realize how fortunate I am that the Milwaukee VA is taking such good care of me
Not exactly, I haven't had any problems since HRT but this one when I first experienced Vertigo I got left with ""I honestly don't not what's wrong with you."". That doctor just walked away and nobody else said anything to me so I just left. The next day my coworker diagnosed me with Vertigo and she was correct.  

Since HRT I have only seen my trans care doctor and we just have quick chats about how life is going and such. Idk if ""trans care"" is correct, but that's all I see her for and she kinda specializes in it as far as I know.
Not trans, but fat. 

Have reported a fall and hitting sternum on blacktop and gotten evaluated for a heart attack
There's a typo in the added caption
I got asked the other day if I thought my chronic pain could be because of my HRT. I‚Äôve had chronic pain for over five years and have been on HRT for about a year now. I can assure you, it‚Äôs not my HRT it‚Äôs my chest and my shitty body lmao
I had this from some generalised health problems... Doctor made me stop hrt, nothing changed so I changed diet and sleeping patterns and suddenly health. Went back to GP and they decided that we never had the conversation so I needed a new prescription from shrink... Due to some financial issues I lost about a decade.

Super fun. :(
Yaappp  
  
literally.  LITERALLY. **LITERALLY** broke my back and got Trans'ed‚Ñ¢ more times than I can count trying to get treatment from doctors and surgeons in multiple states.  
  
not everything is because trans assfaces...
Yep happened to me.

Eventually stopped telling my endo any problem no matter how small
Remind me this https://youtu.be/tTYL9xkeDfs
Shoot. Didn‚Äôt know this could happen, or can it. I‚Äôve been on HRT for maybe 12 years now.  But the past few I‚Äôve been really forgetful with my shots. I‚Äôm a cis gender male that is still male, I just have klinefelters syndrome and am supposed to take a shot of testosterone every 2 weeks. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass literally and the main reason I don‚Äôt want to take it, is I‚Äôd rather have a low sex drive. I‚Äôm single and not really interested in dating. I never liked meaningless sex, I don‚Äôt really like sex apart from oral, but lately I‚Äôve felt more asexual than anything. Thus having a low sex drive would be ideal. I also have have fibromyalgia so I‚Äôm in pain all the time.  Maybe I‚Äôd have less pain if I kept up with the HRT.
I‚Äôm experiencing this right now. I want to get off of anti depressants and my psychiatrist is worried about how hrt is affecting my mood and I just got top surgery and she wants me to stay on my meds ‚Äúto wait and see if hormones are going to affect my mood‚Äù even though I‚Äôve been stable üôÑ
My eye doctor did this when it was found that I have hypertension against my optic nerves that was causing migraines. The hypertension was caused by excess CSF. I got the impression that she didn‚Äôt understand HRT very well and just made a random uneducated assumption because the cause of this specific thing I have going on isn‚Äôt actually known. But, yknow, it‚Äôs apparently a thing that primarily affects AFAB people and we all know how the medical world is about studying and treating things that affect ‚Äúwomen‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
‚ÄúPlease discontinue all HRT for 6 MONTHS prior to your gender-affirming surgery‚Äù even though research shows there is no evidence of this precaution being necessary ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
not yet but i‚Äôm trying to take some pretty big steps medically soon,, i‚Äôm trying to get top surgery in the summer and i‚Äôm already tired of medical bullshit, i haven‚Äôt made a decision on hormones but i do not look forward to doctors being like that about it
All the fucking reason, sad but real
not on hrt yet but yes i have experienced this
Omg, yes. Thankfully the incident was a mild one, and didn't block me from getting proper care. I had a urinary tract infection associated with (polycystic) kidney disease.

 ""Maybe If you stop taking those hormones you wouldn't get sick"" ‚Äî ER nurse. 

I let myself laugh at the absurdity of what she had said, and I replied something like ""no, they're not related. I've had PKD, and chronic UTIs from pkd, for decades before I ever started taking HRT"", and that was the end of that. 

At least it was just the one nurse who saw me in the ER to take vitals & blood draws (and thankfully was gentle with the needle, even after that above exchange). And the other staff in the hospital who took over my care after admission were much more respectful.
[deleted]
I didn‚Äôt know that was a symptom of taking HRT, I‚Äôll be sure to be gentle with my girlfriend when she goes on it.
You don't know more than the doctor...promise.
6.9k Nice üëå
A second opinion is always worth it. Urgent care told me I had a grade 1 separated shoulder. Went to my own doctor a week later and she freaked out, it was a grade 4 and almost qualified for surgery.
doesnt it actually make your bones super weak tho

&#x200B;

thats what was in the thingthat my doctor gave me for hrt (i couldnt start it tho since i need both parents consent for some reason :/)
Yes but not with healthcare. With my mom. She has these passive-aggressive transphobic remarks towards me and blames every single problem I have on my HRT. My arm hurts? It‚Äôs the HRT. My vision is getting worse? It‚Äôs the HRT. I have pneumonia? It‚Äôs the HRT. (All true stories)
""Are you sure, doc? Are you sure my dislocated shoulder is because of HRT and not the minivan that ran me over?!""
Also uhh... cis women still have enough upper body muscle to *not usually dislocate their shoulder* like that's obviously not a primary cause.
Even though in such a case it seems plainly obvious, I want to add that _sometimes_ it's very tricky because muscles can start wasting quickly, and especially if you have a history with it or with autoimmune diseases related to that (albeit not required for rapid muscle wasting).

Before taking HRT, a long time ago, I had issues with my upper body and couldn't lift my arms (kind of like a T-Rex but with a bit more mobility). Turns out that being very slim and getting an episode of an autoimmune disease weakened my muscles so quickly that it wasn't noticeable at first sight, but taking tests revealed that the muscle actually was very frail because: it was being reduced, and every small movement that stimulates it or uses it was damaging it without a proper rest. The doctors explained to me that even if the muscle wasn't being attacked by my body but it was still being reduced because of other factors (one of them a side effect of MtF HRT) then the result could have been the same, or worse if I tried to force it.

Now, I know your comment was for cases where it was in plain sight, but I want to inform that there are some instances where you might need to be very careful (especially if the doctors ask you so!), though only few cases would be like this.
Doctor has been learning medicine almost all life

Do u really think that u can discuss his recommendations

If u don't like - try to do a research by yourself, there is a high probability that doctor's recommendationa were right
Wtf ! They get away with this too ?
Your shoulder WOULD be weakened by HRT. Doesn‚Äôt mean that was the primary cause of the dislocation, just a factor that can maje it more likely.
They wanted to charge you
Dont want to get Signituritis do you?
Everyone knows transness is spread by signature
I'm sorry that happened to you. People can and should refuse all tests they don't want to do. My partner spends a lot of time in hospitals with a rare, complex anatomy, and docs sometimes get a gleam in their eyes when looking at my partner, like they're a roast ham or a turkey standing on two legs smh. Doctors deserve scrutiny, too
It is your Basic human right to say no to ANY medical procedure. Medical personel in any decent country has no right to force it upon you.

Edit: By no means I'm saying, that it's your fault if you went through with it tho.
This was my dad even before I even realized and came out as trans. Blamed my mother‚Äôs mental state on hormones, rather than her pretty bad undiagnosed mental illnesses.
For the first six months or so, and occasionally now closing in on a year of HRT, my therapist suggests that symptoms of my mental illness are being caused or exacerbated by HRT.

She always suggests it in a very delicate way and reminds me she ""doesn't know anything about that stuff"" afterwards, so I feel bad getting annoyed by it, but come on. 

I've had all of these symptoms most of my life. They're not new. They predate HRT, and in fact, going on HRT has had an overall positive effect on my mental health. 

I mentioned this to my clinician at Planned Parenthood and she said yeah, it's common for other medical and psych personnel to suggest HRT is causing side effects, but it's actually very unlikely and would be pretty obvious in the bloodwork they do at every checkup.
To be fair, after about a year on E my toots get *pretty* bad once a month or so.
Play endless amounts of video games, they will be unsure of whether to blame it on games or hormones, and will get stuck in an endless loop.
The hormones magnetized you and that's why you got hit by that car
Lol my mom is like this too.

I caught a regular cold, and she was like ""it's probably the hormones.""
Man, your parents should just blame every ailment on video games like normal people.
WOW your story scared me a bit!  Okay need to get my license updated sooner than later.  They have been rolling my license around in their hands trying to figure out if its fake or not lately.  I cant' imagine that happening at the ER outside of my normal duke network >.>
>She later apologized and mumbled something about them having problems with ""foreign scammers"" trying to get free healthcare

Damn those immigrants trying to sneak into US to be thousands in medical bill debt. (/s)

They were just trying to follow this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdyin6uipy4
oooh i‚Äôm honestly more interested now in the history of ur country
Wait so you HAD free healthcare until the American govt secretly dismantled it? If that's true it makes me hate my country even more
Damn foreigners cutting their fingers off to try and get free healthcare.
So, she was transphobic AND racist. Wow.
I lost my arm around the time I got boobs. Sorta like an eye for an eye but more like an arm for a rack
Heh. Second hand.
Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just your new defense mechanism. A new arm will grow back in a few weeks. Maybe you‚Äôll even grow TWO arms where the one fell off like an axolotl
The second hand won‚Äôt be super helpful without the arm too.
Why would you go to a secondhand shop for an arm?
What does in-network mean?
Yea, I've been switching doctors every visit until I find one that isn't either transphobic or has some other kind of deal breaking issue... I've been to 3 doctors and still haven't found one... I think I'm gonna move to Canada üá®üá¶ when I have the chance.
Seconding the fuck transphobic doctors. 

In my state, you'd have been fucked the minute you mentioned any symptoms of BPD. Here the doctors can deny your transition entirely until ""all symptoms of comorbid mental illnesses are totally controlled to verify they aren't causing the gender dysphoria"". Aka, if you have any mental illness you can't transition while experiencing symptoms of that mental illness. If you're BPD and you say ""doc, I feel anxious about the idea of my transition being denied"" they'll say ""your symptoms are not under control right now so you can't start""

Some doctors in this state even take the wording to mean if you have ANY symptom of ANY mental illness at all, you can't transition. 

And you're not allowed to transition or have any trans healthcare whatsoever unless you agree to forced mental health checks too
Same here, reported that I had excruciating pain after eating or drinking ANYTHING, every single time. Was grossly underweight because consuming anything was torture. This went on for 10 years. It was first misdiagnosed as endo, but it turned out to be an extremely rare disease called neurogenic MALS. But it went on for so long that it‚Äôs now untreatable and surgery didn‚Äôt help. If only someone listened
I read the T and immideatly thought of trenbolone lmao
>she was trying to understand how my transition would bring me these issues.

That goes beyond what is described in comic. It would be like blaming scurvy on Vitamin C supplements.
> maybe it was the HRT that was causing laser to be less effective. 


This is a completely real thing, though - fem HRT will not make you lose facial hair, but it will make it finer and lighter, which both affect the effectiveness of laser.
""I did, but until I started transitioning, I genuinely didn't understand why it mattered""
I think that's what the comic was originally about
Being both fat and trans can be awful for this reason.
Oh damn.
I'm honestly at a loss for words, that really sucks.

I sincerely hope that it eventually works out for you.
The real lightbulb moment for me - the one that took me from cracking to *accepting* - was when I realized just how many of my day-to-day choices were textbook avoidance, that I'd so regularly dissociate from the person in the mirror (and had for so long) that it didn't even notice, and how many of my personal quirks were...straight from the DSM for PTSD.

In spite of being a veteran, in spite of being married to a therapist, it never really occurred to me that a bunch of transphobic stuff from my childhood left me with scars.  I'd gotten over it and moved on.  (Which is to say that I got very, very good at pretending.  Except when I got it wrong and would go full fight or flight.)
Jesus this thread is like a horror show of medical malpractice and complete incompetence.

I‚Äôd suggest a completely different dermatologist. Perhaps the people at /r/SkincareAddiction can suggest some actual treatments as estrogen really sounds like an inappropriate suggestion through and through.
Estrogen makes migraines worse. That makes no sense.
It can happen to trans men, too. I know I‚Äôve had things be assumed to be because of testosterone. There‚Äôs also a tendency to discuss testosterone like it will make you violent and dangerous. Though I do think this is probably more common for trans women, due to the transmisogyny you identified
It's not a joke at all. This comic reveals the hate and transphobia that we may experience in healthcare system and, but actually it's a metaphor describing how people think that root of all problems of trans folks is the fact that they are transgenders, moreover, it shows how society reacts when we do things that don't align with cishet norms aka hrt aka living our fucking lives as our true selves
My endo gave me all types of warnings about my vegan diet despite looking at my blood tests and admitting there was nothing wrong with any of my levels. Somehow promising to eat more peanut butter got her off my back.
How did you perform 3 surgeries *on yourself?*
Im terrified but I wanna know more about these surgeries
It‚Äôs a comic about ‚ÄúTrans Broken Arm Syndrome‚Äù, which is the tendency for some doctors to blame any medical ailment on the fact that a person is trans, or on the fact that they‚Äôre on HRT, or anything similar. This includes medical ailments that clearly wouldn‚Äôt be affected by these things, like a broken arm.
I'm happy for you, but regrettably, yes, it does happen. Not always to this extremes obviously, but I wouldn't put them past it. They are fallible humans too, and if they happen to believe the stereotypes of your minority, or just flat out hate your minority group, that impacts how/if they treat you.
Have 2 different doctors. One to prescribe HRT and one who actually practiced medicine
Horseback riding accident‚Ä¶ but close enough lol
Cis women don't have shoulders, don't be silly
Also, an averagly muscular cis-guy friend I have, dislocated his shoulder while OPENING A WINDOW so there's that... :D
Yep, I've had something similar happen as well, it's part of why I put hormones on hold for a bit. 

Hormones cause changes in the body, obviously, it's not that odd that muscle mass would be affected. And if your in a position with problems related to it or have an injury, it can cause complications.
This is where a higher protein diet is important,for the very reason on supporting goid muscle health,and combat the depletion of muscle protiens.
You'll be surprised to learn this, but doctors aren't infaillible machines, they have biases. This is why a lot of plus-size folks will be asked to lose weight in situations where weight isn't part of the problem.

Or if you prefer, riddle me this: my doctor checked my ears (amongst a plethora of other things) in order to sign a SRS document (which was only a series of yes/no questions like ""does someone in the patient's family has X disease"".
Oh, don't worry, it was free, I'm not from the US.
God the American health care system is messed up.
Correct. When I was younger and more naive, I needed to get my immunization record transcribed by a physician as part of enrolling in a university.

I went to a local clinic and told them what I needed at the desk. They sent me to a checkup room where the doctor took my temperature and blood pressure, and was about to record my height and weight when I said ""Excuse me but why are you doing this? I literally just need you to transcribe my immunization records.""

So we went back to the front desk and the doctor did just that, right there, and then they charged me $70 for the checkup.
Omg I‚Äôm a Signituritis! What are you? A Leo? /jk
Fuck, is that how I got it?! I had wondered.
That and pens! ""Pens"" is one letter off from ""penis""! And penis bad! /s
It‚Äôs a terrible Plandemic.Our agenda is found out!
>My partner spends a lot of time in hospitals with a rare, complex anatomy, and docs sometimes get a gleam in their eyes when looking at my partner, like they're a roast ham or a turkey standing on two legs smh.

I wonder if it is pure curiosity or those sweet sweet billing codes...
Jaysus, time for new therapist!!!
I understand that being annoying but understand that your therapist is probably exploring every possibility, and it isnt a reason to drop them like people are suggesting. And on top of it theres even some truth to it, or at least for that first six moths. (idk about FtM but MtF definitely) You kinda go into a unstable and sensitive mental state. And especially considering your therapist said that could just be exasperating your symptoms, it also makes it sound a lot better.

Essentially: i think that if it doesnt seem malicious I'd say be clear to them that you understood that at first some symptoms *could* have been made worse by HRT, but that now you're at a point that it's no longer the case as your body is used to it. That should get em to shoosh lol
>She always suggests it in a very delicate way and reminds me she ""doesn't know anything about that stuff"" afterwards, so I feel bad getting annoyed by it, but come on.

This is gaslighting.  If she *truly* ""doesn't know anything about that stuff,"" *then she needs to shut the fuck up about it.*  You are there for her expert advice and opinions, not her baseless speculation on matters wherefore she knows not her ass from a hole in the ground.  If she wants to keep talking shit about your medication, then she needs to do so from a place of knowledge, not a place of ignorance.  Spitballing like that is *tremendously* unprofessional, and if she doesn't listen to you when you say so, then you need to tell her boss.
My toots are already bad so HRT may make them carcinogenic
I‚Äôm trans masc and non binary but my partner and I are considering changing all my documents just in case. All these new anti trans bills have us scared.
Could be any of a number of countries, sadly. Cold War era America was f‚Äòed up.
My guess is they're from a country that got Operation Condor'd
The US does this all the time, throwing coups against democratically elected governments is our thing. We are the bad guys‚Ä¶
I guess it wasn't very secret
Yeah the harshest lesson you have to learn about America as an American is that for basically our entire history, we've been meddling in the affairs of other countries in the Americas since the 1800s. American geopolitical ambitions have more or less been the same for our entire history; the cold war was the greatest and most dangerous manifestation of those geopolitical aims.
Not a bad exchange tbf
Welp. Baiken cosplay time.
so if i get top surgery will i grow a third arm?
Hey, at least it didn't cost an arm and a leg
Wait, so if you take T' you get a third arm? (Or should I say a third leg)
That's the joy of being a woman. Doctors ignore your concerns and pain.
would make that exchange tbh
If you've got any ink on your arm you could say it was a tit for a tat.
Because they'd need another hand.. A second hand.


Anyway, happy cake day!
In the United States your insurance will usually cover more of your doctor visit if that office is ""in their network"", if you go to a clinic that's ""out of network"" you will likely be forced to pay all of the cost for the visit, instead of your insurance paying for it.
Insurance covers far more of the bill if you use a doctor on their approved list, what they call in-network. They have pre-negotiated the prices with these physicians.
Means if the doctor is within your insurance network, meaning treatment would be partially or completely covered. That's if iirc from the explanation I got from a family member who works in insurance.
Speaking as a US citizen, you asking this question makes me angry for the state of my country.
It has to do with if you have a PPO plan or a EPO plan for insurance in America. If you have a PPO plan and it‚Äôs out of network insurance won‚Äôt as much and an EPO almost nothing out of network.

Basically PPO has a higher set rate for out of network and EPO say fuck you stay in network.
Good luck with moving! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd love to have you here! üòä
Exactly!

Transition takes time and in the meantime many people like me aren't satisfied with the partial results. If I talk about this, some people will use this as an opportunity to blame the transition instead of gender dysphoria. It's the progress that I didn't yet made that makes me feel bad, not the progress that I've already made, but some people just want transition to be the boogeyman.
But there isn't a single fine hair between my upper lip and my nose. The hair is coarse, stiff and dark. My skin is fair.

Over the last year, they have postponed almost every appointment so far with a different excuse everytime. I was complaining that this was probably the reason why the treatment had not been as effective as they anticipated but somehow she felt the need to reply this BS about HRT being the cause instead of just acknowledging the issue and try to work out a solution.
For real... I'm losing weight like crazy now that I have a will to live and all that.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say besides that transphobia left scars
Estrogen does help with acne very well, but there are other ways or treatment such as erythromycin topically. It helps a lot with acne as well without boosting the level of E in body
Yeah, I feel like in a lot of cases it's always trans women who take a large chunk of the transphobia. I think a lot of it stems from cisheteronormative gender stereotypes.
Ah thank you for enlightening me I'm not too knowledgeable about problems like this yet
I will try that next time. 

All my levels are always fine but even my broken nose and concussion from walking into a plexiglass was blamed on my diet.
How? Well with pain medication, and a scapel the world is your oyster
Well I performed a Myringotomy on myself, thats where you cut a incision through your eardrum to allow for fluid drainage, and to restore hearing loss (I was pretty much deaf at that point), I used a YouTube video as a guide, and I had a couple of mirrors. I also performed a Lipoma removal surgery, thats just the removal of a lump from underneath the skin. Then I performed the Myringotomy a second time later in life becuase I needed it again. I did say they were just minor surgeries, not like I performed heart surgery or anything.
Wow, that has got to be the most frustrating thing ever
H‚Ä¶ R‚Ä¶ A‚Ä¶ but you are Trans.. Trans starts with a T‚Ä¶ HRT! IT IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL

Horse riding? As a trans woman? Being rich and trans? No wonder they didn‚Äôt believe you.

I can't even deal with the all too real evil expressed in that comic.
Lucky. I hate America.
They wanted to charge the government, or whoever pays them.  Here in the US, that's a rather common scam - doctors ordering unneeded tests for things, I mean.  Former Florida Governor Rick Scott owned/operated (part of?) a company that did that sort of thing.
> I'm not from the US.

biggest flex
Yes it is, my treatment, which I need to live, is 150 a day and without Medicaid I'd have to pay that out of pocket for 12 days of that shit
A lot of people seem to assume this happened in the US, but I'm from Montr√©al, Canada. I didn't pay a dime.
Sorry i don‚Äôt believe in Astrography.
I've experienced both, for sure.
ü§∑ it takes me at least six months to warm up to new therapists, so swapping her out isn't really an option. I hear you though!
...They clearly state it could be just exasperating symptoms, and that they dont know much about this. Especially if this person is MtF, for the first six months it very well *could* have been making some things worse. If your standards for therapists is that high.. I shudder to think of the struggle that would be needed to find one that works for you /nm /gen
Gaslighting would be lying to me about my own memories of an experience.. right?

I appreciate the desire to defend, but I'm otherwise happy with her services, and don't want to pursue finding a replacement, as I've said. It's okay for me to have some complaints but also not want to go through the process of finding someone else.
Therapists typically dont specialize in gender dysphoria and transgender topics (at least where I live. I'm sure that's not everywhere) so/and if they dont know too much about something.. would you really like for them to just go, ""nah, not my expertise. Find another therapist if you want an expert's opinions."" Cause I know I would find that incredibly rude. Just because they dont know for sure about something, doesnt mean they cant attempt to help their patient anyway.. that's literally their job. /nm

And I'm sure it was just a mistake, but even in a hypothetical where I agreed it was bad for their therapist to day that, the term wouldnt be gaslighting. /nm
Yes I was preparing to get my required document signed by my Endo in Jan.  I figure if my license is updated its harder for phobic laws to target me = /
OOTL. What anti-trans bills?
I feel like there's nothing that can be done. Evidently might makes right for the american government. Wtf is even the goal here? God forbid someone's life gets saved for reasons other than money /s
plus you can look forward to a cybernetic one in the future.
Yeeeeess.
yes.
Hehehe
That is horrifying to me. What happens if you are in an emergency and are taken to hospital that‚Äôs not in your network? Are you stuck with the crazy bill even though it was out of your control? 

I‚Äôm Canadian and our medical system needs a lot of work but the US‚Äôs system truly freaks me out. One time I realized I had forgotten to get traveller‚Äôs insurance when visiting the US and I got so scared that I basically just sat still in my hotel room until I got the confirmation of the policy I quickly bought.

Also, thanks for answering my question helpful internet stranger.
‚Ä¶but they could be from somewhere other than the US
Seriously. I'm forcing myself to slam the brakes on for my weight loss (and giving my beautiful crop of blisters a chance to heal) after losing 2 1/2 stone (15kg, 33lbs) in 6 weeks - that shit ain't sustainable...
PTSD isn't necessarily the kind of thing that makes sense.  Some kids being mean (kids) when *I* was a kid leaving scars doesn't make sense at all.  Nothing about that struck me as being something related to PTSD.  It was only years later when I started to unpack all of it that I recognized what had been done.

I'm not trans *because* I have PTSD; I have PTSD as a direct shitty side effect of being trans.
I am aware of that, however OP has it as an effective contraindication. And I‚Äôve noticed that for things as ubiquitous as acne, there‚Äôs usually more than one treatment to be considered. I should‚Äôve been more specific in calling it inappropriate by saying it would be inappropriate for him as a patient.
I don't think pain medication would be quite enough, however to suspend my disbelief for a little while longer, what surgeries did you perform?
Your balls are bigger than mine. I'm truly impressed
It really is

Don‚Äôt need that much money to ride horses. Atleast for a day u don‚Äôt afaik
I mean unless you live in the city horse riding isn‚Äôt really that expensive, I currently have 16 horses (all but one are on permanent loan, which basically means they‚Äôre given away to good homes but if they no longer want them or we feel they‚Äôre being neglected we can take them back) and I think we paid money for 3 of them, the others were all rescues or like the one we have now the Foal of a rescue, and livery yards aren‚Äôt SUPER expensive. They‚Äôre about ¬£150-¬£200 a month including straw and hay. I know plenty of everyday people with normal jobs who own multiple horses

Don‚Äôt know where the other commenter is from, however, in many countries with universal healthcare, they will not pay for any tests deemed unnecessary 
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúscam‚Äù that would work in my country for example
Not in Canada, at least not in the public system. In fact, they usually try to *avoid* doing tests unless necessary, as it can clog up the waitlist. The doctor gets paid the same at the end of the day. Mine probably did tests hoping to find *something*, just to avoid signing my SRS document. She kept asking questions about my sex life, partner and if I had ""problems"" like depression because of hormones, she seemed salty when I said I have never been happier in all my life, plus it'll be 5 years I'm with the same partner (not mentioning the others in my polycule tho, hehe).
It's a common scam in any country with private healthcare providers. 


In Germany for example the amount of money a doctor can charge is very limited for a patient that is insured with the government but any privately insured person pays the full amount. This leads to situations where doctors have to reserve time for appointments etc. where privately insured patients are prioritised as well as private patients sometimes having unneccessary procedures done on them in order to make more money.
This is literally medical fraud/waste/abuse to schedule unnecessary tests to inflate billing. It's a serious crime healthcare workers are trained to spot and report. Shameful to use transphobia as a pretense.
Oh, fair enough. Though I guess I was responding directly to the premise laid forth by Rivver98 which does happen, so the sentiment remains. The Canadian health system is obviously not as infamous but could they still be profiting? You didn‚Äôt pay out of pocket but they are still billing the medical system right?
I believe it‚Äôs spelled ass troll orgy
But psychologists are just there for your money really. They aren‚Äôt psychologists if they‚Äôre your friends, then they‚Äôre just, friends that you pay whenever you meet them.
If the therapist doesn't know, they shouldn't refer you elsewhere.  They should either learn, or keep their mouth shut on that topic.  Burke's therapist could have supported Burke without insinuating that Burke's transition is now causing Burke's symptoms.  That's fucked up.  A therapist should never just riff on shit like that when they're on the clock.

Attempting to help the patient when you don't know what you're doing is dangerous, like untrained folks trying to move someone who may have a neck injury.

As for gaslighting, yeah, not knowing shit about HRT but repeatedly saying it may be causing mental/health issues *is gaslighting,* cuz hearing that shit from a professional who's supposed to know better *undermines the client's sense of reality.*  If this person is supposed to be an expert, but is giving out unfounded advice and baseless speculation, then yeah, that's gonna be crazymaking, and it's a therapist's job *to know that and not do it.*  So the therapist is either doing it on purpose and therefore gaslighting, or *grossly incompetent* and still undermining Burke's mental health anyway.

My birth state is Texas. They are leading the pack. I can currently update my name and gender there but I‚Äôm afraid they are going to pass legislation to prevent that in the future. If I‚Äôm going to present masc, it would probably be safe to have my birth certificate, passport, ID etc say male and not female or NB.
When Trump was still in office, all anti-discrimination laws applying to transgender people were removed as far as the government is concerned. That means housing, insurance, healthcare, food stamps, any kind of government program. Biden undid all that as soon as he was in office.

However, I believe the Religious Freedom Act is still in play. What this does is allow anybody, including doctors, police, etc, to discriminate against the LGBT community due to religious exemption. Basically: ""I'm Christian and the Bible says 'gays are bad, mkay' so I don't have to help them since it goes against my religion"". This is how you end up with judges in Alabama who refuse to wed gay couples, despite gay marriage now being legal there.

Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
It‚Äôs mainly in the context of socialism vs capitalism, rather than just healthcare. During the Cold War days especially, the CIA would go toppling any leader ‚Äî third world leader at least ‚Äî who had an inkling of pro-USSR or leftist leanings. As other people have mentioned, this happened particularly a lot in South America, where the CIA carried out ‚ÄúOperation Condor‚Äù. [Rare Earth (a documentary channel run by the son of Chris Hadfield) has a really good video on Condor‚Äôs consequences in Chile.](https://youtu.be/MS5objr5dI0)
Celeste!!!!
You'd better hope the EMT the 911 dispatcher sent is in network - they bill separate starting at about 5k per ride without insurance or out of network.

Then the hospital will only provide the minimum care needed to ensure you don't die, then charge you in the tune of multi-thousands of dollars for it if they're not in your network.

If you can't pay that it goes to collections agencies, which are apparently mostly private entities from a quick fact check, where they can submit for it to be garnished from your wages.
Most plans have an exception for emergencies, they will cover anything as if it's in network as long as you contact them and move to a network location as soon as it's medically feasible. It might even be a part of the ACA law that reformed a lot of the most glaring gaps in the system but I'm not sure. ""Surprise billing"" by hospitals and ERs is still an issue though and if you have a high deductible that can wipe it out all at once, which really screws you over if the reason you chose high deductible was because you couldn't afford high premiums.
The weird thing is, America actually has a fantastic healthcare system. You just have to be a veteran to get it. All of my healthcare has come from the Veterans Administration and in the last 7 years, I've paid a total of $450. And that money got me A LOT.
Don't forget the fun of having the hospital be in network, but not the emt or doctors who treat you. The entire system is basically designed to make you wish you had just let yourself die. It's horrific.
> That is horrifying to me. What happens if you are in an emergency and are taken to hospital that‚Äôs not in your network? Are you stuck with the crazy bill even though it was out of your control?

Congrats. You've just discovered why Americans are terrified of basically any kind of ailment, since there's a good chance it will bankrupt you here.

Doesn't help we also have sub-par (for a developed country) healthcare outcomes either given how expensive health care is here. 

As to how this is relevant to us trans folks...

It means as far as I can tell, a lot of trans people opt to go out of the country for GRS because its often cheaper, and the surgical outcome quality is higher for the prices you pay.  Also means that transitioning in the USA can get expensive fast.
10k vs 1k, in my experience
I assumed that to be the case. The fact that my fucked up way of life where being medically oppressed is so normalized that this kind of question isn‚Äôt inherently known by outsiders pierces the veil that much more
Yes, I guess I should have been clear. I am Canadian. 

I‚Äôve heard the term and had a vague idea of what it meant but wasn‚Äôt 100%. Even with the other peoples answers I‚Äôm still a bit confused. It seems wild that people in the US pay so much for insurance and then even then it‚Äôs only good some places. That breaks my brain.
Yeah, I'm not losing that fast I don't think, but I've dropped over 160lbs in the last 7-8 months, from over 500lbs(227kg) down to currently 339lbs(154kg). I'm feeling pretty fantastic and it's mostly attributed to my newfound ability of self control and willpower combined with changes to my lifestyle and how I treat food in my life.
Well as I explained to another commenter here they were minor surgeries but I performed a Myringotomy on myself on two separate occasions, thats where you cut a incision through your eardrum to allow for fluid drainage, and to restore hearing loss, and a Lipoma removal, thats just the removal of a lump from underneath the skin.
Perhaps not the subreddit to compliment someone's balls, but thanks?
Stealing this one if I ever run into this kind of issue in a doctor's office, what a reference, thanks.
OH YOUVE GOT TROUBLE
THAT STANDS FOR POOL
Depends. There are some barn kids that are super poor. FIL grew up with horses and was an avid hunter. They were dirt poor. Bullets are cheaper than meat. Hunting was the process whereby they turned bullets into meat.
I was a neighbour of a farmers family for 12 years, they werent rich but also not sad, they were the happiest people ive met ! (But then again i also pretend to be happy so you never know)
No money only a horse
Yep, can confirm. A family I'm good friend with has two horses, one was the mom's horse, the other is the daughter's horse. The one that belonged to the mom sadly passed, but they do still have the other, and they are absolutely not wealthy, let alone rich
I think they were talking about being a horse kid menat you were either rich or depressed, not being trans tho I could have misread the convo
You pay their moving costs then! 

Yeah, bet you've changed your mind now, haven't you?

Even then, people have lives and family. Even if they had a million dollar moving budget, their family is there. Their friends are there. Everything they've ever known is there.
I did. Do I get a prize?
Right. It's like hating your parents, but unwilling to move out of their house.  People hate America, but wont buy that one way ticket to paradise--I mean Venezuela.
I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with that.
If they were only going in to sign something and were given a battery of tests it may not have been a transphobia thing at all - just basic greed.

Broken Arm Syndrome can be similar.  In a lot of cases, it‚Äôs not that whatever they focus on bothers them personally as much as that they can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees.

Ironically, broken arms *are* an issue being trans can create - osteoporosis is one of the more common side effects of HRT for transwomen.
They're not. Their expenses are paid for by the government, they don't ""bill"" anything when it comes to regular healthcare. And their salary is fixed.
I do believe in that!
Are You trolling my ass? üòç thankYou‚ù£Ô∏èüíã
Thats...probably the name of some skyrim rule 34-
I don't expect them to be my friends, but I get better solutions from them when I'm open with them, and I know it takes me a while to open up. So once I've formed that bond I want to keep it for my own good.
This makes me sad tbh
Nope you're right.  Its causing a mess in certain states like Iowa and Texas where the hospitals are claiming to to cover certain procedures for women due to pregnancy, abortion, etc.  Many of the hospitals are Christian owned and its really terrible =(
At that point it's just Hate Freedom Act. I wish I could do something about it(other than voting for the right people).
Thank you so much for exposing me to this. I can see why they don't teach it to us in school
Holy shit that is terrifying. 

Ambulances are one of the things you do pay for in Canada but the cost is $80. In fact the NDP (our social Democratic Party) have campaigned on getting rid of the cost entirely as it‚Äôs thought to be a deterrent for some.
So do you have to pay the entire deductible before your insurance does anything? For instance, if you have a $5k deductible and your medical bills for a year add up to $4900, would your insurance pay nothing even though they are charging you monthly to have the policy? So essentially you‚Äôd be paying an insurance company to do nothing? Or is sliding it a deductible dependant on the scope of the treatment.
I heard that it's the same as any affordable healthcare in that they get really bitchy if you want things done quickly. I had a vet friend whose shoulder was suddenly so fucked up he couldn't lift it, and they had him on a four month wait to get surgery for the thing.
Sorry to have caused you any discomfort. 

It‚Äôs one of those terms I‚Äôve heard before from American movies and tv but I never fully knew what it meant, just a vague idea. I‚Äôm Canadian and our medical system needs some work but I‚Äôm still very grateful for it.
If you think of medical services as a profit-based industry instead of a healthcare-based industry then it makes sense. It‚Äôs hard to maximize profits when your livestock has the ability to go to greener pastures than you can provide.
That's great work! Isn't it amazing what having a reason to care does to a girl?
Right there with you, girl. Down from 400+ to 323. We got this ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh ok I see, those are like *really minor* surgeries. Alright sorry for not believing you earlier.
You know what I mean though. Anatomy aside, that takes serious courage. I could never do it
Camping across the open plains with only a horse and a handful of gear sounds fun. Just need an inclusive noun for it that doesn‚Äôt sound like fetish play because ‚Äúcowperson‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to work.
Rude of u to assume we still have family or friends
Where did you go fellow traveller (I went from Sweden to France)?
But is it paid for at a fixed rate or on the basis of patients served? Just curious how this works.
Same
You just gave me flashbacks from the bots in youtube comments
yeah, it's not uncommon for people to get mad at you for calling an ambulance here, our healthcare system is fucked beyond belief
People here in the US often take Uber/Lyft to the hospital instead of calling an ambulance, because most people don't even have the emergency savings they would need to pay for an ambulance ride, let alone the emergency treatment once they get there. The whole situation is so fucked.
Preventative services are covered for free (so regular well visits and recommended screenings, that's due to the ACA), but other things - sick visits, diagnostic lab tests, prescriptions, and emergency go to deductible first, unless they're covered by a copay. Usually when you choose insurance there's a choice to have a small deductible with higher premiums and co-pays, so visits and prescriptions are always the copay amount and the deductible only applies to a few things anyway; or a high deductible but the monthly premiums are a lot lower.

High deductible plans also qualify you to have an HSA, which is where you can put pre-tax money to pay for your bills, so it's worth like 20% more and if you get your plan with an employer, sometimes they will put extra money in your HSA as well. So that's an advantage to having a high deductible plan if you can do the long term budgeting.

It's really unnecessarily complicated but roughly: you can get a cheap monthly plan and gamble you won't need it; you can get an expensive monthly plan and everything is affordable at point of service; or you can get the cheap plan, put the money you saved on premiums in your HSA, and use that to pay the deductible if you do need it.
That's nutty, I've never waited for more than a month for anything at my facility. But mine is also really highly rated

You should look up the fascinating history of self-sugeries, like Warner Forssmann who wanted to prove a new method of heart surgery so he just performed heart surgery on himself, and proved himself right, or the woman that performed her own C-Section with only three shots of alcohol, and a kitchen knife. I've only done relatively simple stuff, but you'd be surprised what people are capable of.

In the public system, at least in Qu√©bec, it's a fixed annual salary. For family GPs, they have a minimum of patients that they need to be assigned to (don't know the exact number) but they'll get paid the same whether their patients see them once or 20 times in a same year. They only get a bonus if they get assigned \*more\* patients than a certain amount, but it's not on a per-visit basis, only on a per-assigned patient basis. Most family GPs, when they have unscheduled time in their agenda, will be assigned ""emergency patients"" i.e. those in the waiting room that do not have an appointment nor a family GP.
Terrific!üòÉ
Thank you kind internet stranger for helping me understand the wild world of American health insurance. I very much appreciate that you put all that time into answering my questions.

The crazy complexities and costs with the American system very much make me appreciate what I have. I‚Äôm glad that the only card I‚Äôve ever pulled out of my wallet at the doctors is my care card (card with your health number) and never a credit card.

Mom just told me I dont deserve HRT because of bad grades	"So... my mother recently started accepting me as trans although it is wierd how she shows it.

Won't let me paint my nails cuz others will see it

Wont let me dress up or anything cuz thats just too much for her

But today was just...aeugh

&#x200B;

So she promised me she would help me get HRT after I pass my finals and lose some weight. Cool.

But situation got a bit more fucked up. I officially failed 2 subjects this first semester because guess what, doing school during a pandemic while battling depression is fuckign hard. And its not like they kicked me out of school. I can re-do the semester and it will all be fine.

But no. In a fit of rage my mother literally told me she won't lift a finger to help me because of my grades. Which is just fucking wonderful. I didn't know healthcare is something I have to earn with some numbers on a website.

&#x200B;

I fucking hate it here...

&#x200B;

EDIT: Talked with her, she proceeded to call me selfish for not considering others "	"*My diabetic kid failed a test so I‚Äôm going to take away their insulin, that‚Äôll teach them.*

Seriously, I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about the grades. If she would gate your health by a test score, if you did well on it, she would‚Äôve probably moved on to something else that she can hide it behind. If she‚Äôs not accepting, a good grade won‚Äôt change that. 

Perhaps reiterate that it‚Äôs really hurtful she wouldn‚Äôt prioritize your health in this situation, and that this isn‚Äôt a privilege, it‚Äôs something that you need. Tell her that she‚Äôs doing you real harm, and that isn‚Äôt going to help your academics either at the end of the day.
""...that's just too much for her"" sure sounds like acceptance. Yep, totally accepting...
Your mother sounds stuck up as hell :(
If it's conditional acceptance, then it's not real acceptance. She's transphobic and there's no way around it
That is so fucking abusive. She is holding human rights over your head as a punishment for doing poorly in school? Has she considered that this kind of treatment is having an adverse effect on your academics and that you might actually do better in school if you had the medicine you need? I'm sorry, that is so fucking cruel, you don't hold medical treatment over someone's head like that.
Nursing home 4 her
This woman is gaslighting you hard. She's declining medical care due to your grades?
Umm you can share my story with her if you want. I was an average student in school before I got to college. My depression hit in puberty (6th grade) because my father died and I started looking more like a girl. I actually hit puberty early and was wearing bras and shaving by 5th grade (10 yrs old). 

To cope with the massive depression, I started drinking and smoking weed. It helped a little, and I coasted through HS. I wasn‚Äôt a bad student, but wasn‚Äôt a superstar. Then college hit. I realized what my source of discomfort was at 19 and started drinking and doing drugs HARD. Started failing classes first semester and continued for 2 years until I dropped out. 

It took my seven years of major drinking and drug use before I hit rock bottom and had to come home. By that point I lived in complete denial that I was an alcoholic. It took me a year to get sober, and another year before I trusted myself to make mohair decisions like transitioning. 

Guess what? My grades shot way the fuck up after starting T. My voice dropped and suddenly, I could stand to hear myself talk in class. I‚Äôm a chatty SOB now. I‚Äôm on the Deans List, a straight A student. Im even starting an internship today at an accounting firm and have fucking FUTURE GOALS. When I was a teenager, my future was a blank expanse. I couldn‚Äôt picture myself as an adult at all. 

Transition can literally save futures. I still paint my nails and am HELLA gay, but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs ME, and I don‚Äôt mind looking in the mirror or making mistakes as much anymore.
I am sorry for you and your mother is clearly in the wrong here and actually undermines your success in school. 
What Subjekts did you fail? Maybe I can help you a bit in school over Discord. Feel free to dm me.
Sorry but fuck her, they don't realize you have enough mental and emotional shit going on without the support and medical help you need. Took me forever to finally start hrt but it's such a relief to not having testosterone controlling my mind
Ouch sis(?) that‚Äôs hella rough ü§ïüòñ 
Depending on where you live and how close to the age of majority you are, you may well be able to begin the process to do it without her. It it your body and your life after all. 
Lots of us, self included have had to deal with conditional ‚Äòacceptance‚Äô at various points and I don‚Äôt know how to help you - that‚Äôs far worse than any condition i was ever given - but if she will see *any sense at all* can you try and make it clear to her that support with strings attached is not really support, and that whatever happened to unconditional love? 

Another tactic would be to tie some of the problems such as grades or extra weight to the problems being forced back into the closet and having your identity swept under the carpet is doing to you (cos that‚Äôs essentially what‚Äôs happening here). 


The best i feel i can do is send *all of the* internet hugs and let you know there are thousands of us out here who are now your mom, or cool aunts and big sisters üíï and that we‚Äôre al here for you. 

Nothing is permanent in this life and you can be out of there before you know it if you stay strong. Use this time to explore your options and make plans so when you‚Äôre free, you can transition smooth af.
Take any medicine she uses and just say to her ""you don't deserve it until you're a better mom."" That's abusive as hell.
I hope that was a joke, that is so wrong
I'm sorry thats happening. It sounds like shes just coming up with excuses in order to delay things for you. We can get HRT after you lose weight... after you bring up your grades... after you get through finals. All of these are delay tactics but someone who doesn't REALLY accept you for who you are. Maybe she's just digesting that and needs some time - or maybe she's a huge jerk. I have no idea which. I do hope things improve for you soon. You deserve to be yourself.
Withholding life saving medical treatment as a punishment is seriously tucked up.
I also wanna mention that denying you HRT due your weight is really really unfair. To expect a kid to like diet and exercise is fucked up, but expecting this from a trans kid who is unable to have the body they desire is even worse. You want your kid to show their body some self care when you will deny them something they so bravely told you they needed for their body? Exercising while dysphoric is not easy at all. But regardless of all this I think no one should be expected to loose weight unless there is a clear and undeniable health concern. Weight is actually a poor indicator of overall health and its better to look at #s from blood tests to figure out where your body is at. A good doctor will relay this (my doctor has relayed this to me).
This is not acceptance. This isn't even tolerance.

The fact that supporting your transition would likely improve your grades by improving your self perception and mental health makes this ten times worse. She's trapping in this spiral because allowing you to transition makes her ""uncomfortable"", has she even considered the discomfort that you feel every day.
""my mother recently started accepting me as trans""

She hasn't, and this is abuse. I'm sorry.
Imagine gatekeeping stuff that literally helps you. I hope you get your HRT soon, wether that's coming to an agreement or getting it yourself üíú
That's not accepting you, it's all about controlling and abusing you. Replace the hormones with something different that is essential as well, like food.
WTF, what kind of parent would say she's ""accepting"" and then gatekeep their child's from life-saving healthcare ?
Your mother is not accepting you. Your mother is controlling you.
If you are in the US, planned parenthood is generally pretty cheap without insurance. (cheap as far as anything medical goes) I know my appointment to discuss/get a prescription without insurance (mine doesn't cover planned parenthood) was $90. I have also done all my appointments online, so as long as you have an internet connection and a little bit of money you can go through with that.

‚Äúwell then, I guess we‚Äôll just have to take away your oxygen until you can make mushroom risotto perfectly. When you can improve your cooking skills and lose 40 pounds  I promise you can have the oxygen back.
Yo that sounds like child abuse :/
she wants you to lose weight for HRT? and she thinks you don't deserve HRT bc of bad grades? she's not accepting, she's pretending to be as a form of emotional manipulation. I don't think talking to her about this would do much, so check if there's anything you can do on your own or with any other adults in your life
""Im sorry mom, you had lost your job. You dont deserve the healing from cancer.""
Thats how it sounds like. She doesnt see Hrt as medication. Like, wtf?
Maybe you can explain it to her?
Okay, NO. This is NOT how that works. You don't take away someone's anti anxiety medicine or a diabetic person's insulin just because they got some bad grades. This is a medical issue, she's treating it like it's a *choice. It isn't.*
That's like saying you don't deserve your antidepressants because of bad grades. =|

Good job, mom. /S

I hope you can convince her to let you see a trans-supportive therapist at the very least. =/
Parents should take away things that children ***WANT*** in their lives when punishing them.

Not what they ***NEED*** to survive.
OP none of that is acceptance. HRT is a necessity for those who want it. Its medical. You can turn it down. But if you need it and want it then it should be given to you. The fact you can't present like the way you want is one thing and bad. But in order to get medical help you need to do well in school and LOSE WEIGHT?

I'm sorry. I know that its hard for you and you don't deserve this but you know that it is fucked up. So you have the ability to protect yourself from her abuse (yes this is a form of abuse, withholding what you need is abuse).

It's never to late to start HRT. And you might need to get on it yourself. But she doesn't look like she's going to be much help. She honestly seems like she'll make things worse if she ""helped"" you.

But like thats what I'm putting together. I might be wrong. Sorry if thats the case.
Your mom is abusing you
Istg, parents care more ab grades than their child‚Äôs mental health
it seems lots of parents of trans kids definitely struggle with seeing their kids point of view because they are cis. when i came out months ago my mom agreed to call me by my preferred name and pronouns, however when i asked for a binder she said ‚Äúwhy cant you be happy with your chest‚Äù or when i corrected her on slip ups she‚Äôd get mad at me or offended. I don‚Äôt think parents realize how negatively it effects us mentally when we get told that our needs are just ‚Äúwants‚Äù. being comfortable in our bodies isn‚Äôt something that should be seen as a privilege. however when i look at how far ive come and how far ill be able to take my transition after leaving the house, it gives me a bit of hope. i hope this helps :)
Another example of cis people just not fucking getting it
Mannnnn, why all mom's in this subreddit who are just heinous gotta be so bad? I feel there's some actually supportive mom's out there but it might just be a minority. Hope it gets better for you!
bruh
Honestly, this sounds like she views you being trans like something that you really want, and not something that you are. This reads to me like confiscating a toy after your grades were bad or cancelling a trip you were meant to go on after your grades were bad. Which I don‚Äôt really agree with mums doing in the first place, but they both happened to me because my mum put my grades before everything else sometimes. This definitely sounds like your mum is doing that. But it‚Äôs way worse in your situation because this isn‚Äôt something you want, it‚Äôs something you need. She appears to view being trans as a choice. And based on everything else you said about your mum, she sounds like she‚Äôs not even trying to accept you and just claiming she does for the brownie points. I‚Äôm very tired of the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to be/do [blank] in public because it reflects on me crowd‚Äù, because it doesn‚Äôt reflect on them. And you being trans definitely doesn‚Äôt.

If trying to explain all this to her and where her shortcomings are doesn‚Äôt work, then I can‚Äôt really help you any further. I know some parents are too stubborn to accept that their kids can be right sometimes. Sorry.
That's really awful of her.. That's just textbook manipulation. Chances are it wouldn't have mattered to her one way or the other. No parent who cares about their kid's health gatekeeps it like that. I'm sorry you have to go through that.
Let her know without you being able to transition, it‚Äôs the equivalent of forcing you to write with your non dominant arm, or having to pee really bad during class, or not being able to see but being denied glasses, or starving and being denied food, or any other analogy you can think of. Gender dysphoria keeps you from being able to focus on your school work in the same way that all of the above things would make learning incredibly difficult. Think of it like your brain is a computer and the dysphoria is malware that is eating up all of your RAM. Once it‚Äôs treated, the computer can function at full capacity again and will no longer struggle for basic tasks
Maybe you don't have good grades because of dysphoria. That is so insensitive of her.
this is what I've been worried about happening, haven't come out still because I'm afraid about my grades being used against me, mostly by my dad
If you're in the US look into applying for Medicaid through your state, count only yourself and your own income when applying. Once you have insurance find an endocrine doctor and start your own journey.
As a parent, I would have to say your mother is overwhelmed and he is hoping that you will change your mind. She doesn't understand what it is like to be trans and accept it for yourself. Give her time, she's your mother I'm sure she loves you very much. As a trans person who is going through similar situations with many people I know, I wish you luck and offer you whatever support I can from here.
That's just horrible

I do not know how you feel about HRT, but form me it is holy thing

If anyone took it away from me, I would a little bit damage them

&#x200B;

Taking HRT away because of  g r a d e s ? It wouldn't help me, worse - It would make my minds condition go down... I hope something similar won't happend to you...  


*Post written after \[25\] hours of no sleep*
If depression is bringing down your grades getting you on HRT will raise your grades. Maybe if you frame it that way she will get it? She sounds controlling and manipulative.
Make tour mom understand that being trans isn't a reward. It's who you are and her refusing to let you express your personality is literally emotional abuse and she's going to regret doing these things to you when you grow up and won't nothing to do with her.
Sounds like narcissistic behavior on your mothers part. She putting HRT on a shelf and using it as a way to control you. Don‚Äôt buy into it, if your over 18 try getting on HRT without your mother‚Äôs fucked up permission. Sorry this happened to you, nobody deserves that.
she would have come up with something else imo. if your grade were good. its not about grades
Yeah, that's not accepting at all. She's using ""allowing"" you to transition as a carrot to try and control you. If she were really accepting she would help with whatever you asked her to do that was within her power to do to help you transition. She may say she accepts you but it sounds like she has yet to actually show it which is what actually matters
Ask her to have this conversation with a mediator/family therapist present, and I can't stress this enough, DO NOT have another conversation about it until there is someone else present to help both of you.

(Tip: she might lash out at this request; most abusers do. Try to keep calm, but make it known that you do not give her permission to have this kind of control of your life, and I'd iterate that being a mother doesn't give her the right to make those decisions and you're very hurt by her actions.)

Please do not comment on her parenting, please do not comment on her character. Try not to make things about right or wrong.

Keep it calm. Keep the topic on finding a therapist to help mediate your ""conversations"". If she isn't willing to work with you on doing that, then tell her you will be taking that information to your therapist. And that you will not be continuing ANY conversation with her until after you've discussed more with a therapist.
she tweakin
Your mother‚Äôs an ass. That‚Äôs not how you parent. It also shows that she sees transitioning as a choice. 

Why does your mother have a say in this? You‚Äôre 19. You need to be pragmatic. Your finals are this summer? Put your head down, get some great grades (you‚Äôll thank yourself in the years to come because do-overs are fucking hard with education), get a job and move out.

Get out from under your mother‚Äôs thumb, her partner‚Äôs bigoted views and their degrading comments, and take your life into your own hands. 

Otherwise you‚Äôll still be in this situation gaming, meming, depressed, and going nowhere in life, in three years time. Your life. You control it.

It sounds stupid but I know how it feels to be your age and have that feeling that you‚Äôve missed out on the childhood you wanted in the gender you wanted to be. You can waste years being pissed off about it, and blaming the world, but it won‚Äôt solve anything. Been there. Got the T-shirt. Good luck. Start small and think big. Aim for the stars and you‚Äôll hit the moon.
Probably they already told you this
But your mother it didn't accept you as trans
So this is just straight up bonkers. There is NO WAY she actually supports and accepts you if she keeps pulling this game. She seems to be one of those people that care about their reputation rather than your feelings. THEIR OWN CHILDS FEELINGS! Honestly look I started hormones about like 4 almost 5 years ago so if you need a big sister to help you do some research and try to figure out how to go about it without needing her help then just hmu cause nah-uh honey that ain‚Äôt happening! If I could I‚Äôd be trans Oprah and give everyone free hrt! Lol 

But Fr though. If she doesn‚Äôt even let you PAINT your nails then she most likely definitely thinks this so some sort of phase. Or a fad of some sort. You need to go to therapy and get a therapist to tell you that you have gender dysphoria so you can shove that in your moms face and be like HA! this proves I need hormones and then you and I are gonna find a way for you to get some without needing her help. We are gonna get you in the path to loving yourself don‚Äôt worry üíï
Before I transitioned I failed out of college twice. Dealing with college and dysphoria was just more than I could do. I've gone back after I had transitioned and I'm averaging a 3.75 GPA since I've come back. Try to explain to her that taken care of your health will make it easier to do well in school. Related to other health examples even. Would you expect a kid with a broken arm to be able to pass PE before you were willing to get a cast for them? No. Would you expect a kid diagnosed with depression to beat their depression and pass their classes before you got them treatment? That would be ridiculous. If someone is struggling with adhd, are you only going to give them help after they've shown that they can do well in school without it?
I felt this, in the same situation and am flunking school rn and desperately trying to get it back up üòû
maybe you should try DIY at that point. hrt.cafe has links to sites that offer affordable hrt
The deal was that she would help if you passed your finals and lose some weight. You didn‚Äôt pass your finals, and now you are upset that she isn‚Äôt helping? You didn‚Äôt hold up you end of the deal, what do you expect?
[removed]
Your mother is trying to protect you.
Did we have the same mom???
Yah that isn't supportive, that's a manipulator trying to get you to think they're on your side so they can make you earn it.
That's like saying ""You're not allowed to fix your broken leg cuz your bad at maths""
I‚Äôd tell her you recommend reading about the connections between depression and lack of acceptance at home for trans youth. 

If she continues this abuse please don‚Äôt give up. At 18 you can begin to access them on your own. 

And remember, you are beautiful. You are important. Please don‚Äôt give up üíú
On a side note from the main fuckery, it's super fucked up that your mum is telling you you need to lose weight
da fuq?
She doesn‚Äôt sound too accepting to me, she sounds like she is doing all of the motions of a person who doesn‚Äôt want to be a bigot but is also grossed out and made uncomfortable by trans people so to try to do both, they say ‚Äúi love and accept you but i have to respect my boundaries‚Äù, my mom does the same thing, she says she lets me present how i want in public because so she‚Äôs not a bigot, she believes all the terf lines but she‚Äôs not a bigot, she loves and accepts me but tries to detrans me constantly or blame it on the autism that i don‚Äôt have, she wants to show her acceptance but she can‚Äôt even bring herself to get any makeup, clothes, etc for christmas or my birthday because she is made uncomfortable by it. Call her out on her bullshit and lies, tell her she‚Äôs not actually accepting you, she‚Äôs just forcing you to present what makes you dysphoric in public and keep the trans thing a dirty little secret to keep at home
Sorry to be a bitch about this, but your mother is NOT accepting you. She's stringing you along with an intent to exhaust you into surrendering your ""side"". She's not seeing this as you attempting to express your identity. She's seeing this as something trivial like you wanting to wear a style of clothes she doesn't approve of.  She thinks if she can string you along enough she'll just exhaust you into giving up and acquiescing to her wishes, all the while thinking that it was your choice. At absolute best this gas-lighting.
If a person's acceptance and support is conditional- then it isn't really acceptance. If you do end up being able to get on HRT later on with the help of your mom, then that's awesome! But if she's only going to accept and support you for who you are on HER terms, then she doesn't really accept you for who you are.

Your mom's behavior is incredibly toxic and I'm very sorry that you're dealing with this right now. The way she's treating you is absolutely not okay.

Sending all the love your way, girl! Honestly. Your mom has absolutely no right to treat you that way- you deserve to dress the way you want and be yourself.
The bich is a ass hole
Lame excuse to be transphobic and neglect your health. This should be criminalized.
I dunno if it's the same everywhere but in America school teaches you how to handle college and nothing else. Legit one guy was being fined for his teenage kid missing too much school and he took it to court calling schools out for not teaching his kid basic survival skills so he started teaching his kid about taxes and driving and court and stuff and won the court case. One guy literally sued an entire school.

 So if I were you I'd try asking something like ""What's so important about proving I can listen to someone talk for 2 weeks and answer questions on a test about it? Do you remember your (insert current year) in high school? Or what was taught then? I'm trying to improve myself so that I can better function confidently and have a reason to have good grades."" 

And that's not even mentioning that college is a scam. Yeah it teaches what it promises to. But that debt to go in is only handleable if you successfully get into the field. Simply missing too many days because fucking covid hit and you have no vehicle can get you failed. Trust me, I had it happen to me.
Any good parent would understand that depression can affect performance. Geez that‚Äôs fucked up!
Your mom sounds a lot like my mom, are we sisters or something???
Dont know if you wanna embrace the sith lord in you but using anger and resentment to fuel your success drive can lead to a better place in life. 

What helped motivate you throughout your transition?
Revenge in spite of set backs.
This reminds me of another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hy6m0f/aita_for_cancelling_my_daughters_therapy_because/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I saw a while back. 

Mental health care is not an a privilege for a parent to give and take. 

I don‚Äôt like her making comments about you losing weight either, untreated dysphoria is crippling enough and having grown up with a mom who belittled my weight left lifelong self image and health issues. I‚Äôm 31. I don‚Äôt want to see anyone go through that ever again.
It sounds to me like your mom doesn't understand that being trans isn't a ""fun"" thing, where treatment should be rewarded or withheld based on performance- but is instead a health issue. Treatment of your  dysphoria will likely lessen your depression (but depression should likely *also* be treated- I'm not a doctor) and may help you to be able to do better in school.

But moreover, she's also just not accepting you if she denies you any opportunity to express yourself in ways traditionally gendered different than what she expects from your assigned gender at birth.
Your mother holding your health care hostage is child abuse.
I'm sorry about that üòî I hope that you can get your HRT soon. If you need a friend to talk I'll be here for you ‚ù§Ô∏è but remember, we don't need HRT to be valid. You are a really special person
Im so sorry you are dealing with this, it is such a hard no win situation. Do your best to protect yourself and try to prepare to leave as soon as you legally can. It can get so much better if and when you are able to get away. My mother was the same way and it took her 20 years to change, now we have a great relationship but in order to survive I got out as soon as I could. Even though she is your mom, she is just a person like every other person and is flawed deeply. Set your goal of how to start your life after her and work towards it, use that as motivation and protect that beautiful soul you have in there until you can provide it the right environment to really grow into who you are.
if i fail i get my ass beat, if i get straight A‚Äôs that‚Äôs just the expectation. I wish i got HRT with good grades ü•≤
School sucks man and grades are pointless they don‚Äôt even take an accurate measurement of how good someone is at a subject some people are just not good at taking tests but school hasn‚Äôt been about teaching for a long time If schools really wanted to teach they would use methods that are proven to help people learn but no they don‚Äôt want to change and are fucking lazy and keep giving this ‚Äúwe are teaching them‚Äù bullshit I mean the school system is messed up I speak from experience on that and as far as your mom not letting you do HRT because of grades i dunno man that‚Äôs shitty you shouldn‚Äôt have to earn that your mom sounds like she is worried about what people will think of you presenting another way and or think of her my mom is the same way but I‚Äôm not out to her
Lol
im your mum now, we're getting HRT and then ice cream RN
bruh don't let depression be your excuse just work on the subjects and forget about it.
I‚Äôm sorry to be my fat activist self in here but *lose some weight????* Your mom caring about that is just so so so gross. She should care if you‚Äôre *HEALTHY* , not what you weigh. That is so disturbing to me
Sounds like your mom doesn't want you to be trans, but wants to fake support you.
Haha its you again
Why is parents using HRT as leverage such a common thing, also she wasn't going to give it to you if you weighed too much, that is fucked up
I mean we kinda agreed to not talk to eachother today so...maybe tomorrow xd
[removed]
I was about to say. That's not what acceptance is, OP. Acceptance means she doesn't give a shit what other people think either, so she would let you paint your nails.
She fucking promised me she would start accepting me and help me
Yup. This kind of covert transphobia isn't all that uncommon either. If OP gets good grades, she'll find another excuse not to support OP. Moving the goalposts.

Not to mention how shitty an excuse grades are, because transition helps fight depression, and depression is a huge cause of poor grades.
She has not. For her, school comes before literally anything else and thats it
Haha oof
*Crappy* nursing home for her.

Fixed it.
nah, the street
Nursing homes costs money, dump her on the side of the 
 street
I am seconding that! One university teacher testified to court in my favor when I had to get my legal gender changed, and she was all about how I used to be really closed off and defensive, but I became a much more talkative and better student in just a few months' time when I started HRT.
WOW this so amazing!!! I‚Äôm honestly so happy for you!!! üíïüíïüíïüíï
I‚Äôm also really sorry you had to deal with that much pain for a while hun :( I‚Äôm here if you need someone to talk to üíï
Wow.. thanks for sharing. That's seems inspirational for me, cause I'm in that depressive part. I already abused the fuck outta weed, and I've cut it back a lot. 
But to think that transitioning might save my life and help me to be confident, really gave me hope. 
I really look forward to being in a safe place to start transitioning. Cause daily and constant disphoria is clouding my life.
I am in need of some big sisters...
No kidding!  
But no doubt she'll pull a ""1 rule for me, another for thee!"" on OP.
Im not a kid Im 19
Im not in the US planned parenthoods arent a thing here
I mean she is kinda right tho. Ill look ugly as shit if I start hrt now with my current weight
Im not in the US its not as Easy
This is gonna be hard considering my shit conversation skills and lack of control over my emotions
1. I dont wanna be in IT. 
2. I still intend to at the very least pass my finals
3. I am so socially inept even getting a fucking doctor's appointment scares me
I mean thats the best part. Mom was straight up denying me before. Now that my psychologist actually wrote a diagnosis for gender dysphoria, she says she accepts me but then does shit like this
and yeah I am definitely in need of a big sister. U got discord?
Problem is Im scared of doing HRT without a specialist of some sort overlooking my transition
Its not about finals, my finals are still underway. Its grades in general
Trans stuff is literally life saving, not letting her have it because of her grades and weight is bullshit and unacceptable. How is this any different than a diabetic person being refused insulin because of grades and weight?
1. Im 19 
2.  what the hell are you even fucking doing in this sub>
From what? And what are you even doing in this sub?
from living?
Then again, I have always been very direct and straightforward on calling people out so perhaps the better strategy for you would be to voice how it makes you feel to her, that‚Äôs only if she is swayed by emotional appeals though, i can‚Äôt relate to that since my mom doesn‚Äôt actually care about that.
In europe you dont have to go in massive debt to go to college
Bruh You dont think Im fucking trying?
?
I second the above advice, but I reframe it to be less blaming.
Your Mother is definitely struggling to accept to you, so I think it's best you approach her gently. I know it's going to be really difficult but you need to be the bigger woman in this situation...
I would approach the conversation not expecting an immediate outcome, but rather to say things that will change her mind over time. I also think but expecting an immediate positive response will help in not getting upset.

Instead of using language like hurtful which implies she's responsible, say it upsets you. Rather than telling her she's getting in the way of your health, explain how hrt will help you and your mental health, and how it's unfair to use positive steps for your mental health as a reward system. Be honest with her, but kind of stroke her ego in a way. She certainly sounds like she deserves the opposite, but for you to get the response you want I think shifting the focus from how she's hurting you, to how much you'd gain from hormone therapy/dressing at home etc, could be better for you.
Try your best not to approach it expecting immediate change, rather approach it giving her things to think about... I hope it helps ‚ù§Ô∏è
You may feel like you NEED your parenta for ""financial or emotional support"" but fuck those guys. They dont care about YOUR feelings, only about how you make THEM feel. Wait until you're old enough to make your own decisions.
Are you in therapy? If not, you need to ask your mom for individual therapy.
Both are necessary medications. The point was to illustrate how dumb it is to gatekeep any medication behind arbitrary goals like grades. 

You wouldn‚Äôt do that with insulin & you shouldn‚Äôt do that with HRT regardless of whether they‚Äôre a 1:1 comparison.

If you can‚Äôt understand that, it really seems like you just don‚Äôt think of HRT as a necessary medication in which case you‚Äôre just ignorant.
Kinda sounds like narcissism to me. It's she this manipulating about other things or just this?
My mum did too. Guess who's fucking not doing that?
I feel like she's struggling with the idea still and just found an excuse, and you made her mad with the grades so she's going to make you mad with something else that's irritating her. Seems pretty fucking stupid on her part tbh
Sorry OP. Maybe show her this thread, so she can see that there's a whole world of people that think she is clearly in the wrong here. Also, paint those nails!
I wonder, would she hold depression meds from you if you needed them, would she hold Adderall from you if you had ADHD? Because of grades? Would she not allow you to take blood pressure medication if you had a weak heart? All things that would literally preoccupy you from doing well in academics, not to mention have a poor effect on your life and wellbeing, if untreated? Kind of like being forced to go through the wrong puberty???
My mom had this attitude. Growing up, I was not aware that she wasn't the final authority. It took me a long time to reclaim my identity, long after moving out. You seem like you still have yours. Hold onto it. Stay on your own side.
Withholding medical care that would help you do better in school because you aren't doing well in school is nonsense. This isn't because school comes first.
the woods
Wow!!! I love this for you!!
Thank you! My grades and overall mood changes were probably the reason why my mom stopped being so resistant to my name change and everything. She‚Äôs actually getting better, too. 

As a background, she used to watch Fox News and told me she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt hate gay people, but didn‚Äôt think they should get married‚Äù a decade ago
Tbh I had a bit of a breakthrough in the midst of a breakdown at the psychiatrist‚Äôs office when I was getting sober (outpatient group). I was asked for the umpteenth time when I was expressing dysphoria if I wanted to drink or smoke weed. I said ‚ÄúI would never smoke or drink again if I could just transition,‚Äù and that has really helped me stay sober over the last couple years
You can count me as another big sister for sure and feel free to message me whenever you need someone to talk to okay? üíï
We are all your big sisters now üíôüíñü§çüíñüíô 

As for your mom not wanting you dressing in affirming clothes‚Ä¶ if you want to go out as yourself, can you hide under baggy pants and sweaters, then take them off and keep them in a bag while you‚Äôre out? When I lived among transphobic conspiracy theorists I used to stealth cute skirts and dresses that way like a little trans ninja ü•∑ and present as myself once I was a safe distance away from those bigots, or wait until they were all asleep, out or engrossed in their fascist media to go out fully femme. In boymode, a well placed knot can turn a t shirt into a crop top too if you need to change quickly. 

Is she the sort of person who would notice clear/gloss nail polish? Keep them filed and trimmed in a nice shape - she can‚Äôt stop you doing *that* at least. Likewise you could have a go at shaping your eyebrows , taking good care of your skin etc. 

I know it‚Äôs tricky but we take *whatever* shreds of affirmation we can get. As i said, we‚Äôre all here for you sis. üíï
Then she has no legal right to know anything or say anything about your medical care in the US unless you are conserved. If you are conserved, in the US, and she is doing this it's an APS call.

Edit: For context, there is something called medical abuse or medical neglect. If I heard your story from a minor in my medical office I'd be calling CPS as a mandated reporter to report medical abuse. This is very much not okay.
Sorry, I assumed you needed your mother‚Äôs permission to access HRT because you are underage. But what I have to say about weight loss still stands. Its a totally cruel barrier.
My point is you deserve to go on HRT with or without any change to you right now. And you'll have plenty of time waiting for changes anyway
I do have to go though. I hope things go well for you at some point and I hope I didnt come off as too demanding or aggressive.

Best wishes <3
First off is that YOUR opinion or HERS? You know you can work out on HRT right? In fact its advised you do if you are to make any body changes anyways. I dont know what you look like. But I dont need to in order to hear what sounds like conditioned body image issues.

Maybe I'm in the wrong for this. Most transmen want to be slim or muscular or ect and i want to look like a chubby bear and I started out pretty skinny. So many people think I'm wrong to tell anyone about weight.

But I know people are happier the way THEY want to look. My girlfriend wants to be strong (which many people dont see as a feminine trait). I want to be round and pick up logs. My friend Wren likes being a twink.

You have plenty of time to work out on HRT because idk if you knew but HRT isnt a quick process.. Unfortunately.

You want to paint your nails and wear clothes you like right? Well. Start off with what do YOU want to look like? No outside opinions. If you need help then thats cool but... When you are going for HRT what do you see your body becoming? What do you see YOU becoming? You dont have to have it all right now and if I'm honest things will change a tiny bit once you start transitioning.

You dont have to answer here either if you dont want. I just want you to think about these questions for yourself. I just feel bad because I was in a similar situation. I dont know you. You dont know me. I will never understand what you are going through in all high probability but I just want you to remember this doesnt affect her. This is your transition and you'll be the one changing. She has to just either suck it up or fuck off. I say that reasonably ofcourse.

Sorry if this is out of pocket or Im speaking out of turn.
Exactly why you need a mediator
I understood from your post history that you were studying IT. My bad. 

Good luck with the finals. Trust me that good grades now will stick with you for the next forty years of working and so will the bad ones. It‚Äôs really worth it working hard for the next six months and focusing on your finals. 

You need to get over those social fears with doctors. If you are serious about transitioning then you‚Äôll spend the next years of your life making polite demands of doctors. You need to be informed and be able to politely and calmly express your needs. Like a said above. You‚Äôre the project. Take it one step at a time. 

Whilst you‚Äôre still at home, make sure you can take advantage of learning how to do things from your mother. If you don‚Äôt know already, figure out a few dishes that you can cook for yourself. Figure out how to turn the washing machine on and wash the right clothes at the right temperature. How do I manage income versus expenditure. How do I do a tax return. Basic how do I live by myself problems. Because you are going to have to move out if you want to move forward.
Ugh. Sorry to hear that hun :/
Yes ma‚Äôam!
Any family doctor or primary care can do it. Some planned parenthoods can offer it.
Semantics, if you are failing courses, you are not keeping up with grades. Additionally, you mentioned you have depression which is a reason you list as to why you failed the courses. Are you getting help with the depression/ have you asked for your mothers support in helping with your depression, especially if this is something that is affecting your grades?
It‚Äôs quite literally not life and death. A diabetics body cannot function without insulin, if they don‚Äôt take it, they can die. A trans person can hold off taking hormones to start developing. Their body does not need hormones to survive, they are choosing to take the hormones to change their body. Don‚Äôt compare the two and say they are the same.

Well at least there's that. **starts considering saving up for an online course**
am dumb my bad hopefully shit gets better
Marcy you hoe its me, Alex
Its...gonna be hard. I could really use some help with that
This is better advice than my kinda off topic rant. And you've got a point. People never respond well to negative feedback especially if it's like pointing blame.
Technically I am but I am socially inept and afraid to make a doctor's appointment
decent people?
people, especially dumb parents, use trans problems as a petty way to get back at or punish you. like come on would you punish your daughter by being misogynistic? no! that's incredibly damaging! so why would you deadname your trans child to take out your anger?
She does not care. To her its not healthcare its my whim.
You should need a license to raise children.
Take her to the sewers, not even the rats want her
An active volcano
Omg..
Okay...
So even If I weigh almost 300 pounds I should still start and I wont look like ellie from borderlands?
I am studying in IT But only because its too late for me to change courses

And my social fears arent Just with doctors. Theyre with everyone. It would be awesome if someone could go with me even if I knew how to do it...
Drop me Ur handle in the dms
Planned parenthood does not exist here considering some fucking nutjobs literally banned abortions last year
I am actively taking antidepressants
Dysphoria absolutely drives people to suicide, how can you not tell me the shit is essential when so many people die from it. Just because it‚Äôs not necessarily needed to survive doesn‚Äôt mean not having it kills people. Of course that‚Äôs not the only reason people experience dysphoria but you get my point
I fully accepted that society is gonna hate me and I dont give a fuck. I do this shit for myself and nobody else. IDC about other's opinions on the matter, they can suck my ass. Im doing this purely for me.
Thank you. Appreciate it
Oh fucking hell. Hey XD
Well that's not very convincing.
 I get it, doing stuff sucks and can be really stressful but you're inevitable just going to be miserable since you're not going to take any initiative.
Call your Doctor. Embaress yourself now so you can get what you want later.
I get that. My partner and I still are always trying to get the other one to make appointments, and we are in our 30s. Its hard and what ends up happening is that we put off our medical, dental, etc. until it gets way worse.
work on this tbh
Then that isn't really acceptance is it?
Hey! *Get out asap!*
I now know what to do when on holiday in Sicily!
I mean if you want to of course! I just wanna make sure you‚Äôre okay is all! *hugs*
I find nothing wrong with Ellie. Ellie is able to walk and uses her power of her size to her use.. Theres a toxic trait in comparing and criticizing others looks. You don't truly know how healthy a person might be. Muscly grows with fat. You can get strong on fat. Also she is a cartoon character. So...

But to answer your question that depends. Do you want to look like her? Do you not want to? Regardless of going on HRT were you going to work out anyways? Are you expecting HRT to solve all of your answers? Or to do the job it was made to do?

I would suggest looking for charts on what HRT you are wanting to go on ( I'm assuming its E but since I didn't get your pronouns I haven't said anything certain because its rude) and figure out the milestones and when they start to kick in.

I'm coming to the conclusion you think HRT is going to change your appearance quit quickly. It doesnt work that way. At all. So you have time now if you really want to make those changes and later to do so.

Also I'm not going to dog you for thinking that all fat is bad and that people who are fat are gross. Thats a common thought today. Unfortunately. Its also unfortunate that the people who started all of that were racists and eugenicists. Not many people know this.

However if your weight seems to be a health issue at all I would suggest seeking medical help to evaluate if you can go on HRT anyways. As well as just the average primary care that is necessary. I dont know if your school has mandatory check ups as a thing needed for schooling hut you can use that excuse on your mom.

Either way. Evaluate your health. Look up what HRT can do for you. And figure out what you want to look like. A person is a person no matter what. If we all looked the same it would be boring anyways. Also just... Be careful on the spiral that body shaming can do to you and others around you. Again not beating you up for it but like it hurts you and others and you and- its a bad spiral. Take care of YOU. Love YOU. Focus on YOU. And dont look too much on fantasy for body shit that never works
I did!
Are you saying that being trans is a mental health issue? I‚Äôm genuinely curious, I don‚Äôt keep up with this topic much.
You dc abt opinions but do care abt somebody not accepting you?
I hope you will trully listen to some of the advices these redditors gave. That person willing to help you with writing an email is really great.
Problem is I dont even have a primary care physician. Not since I oved and I have no fucking idea how to register to one
I dont fucking know I just wanna be happy
Yeah I do
Its different. My mother was supposed to help me with this.
Yeah DW i do intend to take their advice
You don't need one. Just go to any informed consent doctor (you can even schedule online, often via email) and pay the copay. I promise it's less difficult than it seems.

If you want more in depth steps feel free to message/chat with me and I'll walk you through it. Taking steps to improve your mental health is the best thing you can do for yourself.
‚ù§Ô∏è do you think you could get access to some kind of mediator? A doctor who can support you in communicating with your mother? A counsellor from school?
Also if you‚Äôre doing this for yourself shouldn‚Äôt you be more focused on your grades than your trans goals?
I'll see that you do anyhow.
I wanna talk through it but I doubt it works the same in the US as it does here
With my last insurance (terrible HMO) you needed a primary for them to pay anything. You had to select a primary and then go to them first about anything (including things that needed an urgent care visit). Literally we would be at urgent care at like 10pm at night, and they wouldn't treat us until we called our primary in front of them to verify that they weren't open. If you tried to go anywhere without first contacting your primary, they wouldn't pay (unless you were over 100mi away from their nearest office).
Wdym?
If you don't mind me asking, are you comfortable mentioning what country you're in? Someone from there might chime up with more knowledge
Focusing on your grades would help you more

I'd still be willing to help you draft emails or do more searching for resources if you need it, but this should be a solid start. Good luck!

I have had, as far as transitions go a fairly easy one. Probably because I am older and live in Southern California. In a reddish suburb but I think people here are just more used to people being different. So Cal is a melting pot.

However I am angry and scared that people like us have less rights depending on where in the US we reside. That a sizeable minority of voters have no problem removing our rights and criminalizing trans children, their families, and medical professionals. On top of that a sizeable group of voters don't know and don't care if we lose rights as it doesn't affect them.

So now we have a Supreme Court that could if they decide to essentially outlaw changing your gender legally and maybe even medically.

LGBT rights were rolled back in Hungary and it's no coincidence that CPAC a right wing group that has access to power in D.C. held it's annual convention not in Washington DC but in Hungary.

I am active in my local Democratic club and we have had success with basic get out the vote campaigns. Seats have been flipped.

I got active when Tr*mp won. Sometimes dark times test us and make us act.

That's called gaslighting.
I think there‚Äôs something far more poignant to be said about being ‚Äúsinful‚Äù: despite us being called such, many of us are far more familiar with compassion than those who claim it as doctrine.
Preach! No more politely asking for our place! 

""We're here we're queer, get used to it!""
This is unfortunately true to nearly everyone. But trans people get it extra bad.
That's why I want to set up a Queer Mutual Aid Network. And why every queer person should be armed.
So violence and trial time? Are we finally not just looking at the surface level for the second amendment and actually fighting the government and forming a well made militia/people's court to give us the rights we were promised? If so I'm in.
I'm SO sorry.

I feel like this is something people don‚Äôt talk about much. I didn‚Äôt figure out about this issue until after I changed my name and went to buy a house. The amount of time I had to devote to yelling at equifax was beyond what anyone should have to rationally do. It took a tremendously stressful period of time and multiplied it by 100. I was literally throwing up from stress towards the end of it.

Luckily I was able to resolve it (at least for this specific loan), but I was very very lucky. From other anecdotes I read they never are able to resolve it.

The fact that companies own our data like that is terrifying to me.
Why are they denyed housing? What career did you have?

As someone who is just now understanding how what it means to be trans I want to know more about you guys.

Im still learning. I feel so awful I couldn‚Äôt grasp what it meant to be trans as a cis women and you have my full support now.

Im so very sorry you are suffering because of other people‚Äôs ignorance. I wish you the best and stay safe out there!
I somehow managed to get a home loan 2 months after i changed my name. Maybe it was because I still had mixed documents?

I personally never advocate violence...but I also never *not* advocate violence, either...

Thats a horrible idea and would not go down well at all, it would only hurt our cause. Unless ofcourse you forgot to type /s or something.
There are many laws in the US that restrict gender-affirming care, especially for those under 18 years old. There are also some pharmacies that allow staff to refuse to give HRT and other gender-affirming medications (or contraception, etc.) to patients because it goes against the staff member's religious beliefs.

As someone who has worked in healthcare my entire adult life, this infuriates me and is something we have to fight against and work to improve every day here.
I think others have answered this question but wanted to add that for trans masculine people who want hormone therapy, testosterone is counted as a controlled substance in the US so I have to go through all sorts of extra bullshit with doctors and pharmacies to get it. I can never get extra just in case, it's always just enough so situations like I'm currently in, where my primary care doctor just up and quit so my appointment was moved means I have to go without for 3 weeks. It's a bit like suddenly stopping depression medication (never do this!) and very debilitating to my mental health right now, I can barely get out of bed.
  Also I have heard of other people being harassed by police for having their medicine in the car with them which of course in the US the cops basically do whatever they want it doesn't matter the law if you're someone who was disowned by family and living on the fringes for example.
Telling a pagan they are going to Hell is like telling a Christian they are going to Mordor. 

Actually, the ""correct"" text is **strictures**, not **scriptures** \- ie, we don't follow their strict codes of moral conduct. Imagine it like telling someone ""You can't eat that doughnut because I'm diabetic"" and you might get the idea.

Besides, ""sin"" is a concept designed to make slaves of adherents. And it's a horrible corruption of the original Latin sin/e - to be without (ie, to have none/noting)
I expect that will happen again in the near future at the rate rights are being rolled back...
When I updated my name with SSA, my state, and the various bank/insurance accounts everything seemingly transferred over. I‚Äôve since opened a new credit card account in my current name and the credit pull was done with my current name and was accurate. I think they only checked transunion though. There was a three month or so period where my credit score wasn‚Äôt updating if I looked at it through my credit Union, but it seems fine now. 

I‚Äôm genuinely curious what kind of problems you faced? Did you have to actually call the credit bureaus to update things with them? Cause my wife and I are looking to buy a place this year and it would be good to be prepared for any weird things that might arise.
In several states in the US, it is still legal to deny housing to trans persons
No one is obligated to do all of it, but we are all obligated to do some.

The transphobes.
""Our cause"" what does that even mean?
Oh damn, thank you for your answer.

I knew that medical stuff can refuse certain procedures if it's against their religion but it's illegal for pharmacist to refuse to give medication in my country.

Is psychological care restricted by those laws as well?
Oh that's crazy, I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing this!
So transunion and experian both updated without any issue for me. The issue was solely with Equifax (and I have heard the same from others).

Equifax had me first listed under my deadname, then they told me that they were updating it but It would take 30+ days to process (which is not an option in this type of housing market), when I was able to escalate after numerous calls my name was fixed but my credit was wiped out, which led to me having to go to the beginning of the process. My loan officer ended up also having to contact them which escalated it further. In the end, I got it fixed for the loan (though equifax still has inconsistent info and has my old middle name), but if I had to get another loan it may end up still raising flags.

All of this is to say‚Ä¶ check your credit with the three major companies BEFORE putting an offer down for a house. This may seem obvious, but it‚Äôs a complicated process and things can easily fall through the cracks.

Edit: I simplified this whole story because I don‚Äôt like thinking about it, but every action required regoing through their telephone queue. When I submitted the documents I had to wait for weeks to be told it would take a month to process and update. Every phone call was coupled with a requirement of waiting in a 30 minute queue and needing to retell my story again and again starting from the beginning (also having to out myself each time). To make it worse I get severe anxiety with making phone calls :/
I‚Äôm just so tired of fighting to barely even exist
Yeah dude was bad ass
I will accept your explanation :)
ohh alright, ty for the explanation
""pahz...a fair answer""

gawd that game camr out over ten years ago and I still enjoy playing it :P
us having rights - they would say that it‚Äôs proof we‚Äôre violent and then use that as a reason to deny us further rights
You are very welcome!

To my knowledge, no. Mental healthcare is not specifically banned but I am in no way an authority on the subject. I also do not live in those states so while I do keep all LGBTQ/Human rights legislation in mind, I focus more on stuff that affects my local community first.

I will elaborate though, for emergent situations all life-saving treatment is protected by Federal Law, regardless of the provider's beliefs. For non-emergent situations or non-life-threatening ones, then they can choose to withhold care (at least in general).

Personally, as someone who works in the field, a provider's personal beliefs (religious or otherwise) should have absolutely no bearing on the care you provide to a patient. We swear to do no harm and are in the field to help and care for others. If you can not set your beliefs aside and advocate for your patient then that provider needs to find another career.
I've been trying to update Equifax for months

Their stupid website has a dispute section for names even and whenever I try to upload my files it gives me a message telling me it can't complete my dispute because I need to upload my files....which I'm doing but it's all fucked up and won't acknowledge they were uploaded or something

I mailed them a letter requesting a change and haven't heard anything from them
Thank you for elaborating, I really really appreciate the insight. This is all really helpful for me and will hopefully save me from a similar headache. Sorry you had to go through all that :(
That's why we all fight, so others may step in and take our place on the front lines when we grow weary.
Bad take
I absolutely agree with you, everyone should be able to access healthcare and provider's beliefs shouldn't affect it. I hope it will change to better.
agreed. A healthcare provider is in the business of helping ALL patients, not just the ones deemed worthy by whatever standard

I hate how cis women always have to make trans-inclusive language about *them*	"I don't have the energy to elaborate much, but basically- my existance as a trans man does not ""erase"" the ""female experience"" or whatever the fuck

Acknowledging that I have a uterus, am capable of becoming pregnant, that I still need to access """"female"""" healthcare (cervical cancer screenings and the like) does not ""invalidate"" your identity as a mother or as woman, because *women are also people*, and *being a woman is not defined by your ability to bear or raise children. This is basic feminism for the love of GOD*

I don't *care* if you call yourself a mother. I don't care if you make groups for mothers. I don't care if you casually refer to pregnancy as something that happens to women. I care if the acknowledgement that uterus-haver != woman is treated as stupid, or worse, ***oppressive***, *somehow*, to the point where a legally transitioned trans man can't even access the right type of healthcare because of it. It's not *about* you, for fucks sake

Seriously, there's so much *actual* shit that women have to face for being women and being pregnant. ""Pregnant people"" as a phrase is not one of them"	"So. True. And then some will have the audacity to be like ""why can't we just keep it as 'women' in these legislative papers, it's not like it's hurting anybody!"" As if trans men and nonbinary people with that anatomy aren't literally being turned away from healthcare that can prevent diseases and save lives because they don't fit in that definition. Of course insurance won't cover it if you don't match what's on paper exactly -_-
What winds me up even more about the cis women who complain about this is that often the official guidelines on these alternatives is only to provide the neutral terms so that *if* they happen to treat a trans man or non-binary person then they have those terms already.

Like the whole chest-feeding thing, people ran with it and said that they're ""banning"" the use of ""breastfeeding"" when actually they never did that, they just said ""hey, if your patient isn't a woman, here's the alternative term to use""
oh while we‚Äôre at it I hate the fact I‚Äôve have multiple cis women ask when i‚Äôm getting ‚Äúthe surgery‚Äù like It‚Äôs 20k, risky, and i‚Äôm only 3 and 1/2 months on hormones I couldn‚Äôt even If I wanted to. idk it annoys the f out of me when I get asked this
I am reminded of a joke (bear with me, I'm not making light of your complaints, I'm treating them very seriously):

It's the middle of the night. A guy is standing under a street lamp, looking around with a worried expression on his face.

Another dude walks up to him.

""Hey, is something wrong?""  
""Uh, yeah, actually. I think I lost my watch.""  
""Aw man, that's too bad. Maybe I can help you look for it. Where'd you drop it?""

""Oh, over there,"" the guy points to the distance, ""in the forest.""

""Why would you look for your watch here, then?""

""It's brighter over here.""

\----------  
In terms of oppression and systemic or societal problems and looking for solutions, many people - and that very much includes transphobic people - tend to take a ""it's brighter over here"" approach. Will trans women in bathrooms somehow lead to more sexual assault? No - if anything, the opposite. Is referring to a person as an uterus-haver or a pregnant person going to make healthcare related to pregnancy worse? Again - no, probably the opposite in the long run.

Why say awful things about trans people, then, when it helps no-one in a tangible way and doesn't even make much sense? Why make up oppression where none seems to exist? Well, it's brighter over here. Cis people don't have to wander to that dark forest to look for things that would \*actually\* benefit them.

This is not exclusive to trans people, I'm pretty sure this misplaced hostility happens to any oppressed, marginalised or disenfranchised group. But it sure as heck is prominent in the context of trans people, recently.
Just want to say you're right, and your voice deserves to be heard.
It's really unacceptable too, the number of people who think this is all somehow designed to spare trans women's feelings when there are trans men literally suffering and even dying because of the lack of appropriate medical care.
My aunt was talking to my mom about this. Ugh it made me so mad, it was a conversation about periods and how trans masculine or nonbinary people that have periods or something are erasing her experience as a cis woman. I don‚Äôt know her exact words or what it was all about, but it was something along the lines of that.

I‚Äôm done with that crap, I don‚Äôt know how trans people having other terms for things effects her at all. That was like the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced a bit of transphobia from someone close to me.
Just sexism boiled down
Big huge hugs, this is one of those things my wife struggles with.  One of the harder reasons is woman in their 50+ were still fighting hard for ""Womens rights"" like the right to own a credit card in their name separate from their husbands.   And Women (or people) are still fighting for the right for choice over their body and pregnancy.  And that's a HUGE deal in many parts of the world still.  It shouldn't be but it absolutely is.

So unfortunately some woman are afraid of angry patriarchal men taking away these rights (and others).  And they fear any change in the wording of ""Women's XYZ"" is a potential slip against the male patriarchy.  

I don't know how you solve this problem in the short term.  Trans people deserve to have the right to be people in all aspects of their lives.  But unfortunately hateful patriarchal men (and women willing to stand behind them) have created an absolute shit show for all of us.  We're all fighting for our rights, but getting written and embraced in law together has become an exercise in fear for any step back on either sides problems vs the patriarchy.

I really hate it, but all we can do is say and fight for what's right for all people.
fr tho. go to r/TrueOffMyChest and there are soo many posts from cis women complaining about trans-inclusive language like wtf.
I really just gave up on them a long time ago.
Just more reason to keep it to yourself whenever possible.
I feel like I might know what triggered this. That post was a bunch of TERFs and closet TERFs finding another excuse to complain about trans people. Because somehow the existence of us, whether masc or femme, is DEstRoyInG BIoLoGIcaL fEmAlEs.
Agreed - as a trans woman, I find it ridiculous that my health insurance keeps spamming me with reminders to get my pap-smear ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The healthcare system really needs to wake up and provide better integration and support for groups other than cis white men and cis white women.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve had this experience ü´Çü´Çü´Ç
I wonder how much of it is a subconscious reaction to patriarchy. Like, we trans men always existed of course, but the social expectation until very, very recently (and let's be honest, still is), was that only women can get pregnant and be mothers. I wonder if to a subconscious level it feels like men are trying to intrude in a space that traditionally is one of the few fields where women can shine and get attention and recognition.
I have the opposite problem, as a trans women, people exclude me from conversations about male reproduction and female ones too lol. I will probably be having my kids with my better half with my own tools since I have little desire to medically transition but regardless, i often have to remind people that i deserve an opinion in such things too
[deleted]
I once took part in a ""Diversity in Public Health"" conversation where this came up. The person running the event said they decided to default to ""pregnant women"" because ""In our focus groups, we found that women resisted gendered language like 'pregnant people.'""

And then there's me sitting there dumbfounded, trying to figure out why they called ""people"" gendered language, but not ""women.""
The trans experience is basically just a footnote to cis people problems. People insist on misgendering me, it happens most places I go. But the poor cis people can't use 2 word think of the children!!

Sorry had to get that of my chest üòÇüòÇ
JK Rowling is shaking.

No but you are a 3000% correct, honestly it‚Äôs just straight up stupid. They get defensive before being attacked. IN SPITE of being attacked, rather.
I feel this as someone who uses ‚Äúpregnant person‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthing person‚Äù and gets accused all the time for erasing women, like no I‚Äôm literally just trying to be inclusive of my and other trans mascs birth experience but go off
THANK YOU!
So true, unfortunately. I'm a cis woman who is still a virgin and I feel you. I will be more careful about this.
Well said.
Jesus christ I am so tired of this! I am soooo fucking tired of this. I absolutely 10000% agree.
Some people make everything about themselves. You can only shake your head and move on. Not to excuse it, but people often feel these ways because they themselves are closeted trans people. It sounds a lot to me like ""I'm not totally satisfied with my gender, but some aspects are comforting to me. If this person wasn't satisfied and they transitioned, it erases my struggle because I'm not transmasc""
yeah, i remember a post on r/trueoffmychest that was about language surrounding people who have the ability to bear children. it sucks and I hate the fact that subreddit has a negative post about trans people almost everyday, and the comments are always burning dumpster fire. at this point they have to be karma farming troll posts; i'm sure these people don't actually wanna have genuine and understanding conversations about trans people. 

I thought that argument was stupid and all people who can have kids should be comfortable during the pregnancy and birth, according to their health needs and their gender. I feel like women feel like something is being ""taken away"", but thats a foolish thought because trans masculine people and trans men having babies doesn't change the fact that most babies are made by cis women. We deserve to have inclusive language, comfortable terminology and a happy experience if we choose to have children as people with uteruses, and it is unfair we do not get that chance.
since it seems most other people have responded better answers than i could come up with.

&#x200B;

isnt it != not =! ? (also isnt it funny most people who have transitioned or transitioning are programmers :P)
This reminded me how TERFS boycotted a cancer charity for saying people instead of women üíÄ

Apparently to them women aren't people lol
As a cis woman...I have to admit that I find this ultra stupid because those people care only about one certain version of womanhood. 

Women =|= baby-machine 
Not everyone who can have a baby must be what they perceive as a woman. 
Not everyone who corresponds to their definition of a woman needs to be able to or want to have babies. 

A person with cancer is a cancer-patient. We don't call prostate cancer-patients ""men"" as a whole either, do we? 
A person with a bun in the oven is a pregnant person. Easy. It's a fact. 

To me, all of this sounds like fake-outrage from some people. Detailed and specific language is for the better...we don't call any non-white person ""a savage"" anymore either. 
üôÑüôÑüôÑ
This is what lat√≠n American TERFs have been screeching about recently, I saw one of them missgendering a trans dude when he explained her why those terms exist.
Literally. I just HATE when they say ,,female healthcare"" ,,women experience"" or ,,female struggles"". Why they always refuse to include trans people. We share the same struggles, yet they act like it's just theirs. That's just unfair.
this is so hard to follow im a bit confused what the real issue is here that is being expressed
Bunch of self centered scared manipulated people running around on this planet right now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Fuck transphobes and TERFs. They are not feminists, by definition. Just transphobes pretending to speak from feminism, the bunch of covert narcissists who always want to be perceived as the victims, while their only binding goal is perpetuating gender-based *abuse*. Transphobes calling themselves feminists is a serious insult and at this point, injury, to feminism.

And obviously to us. But their false pretense of feminism is too much. They are exactly like ""pro lifers"" who say their goal is protecting babies, when it's really harming women. Terfs say their goal is protecting women, when it's really harming trans people.

They wear costumes of decency to commit acts of harm. 

The costume is there not just to inflate their influence, but to assist their control tactic of keeping the 'good person/innocent/victim' role squarely on themselves in the public eye. It's a version of DARVO (Deny wrongdoing, and Accuse the person who called them out of being the ""real"" wrongdoer, Reversing Victim and Offender.)

Accusing real victims of being the real abusers is abhorrent, which is exactly what they are doing to us, then DARVOing onto us, in order to claim that such abhorrent things are *only really* being done to THEM by the Bad Trans.

They are textbook **covert narcissists**, as in clinical **narcissistic personality disorder**, displaying common behavioral results of narcissistic thinking patterns. I think it would benefit anybody's social defenses to look up info sources that dig deep into those bolded terms (there are many!) to learn to spot each part of their universally similar sets of manipulation tactics, in order to learn to understand them for what they are when you encounter them!  Studying this topic, and joining various ""dealing with narcissists"" subreddits (...there are too many to list), has helped me more than I can briefly say.)

TL;DRish: Don't believe TERF's good-guy costumes, words, or self-applied labels, especially the 'feminist' one, and anything to do with having scientific or medical expertise, nor with having the support of feminism or of other women in general. It's all just triangulation manipulation. 

Believe their actions, and the intended real-world consequences of these actions. That makes their true goals clear, despite all the bullshit. And applying this to TERFs shows just what they are: a single-issue hate group who wishes to cause harm to trans individuals.

Under all the smoke and mirrors, TERFs deserve no more legitimacy in debate than the KKK, who differ mainly in who they target for harm. They are no less full of shit than a klansman trying to explain why they are good and people of [race] are inherently bad, trying to give their bigotry false merit via triangulation of pretending to be backed by studies and research from prestigious institutions (which actually destroy their arguments, had they fully read or understood them).
I understand your point. 
But in my point of view it also has a sense: Law-Stuff. When it is needed to refer to the (ex)pregnant-people. Then the term 'Mother' terrifies me.
It fucking IS hurting people that‚Äôs why! But my favorite argument is: ‚Äùshould be change it just for a few people?‚Äù Uhhhh so you WANT minorities to be treated like shit, huh? Is that it? You just fucking HATE minorities and having to accomodate ANYTHING for them to feel even a LITTLE bit more included. Maybe we should just go back to calling everyone a man then? And not give a crap about women again? Fuck. You. It drives me insane. Stop being so triggered that there are other minorities that ALSO have issues. Jesus.
Not to mention that they're also implying I'm not a real woman because I *don't* have a uterus.
[deleted]
God IKR

They're acting like they're oppressed because SOME people use neutral language

litcherally 1984 /s
And while we're still at it I've seen some of them (talking about MtFs in this case) saying TERFy shit and going ""less than half of them ever get tHe SuRgErY and that should tell you all you need to know"". Yeah, that it's expensive, inaccessible, and highly uncertain, and that for some people social transition is good enough?
Did you get the surgery yet?
Put another way, trans people are much easier targets than the actual oppressors.
As a cis ally, I will take this to heart. I, too, am a marginalized person (I was given a bogus medical diagnosis at the age of 2).
Thank you
Yes, TERFs especially seem to think this all the time. I think it's because they have a much easier time hating on trans women (who they see as predatory men) while pretending they pity trans men (who they see as naive, misled girls). All their talking points boil down to ""the sort of sexism feminists were fighting in the 70s"".
I had to explain to a room full of cis health professionals at a talk that pregnancy is not a personal concern for me as a trans woman. A large number legitimately didn't even know that I couldn't get pregnant because they didn't know what ""trans woman"" meant; that's the level of ignorance in the room.
I will say it: burn the patriarchy!
There was one trending a few days ago, that's what this is partially in response to
TBF I haven't actually had any *direct* experiences with cis women saying this to me, I've just seen a lot of cis women online repeat the same BS (like that post on trueoffmychest that was trending a while back)
But I thought trans men were supposed to be poor confused little autistic girls, not scary male invaders! /s

Oh, right. Their portrayal of us shifts to whichever makes us a more convenient target. Not to mention the number of people who think this is for trans women's sake, somehow

(Not saying I disagree with you, your point is valid and it's an understandable (?) gut reaction for a cis woman to have. key word being ""gut reaction"")
it's interesting that you say you're excluded from both discussions, while trans men are often lumped into women's spaces. Reminds me of [this essay](https://nothorses.tumblr.com/post/665231771105902592/embed)

Dunno if the link works, but it's about how manhood is viewed as a competition, whereas womanhood is viewed as an obligation, which is why trans people (""failed"" men/women) are treated differently
Absolutely! Enby afab, although my ability to safely carry a pregnancy is negated by my uterus and tubes throwing a tantrum (yay endometriosis üôÑ). I'm not a walking baby factory and this terf shite needs to find its way into a black hole, taking JK with it.
[deleted]
the mental gymnastics you have to do to think ""woman"" is less gendered than ""person""...
Occasionally when someone says that I am this ü§è close to snapping and being like ""oh you think the word people is erasing women? So you don't think women are people? Thats kind of sexist."" It's not very nice and a deliberate misinterpretation of what i know they're trying to say, but I'm tempted sometimes.
Yeah that‚Äôs‚Ä¶weird of them. They‚Äôre *literally* included in ‚Äúpregnant person‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthing person‚Äù.
üëä You‚Äôre a real one ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
Oh, it probably is lmao, I'm not a programmer I just use it because I don't have a symbol for the crossed-out equals sign
A lot of cis women wrongly believe saying ""pregnant people"" erases and oppresses women. They insist on language that excludes AFAB people who aren't women. That's a major problem because it increases the risk that a trans man with M as his gender record might be denied important services by ignorant doctors and insurance companies.
Yeah, sorry if it's hard to read. I wrote this as a rant, I didn't expect it to get as much attention as it did
you have some good points, but I feel like straight-up armchair diagnosing them with NPD is shitty. Most abusers are neurotypical
Wdym? I'm not sure I get your point
Many people don't really think through their political beliefs, they just go by whatever they have a strong emotional reaction to. Whether or not its contradictory or leads to bad outcomes doesn't matter.
You're so right, and that makes it even worse. They're really sprinkling a little bit of ""let's just invalidate and hurt everybody in the trans community"" in, huh?
Because governments have demonstrated good judgment, the ability to take in new information and react and be accountable to those they represent.     

What has government done to earn such trust and devotion?
I just dont like surgery at all. The idea of being out and under a knife for like half a day and then the recovery process scares the shit out of me. I would never consider it tbh.

(I've also put off getting my wisdom teeth removed for this same reason, I just hate surgery and anesthetic)
In simple words, yes.  


It's easier to punch down and make oneself feel a little better for a while, and even feel like one is Making a Difference For the Better.  


It's a lie, and an insidious one, but it's clear where it sometimes comes from.
agreed
> health professionals

Geez, that's concerning
[deleted]
They didn't push their ideals on anyone. They said we shouldn't reduce *all women* to their potential or actual pregnancy. Nobody said ""No woman should want to be a mother or stay home.""
you wanting to be a mother (good on you!) does not equal your worth being directly connected to your potential babymaking. you're fighting the wrong people here honey
Wtf you really got that internal misogynist vibes üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I mean what other implications are there to them thinking the word ‚Äúperson‚Äù excludes women? I think it‚Äôs just the natural progression of their hypocritical bs lol you would be NTA for pointing that out to them
A real what? I don't understand.
ok thanks yea that is not a good thing to happen. I always wondered about the whole gender neutral terminology in reference to health care typically used for women like as in who it applied too. I never thought about it being for trans men who still might do those things or need that type of care and the word women doesn't apply to them. I always love to learn new things.
Lol u good i am dyslexic so lol üòÇ
FARTs really do make everything worse.
When I was a kid I was so terrified of surgery I used to say that if I had a life threatening condition requiring surgery, I would just let it take me. I also put off my wisdom teeth surgery for years (got it in my early 30s) because I was so scared I‚Äôd never wake up. I hadn‚Äôt been under general at that point but I sucked it up and let me tell you, it was awesome! I had the most beautiful dream/hallucinations that when I woke up I told the nurse that she and I had been walking up a mountain in the sun set and everything was pink and purple and beautiful and we were in the clouds‚Ä¶ and then I burst out crying because I would never see purple mountain again. I cried and hugged all the staff when I was leaving and in the Uber on the way home I asked my partner why we can‚Äôt take general anaesthetic every night before bed because it‚Äôs AWESOME! 

However, they only gave me a few days worth of pain killers and I was in massive pain for two weeks. I had to go back for more *and* use some spares I had. This was for an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù surgery that removed all four teeth in less than 30 minutes (but left a large shard of tooth in my gums that was fighting its way out). Everyone reacts to surgery differently but I hate pain and it was such a crap recovery, especially as I was told I‚Äôd be fine by day 5 and I was still calling in sick by day 10. (I have fibromyalgia though so everything hurts more.) Currently I don‚Äôt have health insurance but I was recently told I have a deviated septum, nose polyps and the only way I‚Äôll be able to breathe normally is surgery. I don‚Äôt have any prospects for that now and it‚Äôs still terrifying even though it might solve a bunch of health issues for me, so I guess until then I‚Äôll just struggle to breathe.

So yeah, in our society of nip/tucking and excessive surgery people think it‚Äôs no big deal but it‚Äôs a big decision to go under the knife, especially if something isn‚Äôt life threatening (though I know for many people not getting top/bottom surgery *is* life threatening). It‚Äôs not a decision to be taken lightly, plus on top of that I understand that many surgeons require hormone therapy cessation temporarily (for 6 weeks?) before surgery, which can be scary. And if anyone makes a judgement about not having surgery, I mean are they going to fucking pay for it? Again, people act like it‚Äôs no big deal to have 20K lying around or like taking out credit or a loan for that much is easy. 

Surgery is scary. People who opt for it are very brave, have the means, often have/need good support systems for afterwards, have job security or prospects that they can look forward to afterwards etc. Not everyone is in that position. You do you and screw what anyone else says. I know that‚Äôs easier said than done, but people need to mind their own goddamn business.
[deleted]
Oh God please no don't let this types of people have children üíÄ
Whew, harder to explain than tell but I‚Äôll do what I can. A real‚Ä¶quality person, ally, friend, bro, sister in spirit.
This is a space for these ideals. You do not share them. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd want to stay here.

I get misgendered as a cis woman by transphobes because of my job. Just because you‚Äôre getting misgendered doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not ‚Äúpassing‚Äù	"I work in healthcare related to gender so work with trans youth a lot. I also work with transphobic parents. I‚Äôm a cis woman.

When the parents learn some staff are trans, especially if I tell them that, they sometimes assume I‚Äôm probably trans. I pass as cis. I‚Äôm never misgendered in another context, so I know this is why. It‚Äôs a guess. So when they deliberately misgender me, that tells me some things, and one of them I thought I might share is just this - especially to young people - to reaffirm if you feel you pass then get misgendered and feel dysphoric and terrible - it doesn‚Äôt mean you necessarily don‚Äôt pass. It could be a pure guess. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the hate you‚Äôre getting. I‚Äôm sorry for how terrible it is right now. Passing isn‚Äôt everything but that‚Äôs easy for me to say. Things won‚Äôt always be so dire. 

A young person said I should tell other young people this is it made them feel a lot better. In solidarity."	"Anyone who misgenders their healthcare provider is making a very dangerous choice. Not saying the healthcare worker will do something bad, but making them stress out even when they could be attempting to save your life seems like a very bad decision.
A different kind of situation but my bf is a cis man with a quite androgynous voice.
He often speak with strangers on the phone and they often call him by a femme version of his name and misgender him simply because his voice isn't clearly masc and it is hard for most people to actually listen to what they are told when they have already made an assumption.
And this is people who is not malicious or for some stupid reason is out to misgender others
[removed]
Thanks for your kind words<3üíï
Thank you, I needed to hear this...
This is why ‚Äúpassing‚Äù is a bad metric for transition. I understand why it‚Äôs necessary for some people‚Äôs safety, and I get why some people desire and pursue it, but it ultimately has nothing to do with transitioning ‚Äúsuccessfully.‚Äù
I thought this was written as a trans woman who was somehow being called a cis woman and referring to it as misgendering.

Jfc my dyslexia did not like your title lol
I have people over the phone change pronouns mid convo. My voice passes but I'm still legally deadname so they'll call me ma'am until they see my obvious male name, and then proceed to interrogate me that they are in fact talking to deadname.
When i say yes, and authenticate, and then tell them I'm nb and to by Kirby, they change pronouns on me. 

I hit them with the correction real quick. I know it probably gives them whiplash, but why the fuck are they assuming my gender at all. 

Bout to start making a real serious effort to be called Mx. by govt workers and making sure they know the conversation is not proceeding until they can do it haha
‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
i didn‚Äôt think about the misgendering being *purposely,* might need to take note of that
You are a kind soul, and thank you for making our days that much easier
I do appreciate it
It‚Äôs *really* bad for us right now. And many of us, especially the younger ones, only see it getting worse in the future.

Thank you for the work you do and the support you give trans youth. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say it‚Äôs absolutely life-saving.
Yeah I'm a trans dude and get mistaken for being a trans woman weirdly often cus I'm built like a brick but have a chest and I like makeup. It's funny getting called sir (in a rude voice) and just staring at them until they realise I have d cups and an ass and realise they just validated the gender of a trans man.
Also cis, and also i get this too.
You‚Äôre lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è
In a similar vein, I'm the gurly girl type and I always enjoy getting gussied up to do anywhere outside our house. My wife couldn't car less about what she wears and it causes odd occurrences. She gets misgendered as a gun or my husband all the time. I'm the trans woman, she is a cis women. It's just sooo odd. Just because I'm all dressed up and she is in sweats. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Any hoo. She is used to it from all the abuse her mom put her through growing up. Everybody thought it was PCOS but was really a sterly laidig tumor converting her e to t. So hair and such. But she isn't a small girl if u know what I mean. Any hoo. Just always gives us a pause when someone makes the mistake. We figure it's a mistake because she hadn't spoke before the moment, and I'm all done up to the 9's ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yah.
As far as helth care.
I'm a disabled combat vet so I receive all my care from the VA and they are best if the best to me. Less my old primary. Absolutely had it out for me. Everything you could name. False self harm reposts to get me denied care. Trying to lie about me being able to safety take hrt by explaining my stattons will kill me if I go on e. Lol. No. Also constantly refering to my male physiology and trying to constantly remind me that I will never be away from it and we will always have to treat everything as if I'm a male and I need to get used to that I will never actually be a woman. Funny all of my labs I'm more woman than man. I may or may not have male or female chromosomes, we never tested. It doesn't matter. Anyways. Once I opened my mouth to my transmission doctors they quickly started an investigation and got me moved over to their office for everything.

So. Aside from the 1. Absolutely everyone has been so helpful, uplifting, empowering, and really has made me feel safe and at home and I really feel amazing in their care and can't wait for each next step on my journey.
A lot of us that do pass and have been at this for a while are well aware of this happening. I see people misgendering random cis women at the store, I've had old white ladies randomly poke me on the back to point out the t-slur to me without realizing I'm trans and the person they're pointing out is clearly cis.

Transphobes do not know what 99% of trans people look like and it becomes more and more clear every day.
I definitely feel this. I‚Äôm a trans woman, I completely understand the desire a lot of us have to ‚Äúpass‚Äù. 

But, here‚Äôs the thing. If I am having a day where I 100% do not pass by any reasonable standard‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm wearing a dress, carrying a purse, and wearing heels‚Ä¶and you still decide to call me ‚Äúsir‚Äù‚Ä¶that has *NOTHING* to do with me. Any reasonable, empathetic human being would either ask me my pronouns or pick up on the very obvious gender markers I‚Äôm using and call me ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù. So calling me ‚Äúsir‚Äù in that situation is nothing but you being an asshole and trying to hurt me. 

Which, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It does hurt. But the sting is softened by knowing that it‚Äôs never an innocent mistake. It‚Äôs always a choice. That person could either choose kindness or they could choose hate. And if they‚Äôre the type to choose hate? Why should I give a fuck what they think?
I get misgendered at my job... but only by my bosses. Customers don't know shit. Its been months, I know I pass (in voice too), not that it should matter. They do it just to hurt me, or because they just don't fucking care. It does hurt but I'm starting to tell myself to ignore it. At the end of the day theyre just fucking assholes and I'm better off paying them no mind.
Thank you for this! üíú
I'm AFAB and people call me a boy and an ugly man all the time. I'm not FtM either, I just got a weird face lol

And then some people think I don't know what being trans is like because I'm AFAB and not MtF, and even others assume I'm just MtF because I look feminine and state I'm trans.

I don't think passing even is a thing, it's all just blind guess work most of the time. In reality, anyone can look like anything.
Thank you for explaining this.  I'm a passing trans woman and have been trying to explain this to younger trans women for awhile, but they have a hard time listening.  Every time I feel dysphoric, I find my same features among cis women, often even models !  Thanks for saying this; It means a lot more coming from a cis woman.
Thank you for this post. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for your solidarity and humanity. ‚ù§Ô∏è It's easy to give up on cis folks but every now and again someone does something nice or actually gets it. ‚ú®
I was going to agree, but then you said ""it was a guess"" when what I was reading was ""you gave transphobes the information that trans people exist in their vicinity, so they start misgendering every person around to make sure they cause as much damage as possible"". No offense, but you need to understand that they say this stuff *specifically to hurt us and to make a statement that they don't support us*. Normal people don't go around trying to ""guess"" people's gender, because normal people know gender-neutral terminology exists, transphobes refuse to use said language even if it makes them look stupid, same as they'll look a cis woman in the face and call her a man, just because there's a chance to disapprove a trans person.

So yeah, sorry, but you were close, but these people aren't invalidating your existence so it's not quite the same
Very cool
Definitely wouldn‚Äôt help the situation at all. When I occasionally get misgendered it totally throws my train of thought off the rails for a few moments. 

It seems like a good comparison would be popping a balloon behind someone when they‚Äôre trying to give a speech or cutting your hair
To people like that, their hatred is more important than anything else. It's the same mentality when a racist has a non white nurse. They'd rather be phobic than think beyond the next minute!
""Oops, that wasn't medicine""
Oh I work in healthcare and am hoping to become a mid-level provider soon. In the field, we know how to just put that all aside and care for the patient. But if someone actively is awful to us and does stuff in malicious intent, we can just fire the patient if they're not in a life threatening situation. So a basic checkup? Yeah, we can make you find someone else.

I have a high and femme voice and on the phone people change my name Jasper to a surname (that is very common surname here and suitable for any gender) Jaspers. Nobody had ever met a Jasper that sounds like me. So they change it in their head to make it make sense to them. Very odd to me but made me think of your bf‚Äôs xp haha
I saw trans and mental illness and got ready to bring out the keyboard üòÖüò≠
You were *this* close to getting the ban hammer lol
And there's only one cure... üòî
It's really weird how true this is. It's not limited to transphobia tho, it's more like conservatism and all the hate it foster is a mental illness. Unironically most Conservative just had their brain completely broken by mass media and social medias culture war narrative, it's honestly terrifying how brainwashed most of them are. They just react to shape and colors without really thinking about anything. Just talk to them about socialism without using the word and they will agree.

If anything, modern conservatism is a testament to the power of medias.
Well, a question that I've been exploring more and more often recently is ""what if bigotry was just narcissism applied to politics?"". I mean, I've had the displeasure of interracting with both many times in my life and it's astonishing how they both behave in the same way in so many ways.
Oh no sorry! I have dyslexia too. I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs not clear, I didn‚Äôt want to lead with ‚Äúas a cis woman‚Äù because i thought that would be even worse with how some people would initially feel on reading it, expecting some horrible full-on cisplaining which I‚Äôm really hoping it‚Äôs not coming across as and is definitely the risk with this one.
Not dyslexic (but ADHD). Took me a few goes to understand what OP meant too!
Thank the gods that Im not the only one trying to see the issue until my brain finally understood what the words were saying x.x
I also don‚Äôt want that to come across as though people will be being more hostile than they probably are either. It‚Äôs horrible, I know it feels bad either way but sometimes people are guessing, could be because there‚Äôs something ambiguous about your gender, but that could be in expression, or it could be in some mean attempt to make a guess and be hurtful. I suppose my point is it depends so much on your situation, but a lot of young people I work with give me these bogus reasons they think they don‚Äôt pass when they absolutely do, and it‚Äôs stuff like this that doesn‚Äôt help for them. 

I‚Äôm so sorry if this has added in more of a sense of people being hostile to you, it‚Äôs not intended that way. I just think these instances of hostility show exemplars that sometimes it‚Äôs a guess but you feel like they‚Äôve clocked you and the dysphoria from that can just be gut wrenching.

You know what it might be helpful to look at some of the other comments here because people give these brilliant examples of cis people who generally pass as cis being misgendered for non-hostile reasons too.
Yeah my trans friends find this too. I think it‚Äôs more powerful as a message from a trans adult than from a cis adult as well.
Thank you for trying to help younger people as well. I know it‚Äôs so so hard for them and easy for me to say as I‚Äôm not going through it.
No sorry, that wasn‚Äôt clear, what I mean is they made a guess that I must be a trans woman. So we‚Äôre in agreement, it‚Äôs intentional, they just thought they got the right person but they didn‚Äôt, because they couldn‚Äôt tell who was trans/had previously assumed all staff were cis because all of the staff pass as their gender. They‚Äôre ironically admitting that they can‚Äôt actually ‚Äúalways tell‚Äù as they think they can.

Also I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs come across that I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs hard for me, i don‚Äôt experience dysphoria so it‚Äôs not any harder than anyone being hostile to me as a healthcare worker. It jumps out though, and it‚Äôs interesting l. I will also say that most families are not at all like this.
Anti-choicers (the bigots are all the same people really though) will yell at abortion nurses while they're a patient on the table. These people are not even thinking in the moment.
That‚Äôs awesome and I appreciate how professional healthcare workers are. However personally, I would never deliberately antagonize my nurse or doctor lol.
Nah. Being misgendered is really bad. Shouldn‚Äôt expect people to be able to shrug it off
Cis genders people have the luxury of having their genders affirmed all the time. I've seen it throw them off when they get misgendered too. Despite what you may think it's a common human experience.
Spoken like an ignorant person who has never worked on the front lines of health care.

Health care workers are just people. When they don't get enough sleep, they make mistakes. When they don't like someone, they are prone to subconscious bias. When someone does something awful to them, like threatening them, yelling at them, or, yes, intentionally misgendering them, it affects their focus and their ability to do their best work.

I wouldn't ever purposefully antagonize a health care professional responsible for my care. It's a dumb and potentially dangerous thing to do. Keep in mind that while doctors hold to the Hippocratic oath, office workers and some medical assistants are not required to. I follow it as closely as I can, and so do most people involved in medicine, but do people slip through who might be willing to fake a mistake or tell you they don't have an appointment for the next two months to punish a bigot? Do you want to risk your life on the premise that every single person involved in any aspect of your medical care, every doctor, nurse, office worker, medical specialist, and insurance liaison, will totally forgive and be unaffected by purposeful bigotry?

I mean, it's your life. Do as you will. I'll be over here being polite and respectful to the people I am entrusting my life to.
Well if that‚Äôs how you feel, next time you‚Äôre getting a shot or an Iv, spook your nurse just before she stabs you, see how it goes.
yikes bro
Yeah people really be hearing what they expect.

The funny thing is that i got a significant hearing loss so i just avoid using someones name when i speak on the phone with them, and if i need their name for whatever reason i make sure that i actually got their name down and not just what I heard.

But what is weird that someone replied to my bf business email which is not only singed with his common nickname that he goes by but also got the full name in the email line with calling him a femme name. 
Someone not only assumed the wrong shortened name but also managed to reply to their email using an assumed full first name without even what it was signed with?
You were ready to drop some bombs lmao
I support banging cowbells in transphobes' faces
Conservatism is a fear-based disorder
One of my recurring thoughts around conservatism is that it *feels* really good to be a conservative because you‚Äôre always right. You‚Äôre seeing through all the liberal bs with your common sense and all these dreamer yahoos have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. They just need to get out of the way and let us real Americans handle it. Especially if you‚Äôre in a community that feels this way it‚Äôs the perfect reinforcing circle jerk. 

Whereas I‚Äôm very left, and it does not feel good. Looking at signs of escalating genocide for my people, the climate is increasingly fucked, still on stolen land (US), etc, etc‚Ä¶.
You're fine! It's not your fault at all
Lol
Oh it's best you don't, the level of patience we have for that shit is only so high lol eventually we can ask for another provider to step in if it becomes too bad.
i looked at their comment history and it‚Äôs just a bunch of transphobic bigotry
Wow! I have got that too but with my surname! My email is litterly jasper-surname-@ and i sign my emails with that as well. 
And then awnser me with the internet-fake-surname i had put in when i made the email account! 
One time i even did a ‚Äúmy surname is -surname-‚Äú and their next email was with the nickname as well! 

Names.. its a thing haha
*banging cowbells into transphobes faces
I think that's just a worry versus confidence.
For example, I'm confident that thanks to the internet progressive ideas will inevitably drown out conservative ideas. It'll take a lot of work but unless the internet goes away it can't be stopped. I'm not conservative at all; I try to make things better. I just try not to worry. If I spot despair, I respond with the hopeful logical.
Yeah it‚Äôs just a wild thing for me to consider that people actually do antagonize their providers over stuff like, being gay or trans or a different ethnicity
God its so annoying when that happens cause then you know youre not talking to someone with actual opinions, just regurgitated nonsense üíÄ
They antagonize providers when they're asked for a pee sample, trust me it's just part of the norm. People are scared, and the usual form of fear is anger and lashing out even at nonsensical stuff. Just gotta ignore what they say/do unless it crosses a very hard line, and take care of them as best as possible."	122o8n1	trans	1454	0.99	2023-03-26 14:40:00
am I going crazy? stepping into the comments with all of the upvotes and downvotes flipped is absurd		"Turns out the general public actually aren't nearly as transphobic as people think. Most people just don't really care. The ones that do get all riled up. I'm convinced trans acceptance is at an all time high and will continue it's trajectory. We're under fire BECAUSE we're visible and being accepted and the bigots are terrified of losing control
Depends on the sub, for some reason this was a good post/sub.

But make the mistake of stepping foot into a meme subreddit (dankmemes/memes/etc) and oh boy what a trip
That sub skews very left. And I‚Äôve seen the mods take strong stances against transphobia. Just goes to show not everyone is against us!
bit jarring to see that sub and others actually speaking out against this crap.
Another post about a similar topic on that reddit had the same happen. My comments + others got upvoted and transphobic stuff got downvoted.
FORCED FCKING DETRANSITION

I feel the strong urge to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* the people that decided that.
I follow her on Twitter and literally posted about her the other day.
It's seeing comments like that keep me alive. I'm so worn out by constant casual transphobia, sometimes even from other trans people. It creates this hopeless feeling.
Hey to any trans minors in these states you might be able to transition out of state. I know this is true for Utah. You most likely will have to pay without insurance though.
I mean there's more support than hate but there's still a LOT of transphobic circle jerking. Hell I saw someone with like -30 downvotes because they literally just asked someone to prove their bullshit
Considering the terminating treatment could lead to, and honestly . . . being force fed detransition when youre you for the first time . . . and if there was depression before . . . I'd they cared so much about harm they wouldn't be doing this. 

Anyone pushing any government dictated medical decisions should be immediately thrown out of office and into a prison.

This is horrific. Like can they even understand the damage they ARE doing or do they only care about damage that can be done if treatment is stopped immediately?

I'm not even sure why I'm saying this it's not like anyone who doesn't already know all this is paying attention to anything we say.

These people are zealous in their desire to purge us.

I just hope the families of those affected by this will do the right thing and move somewhere safe. I can't think of where would be safe though?
I've had friends moving out of California which seems like a safe state but the price of living, environmental issues, crime, all of that just makes that not good. 

New York? I don't know where else. I'm in Utah . . . I want out of Utah. I'm in the US, I want out of the US. 

I'd suggest we just make a new nation for trans people and family and friends who would rather move to a new nation than live in one built on the principals of religious persecution . . . but they would just use that as a way to wipe us all out easily with a WMD.

They're evil. Evil and heartless and thoughtless and cruel.
America is falling apart, let's just claim Scotland as our own
Really not surprised at this being passed in South Dakota.  Their government, and a lot of other aspects of life there, is in the dark ages.  It is the reddest of red states, you think Desantis is bad, go look at Kristi Noem, she's scary.  South Dakota is my home state and there are parts of it I really like, but it is one of the most dangerous places for anyone trans or queer to live.
I've seen this as well. The comments are mostly not against Trans, at least as I've seen it. Most people at least realize that human rights are stripped away. But my comment there has been downvoted af. I see it as a beginning of a slow genocide against Trans, even if they seem to disagree
Sock puppets and bots. The support genuinely outnumbers the hate, but it‚Äôs known that transphobes will resort to sock puppets and botting to make them look more reasonable.
Welp, time to go beat up Kristi noem
‚Äúthis is the land of the free, and we have so much freedom‚Äù meanwhile, daily shootings with regular mass shootings and school shootings with the government not sorting out gun control. Government actively trying to wipe out trans people and take rights and bodily autonomy away from anyone this is not a white cisgender male. Oh and did I mention a seriously awful reputation with every police force across the country. 

Land of the free‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got to be joking!
just wow i hate this country üò≠
That is horrible....
Pretty sure a guy I went to high school with helped with this shit. Rep. John Hansen. That place was so hard to grow up in. He seemed like a cool, nerdy, theatre and music kid when we were friends. Bummer. Such ignorance and hate.
I'm so scared
im in florida seeing shit like this jusy makes me piss my pants its so scary like genuinely üò≠
Scrolled through that‚Äôs last night and their was a ton of transphobia did they moderate it?
What age is being defined as ""youth""?
You know it‚Äôs weird that these bans don‚Äôt just effect trans kids. Cis people need hormones all the fucking time.
Looks like North Dakota is the better Dakota now.
Uhm.. this has to do with minors.. you guys aren't paying attention to the whole thing.. :/
I‚Äôm confused, what do you mean upvotes and downvoted being flipped? I don‚Äôt see anything weird for that sub
What the actual fuck
That's horrible!
Soon the cis won't have bodily autonomy either, it's a slippery slope.
I hope people start to become concerned about the Republican Party taking their rights away: pregnancy, books, transgender care, privacy, educational choices, etc..
^(Good god these right-wing freaks are evil.)
even if i ever am able to come out will i even be allowed to transition?
What. The. Actual. Fuck.  They're saying that we're trying to force others to transition? This is so fucked up! I'm sure this bullshit is going to be rolled out in here Texas soon, too.
and they say we force transition on people üôÑ
I've been thinking lately it has to do with declining birth rates and the ruling class being terrified of having a smaller surplus population to exploit. They got rid of Roe v Wade and immediately started going after gender non conformists. I'd bet their end goal is returning women to the role of property
I think Reddit skews young, and young skews left.
It's an uphill battle, but so is riding your bike up a hill. Just because it's an uphill battle doesn't mean it's a losing one.
I feel like there's some aspects of being trans that the average person is still uncomfortable with. I.e. trans people in sports, and change room access. But they still want to allow us to exist and the genocide being proposed my many states bothers them as much as it bothers us.
We are under fire because transphobes are starting to realize nothing else is working and transphobia is literally all they have left, and even that‚Äôs not working
r/memes & r/dankmemes users trying not to be racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic challenge (Impossible)
Even r/funny is dominated by turbo cringe transphobia
r/polls is pretty terrible too.
Really? It doesn't surprise me iirc there's always a top post regarding the latest in social justice
Yep im the one who posted this. It was really good until it hit the front page‚Ä¶.. then the awful comments came rushing in. And of course awful comments got like 50 upvotes because all the transphobes sort by controversial
Erin is the best
and in the cases where you need to pay without insurance USE GOODRX. it‚Äôs used in place of insurance and it has literally saved me over $1,500 in the mere 2 months i‚Äôve been on T.
Luckily minnesota is an amazing hub of transgender resources so hopefully it'll be accessible. Still we've seen a lot of legitimately fascist moves from South Dakota, like the courts blatantly overturning a referendum vote for legal cannabis.
Don‚Äôt lose hope‚Ä¶
You can come to Europe. 
There are some places, where you will be safe‚Ä¶
So you're against private gun ownership because of mass shootings but also think the government is trying to wipe you out? You might want to think things through a bit more.
Oh nice they did that‚Äôs sick
It's anyone under 18 from what I understand.
I think they mean that whenever they see a trans post in another subreddit that isn‚Äôt dedicated to the trans community, usually all pro trans comments get downvoted and anti trans posts get upvoted. For this post however, it‚Äôs actually pro trans.
Overall it's about restoring things the way they were when the US was not a unified country. Basically, they seem to be trying to go back to how it was when slavery was legal, women where only in the kitchen, and so on. The civil war never ended it just moved into the political chairs and now the crazies that dream of the past are hammering hard at it. At least this is how it has seemed the past decades.

And birth rates wouldn't be suffering so much if they actually gave a shit about people instead of making certain they stay under the poverty line and kept making it so people can't afford medical care.
I don't think that's the case. If they were concerned with having a smaller surplus population they wouldn't oppose immigration.
Nah that‚Äôs white replacement, not classism.
I think people attribute too much monolithic thinking to ‚Äúthe ruling class‚Äù transphobia isn‚Äôt a new concept, people have been hateful against anybody different for a long time. Jim Bob in Arkansas didn‚Äôt just get his transphobia chip triggered by the elite because they want a surplus of exploitable labor.
Handmaids tale anyone?
Yes, and I think largely because of military numbers. Less unwanted babies? Less military recruits. Smaller military? We fall to Russia, China, or whoever notices we‚Äôre ‚Äúweaker‚Äù first
And all under the guise of Christian love... when people force their personal beliefs on others which they learned in Sunday ""school"" instead of scientific factual evidence presented by highly educated, intelligent, experienced, professionals that have spent decades doing the work you have to question wtf is actually going on. The answer to 99 questions out of 100 in America is money.
I agree with you, but I also don't. It's about the area. 99% of teens here (where I live) are right leaning, they get it from their parents.
IIRC (I unfortunately don't have a source) millennials are actually becoming *more* left leaning as they get older.
Not just young most millennials are skewed left as well
Right, it's kind of like that period of time when public opinion of gay men became ""well as long as they don't try anything with me, whatever"".  Will some people talk shit behind your back? Absolutely.  But it's definitely better.
r/dankmemes has been getting better, r/memes used to be ok and is now spiraling into political circlejerking.

(Also not saying r/dankmemes is good, but from my observations hateful posts are starting to get less upvotes.)
I love it that reddit keeps trying to push r/memes on me no matter how much I rebuke that one. Incredibly jarring to be just scrolling through my normal stuff and ope! Here's some driveby bigotry from a subreddit you never subscribed to in your life!
or AITA, TwoXChromosomes, ... the list goes on
Yup, that one's awful too - pushed on me via algorithm just as often as r/memes is and it's almost always transphobic content thrown onto my feed.
I think they meant actively supporting trans rights - many of the subs that aren‚Äôt queer-related on here are intensely transphobic.
Yea but her constant posting made me feel terrified.
I dont know if I can. I'm on disability and I know some countries don't like that.
Honestly the fact that I'm in this community is one of the reasons I will never give up my guns. Gotta have a method of self defense.
‚ÄúGun control‚Äù never said get rid of them. Although place like the UK manage a lot better than the US! But the US is in such a state with too many people having access to guns that taking them all away would never happen. Also it‚Äôs wrong that people can go to their supermarket and buy a gun. Like seriously it needs to be controlled a lot more. 

You may want to learn to read before you start spewing off BS. And yes the US and UK government are trying to take steps to get rid of trans people and prevent us from being able to access care.
They seriously, how can you go through, so many school shootings and mass shootings and seriously not want more gun control. Kids are scared to go to school with the fear that they gonna get shot. Is that not reason enough for better gun control?
Oh I see, that makes sense, though I‚Äôm not too surprised that tfm is like that, it‚Äôs a pretty good sub
Its easier to exploit immigrants in their home countries.

Also, they want to keep America as white as possible.

Xenophobia is one hell of a drug.
American capitalists exploit workers worldwide. They don't actually care which country as long as the laws don't protect the workers. The massive amount of hate from the politicians is performative to rile up their target demographic and distract them from what actually causes their problems
not true‚Äîthey would much rather be able to procreate and multiply ‚Äútheir own‚Äù than accept immigrants into the country. we‚Äôre gonna revert to cousin fucking and marital r*pe being legalized in all 50 in the next 20 years if they get their way.
The caveat there is *white surplus
Being denied access to wealth, reasonable healthcare, pensions, reasonable housing, career advancement, etc will do that.
Yep, we got cheap houses in 2008-09, but most of us still have student debt, getting paid horrid wages, getting forced into shit contract jobs, and paying $500+ a month for healthcare. How does one not get depressed?
I can anecdotally vouch for this. I went from enthusiastically voting for Obama to ""eat the rich"" and watched nearly all of my contemporary friends do the same. Turns out that when you live through multiple ""unprecedented events"" that wind up screwing over the average person, and see even something as humble as ""you know, I'd like to have a small one bedroom home with a modest yard and a car"" become laughable pipe dreams, it kinda radicalizes you.
Millennials are young I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd do me like this
I just press the 3 dots and mute the subreddit. But yeah, I had a alt account and wasn‚Äôt happy about the low key transphobic bs I saw. It‚Äôs fucking hilarious though how often they will portray themselves as the gigachad while being transphobic when they probably have never went to college, got an actual job, pursued a career, or worked on themselves a day in their lives.
What's the problem with TwoXChromosomes? I've always known it to be quite good (ironically, considering the name of the sub).
Oh, really? I've always seen support- that's why i love it here. Maybe I'm just on the good side of reddit lol
Ya... Sometimes I'm torn between being ignorant and happy, and informed but terrified.
Yup. I always laugh at how the same people who advocate gun control can post about cops beating black people or the trail of tears right after.
Why would it matter where the guns are sold if the same checks are done either way? Got your stabbin' loicense?
No, it's reason for better security in school. How can you see so many instances of the government murdering minorities during traffic stops and think it's a good idea to let them be in charge of our safety?
You can only take advantage of illegal immigrants so long as they remain illegal immigrants.
In that case they wouldn't be concerned about a population shortage. Global population is still increasing
Well globally population is increasing still
Agree to disagree. The ruling class doesn't care about ""their own"" and they aren't particularly religious. The culture war stuff is just to fire up lunatic white nationalists to keep them in power. I highly doubt they actually care. People with actual power are insulated from stuff like that
I'm 34. Do you want to go try to keep up with a someone who is 21?
I'm a zoomer and I will be 23 this April. You're getting old.

Thanks to you all though I didn't grow up with delusions of the world being fair and things being affordable. I'm prepared for the world to fuck me until I'm drained of every ounce of my worth and get nothing for it. I yearn for the inevitable doom on the horizen to colaps in so hard it drags the people who think they're imune to it off their golden pedastools kicking and screaming.

38 here.

According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, more than half of my country are younger than me. üòÇ
Yeah, their rules are explicitly trans inclusive and I haven't noticed anything awful (yet).
It's about 50/50 on blatant misandry. Not near FDS levels, but still...
Yea its definitely a problem but it's important to be informed on what states are doing the worst and making sure to avoid them
Yeah but it‚Äôs not like you are gonna go round shooting them everytime they do something wrong. Also gun control is way more than some racist criminal cops.
Your a joke. You realise people are dying everyday because guns are not properly controlled. America is in just a state at the moment that people look at America as a joke cause the government is weak and constantly wish for thoughts and prayers when adults and children die from being shot instead of actually doing something about it. Meanwhile police are trigger happy and frankly a large majority are racist. Also meanwhile the government are actively removing women‚Äôs ability to have control of their body and safe practices for abortion. Oh and also actively trying to remove rights and healthcare to trans people. Need a say more. I‚Äôm not saying other counties are also having issues but nowhere is on par with the US. 
America needs to stop fighting guns with more guns and do something about gun control and any other opinion about it is ridiculous. Nothing is going to improve if things don‚Äôt change.
They are concerned about a white people shortage.  Have you ever heard of the Great Replacement conspiracy?
34 is still young by pretty much any measure except absolute elite athletics. You're in your prime!
i‚Äôm in my early sixties and i do it every day for my job. it‚Äôs not easy.
Trust me we are in much the same boat. I'm just glad you were able to be prepared to hit that brick wall prepared and not destroyed by the sheer realization that what you had been pushed to achieve and reality were so different.
Ok I was kidding around bc I‚Äôm over 40 lol, but 34 is legit young, not even joking. I wish I‚Äôd known how young I was in my early 30s! Although I recently heard an 80yo looking at pics from his 60s saying ‚ÄúJeez we were young‚Äù so maybe we‚Äôre all younger than we think until it‚Äôs too late‚Ä¶
Well that and know what policies they'd like to implement nation wide if they get their way.
Someone starting spitting numbers at me about the declining white population as if it was supposed to terrify me and I was just like ‚Äúwho cares? There will still be humans‚Ä¶ why aren‚Äôt you this riled up about the extinction of entire species?‚Äù
Yes but the ruling class aren't adherents to great replacement. The ruling class isn't concerned about that, their wealth insulates them anyway. The rhetoric is just used to rile up the people that actually care about the race shit. Modern racism was invented as a way for the ruling class to enslave Africans and force them to do jobs for cheaper than they could pay peasants. To keep the peasants from having solidarity with the Africans they invented the idea that the enslaved people were less than people to create division. So basically, the ruling class isn't actually racist, they just use racism as a tool to divide workers
Im aware. I still like poking fun though
That I can believe much respect to you
At 100 he‚Äôll be saying the same thing about being 80
I'd step up with a coalition to stop anything nation wide.
How'd they respond?  Just curious
The problem is enough people treat there political affiliation as so much of an identity they literally don't care what policies are being proposed they're guaranteed to vote for them.

ATTENTION: All my brothers, sisters, and Enby friends. Oklahoma is trying to pass bill SB 129 that would ban trans healthcare until age 26!!!		"As a born and raised Oklahoman this makes me incredibly sad to see. Please if you live in the state call up or write to your representatives and tell them that we DO NOT need a cruel and senseless bill like this!!!
I‚Äôm 16 and in Oklahoma. I‚Äôve been on T a year. Got top surgery 3 weeks ago. The idea of having to stop my hormones for TEN YEARS sickens me.
Isn't age of medical consent 18 in the US federally? How is that legal?
Another reason for me to hate this stupid state I live in. Everyone always points to Texas or Florida for shit like this, but Oklahoma is, and has always been, a conservative hellhole. I'm just... So tired of everything...
Im australian and i just read this bill i hope that you americans protest the living hell out of this bill. Like this can NOT EVER BE ALLOWED TO PASS. LIKE EVER. 


FUCK TRANSPHOBES AND FUCK THE PPL WHO WROTE THIS BILL.



Im so sorry my Oklahoma brothers and sisters and everyone in between
South Carolina is trying to pass a bill that ends informed consent for adults üôÉ
Not only Ban it, but also forcibly medically detransition anyone who has already started hormones before the age of 26
If they have such an issue with gender care, drugs, and even surgeries then there are a lot of non-trans things that need to be included as well. They are basically discriminating against trans people. Aren't there anti-discrimination laws in this country?
Ew, fucking burn that bill. When will someone usurp these despicable pricks writing this abhorrent shit?
I'm not an American but i can feel how it makes you feel, my government also tries to ban trans people to have surgeries
TWENTY-SIX!?!

This is so fucking unhinged, how can they even pretend this is about PrOtEcTiNg ChIlDrEn when they are pulling the numbers directly from their ass?

Are they trying to say Oklahomans can't drink or vote or join the military or get married until 26 either?

They're making it kind of obvious that if they got this one they'd immediately move the goalposts again
It‚Äôs horrible. We are fighting a similar ban in Arkansas. that effects trans youth to age 18. Missouri has just introduced the same bill as Oklahoma that would ban to age 26 or is otherwise a felony. Yesterday, Kansas introduced a bill declaring it a felony to age 26, and Kentucky to age 18. Yes, do all you can to block passage. Once it becomes law, your only recourse is a lawsuit. Moving the age to 26 shows this was never about children. It‚Äôs about control, discrimination, and erasure. This forces families and individuals to have to flee their state to receive healthcare, legally. Also college age students to have to attend out-of-state. Countering this, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California and Washington DC have passed laws to protect as places of safety and sanctuary to protect you. Thank God for the ACLU. They are using great resources to fight the states that are banning this live saving care. I urge your support for their efforts. Follow Chase Strangio, ACLU trans rights attorney and trans man on IG to keep-up. He‚Äôs on the frontline of this fight. A true hero and champion for trans rights!
Is it just me or did every state randomly decide today would be the day to fuck us all over? Within the last 10 minutes I've heard of 3 states that are banning trans heathcare.
What the fuck???
there's no way a bill like this could possibly be passed. absolutely fuck them for trying
They want us dead.
I feel the walls slowly closing in as I fall further away from sanity . I am horrified by what‚Äôs happening and I feel powerless to help and or stop it . I hate this country .
Are you fucking kidding me. I‚Äôm in Oklahoma and I‚Äôm 21, and desperately trying to get a job to get on HRT, I hate people.
Remember: a lot these super radical bills aren't ment to pass, or at least Republicans know they are unlikely to, but these bills are primarily meant as a threat. Think of it as sneak peak of what's to come if they ever gain enough power over the government
Those Oklahoma conservatives are just...so typical. The age of sexual consent in that state is 16 years old, and they have never expressed a problem with federal law permitting military service as young as 17 years old with parental permission. You can vote at the age of 18 for local, state, and national leadership. You can drink at 21.   


So, you can be trusted according to the law for all of these things, but Oklahoma just absolutely feels you cannot be trusted with your own gender identity until the age of 26; and health care professionals who attempt to offer gender-affirming care to anyone under that age face felony charges with sentences equivalent to murder.

Yep. Republicans. Making sense since never.
I live in this state and my wife and I are older transfolk who have recently decided to transition and this scares me to my core. Its not right. If this goes through it will only lay the ground for even terrible stuff. I am honestly not sure what to do. Other than moving.
I was raised in South Carolina, now I live in Georgia. My mom won't let me live anywhere I want.
Oklahoma: the new and worse Ohio
Why do people think this is okay? More trans people are going to end their lives if they cant medically transition (if they want that) or have proper healthcare. Is that what they want? Us to die? Because we never will be wiped out completely.
I‚Äôm so sorry to my trans siblings in Oklahoma, I can‚Äôt imagine how you guys are feeling right now. I‚Äôm in Montana and fighting a similar bill that would detransition people under 18, but 26 is absolutely ridiculous and blatant discrimination. I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôm only in Montana for the holidays and I get to return to a relatively safe state in Wisconsin in a few weeks. 

I hope to god this bill and others like it don‚Äôt pass, and I‚Äôm wishing everyone (except the transphobes who propose/want bills like these) safety and all the best things <3
Oklahoma here. This makes me incredibly sad and scare. I have faith it will not pass. I am 29 but the thought of anyone being forced to wait until 26 is INSANE
Oklahoman here, I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶WHAT?
26 is outrageous. It's unfair. How can one be considered an adult who can drink and drive but not transition. - Annabelle Skywalker. context: she came out to the council. 

In all honesty if they wanted to do this route pick a more sensible age like 18-21 any of those your or any in between ü§£ I'd be willing to make a compromise, it would suck, but 26 is really unfair. 

I'm gonna transition and then move somewhere remote and snowy.
No no no
So much for being considered an adult at 18
They better be okay with a huge segment of their population moving out of state the moment they turn 18 (which I'm sure would do wonders for a state with Oklahoma's problems).

To be honest my home state is exactly the sort that would pull this shit too. So that's fun.
I seriously hope we can get to a point in society where it is simply unacceptable to even mention the possibility of passing such a bill, imagine if someone proposed to pass a bill that directly goes against any other minority.. why is it acceptable to do this to this minority??
Also reminder that it is still illegal for minors to receive blockers or hormones in Texas and all the anger about it just disappeared a couple weeks after it passed. I would‚Äôve transitioned already if it wasn‚Äôt for Greg Abbott.
If passed, a lawsuit would need to be made against it as it is in direct violation of the 14th amendment and is discriminatory to a single group of people. Not to mention it goes against the broad consensus of the medical and scientific communities.
That‚Äôs horable
is there literally anything i can do for y‚Äôall as an out of state person?
The fuck
ugh. i hate this state, and im already likely being forced off T in February due to no under 18 thing. shit man.
Most of America will try to pull this trash, so we gotta either deafen them with our voices, or straight up leave the country
Can we take over that place, if we help the ace‚Äôs with Denmark they could help us take Oklahoma over

Does any one know mass laws for transness
That's absolutely horrendous anyone voting to pass that bill should be ashamed of themselves.
Just kill me instead plsüôè
Oh fuck off Oklahoma >.>
How did they even come up with such a bullshit. Just thinking about this makes my head hurt.

&#x200B;

*Living in Czechia doesn't sound that bad after all...*
26? that has to be a typo.
Good I hope the pass this shit out of this. You don't Oklahoma, move to California
 (22 years old ftm Oklahoman) Great! üò§now I‚Äôm going to end up homeless In the middle of Denver do to being legally blind and only getting ssi.
I‚Äôm a born and raised Oklahoman too. I‚Äôll call and write, but I‚Äôm also gonna make a plan to get outta here. I hate it, but I‚Äôve lost faith in our state‚Äôs politicians
Can people outside of the USA write to the Oklahoman representatives?
Also, Kansas and Kentucky filed anti-trans bills just yesterday. Kansas filed one banning gender affirmation healthcare up to age 21. The one in Kentucky is like the one being challenged by the ACLU and plaintiffs in Arkansas (age 18).
I'm 34 and been on and off T for a while, currently off. If there's an interruption in your hormones, there will be effects but they can be tolerable. I can tell you how it is for me if you're interested. But I wanna point out: having already had top surgery makes a HUGE difference in how well I'm coping with being off hormones. When I feel down about getting my period back, I just hold my chest and think ""these are never coming back"".
top surgery at 16??
How did you get T and top surgery at 16 in oklahoma especially
[deleted]
States also can't ban drugs that are FDA approved but thats a SCOTUS ruling so I'm sure the game is to keep getting sued until they make it to the supreme court and override precedent and ban HRT along with birth control and medication abortions.
Oklahoma legislature doesn't really care about legality. In fact they hope it makes it to the supreme court most of the time so the shitty fucks can make it illegal everywhere and take away the few good things we have in this shit stain of a country. 

If people don't fight back? The next 20 years is going to get bad. And i dont meant ""contact your representative uwu"" fight, i mean legit in the streets fight. 

I strongly recommend any LGBTQ+ person start building IRL community and defenses. Which isn't easy, i know that, but we gotta try.
Well idk how it's legal but my friend said the reason it's 26 is because until 25 u can stay on ur parents insurance (not all the time ofc) and so they want to force u to wait until u can't use ur parents insurance
Not ‚Äúalways has been.‚Äù Tulsa used to be the little blue spot in that ocean of red. Sadly, those days appear over.
NO LITERALLY THO I HATE IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY I‚ÄôM CLOSETED AF AND IN NO POSITION TO ARGUE AGAINST AN ANTI TRANS BILL BECAUSE OF MY TOWN/HOME AND I HATE IT

Yes but Texas takes the cake.
I haven't heard this and can't find info on it, could you link me to news about this?
Only when it comes to employment and things like that. And even those aren‚Äôt as solid as they should be
What country?
It was never about protecting children it‚Äôs about getting rid of trans people. That‚Äôs why it is set to 16. That‚Äôs when insurance from parents cut out. 

Edit: 26 not 16
Shroedinger‚Äôs Adult: Always simultaneously old enough to serve as cannon fodder in wars and be forced to accept maximum criminal liability and enjoy some adult privileges like gun ownership and voting (for now) but also simultaneously still too young to have control over one‚Äôs sexual and reproductive lives and gender identity. üôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§™
New year, the culture war is starting up again. Lot of these places were focusing on abortion and now that they won that, it's time to focus on the rainbow starting with the low hanging fruit that is trans rights. We've already seen them start working being gay back into the narrative.
That‚Äôs by design tho do something crazy outrageous to numb the more ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù law they will try to push next for age 21. I‚Äôm sure their end goal is no HRT at all for transgender people. It‚Äôs also fear tactics and bullying to control and get transgender people out of ‚Äútheir‚Äù state or make us conform to their psycho views on life by hiding or staying in the closet. 

Sadly I live with one of those psychos that spew propaganda news 24/7 around here and think it‚Äôs the only one telling the truth and is no need to watch any other perspectives. Thankfully for only 4 more months!
If it makes you feel any better, it's basically all just an illusion. A big scary shadow meant to install fear and keep us from expressing ourselves. There is a very real threat don't get me wrong, but it is not the big scary monster they want us to belive it is.

This heavy push that tranphobes are trying to do, is more akin to a weak and wounded animal lashing back in a desperate attempt to stay alive. In other words, it's just a group of politicians who see society changing, and are desperately trying to maintain the status quo. As long as we don't back down, and understand the threat they can still pose, we can win.
Testing the waters
Georgia‚Äôs not too bad, it‚Äôs quite purple at a legislative level (though obviously it can still be rough to live in the more rural parts of a state.)
As someone who has lived in both Oklahoma and Ohio, I still prefer Oklahoma but both are hell holes.
That‚Äôs exactly what they want‚Ä¶
That's what they are hoping for...
Also, I‚Äôm pretty uneducated when it comes to politics and things of this sort. What can I do to help with this sort of thing?
26 is when you can legally no longer use your parents‚Äô insurance. they‚Äôre trying to make sure no one can do that anymore (which funnily enough is exactly how i was able to afford top surgery last year).
same, Im going to the snowy depths of colorado. I live in texas and its currently a shithole here.
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they want to happen. Force everyone out of the state who would vote against them.
?   The state was told they couldn‚Äôt investigate families because of that.  And Abbott‚Äôs order doesn‚Äôt carry any force of law.  Are doctors really refusing to provide gender affirming care now?!
Republicans want us dead and gone. Simple as that, first it was 16, then it was 18, 21 and now 26. Dysphoria and ostracization kills, they know this. They're not going to stop until they can forcibly de-transition every trans person in the US. It has never been about protecting the kids or young people. That's just how they indoctrinate people who are on the fence.

>HOWEVER‚Ä¶ & we all need to be fair, listen, start a conversation, take the message and remove your feelings from what you may hear/read! Just hear me out.

Republicans do not argue in good faith about this issue, they've already made up their minds because we go against their precious book. There's thousands upon thousands of medical evidence, documentation, studies, what ever you can think of that support the existence of trans people, trans kids and how transitioning can be a medical necessity. THEY DON'T CARE.
I wish it was man
I know it‚Äôs sad isn‚Äôt it? I know I could never live there again and I don‚Äôt even feel safe visiting friends and family down there.
Yes, you can.
I know that most effects are here to stay and that mostly it‚Äôll just be fat redistribution (T didn‚Äôt stop my period. I‚Äôm on pills for that.) I‚Äôm sad my voice won‚Äôt get to continue deepening though and that my facial hair growth may not come. it just makes me sad that this is what my state has come to, thank you for the advice and assurance.
Age of consent is 16 in Oklahoma üëç
Yes! Some real lucky kids whose parents consent and go through all the work can  get top surgery at 16. Or at least as of right now
A lot of the time with minors top surgery is only approved (for people who have been consistently presenting for years) to prevent more invasive surgeries in the future if you lose access to HRT, like say your shitty government proposes legislation that would force you to detransition and your breast tissue starts growing again.
Good parents.
I think the train of thought is the whole ""you're not fully mentally developed until age 25"" but that's kinda bullshit too. We operate dangerous machinery at 16, are forced to enlist in the draft at 18, can ingest literal toxins at 21, etc.
That's the age you get kicked off your parents insurance. So they are banking on the knowledge the younger generation wont have any healthcare.
Not American, but a big supporter of the 2nd amendment. Every trans person that can trust themselves (physically and mentally) with a gun should get one. The bigger and more lethal the better.

It's a fear tactic that also doesn't work. The very fact that bills like this have even been introduced and suggested, is because we have a voice now! And the only reason we have a voice now is because we exist within the collective unconscious. People know we exist, and as such we have a voice. But unfortunately for the transphobes trying to get rid of us, they are three steps behind. In order to get rid of us like they want, they would need to erase our existence, the knowledge of our existence, and any thing we used our voices to say. Which is impossible to do. The only thing bills like this do is make us miserable and angry. 

And history has a lot of examples of what miserable and angry people do to the people responsible. (It doesn't end well for those responsible)
My point.
Vote for people who don‚Äôt support this (if not already voting).  Support local and state candidates who support people‚Äôs freedom to be themselves
Don't go to the springs. I live in the springs and it isn't the best, especially since focus on the family is here, and they are pretty much a hate group. Go to Denver or Boulder.
Let them rot in their hell hole then! If they want their conservative dystopia so bad, then I say we take all the people who want out, out. Then shut and lock the door, throw away the key, and let them suffer under the rules they wanted.
Wait really? I heard that there was a teenager taken from their parents because of it and assumed that Greg Abbott got what he wanted. We weren‚Äôt outright refused but she said no doctors ever called her back
It really is. I was hoping to start transitioning in OKC, figured it'd be safest there, but now that might not even be an option. But I'm gonna try to keep my head up and hold out hope that this bill won't pass.
No, the train of thought is ""these people are disgusting and subhuman and I want less of them on the streets,"" and that brain development horseshit is just the window dressing to make it seem rational to centrists and liberal moderates.

Oh yes for sure all this is doing is progressing LGBTQI  rights in the long run. If they just never said anything or never put any focus on our community they could of kept laws and rights in the Stone Age for a longer time like they would have liked. 

Sadly this causes psychos to murder and harm us at a higher rate or atleast it‚Äôs more publicly covered now but just like they have done in the past it fails in the long run. 

All they know how to do is run the same tactics over and over and keep failing.
I agree, but there are trans people who are going to be stuck and can't leave. As much as I'd like to leave Oklahoma I don't really have the resources to.

I can promise you it won‚Äôt, but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. The more outrageous the bills get the more they pass more ‚Äútame‚Äù bills like banning hrt until 18. It will just keep going until bills like this get passed.
Tulsa is a good area too atleast so far for myself :)
We do not let children - 

Drive, Marry, Enter a sexual relationship, Drink alcohol, own guns, make medical decisions, live alone, get tattoos, and so so so much more.

Why in the hell should children be able to start gender reassignment on there own?  Now 26 years old is a bit much but someone in their early teens.... hell no.
As long as we don't get complacent and continue to fight back, none of their strategies will work. We only loose if we don't stand up for ourselves.
Thank you :)
Hey! A fellow T-Town girl! I wonder how many of us there are.

Edit: oh snap! My spouse and I are trying to sell our condo and do RV life!
Its medical treatment under the supervision of adults. Those decisions don't get made entirely on the kids whim. Honestly, I think blocking trans healthcare is a form of child abuse. Most early trans care is preventative anyway. In my country, you can start HRT at 16 with parental consent, which makes perfect sense to me. Past 18 it should be nobody's fucking business.
Exactly. The LGBTQI+ commentary has been doing it for a long time already and it‚Äôs not going to change anytime in my lifetime only get stronger :)
Who knows! I have not met another women that is trans in this area before. I been myself for a few years now running. Around 101st and memorial. Have been mostly peaceful minus stares and one rude comment in the past.

Small world! That is the dream for me and my spouse to travel and RV full time but sadly stuff has slowed us down. We are hoping to get a RV in about a year if all works out. :)
[removed]
Okay dude

Edit: do you actually want me to explain why or are you just gonna default to calling me a pedo or something
[removed]
Okay, so.

Nobody is fully medically transitioning minors, to start. Most trans affirming care for minors is preventative or social. Basically, if a kid expresses some tendencies that seem to indicate they're trans, their parents would set them up with a psychologist. Then, in collaboration with their doctor, they'd set up a treatment plan.

At this point, theres several adults involved, including 2 qualified professionals. The kid has final say in terms of refusing care, but receiving it is done in tandem with legal guardians and caregivers. This is extremely normal, we do pretty much the exact same with other medical treatments for minors (surgery, vaccines, etc).

As for why, going through the wrong puberty as a trans kid is extremely traumatic. In many cases, trans affirming care is life saving. Not to mention the additional stress that can be prevented later in life by facilitating a smoother transition.

So now you have a kid, maybe 13 let's say, who's on puberty blockers. Literally nothing about them will change. If they realize they're not trans, they just have to stop taking them and there will be no long term issues. Blockers have been used in this way for non-trans affirming care for a really long time. After several years there is a slightly raised risk of bone problems, which is why some countries opt to allow HRT at 16.

Whoa? 16? Okay, calm down. At this point the kid will likely have been on blockers for 8 years, fully socially transitioned, and not shown any indication that they're incorrect in their assessment of their transness. Again, this decision would be made in tandem with professionals. In addition, HRT works differently if someone hasn't already gone through puberty. They really slowly ramp it up, which would allow for plenty of opportunity for someone to realize they're wrong.

Cis people often spread fears of irreversible damage brought on by HRT. But to us, first puberty is exactly like that. It's literal body horror. And if you think that a minor couldn't possibly understand their gender identity, especially with the help of multiple professionals, then you're just flat out wrong.
[removed]
Blockers just stop puberty from starting, thats not a life altering decision. Thats a totally normal age to prescribe that, the point is to prevent the onset of puberty which can start anywhere from 8-12 depending on the person.

Again, we'll prescribe blockers at this age if its to affirm the gender assigned at birth or prevent complications from a puberty that arrives too early. You just get scared because its trans healthcare. You can say 8 years old as many times as you want to make it sound all scary lmao. Im literally just saying that--in tandem with medical professionals--a child and their legal guardians may elect to take something that will prevent the onset of puberty until either the kid realizes they're actually not trans, or enough time has elapsed that you can reasonably start further transition care. Im not putting kids in an industrial-sized meat grinder here, Im trying to save a lot of trans children a lot of unnecessary trauma.

is florida really banning all trans healthcare?	"i posted this in another sub but wanted to ask here as well. i keep seeing online that FL could be fully banning all trans healthcare for both teens and all adults soon on [august 5th](https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1550178123026677766)...i was aware that they are going  after trans minors, and trans adults on medicaid which is already  horrible...but for the rest of everyone else too apparently? has anyone else seen this stuff about the rest of floridians? i (FtM) was planning on starting hrt out of pocket in august, the idea that i could have that option taken away from me is horrifying. i dont have a way to get out of this state due to college & family. if they deem gender affirming care as something that isnt standard, the licenses of doctors who preform that care could be threatened/revoked. is the ban only for trans minors and adults on medicaid, or is it really coming after other adults too?

(pardon my usage of the word  ""only"" here, as im not trying to minimize the horrible effects this  will have on the groups affected if it is that, i dont have a better way of phrasing it as im frazzled and scared)."	"Saving this thread to see any updates.

I live in Florida and was hoping to start transitioning soon via planned Parenthood. but it looks like if this August 5th meeting has any effect, I'm just screwed.

Damn I hate this state
Excuse my language, but why can't they just let us live our fucking lives in peace? We're not bothering anyone, we just want to live happy peaceful lives, and the Republicans are trying to fuck us over every step of the way. My heart breaks for everyone that is or inevitably will be affected by anti-trans bullshit!
Florida and Texas are literally trying to speedrun being the absolute worst fucking state ever, seriously holy fuck why can't they just let doctors be doctors
My understanding is it could affect minors and those on Medicaid. The state doesn‚Äôt have direct authority over private health insurers.
It seems like that yes, but I'd need a full agenda, multiple sources, etc
No. They‚Äôre restricting everything that‚Äôs in the Florida‚Äôs state government control. Florida‚Äôs surgeon general is advising against trans healthcare in general but that won‚Äôt change the care trans folks can receive outside the state‚Äôs control. Meaning private practice is still an option for trans healthcare (virtually the only option).
Unfortunately, I believe this is only the start. If it's true all trans healthcare is banned in Florida, it would perfectly line up with the Texas GOP declaring their goal of eradicating all LGBTQ+ people.

People still think the abortion ruling was about abortion and abortion only. Things are about to get much, much worse in this country, and I fear for not just us, but all gender, sexual, romantic, and even racial minorities. The GOP's express goal of turning America into a theocracy seems to be moving forward yet these politicians face no consequence either judicially or politically and even seem to be empowered.

Things are bad, but they are about to get a whole lot worse than they are now, and trans people will be only one of the targets the GOP wants to annihilate.

For anyone who reads this, if you don't plan on voting in the midterms, please get out and vote, we need every vote possible to stop the GOP's plans.
Please dont freak out. Yes they are trying to ban Medicaid coverage as well as trans teen coverage for trans related healthcare but they aren't/can't (yet) remove all trans healthcare. Will this make trans lives harder? Yes. But if you live in Florida and dont need Medicare covering your shit than you'll be fine
That being said this still shouldn't be undermined. It's a big deal and we need to be causing a big stink over it. Just dont worry that your life is over if you live in florida and this passes, theres still a decent number of semi affordable options for florida residents they haven't attacked yet. Plume for one being a pretty good one
Im so scared i move back once im 18 to live with my grandpa because he is the only person who supports me. He says that he‚Äôll help me pay out of pocket since im on medicaid but this really fucking scares me. :/ He‚Äôs texting me about it rn but its just sad my home state is not even really home to me anymore.

There‚Äôs this service called Plume? I think you should look into it because it seems pretty cheap and easier to do than Planned Parenthood for rn! :,)
Yes - DeSantis is really trying to ban all Trans Care, and yes - He's serious.

&#x200B;

I lived in Florida until this last February, and I'm glad I was able to figure out how to leave. I suggest you try and do the same.

&#x200B;

Trust me when I say - Now is the time to start running or fighting. These people aren't joking when they say they want to take our rights, and they aren't going to play nice. Do yourself the favor of taking them seriously.
WOOHOOOO only 2 and a half more years till 18, and im moving the fuck OUTTA this shit state!! Canada (or iceland) HERE I COME!!! 

Our teachers will tell us that we need to get good grades bc were the ‚Äúface of the future of our state‚Äù, but im getting good grades so that i can get the fuck OUTTA here!! 

(Trans F -> M in Florida- fuck floriduh)
Me: Wow sure sucks I'm uninsured and need to transtion to live in my own skin comfortably

I am from Florida and this made me fucking cry. I am ashamed.
If my transition is ended at any point, my life will end with it.
[removed]
Wow, this is fucking awful news. Completely ruined my week. I've just recently moved to Florida.. :/ I was really hoping to be able to get on testosterone this year.. guess not.
As a resident of Florida it's always a huge mixed bag on terms of politics down here. The major metro areas like Orlando, Miami, and Tampa for example are very liberal. We are actually one of the few states that doesn't require a full on sex change surgery to update our driver license gender markers, but then you have this shit going on in the background from the less redeeming parts of the state. It's not just LGBT rights. We did vote to raise our min wage to $15 an hour, but you have a lot of state and local politicians trying to redefine who is entitled to min wage now cause of it. This state cannot agree with itself. I think some of it is we have huge influx of older people retiring here, and the no income tax combined with the lax Covid policies from our red state government attracting the worst kind of people. I think I'm kind of over it, this state was still by far the better choice than where I was living, but I'm packing my shit to move in January to a different state.
Wait, shit, my cousin's trans and he lives out there... oh god...
Honestly if you have the cash come to Montreal Canada ( it‚Äôs a 3 hour flight) maybe 600$ for a round ticket. Private doctor is literally only 230$ you go out with your prescription. And they‚Äôre bilingual. You only need to see your dr once a year just do bloodwork every 3 month (you could send them your results). I got fed up of waiting and did that
I‚Äôm Australian but I can‚Äôt believe this is real. Do they realize how many suicides will result from this? Not everyone can afford to just move interstate.
About time all republicans had a small ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, start with the fucking Supreme Court justices.
Just to be clear, they are banning the use of state funds for trans healthcare. So you can't use **Medicare or Medicaid** for those purposes after the FL bill goes into effect.

If you have healthcare through your employer or through military service then you will be unaffected. You can also pay out of pocket.
This is a small rant. Please don‚Äôt take down mods.

Fucking damnit. Of course, of fucking course. Fuck Florida, fuck America! Canadians of the subreddit will you let me join you? I don‚Äôt want to live with these psychopaths anymore. Just when I finally figure myself out I learn of this. *sigh* Fuck my life for living in Florida. Can‚Äôt transition in school, can‚Äôt transition in public or get a job cause they don‚Äôt hire fucking people that aren‚Äôt in college. What. The. Fuck. This country is getting better by the day.
usa is a really misleading name because it‚Äôs not even close to united it should be renamed also are we just going back to the ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù from when usa was first founded with the rights only going to white men
They can and will do it if they can get away with it. It's soon going to be time for all LGBT folks to get the hell out of red states by any means necessary. They're clearly signalling what they intend to do. Don't let it happen to you.
in florida and a minor (17). i am on hormones lol whats going to happen to me :) :) :)
This is terrible, August 5th is my birthday and I don‚Äôt consent to this.
Why just fucking why. I don't get how someone can be so hateful. They just want to erase us from existence and genocide us.
While I hate hearing this advice: If you can move to another state, MOVE NOW.
I'm freaking out!
I wish the best to all of you living in texas or florida (and other phobic states or countries but you got the idea) and I hope things will turn for the better
So far, it's only for those on medicaid. Meaning they'll have to pay out of pocket for care, but minors are prohibited completely (according to what I read, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). I don't think we've gotten to a full ban just yet, but it seems like it's coming soon
Honestly, once Roe fell they started to show their hand and the extent of the power they've been amassing for years. I know how horrible this is going to be to hear but get out of the US or fight. It's all we have left. No more hiding from it, no more running, they're coming for everyone. What's to stop them from deeming HRT as contraception or birth control and those are already being denied with bills ready to go to ban them. And don't think they won't go for this nationally, they have already said if they get the majority they WILL. So, fight or flee. It's all we've got now.
Just wanted to chime in here from Nevada ü•∞ been kinda rough out here lately all around. Stay strong and stay safe my lgbtq gang these people will never understand ^-^ <3
Is the ban on minors for all minors or only minors on medicaid? I was excited to start transitioning once I was 16 I guess I won‚Äôt be able to
This illustrates how important local elections are. So many laws and bullshit policies are decided by politicians that get voted in and win by literally a few hundred votes as no one shows up on any Election Day other than the presidential election. I am well aware both parties for the most part suck but there‚Äôs one party that sucks way way worse. They routinely win by suppressing voting, don‚Äôt let them, vote them out at all costs, you lives literally depend on it
i think y'all are being a little overly dramatic and unrealistic. the majority of Americans don't wanna ""genocide"" us or ban all trans healthcare. It's just a few key people in a few key states. 

they'll never be able to ban trans healthcare outright everywhere in the US. Long before it would get to that point, they would be trans people burning buildings to the ground and rioting in the streets. There's a lot of us here. I promise it won't get to that point
no worries twitter will take care of it
[removed]
I think they are but only for teens and people doing it off medicaid. Out of pocket payers are fine
I havent heard about this at all yet but thats fucking terrifying to hear. I live in orlando and just started hrt 3 weeks ago. if they really try banning that now i'm gonna lose my mind.
ABCDEFrickFlorida.
If shit turns in Kentucky I‚Äôm moving to another state. Damn the consequences. To avoid being acclimated to awful I have a series of ‚Äòif X happens I do Y‚Äô responses. With trans health care being moving to a very liberal state.
I think it would be better if all lgbtq+ people moved INTO red states. Enough of us present and voting will see those states turn back to reason. As many of you as can moving here to Florida would be the best way to fix it.
What does the law actually say? I am guessing you read it and can copy and paste the exact wording you are talking about.
I live in Florida...
I‚Äôve had an orchi and have had my name/gender changed. If I can‚Äôt take estrogen, there are A LOT of bad things that will happen. I am NOT taking testosterone‚Ä¶
If this is happening in glad I got the hell out of Florida holy shit
It looks like it will be taken off of medicade- which is tragic but sadly not surprising. Wi passed trans healthcare I believe in 2019 - so having healthcare covered by the state wasn't the norm everywhere to begin with. outside of state it seems insurance rarely covers anything. It is very depressing but not hopeless. Hormones aren't too expensive. Consultations are but there are groups that will help. Wi started covering it because two state worked sued. Stay organized.
Republicans across the nation are talking about re-banning gay marriage, banning contraceptives, and yes, banning transitioning for transgender adults.  They've held on to this ocean of hatred for decades and now it's all spilling out at once because they have an opportunity to do it quickly with the current scotus.
Y'all had rights in Florida?
As a 16 year old FTM in Florida  with a transphobic family who is also on Medicaid, I fucking HATE this state and I hope this doesn't happen.
Florida and Texas have a lot of electoral college votes. That's why they're making it hell, so that people leave
Shoot why can‚Äôt people just leave medical care up to a doctor and the patient. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. If someone isn‚Äôt a doctor I do not want their opinion
I‚Äôm pretty sure it is, I‚Äôm only 13 and have no clue rn exactly but from what I hear it sure sounds like it is or will be, same for A LOT of other southern states. I live in TN, and I found out a while back that if they pass that whole Title whatever thing, then doctors can refuse service to you if your LGTBQ, and schools can fully expel you with no other reason other than being LGTBQ.
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was gonna add. Currently only minors and those relying on Medicaid are screwed. That‚Äôs still absolutely horrid, but we seem to be at risk of Florida establishing a new standard of care in the state that would make trans healthcare inaccessible. I don‚Äôt think it would be easy considering all major medical organizations recognize trans healthcare as safe and necessary. It‚Äôs much easier to ban it for minors than adults based on their fake research. But at the very least it may put trans healthcare on pause or make doctors hesitant to treat trans patients do to fear of losing their practice or being punished by the state government for helping trans folk. I live in Florida and am gonna be really pissed if I have to put my degree on hold and flee the state due to our shitty state government. And I‚Äôm even more upset for the people who don‚Äôt have the resources to leave.
I'm in the same boat, I was really excited to start my transition sometime this year. This news ruined me. :( I'm praying that this is just a scare and nothing will happen, but I doubt that..
FL gal here also. I just decided to wait till my wife and I can leave the state before I start anything, so here's hoping for some money lol
As a Florida resident I love this state but if this is true I will be moving state residency‚Äôs. As such I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs true for adults because I see certain medical businesses spending millions to prepare for transgender healthcare. Spending this in facilities, providers and resources‚Ä¶ if there was a ban on the line these preparations and dollars would be lost and that‚Äôs not good for taxpayers or businesses. I‚Äôm very interested to follow this though.
im so so sorry :( we have to fight but i understand how exhausted everyone is from the relentless attacks of this
Our state legislature looks to you guys and Texas for political takes, so I‚Äôm also curious (and nervous).
Because they hate anyone that isn't a cishet white male
They don‚Äôt care about trans people per se. If they could create a social division from ownership of calico cats, they would ban them.

That‚Äôs the thing that has a so fucked: it‚Äôs not really about us. It‚Äôs Republicans a few years back post Bush II looking for wedge issues.

They found it when a couple of trans related events occurred:

1. Two young black athletes in Connecticut won some foot races against some white cis girls, and they hooked up with their local republican party and started a legal fight that made the news. News is good for politics.

2. TERFs found traction on the ‚Äúchild abuse‚Äù narrative, when they got nowhere on the issue of adult trans people. They connected up with the right wing christofacist bloc and they hit the gas pedal. It didn‚Äôt help that trans people were mostly unprepared to respond. We tend to not understand our moment and we aren‚Äôt equipped to fight a hearts and minds propaganda battle. We will shoot ourselves in the foot more often than not.

The US Democratic party is the world‚Äôs most incompetent political machine. Seriously. Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton are the two best choices in your entire country?

So it‚Äôs not really about us. It‚Äôs about our utility in getting Republican votes.
Suffering is the goal.
your language is completely understandable, this stuff is tiring and mortifying to see all across the US.  im so sorry that these things keep happening, i wish we could do more than just spread information and protest. were just people trying to exist...theres nothing wrong with that..

at this point, even if this does get legal action taken against it and it gets shot down, ill be lucky that i can even get 1 or 2 months of hrt in before they try to go after it for adults again. i hate this state
I agree, I mean, I'm not hurting anyone. 

I wanted to move from Germany to the us, for a looooong time but since that bs came up I'M NOT GOING THERE AT ANY COST. Now I wanna move to Canada :D

Anyway I can only hope the best for trans or lgbt folk over there :/
Literal modern day ""Nazi party"" I hate to say... This is their idea of ""eugenics"" in a nutshell. They hate anyone who is not like them which is most people who have a functioning brain. Utopia might be a pipe dream but these people... You keep letting them take control and soon enough its going to be a dystopian nightmare, which is already unfolding.
Because we don't fit into their Christofacist gender idiology that says men are strong godly providers and women are their servants who exist to make more babies.

If they allow us to live unimpeded lives then their wives and daughters might start to question the ""natural order"" of things and they wouldn't have their preferred lifestyle anymore.
Because their hateful god and priest, minister or pedofile told them that they have to hate on everything that is not what they don't understand.
Hey, hey, Tennessee is in that race too. Don't forget us.
DeSantis and Abbot are literally just bouncing back trying to one up each other to capture the votes of Trump sycophant's, as both of these evil men are eyeing the presidency.
America is literally trying to speed run being the worst country
Idaho has joined the chat.
Alberta is watching jealously from across the boarder
>The state doesn‚Äôt have direct authority over private health insurers.

Doesn't mean they won't try to. Money talks and who knows what could happen.
The thing is, the private sector often very closely trends what Medicaid/Medicare covers.

Example: Gender-affirming care in PA was determined by the state Supreme Court to be covered under Medicaid. Private insurers, as a result, followed behind.

I‚Äôm worried that the same will hold true now. That if the PA Supreme Court overturns it‚Äôs decision, that the private sector will follow.

And that‚Äôs terrifying, because testosterone is the only thing that has allowed me to function in society without constantly suffering from suicidal ideation.
ah shit i hate this state. thats the only thing ive seen thats really talked about this specifically, which makes it all the more concerning that its not being paid attention to...
The agenda can be downloaded on the boards website. It is not easy to find. I *think* the specific item is the August 5th full meeting here
https://flboardofmedicine.gov/meeting-information/upcoming-meetings/page/2/
And specifically with regards to Dr. Lapudo's letter that uses extremely cherry picked data to justify the ban.
Would that include through planned parenthood or no? 

Forgive my ignorance, Canadian just wanting to learn
thank you for the clarification...i apologize if it seemed like i was spreading panic on purpose, i genuinely was having some trouble understanding it.

this is horrible and i hate that this is happening, even though i will have a chance now to hopefully go on hrt for a bit as i am an adult who is not on medicaid, its still awful to know that this will effect and violently harm so many others. and i know that a full ban on hrt is definitely on the horizon in this state
Hold up can I get a source on texas declaring to eradicate the LGBTQ? Thats insane!
>Yes they are trying to ban Medicaid coverage as well as trans teen coverage for trans related healthcare... If you live in Florida and dont need Medicare 

Yeah that's still a lot of people, and as you implied this could only be the beginning. So we need to fight for this ground. Hard
They haven't removed all trans healthcare *yet*. We have every right to freak out over this.
For now..
I've been using plume for 6 months now it's only 99 a month plus the cost of the pills. But they pay for your blood tests and everything jts pretty great and has no wait list
im so so sorry...i hope you will be alright. form what i have gathered it seems that it is saying its only not for minors, and will also not be covered by medicaid, meaning that things like PP and hrt apps should be possible if you are an adult, i think. it is awful to have to watch this happen

and yeah, i was considering PP initially, but it was too expensive (and far away) so im looking to start plume in early august. thank you for the reccomendation
Things are not going great in much of Canada either ATM.  Also is not that easy to just up sands move to  another country.  For instance in Canada to get citizenship you have to have lived in three country for 3 of the last 5 years.  But you can't get a job there, unless you are highly in demand via education/skill, unless you are a citizen.  So you would have to have enough money to live in Canada for 3 years with no income or insurance of any kind.  Before you can become a citizen & start working.  

Iceland isn't much better, you can get a temporary work permit there if you are attending school there.  Otherwise it's actually harder in Iceland
Red State brain drain?

I, a trans person try to enlist in the AF: [LET ME INNNN](https://youtu.be/LJ5nV9aKthU)
Geeze I wish.  Their recruiters are the pickiest I've ever seen.

Prior service, active NBCI, degreed.  Recruiter won't call me back but cursed me out for trying again.  Like, wtf?  Guess she didn't like my face.

I may be too old now though because she has been THE recruiter in my area for years.  


So it's whatever.  Guess I'm not yokel hick enough for her.
They won't stop until the genocide is complete. Any faith I had in humanity is shattered.
I always say that and for some reason when I suggest we eliminate the transphobes people lose their minds and call me a psycho

Come to the west coast.
I'd advise you get them out if you can
im so desperate that honestly i would love to do that, but i live with conservative parents who think canada is evil because socialism or something....if it comes to that i might just have to bite the bullet anyways
Especially people on Medicaid, not to mention minors
Many private insurers base what they will pay for on what Medicare covers.
SANSMASA
i cant get out until 2024....jesus christ this is horrifying to watch. so many people will be hurt and killed
A great chunk of people this is affecting (minors) have **ZERO** way of moving. Its not feasible. Also people on Medicaid arent necessarily in a financial situation where they can up and move.
as far as i can tell, the ban is unfortunately for all minors, and then adults on medicaid as well. theyre trying to push conversion therapy as treatment instead which is disgusting and horrible. im so sorry that this is happening, i hope theres legal pushback against this
what does that mean?
Obviously Mexico has its own problems, but youre better off as a queer person in Mexico than most states in the US besides the northeast and west coast, which both are notouriously expensive to move to
im so sorry. from what i have gathered from the comments here, its only for minors & also will not be covered by medicaid...if you are paying out of pocket you should be fine, i think (thats not to say that what will happen isnt already horrible). im so sorry that youre having to go through this. we have to fight and make our voices heard
so, from my understanding, it is just being taken away from minors and those who use medicade to transition? and im not saying that to diminish the horrible effects of it, i just want to make sure im understanding this correctly if there is still hope for me to transition out of pocket. thank you for your comment

i cant flee the state, but i will do everything i can to protest about this. this is abysmal and horrifying to watch happen, even worse knowing that other red states will copy
Forgot Christian, they hate other religions too.
Yeah, it you're not one of the select few born into a ""privileged"" situation they try endlessly to make your life a living hell.
Democrats are paid to lose. If they became effective the donations would dry up.
End goal is to drive as many democrat voters as they can out of key states with such awful policy.  Thus ensuring their outsized representation in the legislature and electoral college.
Genocide is the goal, suffering is entertainment for them.
I'm sorry you're stuck in a bad situation. _hugs_
A bit of advice from my original endocrinologist who was from South Africa and appalled at the ways our government interferes with good medical practices- testosterone has expiration dates that are wildly conservative. They say things like 3-4 months or something but in reality can keep for almost 2 years in a cool, dark environment. In the past some mtfs would have to get a year's worth of Rx from out of state or whatever.  It's not best practices without twice yearly blood work but if there's uncertainty of medical access often doctors will understand and help set you up to the best possible plan in the circumstances you have so do still pursue medical treatment! The occasional bad doc is obviously a nightmare (speaking personally!) but most doctors are extremely logical and ethical people by nature of the training they go through and it's much more that insurance companies, retail pharmacies, and obv governmental policies are to blame for bad treatment so use a good doctor's help as far as you can! Good luck!
Visit Seattle but wait till all this is done to move here
That's honestly the issue.  


If republicans feared repercussions they'd be slightly less slimy.
Is Germany having issues as well? Ironically most LGBTQ people I‚Äôve talked to about fleeing the US are wanting to relocate to Berlin.

Canada also appears to be having some issues, especially in and around the interior, much like the US.

Honestly like half the country
Conservatives: medicine must be privatized at all costs       

Conservatives when private companies sell medicine to trans people: no stop it that isn‚Äôt how you play the game
Currently the PA Supreme Court is majority democratic, so I don‚Äôt think you personally need to worry, others, however, like here in Florida may need to start looking into other options like mail order HRT.
This is exactly what will happen.  Private medical insurance companies model their coverage based directly off public healthcare.  Their entire business is in finding out the bare minimum they can cover and get away with it.  If public healthcare isn't covering something then they are as hell will not.
Yep
Not directly. Medicaid patients may have to pay out of pocket. Functionally PP will still be able to provide trans healthcare.
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna34530

Fun fact: they did this at the same time they declared yet again that they want to secede. Good way to hide really awful shit like this is say complete nonsense so people focus on that one bad talking point and not everything else
Isn't what Medicare covers the basis of what other companies will cover? So this screws all of Florida trans people?
Being upset and raising awareness is justified and needs to happen. I just dont want people to panick.
That‚Äôs a lot I pay $10 out of pocket at PP in NY
My plan is to go to a college in canada or ice land, so right now im making sure to keep my GPA at a 3.5 and higher!

I‚Äôd like to but in my industry it is low income no matter where I live (going back to school to do something else‚Ä¶) Plus it‚Äôs already decided I‚Äôm moving to Atlanta. My bf got a high paying tech job and I like being middle class so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll live. It‚Äôs obviously another red state but money can keep you out of a lot of trouble tbh
Yes the Medicare cost schedule. This is not set by Florida. It is set by the US Congress.
That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äòif you can‚Äô for those who have the ability to. As what can be done to not be killed in the state for existing, keep you finger on the pulse for any way to make even a little change or a bending in the laws that will keep each other safe.
Oh dear oh dear oh my
all those karens on twitter will get florida to be normal again and keep transitioning legal
well in that case I guess i'm lucky, for now anyway. I'm 24 and pay out of pocket. But that's still just horrible to hear. They're going to cause soo much harm to our community with this stupid bill or whatever they're trying to pull! Politicians have no business getting involved in our personal medical decisions! It took me soo long to work up the courage to even start HRT, Now i'm feeling happier than ever and actually looking forward to the future for once. To think they're just gonna take that away from some of us now is just soo disheartening. I feel soo horrible for the trans youth and people on medicaid that are gonna be effected by this. It's just not right. We need to fight like hell against these horrible politicians!
Yep- at least that's what I'm reading. Headlines don't say the medicade part. Planned Parenthood -and there are some online doctors that can treat you and ship hormones legally depending on the state. I'd have to check Florida
Otherwise - look to see where they have trans care at hospital s near you- it took a lot of research but! You can just call- it's scary but it'll save you time .
b4 medicade covered hormones for me I just paid the consultation fee (which was hella expensive but worth it) and used goodrx. Testosterone s really not expensive. And call before had see if you can get hormones / a prescription same day as consultation if you are self paying. They may be understanding. I lucked out with that. 
Anyways
Good luck. You will definitely get hormones :) even if it's hard. it's within your reality.
And they _love_ to shout, ""Freedom of Religion"", such hypocrites
Hell they hate other christians too it's not just other religions. It is anything slightly off from their ""prefect image.""
The hate other Christians.  Once they've gotten rid of us their little alliance will fall apart and the protestants and Catholics will be at each other's throats again.
In reality Christians are the most persecuted people in the world. I know it sounds crazy, but I think your problem is with western culture, and I would agree with you on that. Western culture bends religions to fit their naritives and justify their wars. Muslims and Christians literally pray to the same exact God, and the characters are pretty much the same in both books minus a few. Not trying to argue, but God loves you, and wants you in heaven. I don't know if we have to change to get there, but that fact is true, God loves us all.
If you want the leadership of the dems to change vote. Vote in every election. Local state and federal.
Control and power is the goal. Genocide and suffering are the tools.
I would've gone to relatives but they live in Tennessee
No, it's pretty save over here, not in Munich thou, they're ‚Ä¶ pretty old school if that's the word, idk, at least as far as ik. IMO you should tell you're friends to he careful with flats n stuff cause Berlin is the 4th most expensive cities to live
This map is missing some info, texas has a ton of antitrans legislation and its white.
True
So is red good on this map?
Bro if they do the SHIT they are doing in Florida in Louisiana I am going to need a *few* weapons for‚Ä¶ *reasons*
Come to Illinois, we‚Äôre one of the very few states outright protecting trans rights.
yeah i wanna move to Illinois later this year, it's like the last bastion of leftism in the midwest. I live in Michigan which is reasonably democrat but it can flip at any time. Ideally I want to live somewhere like Colorado but no fucking way I can ever afford that
And if there are, then we defend them. If not, then it's time for Operation Frequent Wind
It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to put together some projects in Washington State. We need places for people to move or at least stay.
As a PA resident, that gives me some relief for now. But, I do worry about the grand scheme of things if the Republicans win the 2024 election. At least it'll be me sometime to get some surgeries in and to move out of the country possibly.
Yiiiikes
They get to decide. In the bad old days trans people were refused blood transfusions because their blood is transgender and they didn‚Äôt cover transgender care. Basically trans people could have our entire bodies considered preexisting conditions.
i hate this :( what the hell...
Possibly, not an expert
I've been in the enlistment process since mid 2021 and have gotten pretty much nowhere üôÉ

i hope youre able to keep getting your hrt, in that case. we need to turn this anger into action and protest about this because its disgusting and such a massive invasion of privacy and health. the fight will be hard but we have to do something. im wishing the best of luck to you
Oh! And if you're in college and it's not a private conservative one - go to the LGBT center. There's a good chance they'll have ppl who can write letters I'd you need one (you shouldn't but you used to need those) and they can point you in the right direction:)
Freedom of religion in America has only ever been freedom of traditionalist white sects of Christianity. All others are just at varying levels of being tolerated by our government officials.
What they mean is ‚ÄúFreedom of our bigotry and christofascism!‚Äù
More like ""freedom to opress""
Honestly it's getting to the point that if I get any chance to ban religion in any form I will I'm getting tired of it causing issues they have ruined and are still ruining this world since day one of there bs
No. Please tell me how in the HELL Christians are ""the most persecuted"". If we're talking the USA Christians are the de facto biggest, most influential force in the country. When speaking of other countries, I lived in Africa. I was a missionary in Africa. Was I persecuted? FAR FROM IT. The respect people automatically give a ""man of Jesus"" was astonishing.

I cannot speak for the whole world on this, but in my experience as a former VERY DEVOUT Christian true persecution was NEVER A THING. FFS we're chatting in a thread discussing literally taking away medical rights from a minority group. Tell me where, HOW the Christians are EVER persecuted like this!

(note: I'm not bashing your christian faith. Believe in Christ, in your God, your church, that's all fine. But I do have a problem with your audacity to assert that Christians are ""the most persecuted ever"". That's utter BS.)
I'm an atheist, your God is a lie. I doubt you believe in Vishnu, Thor, Odin, Quetzalcoatl, or any of the other thousands of Gods from all other cultures around the world. You'll deny the existence of all those other Gods, otherwise you'd be Pagan, choosing only to believe in one, and denying the existence of all the others with as much unsubstantiated proof as they all had.

The difference between me and you is I believe in exactly one God less.

God will not save us, Human compassion if it exists will.

Be an atheist, choose compassion.

Love you.
You are so brainwashed and full of shit and have no idea what oppression is.
Are you dumb? Were you dropped on your head as a child?
Tell them that then
That‚Äôs what I am telling people. Especially primaries. We need to challenge them. We need people to run against them.
Yeah, I think they‚Äôre more content with the idea of *forcing* us to be straight and cis. There‚Äôs still someone to wield power over in that dynamic, but if we die in the process, they also see it as a win.
Yeah, I‚Äôve heard Berlin is pricey. I think this has mostly been a hope/daydream among friends. Truth be told, I doubt many of us could successfully leave for a more tolerant country unfortunately. The best we can do at the moment is figure out our best path forward here in the US, part of which includes relocating to blue states‚Äîwhich some of us have already done.
No, like in the Cold War, red is very bad
I might have to haha, currently cant even find a job let alone move to a new place though*
Plus we have deep dish pizza and legal weed! I‚Äôm not a big fan of the weather here, but there are a lot worse places to be right now!
i think minnesota will be safe too
I just want to add that I'm in Minnesota and this is not a bad place to be trans, aside from the lack of active support groups (seriously, how can there not be any in a metro area of 3 million people?) Definitely stick to the TC metro though, outstate is a different world.
Hate to say it but we need to have protests.
Talking online spreads the word, but protests are much louder.
Well, idk your situation but I'm still pre-hrt, pre-everything and I've honestly had to pass them up a few times cause they were *pretty damn eager* to have my time

Then again, recruiters do what recruiters do
Just here to remind you that they were asking a question, they didn‚Äôt say that this was definitely the case. While it‚Äôs bad over there (honestly, I will never take the fact that I live in a civilised country rather than somewhere like the USA for granted) please do not distress yourself about questions and hypotheticals. Focus on the present facts- you‚Äôll do yourself no favours panicking about things that may never happen. Good luck out there & I hope you manage to get out of that place one day
I really hope so too, without it I just don't see a point in going on anymore. hrt is literally my last chance. totally agree with you, we can't sit by quietly while they try to ruin peoples lives. I just wish there was more I could do. feels so hopeless in this state sometimes tbh. and thank you! I wish you the best of luck too!
thank you for the clarification of these comments, i really appreciate it. i will not let my guard down because i know what is on the horizon, and that the people currently affected need all the help they can get, but knowing that i will still be able to transition for a bit helps a lot personally. thank you so much for these resources

also, is plume considered ""online doctors""? i was considering going that route because it was cheaper for me than PP, and i know they do ship to florida
The founding fathers weren't christan though they were free masons
Freedom for cis whither Christian males to oppress. Ftfy
We have to be careful with that. If you look at WW2 you would see a religious group was the focus, and you would blame religion for the war, but in reality we would be blaming the victims of an atheist pagan mad man. I'm not saying anything negative about ahtiest or pagans, but we can't really victim blame either. Our problem is with western culture and politics. Western cultures are willing to manipulate scripture for their agenda.. and it's wrong. Eunuchs were feminine castrated men, and one was baptized in minutes of meeting one of Jesus' deciples. The castration was forced earlier in life by his queen, but the Bible talks about things we don't hear about now, and we should all try to find it all out because these things should not be used against us if they are being manipulated.
Southern Africa yes youll get respect, Northern Africa you're gonna have a lot less fun time. For Muslims just invert the two.
It's honestly through research, and believe me, I was just as suprised as you. It sounded crazy to me at first, but checking it out I see that Christianity is the fastest growing religion, and Jesus deciples were almost all killed. Christians were fed to lions, and murdered in mass numbers through the ages. Christianity spread through India very quickly, and that is where they are persecuted the most.. due to it being a threat to Hinduism. It spreads to other cultures so quickly, and that is really the reason.

My thing is these people who push hate don't really understand scripture, and I think we need to turn to this because the Torah for example has no mention of transgender specifically being bad, and this is the law set for Christianity as well. 

Also, thanks for the side note! üôÇ‚ù§
Hence the part about genocide being a tool. The power isn't over us. They dont give a shit about us. We are a scapegoat.
*Tim Curry Russian accent*

Capitalist propaganda
Blue was bad, and red was very bad. Blue was definitely the lesser evil, wait a minute this seems familiar
I was afraid of that
Yeah, one downside of Chicago is that it‚Äôs pretty expensive here :(
Deep dish pizza is the best!
I used to live in MN and was in some pretty great support groups when I was in high school. Do you know if TransForming Families is still a thing?
I like this one
I'm pre-everything as well so I figured getting in would be simpler...I was very very wrong. While they can't legally bar you from the military for being trans, the paperwork is damn near prevention enough. You will likely have to obtain every medical document since you were born (probably more than once) then wait ages just for them to tell you they need more documents. It's a bit of a nightmare tbh.

Get plume and folx health. I know every state is different but if you have out of state friends with addresses ... :) I doubt they'd check. They're there to help
Excellent point. And you nailed it: I was in southern Africa. The northern regions are far more Muslim. I'm sure like Islam is in the states, Christians are probably fewer and less respected in high concentration Muslim countries.
Yep
Yeah, I‚Äôm about an hour outside of the city and I pay $950 a month for 400 sq ft, but it‚Äôs worth it to be able to safely transition
Yes, looks like it is! I'm glad there's something there for younger people.
Hmm? You have confused me lol
I was just worried you were getting yourself into a spiral and you may not even need to. Take care of yourself <3
As in protest. I like the idea
Ah yeah peaceful protests would be good"	w63ok8	trans	1084	0.99	2022-07-23 13:10:16
My Partner Came Out, What Now?	"I‚Äôll try to make this as clear as possible and I‚Äôm open to any criticism, but please just direct me on how to educate myself if I‚Äôve done something wrong so I can adjust my phrasing. Just to clarify, they use gender neutral pronouns currently but are MTF. 

My partner, whom I‚Äôm incredibly in love with to this day, has recently informed me that they have always felt like a woman since they were young. I feel as if they got outed a bit abruptly, but I wanted to immediately be supportive. I asked maybe an insensitive line of questioning first, what did this mean for us? They informed me they would always love me and were still immensely attracted to me. 

Next was what could I do? However, I‚Äôve realized with both of us coming from undereducated roots, I‚Äôm not sure where to start and neither are they. They are in the military, so we‚Äôve started with small things. I painted their toe nails, I try not to refer to them as daddy as much to the children, we have bought them some feminine socks and underwear. But I can tell it hasn‚Äôt been enough and they expressed becoming dysphoric when having to put their uniform on and go to work.  There is so little they can do and keep the job they have for our healthcare.

I‚Äôm at a total loss. I‚Äôm not totally detached from the community, being an openly bisexual cis woman myself, but I‚Äôve never experienced the feelings they are. Does anyone have any tips on how to help them feel less dysphoric while they‚Äôre not publicly out yet? If you were in their situation, what could your partner do for you?

TLDR, my partner isn‚Äôt out and is feeling dysphoric for it. How can I help?"	"[deleted]
Hi. I‚Äôm 47. MTF. I came out to my wife approximately 5 months ago. I am very fortunate that she is very supportive as you seem to be. 
That‚Äôs the first and most important thing, acceptance. Next is reassurance. May be just me but I find it comforting when the holds me and reminds me she still loves me no matter what. 
From the perspective of the trans person (this is the only perspective I hold), my brain continues to play tricks on me. The constant questioning- am I really trans, is it faze etc. My wife also insisted I saw a gender therapist. This turned out to be the best thing ever. It kinda gave both of us validation that this was ‚Äúreal‚Äù in what seemed to be an unreal time of our relationship (25years). When I had my appointment to start HRT, she was there. She took me shopping for essentials like my first bras. 
I think just being there, understanding and acceptance is key. Therapy is also important IMO. You sound like a loving caring partner and she is luck to have you. 
Hope this helps and happy to answer and questions you may have.
/r/mypartneristrans is a good resource that has helped my partner. Sorry I don't have more to offer, but better help is surely coming! ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
You‚Äôre already doing the best thing you can do. 

Everyone‚Äôs gender is individual, and your partner is just starting this part of their self-discovery. The one thing everyone in this world needs is support and acceptance, especially during such a big change. It‚Äôs not the easiest thing in the world, but every relationship has challenges. 

What specifically could help them with dysphoria? That‚Äôs 100% individual, so there‚Äôs no manual there.  Looking into various perspectives on how people navigate their identities and how people think about this stuff generally might be helpful? For me, having my partner react positively to things I try out, and gently asking if I‚Äôd like to try certain things has been helpful, because even though I‚Äôve been supportive of trans stuff for a while, I still have a lot of internalized shame and guilt about trying little things. If they‚Äôre like me, they also might be moody and go back and forth about what they‚Äôre comfortable with, until they get more of a handle on things. Oh, and you might accidentally make comments that make them feel more dysphoric; if that happens, don‚Äôt blame yourself. It‚Äôs an honest mistake, it happens, and you learn from it for next time. 

In my experience, dysphoria has felt a lot harder to manage after starting to come out, because I‚Äôve been directly confronting it instead of pushing it aside. It‚Äôs a hurdle to get over, but it does get easier.

Remember that, while you‚Äôre in this together, make sure you have boundaries and space to yourself, too. If you burn yourself our worrying that you‚Äôre not doing enough, that won‚Äôt help either of you, so make sure to take care of yourself, too :)

Oh, last thing: open communication is really helpful. I mean, that‚Äôs true in all aspects of any relationship.

Remember that you‚Äôre already doing more than most of us could hope for, and your allyship means a lot to all of us <3
Deodorant was nice when I wasn't presenting publicly. Shaving is also good. Therapy is helpful. Getting in touch with your local lgbt community as well as online. Be open and honest with them and show them support.
First off huge congrats to you for goign out on your own to find some answers and support. It's very easy to just look to your partner for all the answers and you taking the time find things out on your own is a huge step in showing them how much you love and want to continue supporting them on this journey. Secondly, to address the guilt I picked up that your feeling around the potentially insensitive initial line of questioning and not being able to immediately do more to help them, please know it's OK, you are gonna make mistakes and not always say the absolute right thing everytime and that's OK. From my own experiences, when that happens, don't make it a huge deal, correct whatever was said or acknowledge that it wasn't the right thing to say and continue on. Make a huge deal out of it can often make the other person feel more dysphoric or anxious because it's seen as like well this person doesn't actually see me as whatever yet, or I'm putting all this pressure on them. Thirdly as for ideas about ways to help, what you've done is great, and I feel sure you'll keep it up, but the sad truth is you're not gonna be able to fix everything, like the wearing of the uniform and presenting as masculine at work is something that they are gonna have to work through and figure out how to change that in a way that makes them feel safe and comfortable at work. What you can do is make sure you are doing what you can to make them feel that way at home. Sit down with them and talk, see if they have ideas about how they can change little things at work to feel less dysphoric, or if there are more things at home they want to try out to feel more comfortable and confident. It's going to be a process, but you are doing amazing things already to help, so just keep it up and be there for them and you two will figure it out
What military? I know the US military is accepting right now and won't stop then from transitioning and will do some things to support them and help with the dysphoria and what not. Idk the actual procedures though.
Man idk but you're doing what we all dream our loved ones would do. Yall will be just fine.
I was in the Army before I came out as a trans woman. If they need someone anonymous to talk, vent, share with. Please feel free to DM me. You‚Äôve got a beautiful heart. Listen to it and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre both scared right now. Share those feelings. Make sure they know they aren‚Äôt alone. You can never tell them you love them too much. Good luck! üíú
You sound like you‚Äôre gonna be ok. You two clearly respect the hell out of each other and are afraid of losing your connection.

Just baby steps hon, you two will be beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
You're already doing a good job from what you wrote.

Do what you can to help your partner feel feminine and deal with dysphoria. Also, they're going to need to learn a lot about being a girl (hair and makeup for a start) and you can be a great source of info and teaching.

Pro tip, shaving your legs is one of the best thing to feel feminine and to combat dysphoria. Tho I think every trans girl made a huge mess and sliced up their legs the first time they shave.

Help out your partner by shaving their legs, provided they wear pants at work so it won't show, if they're not comfortable showing anything off.
Just love them no matter what and support them
r/transalute Since you mentioned your partner being active duty military. I‚Äôve been out of the military since 2015, so I don‚Äôt have the knowledge to answer questions, but this sub might help.
I am not in a long term relationship nor I have been in one so I will comment on that, but I have to comment on your dedication to your partner, if anything else. The thing I can recommend, because I feel it is kinda universal, they know better what they need than anyone random person online might tell you, because their experience is unique to them, so be patient in the coming hard psychological times they will come for them trying to figure out who they are. 

On the job thing I am lost for words. I don't have a good answer for myself and I am lucky enough to live in a country where I at least have insurance. I can only say that I have first came out 5 years ago and only this last September managed to find a private psychologist to listen to me and take me seriously, so just keep in mind that you might not find help from professionals for a long time. 

Look up local queer groups if they exist, because they definitely can offer better material support and maybe you need to think of ways out of the military, but I am sure that last comment is pointless since you probably thought of that already. So yeah look up your local queer organizations and go there to ask for help. I am giving that advice even if I didn't do it however I was lucky enough to be surrounded by like 10 queer people the last 4 years, so I have a support network. 

And luckily for your soulmate they have you to stand by them in the most difficult thing they will have to do for themselves. You sound amazing and they are lucky to have you. 

If you have time and energy, there is this site [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) that will be more in depth than any of us could hope to succeed to be in the comments. However it might be more help for them than you. still it is not a bad idea to look up some stuff. 

Also I don't know everything nor I can do that about gender, but I really like to look into it and I have due to luck the ability to understand the academic mambo jumbo, I am volunteering to offer my awful skill set of thinking I understand theory to help with anything you might need to be translated in human terms. I know that academic terms sound terrifying, i am studying them since I was 6 and still have trouble feeling at home reading some academic works, so it is normal if someone feels that the bar is too high, because especially for transness it is. The gatekeeping we are facing is unreal. I felt that wrote the most difficult essay I have in my whole life the time I tried to explain to my psychologist why I feel and how to justify it. 

And I want to re assure you about something. I firstly came out to friends from university. People that are supposedly smarter well read and stuff like that. I have not felt more seen and loved than by one of my friends who has finished a technical school and it is working a regular 9-5 and not an academic job or something that requires scientific understanding of any field. You already have the feeling without needing the fancy words and any justification other than love and respect. You have done more for them in this short amount of time than 3 specialists with a wall of degrees each did for me in years. Because if anything the thing I needed the most back then was understanding and that is something that doesn't require education, but humanity, which is something you seem to have in spares. 

I can only wish you luck and may your story have the happy ending your family deserves.
Talk with your partner, cuz everyone is different and if you talk you can get to know each other's minds and thoughts, there's not like a key to understand people I would just recommend talk about everything with her, and you'll find a better relationship
The feelings of support and love I have gotten from my partner have so far been the best thing about my transition. You're doing an amazing job so far just by wanting to be as informed and prepared as possible. I cannot speak for your partner but my personal challenges may offer some insight.

I have been slow to incorporate new things in part because I don't want things to be too jarring for either of us (and in part because the high low swing of doing too much too fast is a little too unpleasant for me). When I do incorporate something new, I might feel sheepish about it as well, as nobody has seen me this way before. It feels awesome when my partner compliments me and takes an interest in my thought process, even if I'm not quite ready to answer. She has a great way of reinforcing those things as valid choices I can make, which is very important to me because even though I have made enough personal progress to be open with her I am still working through many of the internal issues that kept me from knowing I was trans for so long. Like sometimes I just need to be reminded I'm not a bad person for doing a regular thing, y'know?

She has also been able to reassure me that she would tell me if something about the relationship fundamentally changes for her at some point. My partner is straight, so it was a considerable point of tension for me prior to coming out and my insecurity here may be worse than others, but by knowing she'd be honest if something was really wrong I can appreciate that things are genuinely good right now.

She has also started broaching some topics that we likely would not have discussed if I were still presenting as male. It's helped me feel like our relationship is deepening and it can be so rewarding to get a more social validation when so much of early transition is fixated on looks.

If I really need it, she will just hold me tight for a while.
I'm currently in the military and not out either, and one of the things that helps me in regards to uniform and not feeling dysphoria about it is that the command on my vehicle is probably the most badass person in our platoon and she is a cis woman same with our platoon CO, that helps ground me in that the uniform is for everyone, and depending on the work then wear feminine underwear, and when i get home i always change over to feminine clothes at once,

 i hope any of this can help your partner at least a little and they are really lucky to have someone like you at their side best of luck to the both of you
To be honest this post really touched me. Thank you for being so kind and accepting towards your partner. The world needs more people like you <3
Hey!! Let‚Äôs connect. My partner recently is transitioning too. She came out a long time ago to me but now we are facing transition together after being a hetrosexual couple for most of our relationship (her choice, turn out being trans is hard and she‚Äôs finally ready to transition). I too am bisexual so the transition doesn‚Äôt bother me but we are also on this journey figuring out what to do. I‚Äôd love someone to talk to about this as well since we have no close friends in the LGBT community.
Hi, I feel like we are in a similar boat. My partner is in the military(USA, not sure if you're in America) as well and we have 3 young children together. They have had gender dysphoria since before they can remember and became very depressed about 6 months ago because of it(they've had depression for a while). I encouraged them to go to mental health and see a therapist. They ended up going and the military has a therapist on base who specializes in gender dysphoria. My partner did not have to tell any of their leadership about why they were going to mental health and was able to be open and honest with their therapist without fear of being outed. They found out that the military has lots of things to offer people in their position. They are starting hrt without having to tell anyone they work with, and have begun facial hair removal. We also got their eyebrows plucked and they present as female at home. They have come out to their close family and friends who are supportive, and plan to come out to everyone after they get out of the military. 

But for now, it has helped so much to have a therapist, get hormone therapy, get rid of facial hair, they shave their legs and love that as well, and dressing feminine in the house has been such a help to them. I highly suggest they reach out to mental health and be honest to them so that they can start taking steps in the direction of transitioning, without having to come out to everyone they work with. 

As for our kids, they know that their ""daddy"" is a woman stuck in a males body and that one day she will go through a metamorphosis like a butterfly, and will no longer be ""daddy, he, or him"", but will be ""mommy, she, and her"". They are young and so loving and understanding and are excited for their ""daddy"".
It might help if you can look at treat them as you would another CIS woman. Maybe they are Trans Bi or Lesbian.
You‚Äôre doing great! Thank you so much for being so supportive! We need more people like you :)
Remember one thing, that every trans will say to you, you're helping and the dysphoria that they have it's not because you're not helping enough it's just there. You're doing great you're helping them as mush as you can do for the moment !
Honestly, you‚Äôre doing great, I think. It seems like what your partner is struggling with right now is the inability to be out at work, especially now they‚Äôre at a point where they are out to themselves and at home. 

Making your family and your home affirmatively a safe space for them to be themself and explore what it means to them to be a woman is fantastic. There may be other ways you can do that, sure, but you‚Äôre off to a great start. 

I‚Äôd check in with them and see if they have any ideas about what might help them, or things they‚Äôd like to do or try. 

If their job is somewhere they are not going to be able to be out, it might be helpful to do some serious planning around how to work towards supporting your family another way. It wouldn‚Äôt be a quick fix, but making working there while closeted a finite thing instead of an indefinite one would probably help a lot. And that probably feels like a lot right now, but it‚Äôs not something that has to be finalized right away. Just opening that possibility up would probably help.
Military can make it incredibly difficult depending on what rank and area they're in. Whatever they want to do to transition they're going to need to do it gradually.

Learn what the policies are for transition in the military. I know someone who was trying to transition but wasn't allowed to start HRT because it would make them lose their strength. But they were also training for a highly specialized special forces role of some sort. Idk if maybe the regular military would be more accepting.

Honestly help them pick some clothes they can at least wear around the house. Help them learn makeup and stuff that might help with a feminine presentation.
What a wonderful partner you are. They are lucky to have you. As for what to do to futher support them, keep allowing them to experiment with what they feel comfortable with and be affirming and loving when they are dysphoric. Military jobs aren't forever and transition can take a while to become noticeable. The Trump policy on trans folks serving have been reversed and your partner cannot be discriminated under the law. 

Here's a link to the story if you are interested

Good luck and keep being awesome
How about getting them an outfit or 2, so they have something to change into after work. Skirts and T-shirts are a good place to start. The femboy sub-reddits love to spin their skirts.
If they are using gender neutral pronouns, saying ""my person"", ""my spouse, parent of my children"" may help alleviate some dysphoria. Could your spouse wear a sports bra under the uniform, if that would help?
I think reading the dysphoria Bible, easily found with a Google search, might prove illuminating and helpful for both of you if you haven't done so already. 

I had a partner of a decade when I came out and she did sweet little things like swapping my pillow case to something softer and more feminine, going shipping with me for things I was uncomfortable looking for alone and making time for little silly feminine things together like a quick eyeliner tutorial on the internet. None of this was substantial and the physical things don't matter other than they were continually little signals that she supported me in finding myself.
wrap her up in a blanket like a cozy burrito

snuggle up to burrito and spoon <3
Something small that really helps alleviate dysphoria is to give gender-affirming compliments. I would ask if your partner is comfortable being called beautiful or pretty, usually this helps a lot. Sometimes when my partner feels I'm struggling he called me handsome and it really helps :) thank you for being a supportive partner

Edit: pronouns
Well you can‚Äôt always use the word they. It just doesn‚Äôt make since with everything.
you're doing your best that's what matters
But then some feminine clothes to wear at home, and maybe out in public if they're comfortable. Dresses, feminine tops, skirts, etc. Maybe help them try out makeup and see if they like it.
And when they're comfortable and if they want to, let the kids know about them being trans and try to educate them on what being trans is.

Bottom line is, let them be who they are as they want to, when they can. Which you already seem to be doing, so thank you.
A few things I‚Äôll suggest give https://genderdysphoria.fyi a read its a great beginners guide for both of you to get some ideas on what to expect. Branch they are in isn‚Äôt specified so my knowledge is limited to army because that was my branch. I would recommend researching different branches policy‚Äôs but if its the army they just need to get a diagnosis for gender dysphoria and inform their CO and put a request in to change their gender marker in DEERS however DEERS does not take non-binary as a gender. But given that the military will pay for all medical procedures is a plus
Thank you. It‚Äôs really hard to feel like she is drowning and I may be doing as much as I alone can without a gender affirming therapist right this moment.
This. Just you supporting and being there for them is honestly the best help you could ever give them. You're already doing great.
I‚Äôm so happy you also were welcomed with open arms in your relationship. I really appreciate this experienced point of view and I will try to look into therapy for them. Thank you so much for the compliments and advice.
Thank you!!! I am new to Reddit but I will definitely check this out!
I totally didn‚Äôt think about deodorant because I use ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù deodorant! I am also looking into resources like you mentioned, realizing it‚Äôs going to be hard where we live currently so I‚Äôm starting to think we‚Äôll have to rely on the internet :( thank you!
Great answer ‚ù§Ô∏è
[deleted]
I got permission to share this but they actually shaved their butt without me and holy razor burn üò≠ I have been applying aloe to their cheeks for three days.
I read every bit of this and really took it to heart. Thank you so much for taking the time to express so much help, resource guidance, and valued point of view for my family. It means the world to me!
Of course! I hope I didn‚Äôt come off as having a closed line of communication with them, I was just really hoping people who have more experience might have tips for how they‚Äôve been gender reaffirming themselves while closeted since we both come from the south and when we were living with our parents even secrets would have been dangerous. Now, they‚Äôre safe and loved! But they still seem timid.
I will message you if that‚Äôs okay! I would love to have someone to talk to and it would be really lovely for our ladies to relate!!!
I really believe they are a woman no different from any other woman I‚Äôve loved and I will make sure I constantly remind them they are a beautiful woman.
Yes you can and yes it does. They works as a third person pronoun in any place where a third person pronoun works, because it's a third person pronoun.
Primary goal should be to get a therapist, however you can. She is going through a lot and you just aren‚Äôt equipped to be her only source of support. You need to take care of yourself, so that you can have bandwidth to be there for her. The only way that is possible is if she is in therapy. 

Let me be clear, I don‚Äôt think she needs therapy because being trans is a mental illness as transphobes say *(it absolutely is not)*, just that it is a major change and your partner has a lot to navigate that just frankly takes a lot of care and energy to do. I am speaking from experience. There is just a lot to process in starting a transition.
Idk what the process is for counseling in the military but make sure you all don‚Äôt accidentally circumvent any established procedures (eg: going directly to a gender affirming counselor rather than being referred). I don‚Äôt know how the military treats trans-related counseling but last thing you want is for your SO to get some sort of ‚Äúunfit for duty‚Äù report by a military counselor. Again though, idk what the process is like and I would appreciate if anyone can correct me or offer more details.

Also, good job at being supportive OP! I‚Äôm sure your partner appreciates that you‚Äôre taking the time to help her navigate this
The dysphoria tends to get worse after coming out to people around you. My theory is this is because it‚Äôs suddenly okay to stop pretending, but most of us still have a voice in our heads telling us to keep hiding.

Basically just keep being supportive. Keep gently pushing them forward with what they want to try when they freeze.
They mentioned their partner uses gender neutral pronouns btw!
Anytime. Here to help others as others have helped me.
Go together and smell different deodorants so they can pick one out they like. Focusing on a new skincare routine is also nice, adding in a moisturizer and trying new soaps, and shampoos.
hi, im former air force and EO will absolutely go to bat for your partner, but the only people who even need to know anything in the immediate are their CC and First Shirt.  


Please please please, send them to mental health on base and get an official diagnosis.     


If you have any specific air force questions please DM me, I just went through all this about 6-7 months ago now.
Must be just the navy then
I‚Äôm young, so I may be saying something stupid. But if your partner experiences significant dysphoria, do you and them believe they could get another job where they‚Äôd be able to be more open??
Yeah, AMAB people have a real rough time shaving the butt. I'm trans, am on hormones, but don't shave my butt. I've been meaning to get laser hair removal for that.
Yeah Ive been dodging that rabbit hole for a bit now,  I haven't got a clue how to do it and dont have anyone to help out :(
I am really afraid when I write such big texts that i will say something that will cause harm. I really hope that I anything you might take from any answer here will only help you and not set you back.

I want to be a mom some day and whenever I read about households and families of trans people I get unreal levels of strength to keep on fighting. If anything I should be thanking you for warming my lonely heart with your uncompromising dedication to your significant other. I wish you once again the best of luck
The problem is that there's not a tip to understand someone, but I think that there's a lot of thoughts about how you feel comfortable with your body o with yourself and after a lot of thoughts and meditation, you start to question your sexuality, like orientation and self perception that are different things, at least for self perception I feel like it's a bit harder to understand cuz everyone has different minds and thoughts, for example with me I've always been bi and at some point when I saw cute or beautiful (like handsome English isn't my main language sorry) i started to say damn I wish I could look like her and after a lot of thinking and meditating about it (like literally 1 and a half year) i came to the conclusion that I'm trans, once I get enough courage to talk about it with someone I did it and here I am.
Also I think at some point you're scared about it and you start to think ""am I trans or am I faking it?"" Thing that at my point of view I think that if you ask that to yourself means that you are, a tip I could give you is talk to her has she wants (of course you have to talk to know more of her) be supportive and a big tip is if she goes to hrt she will be more sensitive not only fiscal but mentally too, I hope that helps you, and good luck (I guess) :3
Absolutely!
They are very blessed to be with you then. Thank you for your humanity.
Incorrect. Lol. But you‚Äôre the grammar expert here
Ohh, ok! I'll edit it :)
THIS. I started a skincare routine almost immediately after I started questioning because I wanted to be SMOOTH and it helps so much with the dysphoria honestly
I feel so hard for trans military members because I mentioned the other night the directors of the Matrix were trans women and I just ostracized us from nearly our entire friend group for being transphobic about it before my partner came out. They were all military and military spouses. I now realize my partner was closeted and got a horrible look into what they would say about them at work or in private. Their entire end of the year reviews are hinged on people loving them‚Äî and they are seriously beloved in the community. It breaks my heart that THAT is what‚Äôs stopping them from being themself.
I have actually BEGGED them to quit the military, not only for this reason but I‚Äôve suggested it now more than ever. After Covid hit, we were some of our only family who managed to keep a steady pay and had health insurance. They are truly terrified of quitting, as they are 30 now and it‚Äôs good enough pay and insurance that they have told me they don‚Äôt see another way for us. But I told them I will support them through anything and I don‚Äôt care if we don‚Äôt have two pennies to rub together if that‚Äôs what it takes.
I don‚Äôt know about your skin sensitivity but I just taught them how to use nair today (on their legs and not their razor burn) and they actually said that it was exactly the look they had wanted!!!
I really appreciate you taking the time tonight to help explain this point of view to me! I see I could have been generalizing a bit!
says the one using singular ""you"", when the grammatically correct singular second-person pronoun is ""thou""
What you are dealing with right now is the sunk cost fallacy oh, what she needs to do is real getting this done and over with sooner rather than later is going to be the best option for her mentally and the best option for the family, have her seriously ask the question is it going to be better for me to try and look for a new job now, or suffer for several years before winding up having to get a new job anyway because her workplace is hostile.

Please don't let her fall into the Trap that a lot of older trans people do when they have careers which is assume that they can just suffer for several more years just because they've already done it for so long, but the fact of the matter is that she has accepted that she is trans and that means that any amount of suffering she had previously from her dysphoria is going to be so much worse until she actively start being herself all the time.

Some stuff that you can do very easily to fight off the dysphoria is to buy a electric shaver there is a woman's one on Amazon for like $20 if you look it up and just shave everything on top of that you can try scented deodorant perfumes moisturizers and if they can grow out their hair lots of different hairstyles. You may also want to consider buying a wig if her hair is short.
Didnt know nair existed! Always bothers me how even after shaving with a blade or an electric razor theres that weird look where you can still tell its there just waiting to grow. Does nair create a different look?
Well there's no problem I guess, isn't a big problem and i think I could sound a bit agresive thing that wasn't my intention just that it's a bit hard to write when I speak other language (Spanish), but I would just recommend talk with your partner about your feelings and doubts, no1 knows better your partner that herself, I hope you can solve some doubts here, it's good being accepted and supported by your partner, good night :3
You poor thing, they had the same issue with the electric razor and that‚Äôs what did it to them. Like DEEP red streaks down their backside and thigh. Yes, nair is a SOFT completely clean look.
Good to know. So far I've been quite lucky and safe with the shaving, I've been deathly careful around areas I dont normally shave to avoid nicks and as you say deeper burns and similar. Do you have any suggestions for how people like your wife (sorry if thats not the preferred term) and myself get rid of hair like that? I guess nair would only work on already shaved skin
Honestly, they would love to hear someone referring them as my wife. I don‚Äôt want to put words into their mouth because I think they‚Äôre only leaning neutral for fear of transition being jarring to me. Nair actually works on completely unshaven skin! It sounds scary but you leave it on for five minutes (my hair is thick so I go a little longer) and it technically burns it off. I suggest doing it in the shower, then rinsing it off of your body, then going about your regular shower :) it is quite literally as easy and wonderful as it sounds. And the one I bought yesterday was about four bucks!
As OP said, it's quite easy to use (I used a similar product by a different brand), just please please please don't let it get close to areas where your skin is sensitive, it will very likely get irritated af, so you really wanna avoid that and find a different solution for these areas if you want to get rid of hair there 
A tip for shaving in the public area and wherever else your hair might be a bit longer, that I've learned a while ago, is to cut it shorter with (hair) scissors at first, before using the razor. I also have an electric razor with a body groomer head that honestly works absolute wonders for shaving just about everywhere without much (or any) skin irritation - and I have incredibly sensitive skin, that is constantly dry, because it sucks up all cream/body butter within half a minute like a dry sponge and gets red and swollen and itchy when I just use normal plasters instead of sensitive ones, because it doesn't like the glue it seems
Thanks so much for answering my questions, its been seriously helpful.  I really hope everything turns out great with you and your SO!! :)
Honestly i dont know if i can bring myself to use a razor directly on my bits. I feel like I'll definately cut myself and I imagine that could end quite bad. I might look for a solution for sensitive skin if one exists because honestly down there is just a terrifying place to shave. I've tried using some tiny scissors but i have very unsteady hands and as you might imagine I'm quite nervous for nearing it...
I totally get that! That's why I like the body groomer head so much, it's almost (!) impossible to really hurt yourself with it. At least right now I'd say it's the safest and least painful I could think of of all methods I've tried so far, that isn't performed by a professional of some kind. Most body groomers are made in a way that the blades are kept away from the skin a little bit, so if potentially investing in an electric razor would be an option for you, I'd definitely have a look into one that has a body grooming head (it's honestly great for legs and other stuff too, I basically use mine (a braun multigroomer, not sure which one exactly) for pretty much everything, from undercut, over eyebrows, to legs and more private areas)

God I'm so sorry if I sound pushy or like I'm trying to sell you something like my electric razor lmao, I just tried a ton of different things (cream, sugaring, epilating, shaving with multi blade razors, single blade razors, cheap and high quality electric razors/groomers) and hope to kinda spare you going through some of those options, especially those that involve ripping hair out (like epilating, sugaring and waxing)
No no honestly I really appreciate the recommendations. I'm not entirely sure I get what you mean by a body groomer though. Is it just a regular electric razor head? I've tried googling it but it seems to just come up with regular razors.

 Sorry to be a bother, I'm really only getting into hair removal and I'm really new to electric ones in particular so I'm a little confused
Okay, I'm glad you do! And don't worry, you're not bothering me at all, I'm happy if I can help somehow

I put together a little [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/T3rTTDc) explaining a few different heads that are relatively common in most electric razors/multitrimmers/multigroomers (not sure what name exactly is the correct term here tbh, probably all and none of them, you can for sure find them under each of the names, the last two seem to bring up better results tho) and especially might be interesting and important to know in this context. Some sets also include other stuff like nose hair trimmers, but I guess that's pretty self-explanatory. Hope this helps understanding the difference a bit better!

Also, if you have any further questions, feel free to message me privately, that's maybe a bit more convenient than in the replies like this (but if you prefer it this way, that's totally fine too ofc!)"	s5rafa	trans	1078	0.98	2022-01-17 01:27:52
Welp üôÉ While there's been so much legislation introduced recently attacking trans existence, this is one of the most directly harmful ones yet to fully be passed into law (hopefully it gets blocked by the courts)		"This won't get blocked by the courts. It's Utah, this is Mormon Town and Mormons *hate* trans people
Remember when this happened in Texas and our community alongside allies kicked up a huge storm? That needs to happen again. Actually, it's been desparately needed for months now. There was one huge wave of pushback, and then silence. But legislation restricting trans rights and access to care have not stopped coming this whole time. We need to be loud and we need to be consistent, not just when things are really bad, but at every small act of aggression, every minor law that pushes the Overton Window on the ""trans issue"" further to their side. Because these people thrive when we let their harm slip under the radar until it's too late.
Mormons gonna Morm. They can come out and say they are indifferent to LGBT people all they want, but this legislation is the direct result of allowing a cult to have near free reign of a state.
Jesus, this makes our TERF island look like a haven for trans people.
I live in Utah and I didn't know about this. I thought our governor was at least a little better than that. There's no way the courts are blocking it, I know my state too well.
I'm so sorry for Utah trans kids... This is horrible and unacceptable. But it won't be blocked, I think, the far right has pulled the overton window enough to their side to make it seem like this is a ""centrist position"".
It *is* Utah, aka Mormon Central, so I'm not surprised. The courts won't block it in that state.
Mormons are the fucking worst.
Better block it then.
Is California trans-friendly?
theres other option to fix it too, fire.
PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD FOR TIKTOK USERS

I'm new to this but I need to get a message out there there is a group of girls on tiktok who act like they are in support and allies but they are posting very transphobic things not sure how this works but there user names are 

Kindnesswitch/kindnessraven
Communityacct.j.j.c 
And mrs.peyton.mainacc

I think they have gone private but the account they share isn't and has some very transphobic posts they have also been found out to be racist and a bunch of other crimes they've done behind closed doors including doxxing people putting people in danger and children in danger 
I want all my trans folks to be safe so I want to get the message out there not to trust and to report these people
the bill does not outright ban it, just requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis to get it. srs is banned for youth though which i think is semi-reasonable
This is ridiculous! Do they not want people to be happy? All they are gonna get out of this is lose voters and lose people when they move states or countries
As someone from Utah, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcommon stance.‚Äù The part the part that utahns agree with is the surgeries but very few here have even heard the part about hormone therapy.
Interesting, considering all of its ties to polygamy.
Can they not get blockers at least ?
People keep saying how free America is, we need to make sure that it will stay free for us too.
This is sadly gonna probably cause an increase in suicide of those under 18‚Ä¶ Gender Dysphoria is a fuckin bitch istfg
I thought it made it so they had to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria to get hormones
They're also trying to resume conversion therapy which is currently banned. Not the physical part (like electroshock). Just the talk based ""therapy"" like conversion camp.
[removed]
That cult hates anyone who isn‚Äôt them. Utah is the world‚Äôs biggest tumor.
This same law in Arkansas has been blocked, appealed (block continued), and appealed again. The final ruling should come soon but for now, care has continued. It will have a bearing in other states. The lawsuit is Brandt v. Rutledge so have hope! The ACLU is on top of these bills and is representing four minor plaintiffs and their families in Arkansas.
It's unconstitutional. The federal courts could easily twist their arm on this one.
not every mormon hates trans people. But A LOT do
Yep. This is why I don't care about all of the people that say things like ""not all conservatives/Republicans hate trans people. Most of us don't care what you do in your own life"" and then they vote for this shit
it's morming time. jokes aside i am really happy to be living in New Zealand rn, america seems to be trying to pass a new bill against trans people every week.
There's still a majority of the US that isn't trying to pass these laws, and several states have already codified trans rights into their state constitutions. Remember, the US is essentially 50 separate countries, and the really conservative states like to pick fights with the federal government for fun!
It's unconstitutional. They are kinda bound by the highest law in the land. If it is not overturned, then the government can take away federal funds. Which would be VERY bad for the Utah government.
It's unconstitutional. If it is not blocked, the federal government can restrict federal funds from the state. That would be VERY bad for Utah's government.
Yes as far as I know. Source: live here
This is false. It bans all youth not already with a diagnosis before the bill came into effect. A diagnosis has always been required for treatment with the way the system was set up.

https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/utah-care-ban-for-trans-youth-takes

That being said, gender affirming surgeries simply do not happen with youth (with the exception of top surgery for late teens, which is extremely beneficial to their health and banning which should also call into question breast augmentation surgeries that are perfectly legal for cis girls) considering medical best practices, that isn't something that needs to be banned by law. The only reason for it to appear explicitly in a bill would be to make it seem like a real issue, to push the ""trans people are chopping up little kids"" narrative, which is untrue
Considering the courts in Utah have blocked enforcement of the Trans sports ban shows that this will likely meet a similar fate. Both bills target trans people in ways that it is difficult to argue they are not discriminating against trans people. Legislators of this bill even refused to change the ban on all plastic surgeries on minors. Equality Utah is planning a lawsuit on this one like they did for the trans sport bill
This bans all forms of medical transition related care for minors, including blockers
No:

""The bill, which rocketed through the senate and the house and featured heated debate in both, bans all trans youth NOT ALREADY DIAGNOSED with gender dysphoria from receiving gender affirming care. It also features a complex web of statutes meant to make gender affirming care impossible to provide, such as a statute that lets anyone go back in time and ‚Äúdisaffirm consent‚Äù up to the age of 25 years old. Collectively, these statutes will effectively end gender affirming care for transgender youth in the state of Utah.""

This means youth who are not already currently receiving affirming care are barred from ever getting it 

https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/utah-care-ban-for-trans-youth-takes
That's nice <3 I was suicidal before transition and now I live every day like any other person. I take bioidentical hormone supplements that have put me down the natural puberty cycle for the sex I am most comfortable with. Idk how that can be seen as mutilating my body (anymore than someone taking vitamin supplements so their body functions at full capacity) or dysfunctional to my mental health, but keep living in your fantasy where people are somehow ""crazy"" for not perfectly fitting into a social role predetermined for them at birth.

People are born with much MUCH weirder conditions than their sense of self not matching with their genitals; people are born with tumours and without limbs and all kinds of smaller-scale oddities all the time, I don't see how transgender people as a concept are so far fetched to you people considering the complex, multi-stage, and imperfect nature of sex development
Yup. I fucking hate it here and one day I'm gonna leave.

So was slavery.
Man, I wish I had your optimism. I just feel like knowing Utah and how the Mormons run and manipulate everything to be exactly how they want, it's not looking good. Utah is legitimately run by a cult. They have extremely strange laws there that if it were any other state, would never be passed. I just get the feeling that with how deep the Mormon cult runs in that state and with who knows who's pockets are being lined with what type of currency, and with a growing transgender youth population being seen as a blight in the church's eyes, I just can't help but feel hopeless. It may be unconstitutional, but I don't know if the people that are supposed to do anything about it actually will...
Let's hope Biden has some guts I guess
The state court that blocked the trans sport bill cited violations of the Utah constitution‚Äôs equal guarantees and this is the same case.

No, but I understand how constitutional law works and what happened with South Dakota v. Dole.
Maybe you should find out what this bill does, and maybe that will persuade you to stop supporting the party pushing for a genocide against trans people.
Re evaluate this position. It‚Äôs wrong.
Sure, here‚Äôs your acknowledgment: rethink your positions, because you‚Äôre likely very deeply incorrect in all of them. Putting that target on your back ain‚Äôt worth saving money on taxes (which they probably aren‚Äôt actually doing for you anyways, unless you‚Äôre among the mega-rich).
never thought i‚Äôd see a transgender republican
I'm going to try not to come at you too hard here, but I see you have ""femboy she/her BLM"" in your bio. 3 things the republican party are publicly vehemontly against. The republican party is passing anti-lgbt legislation across the nation and wanting to push for it federally. They passed anti-abortion laws across the nation. The defund planned parenthood as much as possible and want to completely close it down (eliminating healthcare for mostly cis women and trans people). They're pro big government despite saying they are the opposite just to deny the citizens better healthcare systems. They're anti education because it's ""indoctrination"". The politicians themselves have claimed to be christian nationalists. They are intentionally even trying to misrepresent the 1st amendment so they can instill christian law while simultaneously speaking down on al-qaeda for doing the same thing because they view Islam as false and radical. Which also just shows that they don't actually care about the constitution as they try to use it to control everyone who has different views and then ignore the rules that apply to them.

I'm just failing to see a single good thing about the party. Sure, they back the 2nd amendment like it's the word of God himself, but many democrats/independents support it as well.
My friend that is rather foolish

Doesn't necessarily even need to get that high. I don't even think it will reach the Supreme Court. It is blatantly unconstitutional.
You're not offensive, you're just fundamentally wrong on a number of the facts you listed. Every cell in your body sure does have your chromosomes, but the ones that determin sex have no function long-term outside of guiding some basic processes of development during your formation in the womb and a bit during puberty, which are far far more complicated than just ""cell says do this, so body does every single thing related to sex formation perfectly and without any variation"". The chromosomes are just the first trigger in a huge complicated multi-step system that has a lot of moving parts and will go on to continue to change and develop throighout your life. And chromosomes, when tested, can sometimes not match what you'd expect! And this happens actually fairly often! Because these processes are imperfect and variable! This little piece of your cell does not carry nearly enough information to be define your entire gender and sex, it just sequences in a pattern that binds with other cells in a way that triggers a domino effect of many processes that typically cause sex development in certain typical ways.

People didn't even know chromosomes existed until a couple hundred years ago, but gendered divisions have existed for much longer. We cannot be bogged down in a conversation about chromosomes when they have absolutely no tangible bearing on everyday life. We don't gender certain social roles because people have some microscopic chromosome we cannot see, we do it because of lived reality.

People can have kids, even if theyre trans. And your point fully devalues adoption as just as good of an option

There have been numerous studies on regret rates, and all of them come up with the same conclusion that transition helps the vast vast vast majority of people who pursue it. It is also widely accepted that being trans is not directly caused by or linked to mental health issues or dysfunction, but this relationship is often very profound in the opposite direction, because of the burden of having to live with a discordent identity and facing social stigma. The very few studies suggesting otherwise have been debunked time and time again for their poor scientific rigour. You seem to cite what is essentially the ""social contagion"" theory of being trans, but if you look to any respected academic or medical organization, you will see this is also bunk science that has been discredited. Of course coming out as trans is happening more, as more people are given the knowledge to understand themselves and the avenues to access transition. Left handedness also rose (and eventually plateuaed) when society stopped treating it as the devil

Also, again, hormone therapy is bioidentical. A basic regimen for a trans women has essentially the same risk factors as just... being a woman (and vice versa). Sure, intaking any medication always comes with some other things (like all pills need to be processed through the liver, etc. Though there are other methods of HRT that makes this point moot) but this is why it's a process monitored by your doctor. It makes your body do the opposite puberty that it originally was doing, that's all there really is to it. It is not some crazy experimental drug
I want to live in Oregon, personally
What does SD v. Dole have to do with this and why would the Feds actually give enough of a shit about us to actually challenge the bill?

We've seen the same type of legislation passed in many other states. Why is this one different?
thanks üòä
To clarify legal protections are not the same as having it codified in our constitutions. (I'm a Washingtonian) and one of the republican representatives proposed a G.A.C. ban for under 18s the bill got to the public comment phase (really early) and so me and everyone in our state wide support group left our comments. Afew got replies to their comments on the bill basiclay assuring us the bill was dead on arrival and wouldnt even get a hearing) yhe person whi got the reply sent a followed up messagr suggesting we add protections to the state constitution 
And thr reprrsentative replied again prop wa rep Sharon  

The partys working on adding abortion protection to our state constitution but are shy of the 2/3rds majority needed to let it go to a statewide citizen vote (which only needs 50%)

Si We're 4 senators and 8 representatives short for any state constitution stuff that doesn't have cross party support
Thanks I live in mass and I was worrying a lot over this. Things are still going to get bad in the upcoming years.
Alright! I don't really understand this part. Let's hope for the best!
Go for it! That's a good one too!
SD v. Dole is what the federal government can do if an unconstitutional law is not overturned. 

There are examples of similar bills that have been blocked in states like Alabama and Arkansas. For example, courts have held that any intervention by the state must be based on a compelling interest and have a narrow focus. A federal court found Alabama‚Äôs ban did not meet either because twenty-two major medical associations endorsed using medications for transitioning. A similar thing can be found for this as well.
Indeed!

Why the hell do they care so much about denying us, when we‚Äôre literally only 0.7% of the population. And probably less than a quarter of that percentage is actually taking advantage of the health care? Really??????

My state too -_-
Cult state.
Yay!! Let's watch children's suicide rates spike! This is so dangerous. Next, we will have teens' percentage of suicide has increased, but we can't find where the correlation is. As we and other psychology professionals are screaming about suicide due to lack of child care services for lgbtq+ kids to feel safe or be social with those the love.

the 3 bills are: SB 16, SB 100, and SB 93
Am I missing something in Missouri?? This post makes me feel like I did.
If it passes, someone will file a lawsuit. Given that it is unconstitutional as it goes against the 14th amendment, a proper court will undo it. I don't think it will make its way to the Supreme Court as it is obviously unconstitutional. I hope Utah's Supreme Court will be smart enough to recognize this.
My state too üôÉüôÉ I began hrt when I was a youth (in Maryland) and it was a life saver.
Legislators have ZERO business regulating healthcare. What a patient does is supposed to be explicitly between the provider and them. This is a serious overreach of power.
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but gender affirming healthcare has quite literally saved kids‚Äô mental health and lives right? 
They‚Äôre just restricting frickin access to lifesaving care at this point. This country istg‚Ä¶

Salt Lake City is the only place where people aren't conservative Mormon dickheads. My family is a part of this cult. I grew up in it and believed in it for 24 years. It's hard to get out once you are in because everyone looks down on you. Joseph Smith was a con artist and a pedophile. I hate this state.
Young people and lgbtq people alike need to get involved local politics!
thank fuck i don't live in that cult infested shithole
arm yourselves, fight the tyranny, teach them they work for *us* not the other way around
So tell me again how this isn't blatant discrimination against someone based on gender, age, or orientation? Is it really that hard for these people to just accept that some people are different? We worked so hard to get gay rights on a federal level, because obviously the states couldn't be responsible enough to do the right thing on their own. Why are we letting them control us?  These bullies have been in power long enough. Are we just not being loud enough, or are we yelling at the wrong people?
Do you live in Utah?
You're applying logic to a purely emotional and fear based argument. It's the same as the moral panic against communists in the 50s, the Black Panthers in the 70s and 80s, the satanic panic of D&D, and the reaction to Muslims in the 00s and 10s. Anything to scare the base and not get them to think about how shitty their lives are.
They‚Äôre genocidal. End of story.
Come to us or the Kiwis, our Democracy is.... flawed but its so much better than the shit the U.S has. Better yet, it's unlikely stuff like this could happen here without...

As a Utahn and former Mormon cult member and still stuck in this pos state, I approve of this message. Seriously though, there's being ""in the closet"" then there's being ""locked in the fucking basement behind a steel, soundproof door"" because of cult brainwashing.

This state is fucked up I left the state back in 2007 but still my state is fucked up to don't vote Kristi Noem ever even for president of the usa
It's patriarchy all the way down. Too many old religious people with fucking brain worms.
One in five anti-LGBT bills brought up this year has been in Missouri. They range from book bans to classifying drag shows as ""obscene"" strip performances to banning HRT for teens to banning all sex ed so kids don't learn about gender. There's also one bill, I don't remember if in Missouri or Kansas, that bans birth control because it's a form of abortion. The midwest US is not okay.
I Doubt it
Well, nazi Germany was slower with that
No. Pennsylvania, but this is just bullshit yk.
I live in southern utah. i‚Äôm 20, but this breaks my heart everytime I see it on the senate agenda
Yeah. It‚Äôs not logical at all. It‚Äôs just an agenda. 
There‚Äôs a multitude of things logically to get rid of, before getting rid of trans healthcare. Literally doesn‚Äôt help the economy by a fraction it‚Äôs just to tear us down because of their beliefs.
True that
I get where you are coming from, but there is a slight problem with this comparison. The Communist Party and the Black Panther Party were actually inherently threatening against capitalism in a way in which greater trans rights are not. Our socioeconomic system is very adaptable. Nothing about basic trans rights is antithetical to capitalism, even if actual queer liberation is. The trans movement/ppl can and likely will be assimilated into the system and to an extent already has, we see this in parts of Western Europe. Even many of the basic tenets of belief of both the Communist Party and the Panthers were inherently oppositional to capitalism in a mutually exclusive way.
Add Canada to the list. Our system is also flawed and far from perfect, for sure, and I am absolutely the opposite of a nationalist, but thank goodness, so far our governments (and populations) don't seem to be anywhere near this level of anti-trans absurdity.  Plus, we'd love to have you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

De-transition Awareness Day	"Twitter has informed me that today is de-trans awareness day. While I fully support everyone‚Äôs gender journey, I can‚Äôt help but have some complicated feelings surrounding some of the posts I‚Äôm seeing. Many de-transitioners seem to feel like they were pressured to transition from family or healthcare providers, and seem to be advocating for less accessibility to transition resources. Resources like puberty blockers and HRT- resources that would have saved me years of crippling pain and dysphoria if I‚Äôd had access to them before t puberty destroyed my body. 

It is estimated that about 8% of people who transition end up detransitioning to some extent. And of those, about 90% do so out of fear for their physical or social safety. 

Just because it wasn‚Äôt right for you doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs right to deny access to millions of trans youth around the world. 

We all have a right to our gender identities. Don‚Äôt let your mistake (their word, not mine) veer you away from allyship or towards transphobia."	"100% agree, fam. I used to lay on my living room floor and cry because E puberty made my body so misshapen.
It‚Äôs worse in the UK, with the tories in charge. It‚Äôs impossible to get even blockers before 18 without a court case at this stage apparently (I have limited understanding on the matter) because of how de trans people have been depicting the healthcare system. I understand it wasn‚Äôt right for them, but they make it difficult for others
I can promise you, most of those posts will be from trolls/people pretending. Nobody is pressured to transition, and in most countries, it's very difficult to even be allowed to transition. It is naught but a way to discredit trans people
Don‚Äôt buy into this crud. TERF‚Äôs and the right-wing have formed an uncomfortable alliance on this issue, but the nice thing is our president supports us and we have the winds at our backs. We have to press forward and be visible at all levels of society. We can and will do this. üíï
Speaking of what I'd like to be improved would probably be representation of trans people and information about it. I didn't even know Trans people were a thing until I turned 18, so I was already pretty late when I started questioning which in itself took a bunch more years...

If I was explained what they were in a non condescending way when I was like 10, it would probably have changed my life for the better.
I think it can be hard to support people who detransition because of all the fear mongering that comes from conservatives.
Detransition people have been used as an argument to push a transphobic agenda. So when people mention detransition we get weary because most of the time it‚Äôs followed by transphobia. This doesn‚Äôt make detrans people any less valid.
This shouldn't be a thing.
I usually say it pretty blunt:

Any person who detransitions (for whatever reason it may be) and therefore starts to try and make transitioning an even harder process than it already is for others, is an absolute worthless person, and I also don't necessarily care if they got affected by TERFs (who do love to pile on vulnerable people like this). It's alright to be frustrated at making a wrong decision, but to put the blame on trans people makes this person a scumbag, period.

I rather have 92 people transition somewhat happily (it is already harder than it needs to be) and deal with 8 cis people (who might not be cis anyways but detransitioned for other reasons), if we take the 8% given here, from memory most of the time those numbers are actually lower in the 3% room.
i didnt De transition persay, but i was one of the many who stuffed themselves back in the closet out of fear for their own safety. it kills me every single day i really wish i could be strong enough to just be who i am but ive had too many straight death threats from strangers to ever feel safe tbh. now even when i Know im safe the memories of getting the shit beaten out of me, or getting kicked out of public spaces, or my parents being my angry then I've seen them in my life. idk if ill ever feel comfortable in my own skin. i cant hell but feel had i had access to puberty blockers of some kind this wouldn't be the case but idk. long story short, a little understanding and empathy can really change someone's life
I detransitioned when I was younger and spent a few years as my agab. there were a few different reasons but they didn't hold up. a lot of my life would be way way easier if I had not done it but I also had experiences in that time that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. It was definitely part of the journey but Idk if I'd do it over again. unfortunately the stories that fit the conservative narrative get a lot more attention than those like mine.
I'd be willing to bet just about anything the vast majority of people actually presenting this stance aren't and never have been trans. It's just transphobes posing as ex(?)trans people.
I really like how you framed this cause it's real complex and how it's politicized also further complicates it

. [It does happen but it's mostly not that they aren't trans but because of pressure, but even so some people who do detransition discover they weren't trans, but then politically it's used to defend anti trans laws -> very complicated]

I really learned a lot about de transitioning from Elle Palmer on YouTube. She's part of the 10% of the 8% that de transitioned cause she realized that she wasn't trans. She also addresses these statics and nuances and explicitly states that it's rare to be in her situation and that she still supports trans rights and everything. 
At least from the few videos of her's I watched.

I recommend folx her videos (a little cautiously cause I think the topic in general can give some dysphoricy vibes, for lack of a better term). I really had not much info on this topic outside of how it's weaponized by conservatives
I guess Twitter just meant awareness for a bad example
Now I will always grow facial hair. My voice will always sound too low and distorted to me. Trans men who decide to get top surgery will always have their scars. Just to name a few examples. It really sucks to see people advocating that this is something trans children deserve to go through. It‚Äôs too late for me, but it‚Äôs not too late for them.
The story is way worse than you know

The person who filed that court case didn't get their hormones until after the age of 16. My understanding is they've essentially slammed the door for all children in Britain

Over something that didn't even happen to them
Yeah the UK is fucked up right now for trans people.

I‚Äôm originally from England with a lot of family there and in Northern Ireland, and I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs safe for me and my family to travel back there any more - which makes me very sad.
>It‚Äôs impossible to get even blockers before 18 

But do they even have any purpose at all at that point?
no no, there are genuine detrans people out there.

except, they just like to peddle the myth that ""society forced them to transition"" as a way of excusing the fact that it was probably them who lied to their therapist as a way of getting HRT for some reason that wasn't related to being trans.

obviously it sucks an incredible lot for them and I genuinely feel for them, but I also feel for the trans kids who have to live their lives with a ruined body and with people gaslighting them into being their AGAB, who are probably living the same exact pain and suffering from dysphoria that detransitioners are.

except the only difference is that detransitioners are treated like children who fell off the monkey bars, while trans people are treated like war criminals.
Sorry, I live in America. You‚Äôre right. We actually have it okay here. I know it‚Äôs hard in other country‚Äôs rn but we HAVE to fight for what‚Äôs ours. Nobody is going to just give us our rights.
Look, I lurk on the different detrans subreddits, and some of them are honestly people in pain going through a difficult time after transitioning for the wrong reasons. Yes, some detrans people totally flip and become transphobic and that's bad. It is terrible that detransitioners are used as a weapon against trans people, but that doesn't mean we should throw all them under the bus, and deny them the right to call for awareness altogether.

I believe that awareness about detransitioners is important despite the transphobic crap can sometimes accompany it. For one, it's an important thing for people who are questioning to learn about in deciding whether or not transitioning is right for them. And two, some detransitioners are trans allies, and trans people pushing them away will only alienate them from us.

As trans people, detransition should remind us that not everyone questioning their gender is trans and should transition, and that the best way to help those how are questioning is to encourage them to explore everything, and take time to decide what's best for them.
What shouldn't be a thing?
I think some of you are making it more complicated than it is. Isn't it just that some people have gender dysphoria, transition then the dysphoria changes and they realise they don't want to be transitioned, so they detransition? I've been watching some of their videos. None of those said they were pressured by anyone to detransition, only they felt it inside.
One thing I will say if you are a trans man new top surgery techniques have made scars basically invisible just wanted to say because a lot of people might not be aware
That really brightens my future then. I bloody love the conservatives, always focusing on the right things. Like it‚Äôs in their nature to be bigots but they could at least wait for the international problem to end first
I was genuinely unaware of it all too, luckily I‚Äôm in the most trans friendly area of the place, but I only found out recently that I won‚Äôt be able to get HRT for even longer than if I was on a waiting list. I don‚Äôt think a lot of people realise how much damage they‚Äôre doing
Scotland is pretty chill though if you overlook the blatant human rights violations committed by the SNP government
Puberty continues for a few years after that, especially for facial and body hair growth. But, for the most part, the effects on bone growth, muscle development, and so on are done. It's messed up because if puberty blocking were generally accepted, the risk of transition regret would go down since gendered development would be delayed by some number of years. (In order to ensure proper development after resuming, they can only delay certain effects so long, so which effects are blocked varies.)
Adding on, you have to be on blockers for a year before HRT at least as a minor under the NHS
I completely believe there are people out there who felt something they perceived as pressure to transition, and then detransitioned when they discovered that it wasn't right for them.

I also believe there are people out there who felt transition was right for them, then discovered that it actually wasn't, and have used ""pressure from society, etc"" as a reason for why they transitioned in the first place in order to reduce how much of a mistake they're owning up to.

And finally, I believe the vast majority of people who decide to detransition do so out of a loss of insurance or financial capability to continue their transition, threats to their safety, health and wellbeing, and just overall unhappiness feeling like a persecuted class in society or a combination of all of these reasons.
>society forced them to transition

What society to they live in? A conservative fever dream version of Portland?
Of course there are real detrans people, no doubt. But all research shows that it's very few, and only a tiny tiny part of them do it because they regret it, and not out of outside pressures/circumstances. I'm talking about the people online who peddle detrans stories as a reason as to why no one should be allowed to transition. I'm willing to bet that very very few of them have ever transitioned, let alone detransitioned.
yep, there are plenty of genuine detrans people. and they get preyed on and manipulated by the terfs. chewed up and spat out when they're no longer useful.
De-transition awareness day should not be a thing. It's just an excuse to attack trans rights.
I'm not negating their experience. I'm saying that a whole day devoted to it will do more harm to the community than good (which includes trans people who decide to detransition).
Only for smaller chests, right? Anyways, surgeons in my country won't learn it for years... :/
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. Yeah the wait times are out of control üò©
[deleted]
Yeah, it is one thing to validate the people who did ""de-transition"" and another thing to make a WHOLE DAY dedicated to it.
I think it should be a thing, but it shouldn't be a valid excuse to attack trans rights. It should be a day for people to actually learn or be educated about why people detransition, the stats and how the only solution is to make resources more accessible and easy to experiment with.
it's terf propaganda, nothing more.
It is a bit like ""I prayed the gay away"" day or something...
Which,  is very icky. 
And definitely used as an excuse to attack our rights.
only for small chests yes :/

Alabama criminalized trans healthcare. The fuck is going on over there??		"Idk what is happening but now I know that you can fuck your sister but can‚Äôt become the sister
Hate. Nothing but hate against anything that isn't white, straight, and Christian over here, unfortunately. I want to leave, but I'm stuck here for multiple reasons.
It's a shithole run by old conservative bigots. Also includes crappy white BBQ sauce for some reason. 

The only reason I've visited is cause my grandma lives there, but it's like Georgia without the redeeming quality of having a major metro area. Seriously it sucks.
Probably the same thing as when same-sex marriage started getting serious in the USA. A bunch of states passed reactionary legislation to try to ban it. But eventually it became legal and protected everywhere.

I'm sorry for anyone who is caught up in the back-and-forth as this is politicized. It's not fair to trans people just trying to live their lives in peace. In the meantime, for what it's worth, urban areas in blue states are generally be the safest places (if you have that choice).
""The¬†bill¬†would make it a felony punishable with up to 10 years in prison to provide medical care including hormone treatment, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery to minors.""

I'm guessing that means its just for youth, but still.

*sigh*
""land of the free""? yeah, only for cis white guys, like myself. but I couldn't care less about having freedom if everyone doesn't get it. I'm on your side with this, my trans friends.
How the fuck are the youth supposed to use puberty blockers if it‚Äôs illegal to give them puberty blockers? Do they really expect to be giving young adults puberty blockers??? This will kill kids ü•∫
It‚Äôs fine to marry a 16-year-old, though.
THE BILL ACTUALLY PASSED??
Land if the free my ass
As somebody who is trans nonbinary that has the misfortune of living in Alabama, it's because we're ruled by conservative old rich white people.

The people in control are scared of trans people having equal rights in America so of course they target those who can't fight back, the children. The people in charge are all sick.

Theocratic fascist police state.
 Sweet home Alabama.
Combination of Midterm elections and Trans rights being the hot wedge issue right now
You see, they have lost their IQ from the massive amount of inbreeding
The state is gerrymandered to hell and run by old white conservatives terrified of anything that doesn't fit their narrow worldview. The state intentionally makes voting difficult and has a long history of suppressing black voters. A large percentage of the population lives in poverty, and we've consistently been one of the lowest (if not the lowest) ranked states in education.  

There are good people here, but the state government is doing everything it can to keep them down. For example, a while back, the city of Birmingham decided to raise its local minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. In response, the state government passed legislation forbidding any city in Alabama from raising the minimum wage above the federal minimum of $7.25.

But there are good people here. And the victims of Alabama's government are primarily the people who live here- whether willingly or because they can't afford to leave. I beg everyone to please remember that.

Very topical username in Alabama rn
They are mainly referring to puberty blockers and HRT being prescribed to minors. This might seem like not a big issue to those who aren‚Äôt trans but dysphoria will very commonly make people suicidal. And now that it‚Äôs literally illegal to access treatment, we can expect to see an increase in suicide attempts from trans youth in alabama
If we were allowed to be ourselves and got the support and medical treatment we need without being jailed and discriminated against, maybe the suicide rates would drop. Try thinking before you post incredibly misinformed stuff like this.

I mean, it should also technically outlaw puberty blockers for cis kids too, preventing treatment for kids who do have puberty issues, but we all know its not gonna be interpreted like that
It's Alabama. 

I'm suprised it's even legal to be trans there.
puberty blockers are usually prescribed to cis kids for non-trans related reasons, so idk how this is gonna affect that. also idk about the hormone treatment for periods thing, but i would guess it's not the same hormones

yes but it's not testosterone, which is what would be prescribed to trans men/afab enbies who want it. totally different hormones, so i doubt the bill would restrict them
Something they regretted and deleted :)
Many birth controls are estrogen based tho.
They're trying to ban specific types of treatment, not literally hormones themselves. AFAB teens will still be able to get estrogen, and AMAB teens will still be able to get testosterone. If this is not the case, there would be bigger problems with that than birth control being inaccessible, as many teens with hormonal disorders need artificial hormones. My AFAB sibling has to be on estrogen HRT bc of Turner Syndrome, which is physically medically necessary, as without it they wouldn't have gone through puberty at all, and if they were taken off it their body would go into a state of menopause."	tz7zp8	trans	526	0.98	2022-04-08 16:55:15

My state is about to ban gender affermingcare for minors and I need to know where I can go	I (16 y/o) am almost 8 monthes on T and my state is incredibly likely to a ban on gender afferming care. I live around the midwest, but I'm not sure what states are safe for me to get my T from and which arent or even which are also at risk of banning healthcare. If you know of any states in or around the midwest that can help me that would be wonderful!!	"Michigan is pretty safe! They're working on passing through protections. Illinois is a little bit better in terms of legislative safety!
We're in Iowa and face the same possible ban. Our doctor is referring us to the children's hospital in Minneapolis.

From what I've seen Minnesota is becoming a safe haven for the trans community and there are quite a few organizations that can help and your doctor may also be able to put you in contact with one of these groups.

I wish you good luck. My family and I are after making plans for if/when we'll need to flee to a trans friendly state. We're very fortunate that we have family up there so the move will be slightly easier.
This is a map Erin has worked on tracking legislation that indicates how safe each state is for Trans people. She updates it pretty regularly I believe.

This is a great resource. It‚Äôll ask you to enter an email but there is a button on the bottom to skip that. This is made by a trans woman who is a very good researcher, and she creates (and updates) a map every month of each state and how safe it is to live there as a trans person. She also lists below it reasons why the states are classified as they are and how risky she sees states becoming in the next few years. I am also considering moving to a state with more protections for trans people and this is the main resource I am using.

As an Central Illinoisan, it saddens me (because it should be accessible for all) and delights me (because at least its accessible) to say that HRT for minors is more accessible here than most any other states I've heard about. A lot of my close friends were on HRT before 18 and a lot of times without their parents even knowing. No sharing, online ordering, or anything shady invloved either. Illinois seems like its going to be a ""safehaven"" for genderqueer folks at least from anecdotal experience.
Iirc the only state in the Midwest with protections is Illinois
I live in Minnesota for now .... fairly safe in the cities but out of them I'm not sure
Pennsylvania is great for trans care
Western Washington/Western Oregon would be my picks
Minnesota is your best option right now, completely under dfl control and passing bills that protects us. For instance provides legal protection if you seek gender affirming care in Minnesota iirc. But definitely look into it.
Minnesota or canada
Chicago!! Very diverse area, I‚Äôve had many friends from Ohio transition after moving here, and I feel I‚Äôm not in any immediate danger of losing my affirming health-care.

good luck soldier, i know it‚Äôs scary out there. wishing you the best <3
Mass Health insurance in Massachusetts literally covers almost all surgeries for transgender patients.
Washington and California are safe spaces iirc.
Minnesota is a trans sanctuary state. Michigan is very close as is Illinois. I live in the Grand Rapids, MI area. I'm very out. There are ""White necks"" (same as a redneck, they just know what snow is) that can be somewhat of an issue. About a month ago our Governor signed into law a trans extension to our anti discrimination law so you can legally not have to put up with shit.  Medicaid will cover HRT, mental care, and one surgery for gender transition. Medicaid leads the path for insurance companies here, so they will soon have to follow suit.
Illinois has protections and won‚Äôt be banning that stuff anytime soon
Minnesota is safe.
Washington is a safe place for trans people to go to. I actually moved from Idaho to Washington because of what Idaho has planned, so Idaho isn't a safe state
For those that aren‚Äôt aware.
Lgbtmap.org/equality-maps

This site will tell you how safe each state is based on legislation. That said, Illinois and Michigan are probably the best places to be in the Midwest. If you are in Indiana be prepared for things to get worse, Republicans have a super majority control, and they are passing a number of unsupportive bills.
illinois (anywhere south of bloomington is pretty bigoted tho) or michigan (the upper peninsula is very bigoted)
Depending on what you're defining as Midwest, Colorado could be a good option! I've heard that Colorado Springs in particular isn't great, but the state level protections are good.
So far IL is legal, i live here, but not the best place to live unless your north
NJ just gained trans refugee status, not sure if thats too far for you tho
Transgender nurse here!

I recommend looking at erininthemorning on Instagram as she does a really fantastic job at updating which states are the most safe. There are also LGBTQ centers that look at equality. So far, the states that I'm finding are the best are Washington State, New York State, Massachusetts, Vermont. With much emphasis on Washington State. California and Oregon are also pretty good, but neither of them are closest in proximity to the Canadian border. In October, I'm going to be moving to one of those states so that I can make my Express getaway if needed to
I‚Äôm in the Midwest and know what your going through, I‚Äôm moving to Seattle soon th
You need to get to Minnesota or Michigan OP

Those are the current safe states for trans people in the midwest
Iv heard Minnesota isnt gonna ban anything trans related
I know this is farther than you might be able to go, but if it's an option for you, queer people from the United States are able to seek asylum in Canada
COME TO CANADA!
Idk how far u are away from the border, but if I were u, I'd just go to Canada. I might be a bit biased since I'm Canadian, but it's the safest option if you can afford the move and shit like that. If ur looking for somewhere inside the U.S., then I can't help. But I wish u the best of luck :)
What about just waiting until your 18
Good
I‚Äôm in Illinois, we‚Äôre safe here as far as I know.
From what I know Minnesota is becoming one of the safest states in the US but I dont know about anywhere else
Minnesota is making it so that they a gender affirming care refugee states. Illinois is also a pretty safe state.
Minnesota has codiefied protections and will provide gender affirmative care to out of state patients
Minnesota is the safest, as it just passed a sanctuary state law guaranteeing you can't be extradited for seeking gender affirming care. Illinois and Michigan are close contenders.
Presumably your parents will give consent? If so you could probably go to Planned Parenthood in Minnesota or Colorado? 

I'm really sorry that your state's government are heartless bigots sounds like Iowa.  Hopefully this won't last very long it looks like a lot of people are really starting to take notice of just how wrong this is!
NY state is a good place to live. I‚Äôve been here my whole life. I‚Äôd steer clear of the city and head towards the north country
Michigan is the best in this political climate
Massachusetts is pretty safe and so far unlikely to ban it. It also has the informed consent option to get it so you don‚Äôt have to jump through bureaucratic hoops
Maryland requires all insurance providers to cover trans healthcare. It‚Äôs a great state for a young man. Lots of opportunity.  Join us.
Minnesota seems to be the safest state for trans people in the midwest rn. I'm also in the midwest and looking at moving towards one of the coasts soon. Stay safe. üíñ
Minnesota has just been made a trans refugee state and everyone is very nice.
If you can get to Wisconsin, specifically the large cites you should be able to get care.
https://www.rainbowrefugee.com/refugee-claim-from-outside-canada
Maybe you can come to Canada, it‚Äôs much much safer here!
Illinois isn't too bad
Minnesota or California!
Ya was gonna say Michigan is headed in a great direction right now with our Governor passing LGBTQ+ laws fast as of recently
Oregon is like 50% lgbtq people and the kids here are learning about how gender affirmative care is somthing that should be protected. it's a blue state too
I live just outside Madison, WI and am able to get all my hormone drugs here. I‚Äôve been getting great care for my transition for the last 7 months. Hope you can get the help you need!
Minnesota and Colorado have a lot of legal protections for trans people. Minnesota just passed a bill that prevents people from other states from suing or legally targeting trans healthcare providers and their patients. I feel pretty safe here in Washington, but those would be my go to states if I lived somewhere less savory
Minnesotan here. Twin cities st paul and Minneapolis are amongst the best spaces.
It happens to my state to it just happens  two weeks  ago
I‚Äôm in sucky Indiana, it‚Äôs also RED.
Michigan is passing a lot of protections and our state tax is only 6%. More populated areas are going to be better, but you'll want to stick to the middle/south of the state unless you love driving 5+ hrs to access anything :/ I recommend staying out of the thumb as well. Midland and bay city are good areas that are more affordable than Ann arbor or grand rapids
Do your parent‚Äôs support you? Ask them to move to california
I‚Äôm from the Deep South. Not fun
Rhode Island is a great place.  New England in general is good.  Massachusetts is also a great choice.
minnesota is really safe
New jersey seems to be a safe haven
this could be a bit far but Pennsylvania is really great! it‚Äôs one of the few places that has never had any transgender restricting laws I believe and our current governor is very supportive! My girlfriend might be starting E in the summer (theyre 14).

just reread it and I realized that it says in or around the Midwest :(((( 
(I‚Äôm going to keep this up incase it could help someone else)
Northern Virginia is pretty friendly we have a republican governor but we‚Äôre a blue state in all other positions. There‚Äôs a bunch of trans advocacy here.
QueerMed is an online practice. Take a look at their policy with sending to various states dependent on what is legal. It may likely be helpful to you.
Texas isn't a good option but we are fighting
I would recommend Minnesota especially with how many protections are being announced in the news, Illinois and Michigan
I would say Minnesota but I hate the shit that happens in Minneapolis so not Minneapolis if you do move anywhere in the mn
I'm in a similar situation, I'm from Texas. Does anyone know where or what I can do to continue treatment?
Try Plume. It‚Äôs a little costly, but it‚Äôs virtual and the prescribe you your meds over a video call
I'm in Arkansas my pharmacist is also tran and she is fighting for our heath care here
Illinois is safe at the moment
In the same state, Colorado is the nearest totally safe state
Minnesota! Especially Minneapolis
Minnesota and New Jersey have both passed trans safe haven laws. They won't make any moves against gender affirming care nor will they allow out of state warrants against you for being trans to be pursued inside their state lines.
The Minnesota house passed a trans refuge bill.

Source: https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/24/you-belong-here-minnesota-house-passes-trans-health-refuge-bill
Maryland according to recent protections that were passed
This might just be exclusive to people in Kansas and Missouri, but the University of Kansas Health System (KU med basically) has a gender diversity clinic. It‚Äôs an informed consent clinic and they offer tele-health. You might have to be 18 but if you‚Äôre on T already, that means you probably already had to have your parents sign off on it. They might accept that. (I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know more about how they treat minors at this clinic. I‚Äôm 22) 

It‚Äôs worth a shot to give them a call and at least see if they‚Äôll accept you as a patient. They‚Äôre a really wonderful clinic and I got my testosterone prescription on the first appointment. 

Here is their number: (913)588-1227 

Here is the number to request a consultation: (913)588-6200

And here‚Äôs the link to the website where you can request an appointment: https://www.kansashealthsystem.com/care/specialties/gender-affirming-medicine 
(It also has both of those numbers) 

If that number doesn‚Äôt send you directly to the gender clinic, the automated voicemail should guide you to the correct department. You‚Äôre looking for the Gender Diversity and Gynecology department. 

Good luck kid :)
Illinois. If you can make your way to Chicago, make an appointment with Howard Brown Health - they have informed consent. Though, with the changes happening right now, I‚Äôm sure any planned parenthood in the state would get your prescriptions filled. Central and southern Illinois, culturally, will be less accepting. But our rights are written into the Illinois State Constitution. You‚Äôre covered anywhere in Illinois.

Good luck to you. I turn 35 this month, I started my transition 5 years ago. In my experience, there‚Äôs not a trans person alive, I think, that wouldn‚Äôt give anything to wake up on their twelfth birthday and have the opportunity to transition from puberty - you have that opportunity and so many of us are going to fight like fucking hell so you can realize it. What our governments are doing is so‚Ä¶ well I was going to say unAmerican, but it‚Äôs just as American as it is unAmerican. 

Anyway, what I‚Äôm trying to say is, good luck to you. You‚Äôve got millions of people in your corner.
Illinois is safe,  well northern IL. The Chicagoland area which includes the 5 collar counties and the suburbs within them.
I heard that Michigan is a great state to go if you are trans and needing the care you need. I‚Äôm not from there, but I am thinking about going there if my state is next
Southern New England. Rhode Island. Massachusetts
Try Minnesota or California. The governor of Minnesota just declared it a trans refugee state.
New jersey just passed protections!

https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/first-period-anti-trans-legislative
I‚Äôm definitely moving to Minnesota or atleast Illinois, Indiana‚Äôs governor just recently passed the law banning gender affirming care for people 18 and under.
Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota.
I‚Äôm actually not sure, but are you able to do something like Folx, ordering it online? https://www.folxhealth.com/
Canada... Yukon Territories, in particular. Gender affirming care is part of their health care system.
Rule of thumb. North and West is the best for trans people. So for someone in the Mid of US, Michigian is a good choice. I'm even planning to go there for grad school cause they have some protections for me. Only issue is they have Gay/trans panic bill. Well most states have it, its just an outdated bill.
Healthcare work in Illinois I have worked with a few trans gender teens. It‚Äôs not illegal unless your doctor knowingly gives something that with you medical conditions the risk would very much out weight the benefits. You like with all medical care. So if it‚Äôs convenient for you come on down.
Anybody lives South Carolina
Illinois, we are a blue state and although our governer is not the greatest he is very pro-trans rights
from what I can tell Colorado is pretty safe, though it's also kinda surrounded by not great ones
as others have said michigan, currently live here, trying to get out but not for these reasons, just family, but michigan is starting to look real promising for this, gov whitmer (whether you like her or not) seems to be on our side for the most part
Michigan us trans people need to get out of Tennessee!
The governor of NJ recently passed an executive order to protect trans people and allow them to get gender affirming care. They also won't extradite you if your state tries to prosecute you across state lines.
RI is amazing
There are safe and reliable ways to get T without going through a doctor. They are actually perfectly legal and might even be cheaper. You know what you are doing with dosing and injections, maybe you don't need the gatekeeping.

This also may not be a popular approach but it worked for me. When I was your age this community did not exist and I didn't know what to do other than simply dress, act and speak in ways that got me treated more like a man than a woman. I work in IT and played women's rugby. It works. In the past the men around me expected me to break up fights in the street. Focus on being yourself whatever that means in the moment, whether or not you have testosterone.
As a Michigander I can confirm. There's only two downsides; it is a swing state and some of the people can be rednecky.
The state of Michigan has given me everything I need to thrive in being a trans person. The people of Michigan are a different story
As a Michigander, can I unconfirm. Anywhere south of Lansing is going to be awful for queer people
God if my transphobic father didn‚Äôt live there I would consider it. California is great but it‚Äôs too expensive here. Been looking a Minnesota but I don‚Äôt know how stable democrats control on that state will be.
colorado is also a great blue alternative:)
My family is in Iowa, and this is what I‚Äôm hearing, too.

I know it‚Äôs scary right now. Yet there are places urgently working to get kids the care they need across state lines.

And when you need mental health support, remember that the Trevor Project is there for you. https://www.thetrevorproject.org
Minnesota Governor Walz signed an executive order affirming protections for trans kids and parents a few weeks ago. 

https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/08/walz-moves-to-protect-those-seeking-genderaffirming-care

A bill to do the same has been passed in the house and is in the senate, the governor has already said he will sign it when it reaches his desk. With a Democratic majority in the senate, I expect this to pass. 

https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/24/you-belong-here-minnesota-house-passes-trans-health-refuge-bill
Also in Iowa and scared. I lived in Minneapolis for 15 years before moving back to Iowa during the pandemic. I‚Äôm contemplating moving back.
The twin cities is pretty amazing.
Came here to say this. Updated map direct link is https://erininthemorn.substack.com/
Minnesota is really good for trans rights, too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Minnesota too. Michigan making strides in the right direction too.
New Mexico if you like the climate. üêù
The Minnesota legislature is working on a transgender refuge bill: https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/24/you-belong-here-minnesota-house-passes-trans-health-refuge-bill

It's passed in the house and is currently in the senate. The governor has already enacted an executive order doing exactly what this bill set out to achieve and has said he will sign it when it reaches his desk.
Ya outside of the cities and Duluth it becomes like anywhere else in the Midwest but I've lived here for my whole life and really you never have to go out there
the cities are very safe and haven‚Äôt had much of an issue in more rural areas either tbh
And thankfully with Shapiro winning we're safe for a while now! I was terrified at the thought of Mastriano winning...
We have heard that both Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon are very conservative. Thoughts? We've heard good things about Eugene and Salem.
I live in spokane wa with my trans boyfriend and no problems so far. State insurance covers all his stuff including top surgery.
Yeah, Howard Brown clinics helped me a lot over the years, and you never pay more than 65 bucks for meds.
Seattle is basically the most trans friendly city in the world right now and the surrounding cities on the west side are all good. Even the East side isn‚Äôt bad, really.
Hope you‚Äôre doing well and settled in
Is this true? I've heard that LGBTQ+ people from the USA are always rejected because each country considers the other ""safe"" for minorities.
The refugee bill hasn‚Äôt passed yet though
The West Coast will succeed before outlawing gender affirmative care
Im about to move to south Illinois, anything I should know?
Whole West Coast
From what I understand we're really the only one that offers legal protection in the Midwest. 

Southern Illinois is basically a different state and bright red. Still legally protected but the people are asshats
I'm there as well, everywhere has their more red areas. Detroit/Metro Detroit are sort of safe and the Grand Rapids area is safe as far as I can tell too.
It's America, no matter where you go it's a little rednecky, it just comes with the states.
Red neck-good

MAGA ‚Äúred necks‚Äù- not good
Well, that's just the Midwest in a nutshell.
What about Ann Arbor?
Not true. I've gotten my T by a doctor in Kalamazoo (local to me) and Grand Rapids is still South of Lansing, right? Unless I'm mistaken. Anyway, that's where my referral for top surgery is going
[deleted]
I just visited friends in Lansing. I really liked it there. Wish I could move there...
Nevada, if you can deal with dryness. Good middle ground and lead the US in trans rights and care.
Washington has a lot of cheaper areas and even the conservative east side doesn‚Äôt really bother trans people IRL.
Thank you for the resource ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks!
Michigan ain't passing a ban anytime soon.
jesse we need to cook estrogen
Seconding this, I spent most of last year in Albuquerque and Gallup, and aside from being dry af it was super chill there. The state is politically split between red/blue but I didn't encounter any real hostility or weirdness.
I'm going be moving there eventually but I have a really bad situation in the parents house they r making it difficult to leave
Basically anywhere between Olympia and Bellingham in Washington, though even our rednecks don‚Äôt usually say anything negative to trans people IRL.
Eastern Washington and eastern Oregon are the conservative spots‚Ä¶ definitely look for major population centers in blue counties and‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll be good.
Eastern WA is conservative but is fairly safe due to the fact that the Western half has the political majority and that doesn't seem to be changing for a while.
gonna be moving to Seattle for College in a couple years actually. Visited it last year, beautiful city and state.
[link to government of Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/canada-role/2slgbtqi-plus.html)

There's been a lot of public support especially for trans Americans to claim refugee status in Canada.
You're more likely now than a few years ago to get accepted as a refugee in Canada.
Idk much about bills or stuff like that (I'm only 13) but can't u just come to Canada like normally? I didn't think they needed to pass a bill to move here
True, I'm just saying MN is pretty good to, though to be honest I'm not really keeping up to date with where every state is
Our state taxes will have you pulling your hair out.
But other than not I can't think of much.

We have a lot of laws protecting lgbt people and laws helping minorities or low income families.  

We also have legal recreational marijuana.

Illinois is a chill liberal state.  You're more likely to trigger an SJW by eating at Chick Fill A, than a Neo Con Christian Extremist by being openly Trans.  Not to say we don't have a few bad eggs, but if your Grandma's got her concealed carry in her purse as she rides Public Transit a mugger is less likely to spring an attack on her.

Illinois we are more likely to sit in a Torando on our porch with a shotgun yelling at the storm than we are to care even a little about what you do in your personal life!
Kalamazoo seems good so far
Is Big Rapids safe? I‚Äôm moving there in a couple months
Oklahoma is nothing but rednecky lol and I hate it ü§£üò≠
Ann arbors pretty good!
Maybe it's just my area, I live down by the Ohio border and it's awful
I live in metro detroit, north east side in Macomb county and I have no problem right now, I just started but I have no problems getting into my drs or getting appts
I have a cousin in Seattle and as long as you‚Äôre not in Seattle proper it‚Äôs cheaper than LA so I definitely think about it from time to time.
Especially if more people move there from red states.
a heuva!
Aww, sorry to hear that...
I apologize you are correct. Freakin Austin allergies are scrambling my brain. Fixed it in Edit ...
If you‚Äôre a nerdy trans person it‚Äôs pretty perfect
Nope, it‚Äôs actually super hard to move to Canada if you‚Äôre not rich or in a high demand career and young. There is a lot of pressure to pass a refugee bill for trans people that includes the UK and US.
They‚Äôre doing awesome üëç
I work in Kalamazoo and I can say that I feel much safer there than grand rapids. But GR has it's safe areas that are amazing
I've only been there once so I can't really say. It's really pretty at least! Just be a little extra cautious until you feel it out and try to find some local queer groups to spend time with.
Born and raised there, I know all about it.
It is rough down there. The more populated areas are just fine. Up north is probably just as bad as down there so I don't think it's a north or south problem.
Yep, and there‚Äôs lots of small cities along the Puget Sound coast that are trans friendly too
I don't even have my license yet I'm 25 without  a license only got the temps
Oh sorry. Ty for telling me :)
Sameeee
Yeah, in fairness I was a bit blunt with my initial comment. There are nice areas across the state but I generalized cause I live in one of the shit areas, sorry.
Sounds pretty just don‚Äôt want to be there when the cascadia earthquake finally happens
Hopefully things will work out for you quickly. Sending you all the positive vibes I can! ü´Ç
No problem! Not something I would expect a middle schooler to be an expert on.
You don't need to say sorry about anything, things are scary and hard in lots of places.
Hopefully it won‚Äôt be too bad. Only old buildings that are fairly small are likely to be at risk.
Hope so if things work out I'll be with the gf soon
That's good! ‚ù§Ô∏è"	12ci6so	trans	476	0.97	2023-04-05 12:07:43
We have to be visible. We are not ashamed of who we are.	"For transgender day of visibility we want to recognize how far our community has come as a whole. We live in a society where our rights are attacked for not being understood. Where our family and friends reject us for who we are. Where we must do what we can to fit in, in a society that would exile and attack us for being who we are.

We want to remind everyone that we are stronger and more plentiful when unified than those who would oppress us and tear us down. Our rights **are** human rights, lest we forget that access to healthcare, the right to self identity, and the right to exist as you are, are rights that everyone should have access to. We are  just as diverse, just as fallible, just as **human**, as any other group of people that exist.

There are those who would fearmonger, who would tell us to hide who we are from fascism, they are the same people who would tear us down in the first place. We must stand strong as a group, hold true to ourselves, and live our lives as who we are. Though we must keep in mind that there are those of us that are in places where they can‚Äôt be themselves, where their life would be in danger just to express who they are, we must be strong for them.

There has been a rapid rise in hate recently, as people spew nonsensical rhetoric to tear down trans people. That can be scary to see, especially if you live in places that are actively passing laws to attack our lives. We must make our voices heard, our unrest, our fear, our anger, we cannot go down silently.

To those of you who come to our subreddit seeking refuge, seeking a place to be yourself, you have found it. To those of you who are here to bring others down, to gatekeep, to tell others how they should feel, we ask that you leave now as you do not belong here.

# From our team members

## bleeding-paryl

Personally, as someone who has been in this community for a bit over 10 years now, I think I can honestly say that this is both the scariest time to live in parts of the world for trans folk, but also the best time in recent memory to actively be yourself. I‚Äôve seen so much positivity in this community, and I‚Äôm always inspired by the things I see here. We will celebrate who we are, we will live as who we are, and despite things like the recent shooting, we will continue to love ourselves.

I‚Äôve noticed a rather recent and rapid uptick in people coming here who are not trans. For those that come as allies, and are here to support us, thank you. For those who are here expecting us to apologize for a murderer, or who think we‚Äôre not upset ‚Äúenough‚Äù at the murder of children, I would like you to first look inward, and ask yourself why you‚Äôre more upset at us than you are about the people murdered. We are grieving, we are hurt, we are afraid. We can feel multiple things at the same time, and we can acknowledge when things will shine an incorrect light on a community of people just as diverse as the cisgender community.

For those of you who see that kind of hate making its way through, first of all I would like to apologize, as I know we‚Äôre imperfect. I would also like to personally thank you for remaining vigilant and reporting it as you see it. Keep in mind, we‚Äôre _very_ busy, we have regular lives on top of the stuff we do for this community, and we may not see something right away, so I am always appreciative of those who can help.

## TallGeminiGirl

Firstly I would like to thank all of you for your help in reporting bad actors and doing your part to keep r/trans a safe space for all things transgender. We really can not do it with out you all. We, as a mod team, are just a small part of the incredibly diverse and wonderful trans community we represent. You, the users, are the real body, soul, and voice of our community. Thank you for being the wonderful people you are. 

I want to take a moment and share some personal thoughts on recent events. We can not let this stop us. We can not let this push us down and go back into hiding. Those of us who can do so safely need to continue making our voices heard and push back against this wave of hate. This is not a call for violence and I will never, ever advocate for such or defend such actions. Today is our chance to reclaim the current narrative around us. Be visible, be kind, and show the world who we really are and what we stand for. The small actions of a million individuals can easily over power the heinous actions of a single, evil, individual.

And don't be afraid to ask for support and comforting. Talk to your trans friends. Be real with your cis allies. It's high time they really get to know what we are going through and what we are up against. Don't feel like you have to answer for the entire community either. Your own personal needs and mental health is just as if not more important than the needs of our community. 

Stay strong everyone. The seas ahead will be harsh and choppy, but together we can brave the storm and come out stronger on the other side.

## The_Decoy

I am very thankful to have found so much support in these spaces. As someone who came to understand this side of myself much later in life, I find so much inspiration seeing how the community comes together to reinforce each other. These are obviously difficult times with our community being set upon by some incredibly vitriolic bad actors. But we are working our hardest to keep this space clear so the community can continue supporting one another. I am proud to work alongside such a wonderful and dedicated mod team. I am delighted to see how the community places such an emphasis on being respectful and inclusive to each other. Ultimately though we are pursuing our ability to live our best lives. This struggle will not be easy but will be incredibly satisfying once we have attained such an environment. I look forward to pushing for progress alongside such incredible people.

If you live in a state with a ban on GAC, you can still get HRT through QueerMed, even as a minor.	"[QueerMed](https://queermed.com/) has been my provider for HRT for the past few months, and they're absolutely amazing. They take **most insurances** (as opposed to services like Folx or Plume), they do telehealth appointments with **no in-person visits required**, and their providers are on the cutting edge of trans healthcare, where most other providers (including Planned Parenthood) still use outdated target hormone ranges that keep patients at levels that are usually too low for transition.

They nominally only serve patients across the southeast US, but if you're outside of that area, keep reading.

I'll let them speak for themselves. They recently sent out a message to all patients (emphasis added):

>Dear Queermed patients and families:  
>  
>We are outraged and deeply saddened by the number of laws banning care for minors across the country.¬† We are monitoring the situation very closely, but please know:

>**WE WILL NOT STOP PROVIDING CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS.**¬†¬†  
>

Again, all you need to do is **give your verbal assent** during your appointment that you're in a legal state. If you were to hypothetically lie about which state you're actually in, they have no way of verifying otherwise, and will be happy to give you your healthcare under the assumption you're in a legal state. Like most providers, they help you schedule lab work and such.

Do this at your own risk of course, but my understanding is that most laws targeting GAC focus on providers, not the patients, and if you have no other options to get HRT in your state, this might be a solution.

Even if your pharmacy is in a state with a GAC ban, they should still be able to fill your prescription from QueerMed (my pharmacy is in Texas, for example). If not, a mail pharmacy is also an option.

If you're in a state with a GAC ban but can't get out, check out QueerMed's website and see if they're right for you. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask.

EDIT: Since this has been asked before, their self-pay pricing, with no insurance, is listed here:  [Self-Pay Pricing ‚Äì Queer Med](https://queermed.com/self-pay-pricing/). They also have an $80/month membership, similar to other services, that appears to include regular appointments, labs, prescriptions, the whole nine yards."	"This post should be pinned üìç
Hi.  I have noticed that insurance companies are delighted when a state bans certain care.  It means THEY don't have to pay... If the state bans GAC, such as HRT, then the companies don't have to pay(more money in their pockets) YET they charge the same rates. If YOU did that, the Government would call that double dipping and prosecute you.  BUT a company (aka insurance company) well that's ok they're just following the laws.

Hugs,

What are the outdated target hormone ranges?
Sweet, another provider to look more into for when it's possible for me to start hrt. ü•∞
When I got that message from them, I interpreted it as as long as you tell us you're in a state without a ban, we can provide care. <wink,wink,nudge,nudge>
I might have to start using this. My current ""care"" leaves much to be desired. Thank you for pointing them out.
!remindme 2 months
I use QMed! Dr.Leo has always been super kind!
Thank you so much. It feels amazing to have a resource to recommend to people going through this.
That‚Äôs amazing to hear! Anyone have experience with them or know how feasible it would be to do this without the knowledge of family? Currently don‚Äôt have the funds to live on my own and was going to wait on HRT for once I moved out but if I can start it sooner I‚Äôd love to.
I love this we c ant be stopped
I was hoping this would happen.

You know what conservatives are doing with their witch hunt? They're cutting starfish in half.

I'd lol seriously if being trans took off as being more popular than regular cuz trying to regulating it made it explode in popularity.
absolutely. living in Florida and I have no doubts that the moment the ban on private insurance covering GAC passes, my insurance will be more than happy to drop coverage. only saving grace is that Amazon Pharmacy's Prime discount and GoodRx still exists, but it's gonna suck paying full price for lab work and such.
Their self-pay pricing is listed here: [https://queermed.com/self-pay-pricing/](https://queermed.com/self-pay-pricing/)

I'll paste the info here, for convenience:

FIRST VISIT: $299FOLLOW-UP VISITS: $149 ‚Äì $199

Expect 3-4 visits in the first year1-2 visits per year after that (after the first year, the total yearly cost for Self-Pay visits AND labs will be approximately $250-$500)

LABS: $99 for QMed pricing- Insurance may cover- Expect labs at every visit

This lines up with how much I've had to pay. They also have an $80/mo membership that includes all of the above, which might work out cheaper: [https://queermed.com/pricing/](https://queermed.com/pricing/)
Essentially, the target a lot of doctors use of <100 or even <200 pg/ml is outdated, since E levels in cis women are routinely higher and too little E is incapable of suppressing T on its own (monotherapy.) Subjective healthcare experience incoming:

My doctors at Planned Parenthood were trying to keep my E levels under 200 pg/ml. I had been on two patches twice weekly and my levels were around 330 pg/ml, which was suppressing my T without needing any blockers. They thought it was too high (despite their own ranges for cis E levels listing the mid-cycle range as anywhere from 64-357) and cut me down to one patch, which, you guessed it, stopped being high enough to suppress my T and I had to get back on blockers. 

I went back and forth with them over it for a while before going to QueerMed, where Dr. Chris Turner told me that PP and most other providers still uses outdated standards that aim to keep levels lower in trans women than they would be in cis women, and that my levels at 330 pg/ml on two patches were not only normal for cis women, but if they worked to suppress my T then clearly they were good levels for me. They even pointed out that mid-cycle is when most women tend to feel best, and it only makes sense to let my levels fall into that same range. 

Not sure if that answers your question, but I hope that helps!
Yes, came here to ask this! And what are QueerMed's preferred values?
That's exactly the way I interpreted it as well. They're clearly committed to helping anyone who needs this sort of care, even if they usually live in a state with a ban, and I think that's extremely commendable.
Not knowing your situation, off the top of my head I‚Äôd suggest doing appointments in your car, a friend‚Äôs car, or a friend‚Äôs house. As far as receiving supplies, I‚Äôd recommend a PO Box (find out if your supplier can deliver to a PO Box) or having them sent to a trusted friend‚Äôs house.
Seems more whack-a-mole than starfish to me, personally.
It's comforting knowing that, despite how aggressively conservatives have been targeting us lately, at the end of the day they're still absolutely shit at governing and, no matter how many ways they try to limit this care, there will always be ways for people to get it and for trans people to exist and flourish as we always have.
Honey, I live in RED State Texas.  East Texas.  Here we have the problem of only certain areas and certain drs. handles GAC.  You have to travel about 100 miles West or South as the closest doctors that provide ANY of the surgeries.  There is only 1 doctor in the East Texas area that handles trans patients. ALL BECAUSE OF THE RIDGID CONCSERVATIVES HERE. I have Humana, and they sent a letter stating if Texas bans gender care for minors, they will not pay for care even for adults.  YET their monthly rate will not go down, in fact it's going to go up.  OH! They Have To Comply With State Regs.  The less they have to cover the more goes in their pockets. WE THE PUBLIC HOWEVER WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR LESS. WELL THAT SEEMS FAIR!!!(YEAH RIGHT!!!!!)

I'm 74, M2F, on HRT 6 months, I live and dress openly as a woman 24/7, and been out about a year.

thank you so much for helping! im am currently unable to work and even this amount of money is impossible for me. but it make me happy that people can access hrt. i just hope that one day i can work again or get to a state that will not deny me any economic help. i fear that in my current situation i might fall pray to myself before i can find help.
This is really helpful, thank you so much! Do you have any studies or medical evidence that shows this I could use to present to my doctor to advocate for an increased dose?
Had to do some research, but sure thing! Most trans healthcare providers use the targets set out in [this 2017 study by an Endocrine Society-appointed task force](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558) that states providers should ""maintain \[serum hormone levels\] at the level for premenopausal females (100 to 200 pg/mL \[for estradiol\] and <50 ng/dL \[for testosterone\], respectively.)"" Most other studies that cite the 100-200 range source back to this document. The emphasis in many of these studies is avoiding supraphysiological hormone levels.

**However,** [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002937871909276) from 2016 shows that the normal range of estradiol in a cis woman's body can be anywhere from 20 to **300** pg/ml, so really, if we're aiming for doses that aren't supraphysiological, any number at or below 300 should be fine (and has better chances of suppressing your T.) The above study is behind a paywall, but the 20-300 pg/ml E2 range it states is cited in [another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028219301219#bib26) from 2019 that's free to read

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor, just a random trans woman with access to Google scholar, so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt as always, but my subjective experience has absolutely been that my T was suppressed without needing blockers at 330 pg/ml, and I generally felt great. There were also noticeable negative symptoms when my dose was lowered by Planned Parenthood.

I got outed. I feel so lost in a brand new way.	"I‚Äôm almost 3 years HRT. I pass, I own a house and I‚Äôm getting married. After years of waiting, life saving bottom surgery was only 6 months away. 6 months. 

I changed all my documents, finished college. Got my RN. I‚Äôve got a year of experience on an ICU and was getting to be a great nurse. 

Last night I found out Florida is working on removing trans healthcare for adults. I‚Äôm nearly certain that my coverage, medical leave and scheduled date for bottom surgery are now over. 

I can‚Äôt lose that hope again. I don‚Äôt know how to live feeling this way for any longer then was planned. I‚Äôve gained and lost hope over SRS happening too many times. 

Two hours after learning this I found out that one of my coworkers found old pictures of me and passed them around. I was stealth at work, living in Florida and all. And now everyone knows. My privacy, my safety, was stolen from me.  

I‚Äôm in so much pain. Not a single coworker asked them to stop. No one voluntarily told me.  No one. no one

I have so much going for me and I feel like I still failed. I still can‚Äôt get the healthcare I need, I still can‚Äôt be seen for who I am. I still didn‚Äôt do enough to make it 

I deleted my main Reddit account. My photos on there is probably what they found. I‚Äôm 25. I pass. I have a partner who loves me and I feel like tonight I lost too much. I was too late. 

I‚Äôm committed to living. Don‚Äôt send the help line info stuff. I just don‚Äôt know who else to tell."	"Is there no sexual harassment in FL?  You can't sue them and the company?  I'd ask a lawyer.

Oh, I swear! If I ever got a hold on the fool that made one of my girls cry, that ICU would be pretty fucking busy! I am too sick right now to be this angry!
So sorry for you. That's horrible and disgusting your coworkers did that.

As for Florida I don't really know what to say about that except it sounds like a hellhole for trans folks. There are better places, but it sounds like you have built a real life there.
Can you at least talk to HR? Why was someone passing around a photo of you and outing, essentially, private medical history without your consent? How could it be anything other than harassment? Seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

I am sorry this happened to you.
Holy shit. I dont even know what to say. I'm so sorry. 

For me, I transitioned but couldnt access HRT for 8 years. So I came out knowing people would know. I didn't pass well and didnt have any hope of stealth. It was hell, but in a way it felt like saying Fuck You, you dont get to hold this over me. Now that I pass tho, and I just want to live my life, Im not stealth but if anything like this happened to me I cant even put into words how id feel. Especially the photos. Its just a violation on every level, the ultimate disrespect, traumatic as fuck, and these are medical staff???!?!?!?! God theyre sick. 

It sounds like they saw a successful person and wanted to tear him down. Yes, obviously its transphobia but I think there was jealousy and vindictiveness here too. If youre happy and successful, you will have haters who want what you have.

And its just straight up workplace harassment. I hope youre able to talk to someone about holding these people accountable 

Sending you all the love ‚ù§Ô∏è Seriously, what the fuck. Im so sorry
Contact HR like yesterday. This is some sort of illegal. Harassment most likely. If HR does nothing, find another job and leave when and ONLY WHEN you get it lined up. Then threaten with a lawyer, you don‚Äôt even have to go through with suing or anything. Threats are usually enough when money is on the line.
Hugs to you. I am so sorry you experienced this betrayal of trust, you deserve better than that. Can you quietly and quickly find another job elsewhere? Do not tell others where you are going. I‚Äôm a cis male happily married to a trans woman for over ten years.
My cousin lives in Florida, FTM he and his wife are moving to Colorado.

I wish people could just mind their own buissness.
I go to work to do my job so i can provide a life for myself, my Gender and sexuality is fking irrelevent on the job. I dont get people, so many adult children in this world.
This is just a new step to our genocide. Stay strong
Srs has been a thing I was looking forward to that was taken away far too many times now. You don't deserve this crap.... I am so sorry Florida is like this.
It sounds like you might have to move from Florida sell your house and everything I would also inquire about an attorney about sexual harassment it does apply.
I‚Äôm so sorry; I cannot begin to imagine what you‚Äôre going through. I‚Äôm also a trans RN, about 6 months into working ICU in New Mexico. I‚Äôve worked with several travelers from Florida, and nursing there sounds like a shit show, but this is something else. You shouldn‚Äôt have to being dealing with any of this.
It's not trivial to up and move, but Florida is doomed. Please try to get to a blue state, you'll be welcomed with open arms and the laws here are written to protect not harm.
It's not the best option but you could always relocate. That's something you'd have to discuss with your partner. If you came to Canada, which would be pretty easy as a nurse since we are constantly understaffed in the medical field, you could get permanent residency and your SRS would be completely covered by Canada's health care system.
A big undertaking but an option that could offer hope maybe.
Hey, I‚Äôm in Florida as well, and I‚Äôm not a lawyer or anything but I don‚Äôt believe the bill will pass. If it does it faces a lot of legal challenges in my opinion. If I understand the bill it‚Äôs going to hold the employer liable for gender affirming care after it has been provided. In a sense it‚Äôs like holding the company or entity liable for a knee surgery covered by their insurance years after it was performed. I don‚Äôt know how well that will hold up. I‚Äôm not sure if there are some insurance options provided by employers that give individuals access to procedures like BA for non-medical reasons but let‚Äôs say there is. It‚Äôs pretty ridiculous to turn around and hold the employer providing the health insurance liable for reversing the procedure if the individual doesn‚Äôt like it.

At this point though as I plan on getting SRS I‚Äôm probably leaving the state. Legislation is going down hill and I‚Äôm a state employee so my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover any trans healthcare unfortunately. I understand how you feel, I was thinking about leaving the state government for a private employer because of this.
Hey Alison ik it‚Äôs hard but know if you ever need someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on lmk, dm me and I‚Äôll be there
Im so sorry.  All those years I just wanted to be a girl, a woman.  But I didn‚Äôt know it was possible back then, and really it wasn‚Äôt a thing back then.  When I found a way to make it happen, I had to accept I was a trans woman.  I couldn‚Äôt change that, so I didn‚Äôt transition.  I tried to push it away‚Ä¶ and when I accepted being a trans woman‚Ä¶ I knew I‚Äôd never be passable‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt give up my kids and start a new life, even if I was passable.   I envied the gals who could pass and start a new life, but the danger was very evident to me, and I didn‚Äôt want to live another lie‚Ä¶.  I‚Äôd have to be strong, suffer loss, such terrible loss.  

I‚Äôm so sorry what happened to you, you didn‚Äôt deserve what they did to you, people are cruel.  Especially right wing conservatives.   They are horrible people who will erase us.   

Your only option is to take that wonderful guy you have and move‚Ä¶. If you want to be stealth somewhere‚Ä¶ be stealth in a liberal state.  But be a vocal ally‚Ä¶.  Please‚Ä¶ when I was in hiding, not out.. the only thing I could have the strength for was to support gay marriage and I lost friends over that‚Ä¶. If trans subjects came up, I was quiet.. I didn‚Äôt want to out myself.   Be strong.  Move away from that horrible situation and be an ally‚Ä¶. Be vocal.  Be passable‚Ä¶ be the amazing person you are.
I'm so sorry this is happening to you and many other Americans.

I strongly believe America will have a civil war or something soon because they are just taking people rights and freedoms away.

Again so sorry can't imagine the pain your going through.

 Wish I could help more than suggest either move to another state or country. 

Hope you have a better day.

God dammit I‚Äôm so sorry. Florida has become such a hellscape. It‚Äôs amazing to think that just a short time ago it used to be a swing state. Is there any chances you can move to a state that actually supports trans people? Florida seems to be the testing ground for all things horrible these days
OMG I‚Äôm so sorry!  Please don‚Äôt do end your life.  It‚Äôs not all over.  You live in FL and own a house there but that‚Äôs not the only place that has nurses.  You can absolutely find work in another state.  Easily.  25 is so young.  Trust me, I started my transition 14 months ago at 41 and it‚Äôs been rough.  I own a house and am transitioning in place.  Everyone knows but I‚Äôm in a blue state.  

Start looking for work in states that will protect our rights.  You don‚Äôt have to give up.  It may be a set back BUT even if it takes an extra two years, you‚Äôve got so many decades left ahead of you to live.  I recognize it‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äújust move‚Äù from my ivory tower of a blue state but it‚Äôs absolutely possible (though obv hard to do).  You CAN find work outside of FL.  

PLEASE please please please do not give up.
It seems like the time and risk to employment spent fighting that would be better placed by trying to escape the state ASAP

I‚Äôm devastated and angry about the election results in Texas.	"I thought we had a chance. I thought Texas had finally had enough. I thought we were going to turn things around.

Instead, I get to make plans with my boyfriend to leave the city and friends and life that we love. I get to forget our plans to buy a house and make it our own. I get to live with the looming fear that any day I could wake up to the news that I no longer have the freedom to live as I am or take steps toward doing so. And I get to hate it all even more knowing that that‚Äôs exactly what they want.

They want us to live in fear. They want us to leave. They want us to give up on our home because we feel we have no other option. To them, we are an infestation that must be wiped out, by any means necessary.

Over the years, I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at not stressing over situations that I have no control over. But this one *hurts*. I don‚Äôt want to leave my home. As a teenager, I always believed that I‚Äôd gladly leave Texas at the first chance I got. But I made a life here. I found people and a city that I love. I‚Äôm happy. I don‚Äôt want to give that up.

And who knows. Maybe I won‚Äôt have to. But maybe isn‚Äôt good enough. I know there are so many people out there that are dealing with so much worse than this. I have it easy by comparison. But we all deserve to be happy. We all deserve to live our lives where and how we want without the threat of violence and persecution from people who don‚Äôt understand us. And our greatest hope for that shouldn‚Äôt lie in a flimsy ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù.

Things are hard right now. Our future is unclear. But, despite it all, I really do have hope. We may not be able to stay in Texas like we‚Äôd hoped. We may have to leave a lot behind. But we‚Äôll find a new home and build a new life. And we‚Äôll be okay.

To my fellow Texans and anyone else who is feeling angry and defeated tonight, you‚Äôre not alone. And wherever we end up, we have to keep fighting. We had some incredibly difficult losses tonight, but we also had some amazing wins! My city decriminalized marijuana! We should be proud.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I was feeling pretty low when I started writing this. None of this is easy. But getting it out helps a ton.üíõ

Edit: Just want to be clear, we‚Äôll only leave if we have to. If trans healthcare becomes illegal, and that is a big if, we will most likely leave. That‚Äôs what I meant when I said we would have to make a plan. We wouldn‚Äôt leave everything behind unless we felt like we absolutely had to for our mental and emotional well-being. We are fortunate enough to be able to make that decision if it comes down to it. Until then, we will absolutely continue fighting here. When I posted this, I was terrified at the uncertainty of our future and pissed off that I even have to think about that because of people that shouldn‚Äôt have any say in it. I still am. But like I said, I just needed to get it out. Now, I can think more clearly and look to the future with hope, for us and for Texas as a whole."	"Hey there! Texas is a DEEPLY red and gerrymandered state. I didn‚Äôt think Beto would win but I still pushed all of my friends to register and vote. Turning Texas blue will take continued, focused effort.

Hey your feelings are valid. I may not understand exactly your situation, but i empathize and am deeply and truly sorry. If you are comfortable, I would like to pray for you <3 if not, that‚Äôs okay :)
I have contradictory thoughts on this. 

One is go and be safe and be somewhere you feel loved and appreciated and where your mental health is not jeopardized by bigotry in the same way it might be here.

The other is be hopeful or organize if you do stay. A friend of mine and I did a video last election cycle about the power of the younger generations to end all this. And it is real and exists because there are more of us,  but it takes more than just Tik-Tok advocacy. It takes turning all that frustration and anger and fear into lobbying and fundraising and getting out the vote and making people see that differences are not something to bear or punish, but something to glorify and something that gives the country it's power and possibilities. I'm not saying don't use social media, it's powerful af, but voting needs to become like second nature to everyone under 50 if we are going to get anywhere in this country. If I were you and stayed, I'd see if I could start a non-profit and go into schools and push for voting. I'd meet politicians. I'd collect stories, I'd go into churches and just advocate advocate advocate. I'd maybe look at running for office of some kind and encouraging others to do so.

Or I'd get out of Dodge. And you don't deserve judgement either way.
Lmao all the removed comments
Texas will turn blue within the next 15 years. Beto lost the election when he said he was going to take people's guns. As much as I agree with him, that was something very stupid to say in any state, blue or red.
Texas is only gonna get worse. Get out.

Putting your feelings into words is a great exercise. In life, most things are outside your control and letting those things control your emotions is a guaranteed path to unhappiness.

It seems like politics never go the way we want, probably by design. Have you considered what would happen if ‚Äúyour‚Äù candidate won?

Consider writing a list of what ‚Äúyour‚Äù candidate would have ACTUALLY done for you.

Would they have stopped the bigoted comment at the grocery store? No.

Would they be able to remove the threat of violence that you mentioned? No.

The best defense of the things you mentioned is to live a life free from fear, expressing your love freely. Your life sounds like it has some amazing things in it, if you can focus on those things you can start to change more and more of the works around you.

Well seeing as other states have banned allowing gender affirming care/treatment/procedures at certain levels there's that. Not to mention bashing/vilfifying/alienating trans folk has become the status quo so I can imagine having a large political group continuously attack you for existing would be detrimental to your mental health
While unclear, the state has *banned* gender affirming care in minors.  Supposing that ban might be expanded is plenty plausible.  Texas *just* voted to keep its governor, *despite* the fact that its energy grid and other infrastructure is in shambles.  It has voted to keep an attorney general who has spent his entire time in office racking up indictment after indictment.  It has voted to largely keep people in office who *insist* that somehow *they* will ""fix"" things *despite* having been in charge since the 90s.

While none of this is particularly surprising if you live in Texas, it is a stark reminder of where things stand.  Obviously the state isn't going to change its opinions on the basis of esoteric things such as transgender identities.  It won't even change its opinions on the basis of clear and *obvious* problems such as a governor who will spend billions on useless gestures such as keeping the national guard ineffectively watching a border while the grid collapses in the face of *cold weather*, or an AG who is apologetically *criminal*.

There is some good news, however.  Local elections saw *increased* support for sensible governance.  My school district solidly rejected a group of five people who ran on a platform that an be summarized as ""trans people are just the worst"", and even managed to kick out one board member who has been nothing more useful than a bubbling cauldron of hate to such an extent that they would regularly prevent useful work from being done such as refusing to pass a budget because a school library had a few books mentioning that LGBT people *exist*.
""Don't hate trans people"" you say. Your side seems real invested in challenging the way we live and stopping us living the life we live as much as possible.

If you're going to try and sell some horseshit, at least dump some perfume on it.

And how dare you come in here with your both sides crap. We are treated like this other lesser thing not deserving of rights. Yours wants to pretend you're the default and normal and anything outside of that is the perversion. We're fighting for our lives while you're fighting to keep us down. So yeah, you're gonna get some hate for that. No reason to be polite when someone's trying to deny your rights.
The fact you think acceptance is defined as ""being pushed on you"" is quite concerning. It's the ""you're safe and accepted as long as it's not in my neighborhood"". The same political environment for what? Last 35 years? Your electric grid is fucked, crime rate is going up, weather is getting worse, your cities are concrete jungles that won't allow rain water to be properly diverted. Your governor rails against acceptance and ""things being shoved down their throat"" so he could waste money and tax their residents. Constantly doing the same thing over and over again, and then blame liberals and the education system (that is failing everyone) is the definition of insanity. If you don't see that there's a problem in your thought process, well then...

I see the comment was deleted.
The Texas GOP platform essentially says ""gay and trans people shouldn't exist and we will make them wish they didn't."" And you don't want us existing ""flaunted in your faces?"" Replace trans people there with literally any other group and I hope you can see why that's fucked up. 

Love the both sides bit. People being angry at the ones bullying them is not ""hate."" It's being fed up with being used as a political scapegoat because we want to be happy. 

Just fuck off with your transphobic bullshit
Republicans DO hate trans people and acting like you don‚Äôt want to see shows that you do

We aren't ""flaunting in your faces"", we simply want to be ourselves
What does ‚Äúflaunted in our faces‚Äù mean?

I'm proud of my country for being so trans inclusive.	"Hormones and surgery are free in public healthcare and insurance must cover them 100% by law.

There's an employment quota for trans people to access jobs easily ""It is established that transvestites, transsexuals and transgender people, who meet the suitability conditions, must hold positions in the national public sector in a proportion not less than 1% of the total positions""

There's a school dedicated (but not exclusively) to trans people who couldn't finish high school. I go there. It's the first trans school in the world, you can look it up as ""Mocha Celis"".

Of course there's still transphobia but with all the help we get from the state and organizations like the Mocha Celis it's easier to exist as a trans person.

I'm from Argentina btw."	"That's very awesome! I've been planning for years to go live there when I'm older because of that. My country is full of transphobic people and there are not many easy ways to transition here because it's actually normal to see that as a Latin American :( but I'm very glad Argentina is different in that way!
No por nada somos el mejor pa√≠s del mundo jaja
Sounds like a great place to live.
Hola. Vecina aca de Chile uwu
WAIT THAT IS ARGENTINA!? 

Que bonito pa√≠s, de verdad son los mejores.

Como puedo migrar? ü•∫
Pff, ns so quiero vivir en Argentina, ya me cuesta estar en brasil, prefiero mi espa√±ita
That sounds like an amazing place to live!!!
Sounds like a dream üò¥
Argentina Pride! I wanna come down there even more now!
VIVA ARGENTINA LA PUTA MADRE, se nos estaara cayendo el pais pero tenemos mas derechos que en otros lados
That sounds awesome, extraordinarily based.
that‚Äôs amazing!!!! go argentina!
Yooo! Same! Argentine and Uruguayan!
Saludos desde M√©xico, espero que pronto estemos igual que ustedes.
Woah that's awesome! This gives me hope. I live in the US and it seems like shits flying all over the place. I cant tell which way the laws and stuff will turn in the future, and quite frankly I'm not the smartest with politics and whatnot so I genuinely have no clue what to expect. But, seeing other nations becoming more progressive and accepting makes me happy and feel like everything will be alright, whether I move countries or not.
I'm moving. LOL
That's the only positive and in big cities, our crime rates, homice rates, hyperinflation, toxic political culture and more doesn't make it a great place to live, i just recommend you to investigate more, for your own safety before stepping on Argentina.
jamas pense ver un post de mi hermoso pais aca y menos mas gente argentinx
Its not. We suffer bad politics, hyperinflation, high crime rates with murderers on the street.
No quer√©s realmente emigrar ac√°, es un desastre en econom√≠a, seguridad, calidad pol√≠tica; todo. Que haya algunas pol√≠ticas inclusivas (que encima mal implementadas, porque muchas veces son s√≥lo para conseguir votos del partido reinante y nada m√°s lo cual genera reaccionismo), no lo hace un buen pa√≠s para vivir, apunt√° a los mejorcitos de la Uni√≥n Europea antes que esto.
Sin dudas quedate en Espa√±a antes que vivir en Argentina con lo desastroza que es, soy Arg y no puedo creer que les venden una imagen irreal con el nivel de discriminaci√≥n que hay fuera de grandes ciudades e incluso en las grandes ciudades tambi√©n encontr√©s, aparte de problemas econ√≥micos y de seguridad masivos que tenemos.
Because it is, it's a country in ruins after years of corrupt politicians, the few plus don't outweights the several cons of the country like hyperinflation, prominent crimes, corruption.
yo tampoco jaja, siempre es lindo encontrar a otros argentinxs
Oh, so it‚Äôs basically the USA with better trans inclusivity.
Aw üòî

Le pongo la mira a Europa mejor :3
Yup but only better trans inclusivity in big cities (still reactionary people in most of the country, i see transphobes offline and online constantly).  
We are even worse in economy with a huge chunk of the population living day by day. But you guys have it worse in gun violence compare to us."	w0ognq	trans	226	0.97	2022-07-16 19:32:29
Popular trans health care provider, Dr. Will Powers, threatens legal action against Transfeminine Science - a non-profit science communication and fact-checking website run by trans people.	"Dr. Will Powers is a popular doctor, providing help and prescriptions to trans patients. He's mostly known for his ""Powers Method"" - an unconventional model of hormone therapy, built on personal experience and less so on widely used guidelines. Depending on who you ask, this method is seen as a form of breaking the mold on HRT or as an unsubstantiated quackery. His name is pretty known in the trans spaces, with many people adapting his methods locally or via DIY. With many seeing him as a beacon of hope in the world of trans healthcare.

Transfeminine Science is a community-run provider of knowledge relating to research around trans hormonal therapies. It's been a source for many trans people, being especially known in the DIY community. It's purely a non-profit and a trans-for-trans initiative. Known for its high stringency around hearsay and therapies not supported by hard research, it has created [an article](https://archive.ph/VBrHk) outlining their reservations around methods of Dr. Powers and questioning his methodology.

Instead of engaging with criticism and peer review by TFS, Dr. Powers decided to threaten legal action against Transfeminine Science. After a few email exchanges, TFS decided to [pull down the article](https://transfemscience.org/articles/powers-fact-check/), citing lack of monetary resources to fight any potential legal action. Today, moderators have been [deleting all threads about the whole thing](https://i.imgur.com/uVuWVCu.png) on Powers' personal subreddit - Powers has amassed a group of very fervent supporters and it seems that criticism eroding that base are not seen nicely either.

What's especially saddening is that trans people are one of the main clienteles of Dr. Powers, leading to a situation where silencing of a trans community organization is fueled from funds extracted from the same community. Additionally [Powers himself admitted to sourcing a lot of his knowledge on the work of one of the TFS' main contributors](https://i.imgur.com/wMtOdfa.png). He cites free access to knowledge, aggregated by trans people for trans people, as one of the bedrocks of his practice.

So he got his knowledge from the unpaid trans labor, extracted cash from trans people and now attacks a trans support website for engaging with his knowledge and trying to forge a better system. The two-faced nature of faux allies, that bite back their precious trans folks as soon as we dissent, has rarely been this apparent."	"It's absolutely fucking sad that healthcare for transgender people is so pushed to the marginalia of science and medicine that the ""best"" sources of information we have include email chains, Facebook groups, and ""anecdata"" collected by a small handful of clinicians.
Will Powers is like Elon Musk to a lot of trans people sadly. He‚Äôs held in a weird pseudo worship type role and is aggressive when he‚Äôs wrong, which he frequently is.

His ego is just‚Ä¶ way too big that once you learn about him your brain should draw questions. He‚Äôs been very harmful in the research of HRT and progression
Seems that the questioning of his methods was potentially costing him money and he did what other wealthy people do, sue to shut them up‚Ä¶. They know they can‚Äôt fight back so the automatically win‚Ä¶. Sad but welcome to the land of the rich where they can get away with anything.
So can we say that Dr. will Powers is doing‚Ä¶ a Power trip?
Some of his methods work outstandingly for some people.   But it's not for everyone,  he's create a Cult mindset within his followers and that's always dangerous.  Not to mention Cult leaders are always narcissistic egomaniac
I think he has some great ideas, I also think he mixes those great ideas with a bunch of quackery.
I used to be slightly critical of him, but clearly I wasn't critical enough.
The original article can be accessed by anyone at: https://archive.ph/VBrHk The article can also be accessed if by creating an account at: https://www.are.na/block/12524458  I‚Äôm guessing that any threats of legal action by Dr. Powers against the owners of these sites (in the Philippines and Namibia) will not be taken seriously.
I don‚Äôt know but when my care team wanted to keep me on a low dose hrt treatment I then looked to his methods and doses applied to women in Europe, somewhat copied it, and finally saw my body and even face feminize. WPATH recommends something like 125-400, my docs wanted me on the low end. I saw changes when I went to 400 and a little above 400. If it weren‚Äôt for him and his experience, I wouldn‚Äôt have known it was safe with Estradiol patches to go higher.
Politics around trans medicine is always sad. However, I have applied Power's Trans knowledge to myself and other trans people and his discovery of the Estrone problem has made a difference in my life and others. My transition would have stalled without him and I will always be thankful for his research.
Nothing but a positive experience with PFM.
Let‚Äôs take a breath.  
Powers asked for it to be taken down for 3 years.  
This post was harming his ability to publish and advance trans health. 

Why did transfem fight him so hard? They should Be working with him not against him. 

Transfem acted like, bigots do  holding onto the past to hurt the present. 

Three years. Let it go. Take it down work with powers.  


Why do something that is harming one of the very few doctors that are trying to move past wpath? 

Why harm a doctor that‚Äôs literally üíØ for the good of the trans community. ?
My ADHD can't read this can someone explain
L doctor
The second I found out about him I was sus about him

I read on a thread once (someone was talking about how estrogen is bad for male brains) that he used estrogen cream to make himself look younger and then used too much once and felt like shit and had to cut back down.... I mean idk if it's real but if it is.... Yikes... Hrt is not made to make you look younger dude.

The fact that he felt like shit should've been a sign to stop - not to cut back down on the estrogen so he could look young...
How has he been harmful?  [Asking as a patient of his practice]
I always had the feeling that his subreddit felt a little bit cult-ish, but I just thought that it was due to it being a relatively small community.
This is a common story. At least he offers some rationale for choosing a particular dosage - which no GP has yet done for me. All I have received from even bona fide gender affirming specialist doctors has been ‚ÄúWPATH says 100-200‚Äù. No explanation of why or how those values were derived. And even WPATH has just this year revised the 200 upwards - it would seem because people were dosing higher when their results sucked and nothing bad happened as a result.
I certainly get a cocky, almost egotistical vibe from Dr Powers but not too many other doctors seem at all vested in outcomes for trans patients. Just follow the cookie cutter one-size-fits-all programme while at the same time spouting YMMV because‚Ä¶ one size actually doesn‚Äôt fit all.

I personally haven‚Äôt joined the cult of Powers but when I briefly ventured outside the WPATH guidelines further than intended on the instructions of my GP, I experienced a noticeable improvement in results.
Bottom line - in general our doctors don‚Äôt really give a shit how good or bad our results are because they aren‚Äôt personally affected. Dr Powers at least claims to be treating patients as individuals which I consider the bare minimum for a good doctor.
The threatened legal action is saddening because we have a tough enough time progressing trans health care without in-fighting. If TFS made claims amounting to libel then his response is understandable. If not it would be more mature to respond with research or documentation supporting whatever statements were being attacked.
Unfortunately it does not change the fact that he has seemingly gone after another source of trans information for no actual reason.
[deleted]
To be fair, he has done shit all for published results or actual case studies. He claims to be advancing healthcare and be a trans expert but has no expertise in the field and only peddles his ‚Äúmethods‚Äù to the trans community that by and large do not understand how medicine and science works while claiming to be a healthcare god
Lots of downvotes...not a lot of responses.   It feels lime a hatemob pointed at him that I don't get...
TL;DR: Dr. Will Powers, a prominent doctor for the trans community, threatened to sue transfeminine science ‚Äî a website made by a trans woman for trans women. This is shitty because Dr. Powers used her aggregate research and conclusions to develop his treatment regiment.

Edit: maybe my tldr was bad? Prominent may have been the wrong word.
He used to defend ivermectin as treatment for Covid for one. If you check his reddit comments you‚Äôll see he commented many times on news and political subs on his main account spreading ivermectin misinfo.
I agree, How has he been harmful? I'm also a patient and Powers and his entire staff have been beyond amazing.
He basically threatened a lawsuit to take down the website that was giving free advice and did not want to discuss what he thought was libel.


The two owners of the site asked what he wanted changed,  but he refused to discuss it and just threatened legal action.
Yes, Dr powers is the only one saying that the WPATH methods are old and based off data from the 70-80‚Äôs when drugs like Premarin were primarily prescribed.  That‚Äôs a drug that caused the high rate of blood clots, meanwhile Dr powers said statistically with how high he prescribed patients that he should have had patients with blood clots.  But he hasn‚Äôt.  My initial care team even went so far as to tell me that just getting hormones should alleviate my gender dysphoria and the dosage shouldn‚Äôt matter.  As in they thought it was all mental, and not based on me having a masculine body and I hated it.  I fired their asses‚Ä¶..went to a different doctor/care team. 

My VA team is amazing but it did take them a while to listen to me, as they are WPATH crazy as well. I went to Mexico and got hormones and increased my dosage and they freaked at the results, I told them to calm down, I am in charge, not them and told them where I got the drugs and plan.  Laid out my evidence, that the studies WPATH sites are all from 30 years ago and the non bio identical drugs, mainly Premarin.   That Dr powers and European clinics routinely give higher dosage and that‚Äôs where the results are amazing.  

I said I‚Äôd rather be able to monitor my health with a team I like, that understands it‚Äôs my body, I am in charge and quite frankly, they are not experts as they only reference an organization that uses studies on outdated drugs which are 30-50 years old.
Seriously.  

Transfem. Articles are posted to look per revised and published. 
For the uneducated ( post secondary experience) they don‚Äôt know that these are reductions, exerts, and interpretations of other studies and papers, 
Not per reviewed and published research.  

Powers is actively using his ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù to advance trans health.  

Name a doctor that‚Äôs stepping outside WPATH and actively publishing that fact to the public? 

Name a doctor willing to try off label medication for trans people.  


Powers is literally doing the things Transfem advances.  


Why the fighting.  Check the EGO.  

Hugs and love.  Fighting is uslesss.
I mean starting a low cost clinic that accepts and treats trans patients and queer people.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
He‚Äôs not a god not sure where that comes from. 

He‚Äôs fighting on our side.
It‚Äôs a hate mob!  I don‚Äôt care about internet points.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhahah
Sorry, let me clarify:  the post I was responding to said he'd been harmful in the research and care of trans people.   How has he been harmful there specifically?  

I'll be honest, I'm trying to ""practice what I preach"" here, and give the anti-powers crowd the benefit of the doubt, but rather than good faith answers, I'm getting downvotes...
Setting aside that that's not how it went down, the post I was responding to implied that he had done something actively harmful towards his patients, which he clearly has not.   [Edit: to clarify, the post said he'd been harmful to the research of HRT and progression.]

If the owners of the website (which I read a fair amount of before I started on E) kept it professional instead of attacking the Dr. they didn't like, or he'll even if they hadn't put the attack articles on the same site, then we'd have a much different issue.   

The key point here is Dr. Powers never asked them to take the site down, and the lawsuit was not about making them take the site down.   He asked them to take the attack articles down, and the lawsuit was about the attack article.  

Long story short, they started the fight and they dont get to claim he's the problem when he defends himself
[deleted]
wpath standard of care already recommends off label medication. i‚Äôm not aware of any medication that has a labeled purpose of gender transition.  the labeled purposes of all these medications are for things that cis people deal with that are not gender dysphoria.

prescribing medication off label is SoC in all disciplines of medicine because meds are constantly being found to have new uses besides their purpose when approved by the FDA.

doctors that are well practiced in hrt know how to tailor hrt to individual clients. powers isn‚Äôt some freak genius for listening to patients and their data.
A bit black and white, no?

""Powers is well-intentioned and has done good things.""  Sure, the article says as much; does it mean *everything* he does must be good, and anyone who questions something he's done bad?

Surely, if I have people's lives in my hands, I *want* people to tell me if something I'm doing isn't properly substantiated, because I want to be *really sure* I don't fuck up.

You said, ""they should be working with him, not against him;"" is checking him *not* helping in exactly that way?
From what I remember about the article In question‚Ä¶ It fact checked a lot of things in his presentation. misinfo about spiro causing visceral fat and stunting breast growth. Misinfo about the origins of trans fetal development. Misrepresenting the state of trans research and the wpath and related orgs.
They also pointed out an unhinged post he made where he seems to have this canary in the coal mine/delusions of grandeur complex.
He refused to even point out what mistakes they made.  It seems like a giant asshole move.

Why does he even serve the trans community again?  Suicide?  Lol

I smell something fishy now and the scent has just gotten stronger‚Ä¶
The way he seems to have formed a cult of personality is really concerning. You don't further medical care by cultivating an environment where people treat you like a messiah.
Thanks hun. But this gal is not a powers fan girl.  No do I love the way Transfem publishes to look per reviewed and journal published.  

But.  Both are for the betterment of my community.   

Why did it get to the point of legal intervention? 
EGO,
Very few docs will deviate from wpath.  Powers is at least looking outside those guidelines. 


An established protocol does not make it good. 


Science and biomedical publishing is a fickle world.  
If taking a three year old article down can help 
Trans people 
Then take it down. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
An article that is preventing a doctor from trails and studies.  
That is a direct harm to my community.  

If we don‚Äôt advance thoughts past WPATH we will live with second rate care.
And honestly, his response to this has been equally delusional and unhinged. The information in the article was well cited. His refusal to elaborate on exactly what is incorrect or impeding his research shows that he‚Äôs fighting shadows.
I do agree that people should NOT harass him, or anyone else. Free speech and free exchange of ideas right? As long as there‚Äôs nothing harmful. TFS‚Äôs article was not.

Had to edit. 
The only way powers is like musk is they are both on the spectrum.  

Those loyal to powers are because he has helped a lot of trans people.  He‚Äôs done a ton of good.  He has had ideas and, methods not work aswell as intended, and has changed methods, as a result.
How was it preventing him from doing anything?  Specifically, what was he unable to do as a result?

Also, I noticed this previously, but wasn't sure how to phrase it:  ""any change"" is not ""good change.""  Yes, we need to improve the state of trans healthcare, of course I agree.  That doesn't mean that *anything* apart from the standard is better, though.  Some things will be worse.

Again, if some specific things Powers does are good, and other specific things he does are *not*, should the latter not be addressed?  Do you think the only reason someone would point out the latter is ""ego""?  Do you think the advancement of trans medicine should be left in the hands of one cis guy because he's the hero of the story?  Or do you think the science could be made better by the collaboration of different perspectives pulling one another back when they begin to stray?
He alleges that academics are refusing to do research with him, citing the article to him, which is one of the first things that comes up when you search his name.

So fair, the article *is* harming his career- specifically his attempts to, in his words, 'go legitimate'. That doesn't mean the article should be taken down, however, especially when they gave him the opportunity to remove alleged inaccuracies. Shutting down criticism of anyone who seems to be acting in the trans community's interests would do much more harm than good, especially if the person is attacking a community resource and silencing corrections to misinformation. I fully agree with you."	yqqxsr	trans	216	0.96	2022-11-09 18:20:13
I‚Äôm Derek (they/them/he/him), and I work with patients getting gender-affirming hormone therapy over video. AMA about GAHT!	"I‚Äôm a queer non-binary member of society that has spent the last 33 years working to steer my life through the wild waters of the world and find myself in the process. Simple task right?

Finding safe and caring primary and gender-affirming care for us queer folx is a terrifying topic of conversation, especially in today‚Äôs political climate! As someone who has jumped around from doctor to doctor trying to find the right fit, I understand the constant battle of unpacking and then repacking past traumas.

I work at a medical practice that provides gender-affirming care and I answer our patients‚Äô questions about (but not limited to): insurance coverage for gender-affirming hormone therapy, billing codes, legal documentation, informed consent, what to expect when getting care over video, etc. Patients have so many questions and some have complex answers, and I wanted to share what I can with you all (but can‚Äôt share medical advice).

My goal is to assist fellow LGBTQ2SIA+ individuals find that safe place to discuss their healthcare and start their personalized journeys towards actualizing their true selves. I‚Äôll be responding to questions from 9am to 11:30am PDT today, so ask away!

UPDATE: Signing off for now! Thank you all for your truly great questions and the warm welcome into this community. :-) I‚Äôll check back in throughout the week, so feel free to leave any other questions or comments that pop up!"	"Hi Derek, thank you for giving this opportunity!

I have a few questions:

- Roughly speaking, at your clinic how many clients apply for gender care and what percentage of those get accepted (per year) as clients?

-is there an average and/or maximum time this gender care is given?

-If for whatever reason a clients decides to discontinue treatment and effectively wants to detransition, does your clinic have a protocol on how to deal with that?

-Working in this line of work must have huge ups (like truly improving someone‚Äôs life) and downs (like dealing with bigots). How do you (and your co-workers) stay healthy of mind?


And last, not a question but I want to thank you for helping making the world a better place for all of us‚ù§Ô∏è
And we are live! Post all your questions, and I'll be answering until 11:30am PDT!
I am a 30y/o, and mtf, I've been on hrt for about 5 months, if you could answer some questions I'd be very grateful 



1.) If you want facial feminization surgery how long should you be on hrt before getting a it done?


2.) As a 30 year old, can I expect any significant changes to my face, hips, chest from hrt alone?


3.) How long will it take me to lose muscle mass in my arms?


4.) Will hrt stop fat from being put on my stomach?

Thank you for your time and for helping the community
Hello Derek I am Josie,

Thank you for doing an AMA here. I personally am 18 months on feminizing HRT and I am 37. I had my orchi done at 12 months and FFS will be next summer with additional referrals sent out for top and bottom surgery that I am now waiting on consult dates for. 

What advice do you have for the older population who is transitioning? Anything from the social elements to planning your medical transition would be appreciated. It was incredibly overwhelming to start and I only recently really feel like I have a handle on all the intricacies of dealing with insurance and doctors, society, and my peers within the community. 

For me what seems to have really helped was creating a master document to have all my research and any supporting documents (letters, consult notes, surgical notes etc.). Additionally I have started a visionary board to start compiling my personal style and aesthetic goals.

Finding my voice was imperative to my transition so far. I believe I have struck a good balance with medical providers regarding being firm in my expectations but understanding of the limits in place in the medical community. When red flags presented I quickly sought out alternative providers. Can you elaborate on what are some tell tale red flags and when it is appropriate to fire your care provider/surgeon/endo? 

I could easily ask more questions but I have voice therapy shortly so I have to get prepared for that. Thank you for doing this and hopefully it is helpful to some of the folx here.

I‚Äôm most curious as to what the 2 and S stand for in the acronym and why + wouldn‚Äôt cover these 2 mysterious additions.
Are you Veritassium?
Do you have any inside info on the (most recent) injectable estrogen shortage?

I recently had to switch from once-a-week injections of Depo-Estradiol to twice-daily sublingual estrogen pills. I've *heard* that there's just a single company producing it in a single plant, but I don't know the reason(s) behind the shortage, what (if anything) is being done to address the situation, and when we can expect the estrogen to start flowing again.

Hi Derek!

I'm curious, with the rising risk of bans and other barriers to GAHT access in the US, do you see a possible future in which the DIY scene and mutual aid networks begin to replace traditional healthcare again for trans folk, as we saw up until a decade or so ago?

What do you think that would look like? What are things you worry about or would want the community to work on if that began to happen?
Nebraska estrogen for me I've been transgender for a few years however in Lincoln I can't get the hrt I need
Hi Sylvia, thanks so much for your questions!

* The goal of the practice I work at is to provide safe access for GAHT via telemedicine to anyone (over 18) who needs it! Right now, the large majority of patients coming to see us are a good fit for care, but there are limits to telemedicine. Depending on if the person is taking certain medications that are better monitored in person, for the safety and wellbeing of the patient, we may ask they follow up in person. This is all on a case by case as we want each person to form a personal care journey that best fits their needs!
* There really isn't an average/maximum time that we would be able to see a patient for care. Our goal is to continue to provide treatment for as long as someone needs :)
* If at any time a patient would like to discontinue treatment, our providers are there to help every step of the way to make sure it's handled safely.
* This is definitely the best and most difficult part of what we do every day. My coworkers and I respond directly to patients chatting in with questions, so we get to be there with patients during all of the amazing moments in their journey, but are also there during difficult times! We definitely get some bigots, and we just have to remain positive, remember what we are working toward, and be kind. I think we all know people out there that have bigoted mindsets due to fear, so remaining kind is always the best move (in my opinion haha). The good always outweighs the negative, so remembering all of the positive changes I've been able to be a part of, really helps keep a healthy mindset!

Thank you for your kind words!
Hi BunbunTheJackalope! Thanks for reaching out for some guidance :)While I would really love to answer your medical questions I‚Äôm limited to how much advice I can give on a public forum without you being a patient of ours.

Every patient's transition is super unique to them, as it happens on a different timeline as well as with differing goals. It's really important to keep in contact with your medical provider on a regular basis to get answers tailored specifically to your personal medical goals and desired outcomes. Are you currently with a medical provider that you're comfortable asking these questions? 

I know that's probably not the answer you‚Äôre looking for, but I hope that it helps point you in the right direction!
Hi Josie! Thanks so much for taking some time to chat with me today! 

It sounds like you have already taken so many amazing steps in your journey! From what you‚Äôve described above, your organizational skills are something to be applauded here. A vision board and master file of documents that you‚Äôre collecting is great!

You‚Äôre right that it can be an overwhelming process to get started as well as maintain. I think it's extremely important that you find a medical provider that you‚Äôre comfortable working with and would recommend to always advocate for your care goals. As I‚Äôm sure we all know, the medical system is a bit behind the times. So finding someone that you can grow and learn with, in a comfortable space is imperative! It sounds like you‚Äôre not afraid to ask questions and challenge the system, and knowing when to allow the system to also catch up to you.

If you feel uncomfortable in a space, then know that leaving is always an option. If a provider doesn't make you feel heard, or if you don't feel safe to share important information with your provider, that is a big red flag. Trust your gut and know that you have options. 

I want to thank you so much for posting such amazing questions for others to read and learn from. You have undergone a lot of things and giving others the opportunity to learn from that is amazing. Hope voice therapy goes well ‚ù§Ô∏è

The 2S in the LGBTQ2SIA+ acronym stands for Two Spirit which was proposed to be added by Elder Myra Laramee during the Third Annual Inter-tribal Native American, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian American Conference, held in Winnipeg in 1990! Though the ‚Äú+‚Äù is there to include other groups within the community, the 2S was added to shine light on Two Spirit individuals. :)
Hi BuddyA! 

We partner with the UCSF hospital system and they‚Äôve observed every 2 years or so there's a shortage of injectable estrogen. We do however try to assist our patients with prescription reroutes (where we have the provider re-send a script to a different pharmacy) with the hopes of finding a pharmacy that will fill the prescription as soon as possible. 

Keeping our fingers crossed that the estrogen starts flowing again soon! ü§û
Hi Maya! 

I‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre here and that you‚Äôve asked this question. Coming out can feel like the world is caving in on you, but it's also one of the most rewarding experiences ever. The anxiety you‚Äôre experiencing is totally normal, but remember that you know who you are better than any other person! I would love to also hear from other members of the community on how they‚Äôve navigated this as well! You have an incredibly supportive community standing with you, welcome home.
What's the point of doing an AMA and not answering any questions?
I am currently being prescribed hrt through an informed consent clinic. I goto a planned parenthood over 2 hours away because it is the closest one. The doctors providing me with care unfortunately are very busy and rarely are able to answer the phone to answer any questions and I work to much to be able to make the trip to the clinic more than once every 3 months.
I think instead of adding to the acronym we can just start saying + by itself to include everyone and not worry about someone not getting light shed on them or not, everyone is just included in +, and then no one can feel left out because everyone is equal under +. So the new acronym for the community could just be the + community. Inclusive of everyone, gay bi lesbian trans intersex 2 spirit asexual queer all represented under just one amazing mathematical symbol. Simple and beautiful.
Thanks and ü§û!
I mean, the answers to these questions are all very different depending on the person, there's really no way to accurately answer them without even knowing the person asking
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! You deserve the best care and you deserve to have a doctor or provider that you have access to! Always know that you have options.
Some other informed consent practices offer care over telemedicine so you don't have to make the drive to the clinic. Some offer in app chat as well as have teams for patient support to answer any questions (that‚Äôs actually my job üòâ)"	wxcces	trans	203	0.97	2022-08-25 12:00:59
My teacher attempted to censor my homework about transgender struggles	Basically, we received homework (subject English). The task was to write a short informative text about something controversial. I chose to write about the struggles and difficulties of transgender people. When the teacher opened our documents so she could read them in front of the class, she read all of them except for mine. When she opened the document and found out what I wrote about, she simply decided to not read it. Luckily my classmates stood up for me and immediately confronted the teacher about it, convincing her to read it. The teacher stopped every now and then and kept questioning/doubting/confronting my presentation. I told her that yes, there are cases of transgender people dying because doctors refused to give them proper healthcare and that transgender people need our support more than hate. She didn't really seem like she would care though. She kept making ever so slightly transphobic & homophobic comments which were pissing me off. I did my best to stay cool but I was and still am extremely angry at her. Like she literally attempted to censor my presentation just because of the transgender-related topic. However I really deeply appreciate that my classmates actually stood up for me there. Real heroes <3	"Report them. Transphobia and homophobia from teachers is awful.
"" write about something controversial""

""NOOOOO no that!""

fukin people
Definitely mention this to higher up in the school, if your in NA or Europe, that teacher can be dealt with very easily and mainly be forced to go through more training. It may not seem like much, but that teacher will suffer through the week of christmas vacation they will about to lose.
My take from this is your classmates supported you.  This tells me that as the generations of haters age out there will be less and less.  That makes me very happy.
Don‚Äôt put up with this.  These people need to be shamed.  No one in a position of authority should act like this. You deserve respect and a space to tell your story without harassment. She literally asked for it!
Teacher: Write about something controversial!

Student: *Writes about something the teacher personally finds controversial*

Teacher: *Surprised pikachu face*
Give her time. This is something she doesn‚Äôt understand. And of course you gave her what she asked for, a topic controversial. I know it‚Äôs hard because she used her position to challenge your topic but society has changed rapidly, and many people have very outdated ideas, it takes time for things to change. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt standup for your beliefs and definitely don‚Äôt be a target. But as long as she grades you fairly compared to the others, I think reporting her should it be unnecessary could make her feel defensive and make it a you vs her situation. Use some wisdom and determine if it‚Äôs a wise decision. You want her to realize she is wrong and have a conviction to be supportive.
Having said that: I wasn‚Äôt there so I don‚Äôt really know but ‚Äútrying to make someone suffer‚Äù and that kind of pure vindictiveness because someone doesn‚Äôt agree or understand your position or reality causes conflict. That usually doesn‚Äôt end with one said saying ‚Äúoh you were right, so sorry

Edit: I see that my post is very unpopular which is ok if people disagree with me. But I wanted to add a very important message:  give her time does not mean let it go or ignore it: it means give her a couple of days or at most a week. She could feel bad about it and apologize. If she doesn‚Äôt than you could let her know how she made you feel. And if she doesn‚Äôt seem to care than perhaps you should report it.
Based on the fact that my principal is a member of the most transphobic political party in my country, I don't think that would work for me :/

However the teacher isn't all that bad, while her rude comments made me very angry, they weren't rude enough for it to be report-worthy. It was more like that ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" level of rudeness, rather than actually transphobic insults. It is especially sad because she used to be one of my favorite teachers :d
Millinials did waves better then their Parents and my generation (barely lol I'm 24) aren't putting up with shit. Life is too short to waste on hate
What the hell are you on about?
This person is active on truscum so uh don't listen to them.
that teacher is gonna retire soon but your presentation helped normalize trans issues to all the kids in your class and that's heroic. u did a good thing

My employer pretends to be so trans-affirming, but when it comes to healthcare I'm on my own	"I'm in the middle of two appeals right now. I expect I'll be going through a third one soon. I work for a large organization, and it's a self-funded plan. They could cover my needs. Instead, there is an exclusions list a mile long in my plan document under ""gender dysphoria."" I've worked for this supposedly progressive organization for years. I have a professional job.

And yet I'd get better insurance if I were on Medicaid or worked for Starbucks.

Meanwhile, there's literally a giant poster on my building right now celebrating trans people. I want to ask them to take it down. They don't deserve to be thought of as gender affirming if they aren't willing to cover my medical needs. I'm tired all the time from dealing with insurance, and it's still a long shot for me to have it covered. Stop using people like me for marketing if you're not actually going to help me!"	"Same sib. I love my insurance until the trans stuff was brought up.
What hypocrites! You really should ask them to take it down. :-/
Ugh I know what you mean. When I worked at Wells Fargo they had some super generic diversity posters and there were trans models but you wouldn't know that unless you were especially active in the trans community and knew who those specific models were.
Gender? I 'ardly know 'er!
What company is this? Would be nice for us to know so we know not to work there.
I'm here to talk if you need someone to talk to. I'm also fairly well-versed in other employers with trans-friendly insurance policies if you're looking to get a new job. My DMs are always open.
Similar experience at work. Oh, and don't even ask about the bathroom sitch. üôÑ
That's really awful. I wish you luck with getting the care you need, and I do think they need to take down that poster.
I'm with you I just found out my union insurance won't cover me either.
[removed]
I have to agree.
does your company have insurance opt out in your contract? It might be better to go with the opt out (if available/if your state requires it be available) and get your own plan. good luck
Can not relate to the exact situation but my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover my meds (that I need if I want to continue living) because they are in the ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù category just like with insulin/cancer stuff/etc. They‚Äôre $3,000/mo but goodrx brings it down luckily.
Sometimes graffiti on public property is a good thing if you catch my drift. If they want the brownie points for being an ally they have to actually BE AN ALLY
Oh no, this is a photography exhibit that clearly says they're all trans.
Ew, tell them you don't want to pay your dues if they're not going to stand up for you.
Yes, well, isn't a live birth in a hospital also elective? Aren't there a lot of conditions that you can live with, but treatment is covered by insurance?  

I get what you're saying, but the gray area is enormous. And there are a lot of employers who choose to cover it. In NYC (where I live), Medicaid covers it. The NYC Human Rights Law requires it of insurance plans that aren't covered by ERISA (which, unfortunately, mine is). The WPATH says some of these procedures are medically necessary for some patients and should be covered by insurance. So if you're going to position yourself as being a trans friendly workplace, you really need to be doing more than benchmarks like that require, not less.
Nope. The only reason I could opt out is if I became qualified for another plan. So if I started moonlighting at Starbucks, maybe I could.
Oh great. Ask them if they accept payment in the form of validity or exposure
My union head is going to go to batt for me just going to take some time fingers crossed!
[removed]
that‚Äôs frustrating, i‚Äôm frustrated for you. i had Kaiser my whole life so I get the whole faux-trans-activism BS. At one point I had 4 medical record cards because those idiots couldn‚Äôt figure out how to change my LEGAL name and gender‚Äî each card had a different mashup of old/new name or new name with old gender hahaha. They don‚Äôt do referrals, all in-house, but their trans care is trash.

I‚Äôm still dealing with a shitty top surgery that I now have to get fixed by a real top surgeon‚Ä¶.
Lol, yeah.
Well that's good! That's what they're for!
I'm not trying to invalidate the categories. I agree--there are things that are medically necessary and others that are not. My point is that you're assigning the wrong test of scrutiny to my medical needs. 

So my point about paying for childbirths is this: a company can't just put up a note in their insurance documentation that says that they won't pay for childbirths. We know that not everyone has children. It's a choice to have children--as long as they're willing to pay for abortions. But of course we've decided as a society that we want insurance to pay for medical care that has to do with childbirth.

I really don't know what other people's needs are in terms of plastic surgery. I believe that medical necessity isn't a matter for you or I to choose, but rather doctor and patient. So I don't see any point in getting into whether or not anyone's surgery is medically necessary except for mine. I believe that mine is necessary and so does my doctor. You really have nothing to say about it because you haven't even seen my damn face.

As to my workplace, it's fairly well-known and thought of as being very liberal, particularly on trans issues. And yet, the healthcare plan they have is discriminatory, because it has a whole list of things that it *won't cover for people suffering from gender dysphoria*. So if a cis woman wanted a breast enlargement, and her doctor said it was medically necessary (which, by the way, happens all the time with women who have mastectomies), she could have one, but because I'm trans I can't. That's discrimination. And it's coming from a place that should be on the cutting edge of trans healthcare. Instead, I'm wondering if I can get fired, because Medicaid has a much better option in NYC.

THank you. I'm still reeling and not even sure if my Kansas provider can provide care. When I asked they said they have to figure it out legally. Hopefully those of us in St Louis and Kansas City will be able to get care across the border without interruption. Worried Kansas will follow suit though.

Way safer, legally speaking, at least. Have some friends there too. Had a consultation with a surgeon there, too.
I used to say Chicago was dangerous but after moving to Memphis nah even Humboldt park is safe compared to that.

Oh that‚Äôs so good then, especially if you have friends there! I would hate for you to make such a move without some sort of support and or community.
Missouri Attorney general just essentially banned gender affirming care for most trans adults via emergency rule that will go into effect April 27th if not pushed back on. 

The order requires trans people to meet a very strict and nearly impossible set of requirements before doctors can prescribe them any gender affirming care. What‚Äôs required? 3 years of documented intense gender dysphoria as well as 18 months of therapy sessions to ‚Äúrule out‚Äù other possible causes to dysphoria. It also doesn't allow people with autism, depression, or other mental health comorbidities to obtain gender affirming care unless they are resolved of such conditions before. It has a lot of other really bad stuff in it. 

This is technically not a compete ban on gender affirming care, but a ban that will make it nearly impossible for most trans folks to get HRT, surgeries, etc. it‚Äôs a catch 22.

For the first time someone asked if I was a guy or girl!	"I (29mtf) work in an outpatient healthcare facility. I'm not out yet to anyone at work, because I don't think it would go well.

So yesterday afternoon a patient comes in at the end of the day. She's upset about medications and wants to talk to a manager. I went out to talk to her, I explained the situation and everything turned out fine. I left for the day thinking nothing of it. 

When I came in today the person working at the front desk was giddy to tell me something that I ""would NOT believe."" In a hushed voice she tells me that the patient yesterday asked her if I was a boy or girl! 

I'm still smiling about it, I'm just so happy! I know that's a small step overall but it's a huge victory for me üòÄ"	"Congratulations. Sounds like you are a little bit out at work, or at least now you are. I can only hope this happens to me.
That's amazing! Dream of mine to have this happen at some point.

Things are really bad y'all, like really really bad. And they're only getting worse. But we can make change, we have to generate public outcry, call our reps, organize, protest, make the world listen. We cannot let these bills keep passing with relative silence.		"Not a legal eagle, is there any chance of these getting struck down in court? Hang in there all, and don't give up. We won't take all of this.
land of the free unless you slightly differ from the average
cis people dont give a shit about us. the only way ""public outcry"" is gonna get generated is if it starts affecting them too.
I sincerely hope there are teachers there who outright refuse to use pronouns for *anyone* just to make a point. All students just referred to as ""the student"" til school boards get sick of it. Just malicious compliance until they eat their words. 

The medical care bit though... that shit's rough. I'm hoping doctors pull together for a joint lawsuit claiming that it interferes with care and causes undo harm to the patients.
Yeah, we‚Äôre all silent cause we‚Äôre to busy fighting over a damn video game
Huge government overreach from the party of freedom? That's America for you.

I'd call my reps and sign petitions if I could but I'm European. I'm signal boosting all I can but I have zero reach especially because I haven't come out so I can't use my regular accounts. I wonder if there's any other ways I can help that won't out me...
I wager it's being challenged or will be challenged. It's an unconstitutional law and very discriminatory. As scary as this all is, I know that it's temporary. Rainbows always appear after a storm.
There is a case out of Texas that would ban the second drug used in medication abortions (which constitute a large majority of the procedures) across the country through a nationwide injunction (doesn't matter if abortion is legal in your state).  That would be a huge over-reach and assert judicial supremacy over the executive branch among many other things.  I believe that if medical abortions fall, contraception would be right behind.  I think that would be enough to get cis-people in the streets and potentially reverse some of this state terror against trans people <I hope?>
The drag bans are illegal under the first amendment. They are overly broad and don‚Äôt actually define their terms to an extent that would be unenforceable under legal theory. The medical bans for minors are less clear cut but still a good case since they are interfering with medical care. The one allowing people to misgender people in schools will stand most likely, for the same reasons drag bans are illegal.

Nurse looking for advice	"For context, I work as a triage nurse at a healthcare facility in Canada. 

When a patient‚Äôs number is called they approach my desk and I ask for a piece of photo ID and their healthcare card. During my shift yesterday a M to F trans woman came to our facility. She gave me her healthcare card and I inputted her number into the system. Her name pops up, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúMelissa.‚Äù I then proceed to ask my questions as usual which start with ‚Äúhello, do you go by Melissa? My name is ‚Äú____‚Äù and I‚Äôm a registered nurse.‚Äù She was extremely offended and replied to me ‚Äúyeah, what else would I go by? I paid a lot of money to be called that.‚Äù I apologized and explained that I ask everyone what name they go by and if I don‚Äôt know how to pronounce it, I ask that too. She didn‚Äôt seem satisfied with that answer and I truly felt awful. 

I was hoping for advice going forward as I want to be welcoming to everyone who comes in. 

For those wondering, I ask that question because often times a person‚Äôs full name pops up like William but they then tell me they prefer Bill."	"Sounds like she just took your question the wrong way. I imagine most people meeting a triage nurse are under some measure of stress, I wouldn't take it too personally. 

Maybe as a note, instead of asking a patient to confirm that they go by  the name on record, ask them if they are ok going by their full name? That way it less implies that she'd have another name, and more implies that she might have a preferred nickname?
I think what happened here was a misunderstanding. She likely thought when you said ‚Äúdo you go by‚Äù that her previous name had come up on the system with her new name as a note. ‚ÄúDo you go by?‚Äù can have a sort of ‚Äúnot your real name‚Äù implication.

You haven‚Äôt done anything wrong, but trans people who‚Äôve changed their legal name often continue to encounter their old names in computer systems even years later as everything catches up and it can be frustrating. It‚Äôs happened to myself many times.

Even though this didn‚Äôt happen, I think by the wording of the question she may have thought it had.
Healthcare environments tend to be extremely transphobic 

I probably would have reacted the same way. Im not proud of that. But my anxiety tends to manifest as irritability and medical spaces are the #1 triggering place 

But nurses and doctors do have an obsession with names, asking about them, using them as conversation starters, etc

I theorize its bc its one of the few ways to connect with patients and make them feel like A Name and Not A Number in an efficient way.

Like... I was talking to a receptionist to see my HRT doctor and she complimented my deadname. In my manly ass voice I laugh and say ""well *I* dont care for it"" and she proceeds to dig her heels in like ""Well I like it. Its so unique blah blah blah"" I can see her having a similar conversation with a cis person, but the fact that im trans it *feels* like shes saying something else. Like... I should go by my old name and gender 

Or when my doctor burst into the room and asked very loudly if my deadname was German. Startled, I said i don't go by that name and said my preferred name. She would not fucking let it go. She HAD to know if it was German. And then she ended it with ""But i will call you your preferred name since that is what you preferred to be called"" which again feels like shes saying something Else. like my preferred name is not my name.

So yeah... These are just the ""innocent"" interactions. Where the other person is just being ignorant, but it still takes a lot out of me. Im not even talking about the time a doctor gave my mom an anti trans book. 

My guess is this womans guard was already up and she was expecting some fuckery

Also... She wasnt lying. Its like $500 for a name change where I live. I can definitely see why she'd get defensive about that. Especially when she probably went through a lot of shit and red tape to get that name legalized, and then for people to call her that, so yeah

You just stepped on some toes. It happens.

EDIT I don't think you should feel bad or ashamed or anything like that, just be kind and compassionate towards that lady and yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT These conversations im talking about are not ""confirming my legal name"" conversations.  Those also happen, I literally have to deadname myself to Geico like, the concept of people needing my legal name is not lost to me Ive been doing this for 10 years. Im SPECIFICALLY talking about medical staff who use names as icebreakers / to connect with patients bc its the first thing they see on your chart thats personal. And for trans people that shit hits different, especially when you say ""i dont like that name and i go by x"" abd they wont shut up about how great it is or IS IT GERMAN? why would anyone think a doctor needed to know if my deadname is german to avoid getting in trouble like.... I clearly was not talking about when they are forced to confirm my legal name, im talking about when they try to make a whole ass conversation out of that. Literally no one else i have to reveal my deadname to is this specific kind of weird about it. It is truly a medical staff Thing
I kind of get why she might‚Äôve been initially frustrated, but that‚Äôs a ‚Äúthink for two seconds and realize it wasn‚Äôt an attack‚Äù situation, not a ‚Äúget pissy about nothing‚Äù situation. You absolutely did the right thing asking, and it‚Äôs a shame she didn‚Äôt do the right thing by being respectful.
I think you're doing a great job already, responding to this by taking it in stride. If the point of asking is about nicknames, so I'd go with something like, ""Should/Can I call you ____ , or do you go by a nickname you'd prefer?"" But I also know that's a mouthful to say every time you see someone. At the end of the day it's possible this particular trans person was putting up shields early to avoid being hurt because something *like* this has happened to her before that has lead to discreet or overt discrimination. It doesn't make what she did less rude, and I don't think it makes your response ""wrong"", either. Best of luck moving forward and thank you for your excellent allyship!
I think you did a great job. I don't think you need any advice, unless it's to not let shitty stuff thrown at you by people with a chip on their shoulder ... get to you. That woman doesn't get a pass on being a walking anger bomb, just because she's trans.
It sounds like a normal question to me. My name is three syllables that is frequently shortened, including by me.

There may be ways of finessing the question, but I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong or offensive. You were taking steps to be respectful. Hell, when I taught, I saw different pronunciations for names than I would have expected, and I‚Äôm sure you come across that, too.

Does you chart system have a field for preferred name? If not, maybe you could suggest one. I do legit feel more at ease when I see signage that somewhere is queer or trans friendly. That might also help defuse similar situations in the future?

I‚Äôm sure you know patients are often stressed when talking to triage. It could easily have been stress that made her react how she did.

Thanks for caring enough to ask.
I'm a trans woman in Canada who recently dealt with the local ER.  Their system does have a spot for preferred name.  The triage nurse and the doctor I eventually saw were good about using my preferred name.  That was it for the good in the whole visit.

Most of the rest of the nurses and staff didn't give a shit, just barking out my deadname at me and pointedly ignoring corrections and rolling their eyes.  Sheer anger at the poor treatment kept me awake.  I was there due to massively spiked blood pressure to begin with so the bulk of the staff were actively aggravating my condition by stressing me out.

My legal ID finally changes over later this month.  I wouldn't be surprised if some bigot digs my deadname out of the records and tries to address me by it, which will be a fiasco because I don't even attend to my old name anymore unless it's clearly directed at me.  It's not my name.

I don't think you did anything wrong but when most of us get treated like garbage by hospital staff all too often, yes, we can be touchy and assume the worst (it usually is after all).

Probably adjusting your phrasing and/or tone would help get trans folks to relax as you interact with them.  Just keep in mind that even if you are a delight, odds are high at least one of your colleagues will be openly rude and bigoted after the patient moves on past you.
You did nothing wrong, I‚Äôm sorry she treated you that way it wasn‚Äôt ok. Try not to take anything personally, as getting healthcare as a trans person is incredibly stressful. We deal with a lot of transphobia so we‚Äôre on high edge. Just the other day I went to the GP after a legal name change and the receptionist was annoyed at me and said I have to always book it under my old legal name not my new on in the future. I said I‚Äôd like to be able to book under my current legal name on my healthcare card and she got so angry at me and refused to update my details. 


In short, we‚Äôre often on very high alert/edge in healthcare situations. Never less you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, she shouldn‚Äôt have acted like that over what you said.
Consider rephrasing it to ‚Äúour system has your first name as Melissa, is that correct? Do you have a nickname or preferred name I can add?‚Äù 

The nuances of ‚Äúfirst name‚Äù, ‚Äúsystem‚Äù, and ‚Äúnickname‚Äù will communicate to most people (trans and others) that you are being thorough, not judgmental. If offense is taken, I think you can assure yourself you did your best and sometimes people are just raw or misunderstand. Communication is hard.

But also, don‚Äôt bother adding the preferred name if people aren‚Äôt going to actually use it because that hurts even more. 

(I notice almost everywhere I go in health care in Ontario they now do use my preferred name even though I didn‚Äôt legally change it, but this is pretty new. Thanks for reminding me to ask for it with doctors I‚Äôve been seeing a long time.)

It means a lot to know to know a nurse is coming here for ideas on how to be more affirming and respectful. <3

I hope you are no longer feeling awful. You meant no harm. You apologized. You acknowledged your true intentions. You came here because you want to do better. 

All we can ask of each other is that when we know better we do better, and in my opinion you‚Äôre doing great. :)
Some people just want reasons to be mad
I get that they paid money but there tone of voice from the sound of it seemed harsh. In my opinion, I would prefer if somebody asked.
Not much you can do differently, she just over-reacted.
Just here to pile on the support wagon. You did nothing wrong. In fact, it sounds like you did everything the best. 

Keep up the good work! Thanks for being an ally!!!
Don't worry, seems like just an individual instance of someone being insecure. What you did was perfectly fine and respectable.
I don't get her problem, aside from triage stress,my name is Alexis if you said exactly that id say yeah that or Lexi, whatever is easier!also mtf
She sounds annoying, you did nothing wrong lol
You did nothing wrong. 

I can understand how people would have a defense set up especially after being mistreated, but they need to then go to therapy to realise that not everyone is out to get them and to deal with what happened in the past. You were respectful and didn't mean anything by asking that.
Try "" Hello, Melissa. Do you go by Melissa, or do you have another preferred name?"" . My name is Anastasia,  but I go by Anna most of the time. Melissa could go by Mel or Lisa. Does her answer go into a shared file? I told my cardiologist that my name was Anastasia,  but then when I saw my new GP, since I was presenting as Anastasia,  he called me Anastasia. My cardiologist made a note in my file that my GP saw and read. That was my first visit with him.
Yeah we‚Äôre pretty touchy about getting the name right.  Maybe a better way to say it, is, ‚Äúyou go by Melissa, correct?‚Äù  Or its says here your name is ‚ÄúMelissa‚Äù is that correct?
I think she just misunderstood. Maybe say something like ‚Äúdo you prefer another name?‚Äù Or ‚Äúdo you have a nickname you would liked to be called?‚Äù
I think you were appropriately respectful and did a great job; it's truly awesome that you came here looking for ways to improve:)

That said, it sounds like that patient was just a jerk. Being trans doesn't give one special license to crap on people because they made the most minor of faux pas. ALL people have things that are triggering. As other reasonable people have mentioned, just consider the situation (a public, high-stress environment) and move on to the next patient.
I think she may just have been having a bad day ü§ç I really appreciate being asked because I‚Äôm not the kind of person to go out of my way to bring up my name change. 

This is a bit unrelated but I‚Äôve been wanting to share this with someone since I found this. Here is a link to a LGBT care guide for nurses that I discovered when I was in my LGBT studies class. I really like it and it has some great information if your interested : ) thanks for being an ally 
[LGBT nursing](https://nursejournal.org/resources/lgbtq-key-terms-and-definitions/)
They were rude. Anyone knows you always confirm a zillion times the patient and information is correct because if it's not can be legal hell. My nephews birth certificate says mother race black... my sister is not black. So just as an example say can you verify your information so I can update it in the system, an any reasonable person wouldn't be rude about old information that is medically necessary for treatment. Not trans. Might get some flack here but also hormones for cis women make em a Lil emotional at times... now imagine people in transition.  Everyone should stop being so touchy about others politely trying to do their jobs.
In fairness to the dr, and it‚Äôs a shitty system, but in my experience, medical stuff is a lot of confirming your info on record to make sure they have the right person. So if your deadname is still in the system as your legal name, that‚Äôs the name they need to have confirmed. Which, again, sucks majorly if it‚Äôs also a deadname that hasn‚Äôt had a chance to be legally changed. There are probably better and worse ways to handle asking the question, but they do have to ask or they‚Äôll be in trouble.
The receptionists opinion doesn't count. She's hired by the doctor or the organization she works for. Tell the doctor to change the record. If the name on your healthcard is your now legal name, they'll have a fucking hard time billing the system to a different name.
Like i am totally fine with people confirming my legal name and understand all that (even if it personally sucks for me). I am an adult so unfortunately there are many situations where I have to use my legal name (when like... paying my internet bill or getting a car insurance quote etc etc) and that is not what im talking about in this comment. 

im specifically talking about how in medical environments the staff use names as conversation starters and focus on them a lot as an easy way to connect with patients and how that feels as a trans person
Specially when they have to bill the government. During my last visit to the Endocrinologist, my govt issued health card was flagged. The receptionist asked me if the card was current (obviously it was, the expiration date was printed on the card). She mentioned it might happen if someone else's charges were billed to mine. I immediately came home after the visit and called the hotline. The person asked me some security questions, and said there's nothing wrong with the card, and the current version code was correct. She also said I could fill up a form to find out all charges billed to my health card number, and also the Endocrinologist' support to call them to take care of any error codes popping up.
Yeah I did, it just sucks that we have to deal with so much crap from healthcare in general. It got sorted but I‚Äôm so tired of it ya know
Oh I totally agree. I‚Äôm not trying to invalidate that at all. What I had in mind was like when I get blood work done, even if I‚Äôm dealing with the same person the entire process I have to confirm my legal name multiple times, which must be sucky as heck for people whose legal name is also their deadname. 

I also completely misread your original comment, and for whatever reason thought you were saying your deadname was ‚ÄòGerman‚Äô, not ‚Äòa name of German origin‚Äô. Which are two very different things!
Yeah I get regular blood tests, and the same person who just dealt with my paperwork at the desk will come back with me to draw my blood and  still go through me reconfirming name and birthdate. 

May I ask if your no preferred pronouns flair means you use all pronouns or would prefer no pronouns?
Oh okay, sorry. I was having a bad day yesterday and taking things people said the wrong way. 

But yeah i dont know which one she meant, it was extremely bizarre. She was a wild woman. She also called me a woman when talking about the effects of T and went on a ramble explaining why most doctors are afraid of anything to do with hormones bc they dont learn about it in school. It was a shitshow

Like my last name is literally of Germanic origin. My deadname is fucking french LOL. like if you wanted to talk about your german roots ma'am you didnt even have to deadname me... i have a silent D right there in my last name
Since I don't present 100% female as I just started on HRT, I let the person I deal with decide how they want to address me. I'm 58, and too old to get triggered for every small thing out there. Married to my HS sweetheart for 33years, two adult children 23F and 28M. I can never be 'mom' to them, and I don't want to. I waited till my responsibilities were complete, to start on HRT, with 100% support of my family. My family physician, Endocrinologist, and pharmacist are the best. My family physician did a change to the bloodwork requests identification panel, and now place where I get my bloodwork done don't even blink an eye when I present my provincial health card with my birthname. So yes, no preferred Pronouns, call me what you will. I'm on this journey now, for identity congruence, not to be bitch to everyone out there.

Roe v. Wade really has me worried for the future	"I know that the overturning of Roe v. Wade primarily affects cis women, which, fair enough, they are the ones most affected by this, but I've heard very little in the way of how this will affect people who are trans, specifically AFAB trans people.

I haven't had ANY type of affirming surgery to tie my tubes, remove my uterus, my ovaries; I'm not even on birth control yet, so I'm still very much capable of becoming pregnant. On top of that, I have no desire to have kids or raise a family in the first place. What happens if I do accidentally get pregnant after engaging with a partner? What happens if someone assaults me? Am I just gonna be forced to deal with the fall out all by myself? I'm left to fend for myself, forced to see through a pregnancy I never wanted, forced to raise a kid I never intended to have, forced into a life I didn't choose for myself? Is that it?

On top of that, this has me worried about other privacy based rights, like gay marriage and access to contraception, especially the second one. A big reason I was going to talk to my doctor about starting birth control was to hopefully stop my cycles all together, or at least lighten them, so it would help me better affirm my gender. But if the ruling behind THAT gets overturned as well, what am I supposed to do? I'm going up north for college, but when I come home, what am I meant to do? What if my state bans access to contraception while I'm gone? If I'm on the pill and run out, I can't get my prescription refilled. I can't get a new IUD or implant after my old one needs to be replaced. I can't get my shots at my next appointment. My cycle will come back, I won't have any protection against pregnancy, and not only will that wreck my gender affirmation plans, but also leave me feeling more vulnerable. There's nothing good about any of this, unless you're a die hard Christian who can't stand the idea that other people don't believe in the same things as you do and want to force your beliefs and way of living on everyone else, even if it means trampling on their rights in the process.

This all so scary. Trans men and transmascs get abortions, too, and now, depending on which state I live in, if something were to happen to me and I got pregnant, I might be forced to see that pregnancy through to full term. Just the mere THOUGHT of being viewed as a woman or a mother or anything remotely feminine in regards to healthcare viscerally disgusts and upsets me so much. I don't want this to be happening. I don't want this to be my reality, but it is. More than ever I wish I was just AMAB from the start so I wouldn't have to worry about or deal with all this shit."	"No no no no. It doesn‚Äôt primarily affect cis women. The immediate effect of overturning Roe v. Wade was  striking down protections for the right to get an abortion. However, let‚Äôs be clear, the Supreme Court didn‚Äôt make it about abortion. If it was about abortion, the opinion would have redrawn the line for when an abortion can happen and wouldn‚Äôt have mentioned same-sex marriage, contraceptives, and homosexuality. They didn‚Äôt do that. The Supreme Court made it about the right to privacy and bodily autonomy for everyone, not just people with uteruses.
Your worries are justified. Thomas in particular listed contraception as something that needs to be re-decided. There *is* concerted effort from some groups to ban most forms of contraception under the claim that they are really abortion.
I'm sorry, but my perspective from eu: ur fucked. Ur political system go so many small cracks and backdoors created by greedy capitalists, that it is disfunctuinal. And rn the symptoms are big enough to notice. I sadly don't think u can prevent this, but u could make it less bad. So never stop fighting. But ya ur voting system just broken on every lvl
Gl
Agreed! This ruling affects everyone and the time for sitting back and doing nothing is over. These people are coming for all of us and not even blue states are safe.   


Act up. Get involved.
In other words, the overturning of Roe is just the beginning of a massive rollback of rights and freedoms
Which is completely ridiculous, because the whole point of birth control is to prevent a pregnancy BEFORE it ever even happens; it doesn't work once you actually become pregnant
Assuming nobody stops them, yes.
Different birth control mechanisms work different ways. Some of them do not prevent fertilization but prevent implantation; the claim is that the ""child"" exists as of the moment of fertilization and anything that deliberately interferes with carrying to term from that instant is ""murder"" of the ""child"". Nevermind that it is not uncommon for fertilized eggs to not implant at the best of times. And nevermind that groups are deliberately misrepresenting how other birth controls work that actually prevent fertilization... And it is a wonder how many of the people arguing the fertilized-egg approach are also opposed to condoms...
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 882,793,478 comments, and only 174,190 of them were in alphabetical order.

US Judge blocks Trump policy allowing discrimination against trans patients	US Federal Judge freezes #Trump admin policy allowing discrimination in #healthcare for #transgender persons, in consideration of #SCOTUS recent decision. Further litigation inevitable, but the Judge expects the plaintiffs (the trans patients) will prevail [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/17/judge-trump-rollback-transgender-health-397332](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/17/judge-trump-rollback-transgender-health-397332)	"I don‚Äôt know why that man is so hateful
Wow my country sucks rn I wish I could tell the government I'm a fucking human too sometimes. I'm glad some people are looking out for us.
I am glad that despite all the chaos, we still get some justice, even if it is hard to find at times
This action in the District Court just buys us some TIME.  But Trump and Bible Boy Pence will very quickly come back and make another attempt to take away our healthcare rights if they are not REMOVED from power.  Imagine not having access to trans-appropriate healthcare.  THAT is exactly the GOAL of Trump and Pence.

Vote Trump OUT in November!
Hatred is typically born out of fear of the unknown or is taught. You choose if you want to get rid of the hate in your heart or not. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has chosen to embrace this hatred. He is so concerned about his own personal beliefs that he wants them to be enforced on everyone. Don‚Äôt worry though, he won‚Äôt win again.
The first step towards progress is the willingness to address the problem. My suggestion is not to hate the man, but offer a place where facts can be discussed and hopefully come to a compromise. But until then, keep fighting the good fight and love your fellow human. We can‚Äôt beat hate with more hate, but a little push might be needed to kick start the conversation toward progress."	ibq1jh	trans	91	0.98	2020-08-17 23:57:49
I'm absolutely lost	"Had to make an alt to talk about this because I didn't feel comfortable doing so on my main.

I'm 17, MtF, and just came back from a psychiatrist appointment. I've been using my psychiatrist to try and get an endocrinologist appointment (which I am trying to use to get myself an endocrinologist appointment for HTR) I had one for December 9th of last year but it was cancelled, and since our country has very poor trans healthcare services (Portugal) he was only able to get me an appointment about sexual identification so that I could try and have them move me to an endocrinologist...

No problem, I guess, stuff takes time and I'll take what I can get. But on my way home I had ANOTHER fight with my mother over my gender (they are frequent) she says she doesn't believe I'm trans, that my personality and who I am as a person aren't normal for a girl so I can't be trans?? That I haven't been taking the best care with my body, which isn't a female trait so I can't be trains?? She even said that she didn't care if my doctor told her if I'm trans because I'm smart enough to fake the test results so they'll say that I am trans!! I'm so fucking lost, she said she might not take me to my next appointment (I can't go there myself, it's hours away), she also said she won't help me with any sort of medication or treatments I might need.

What do I do? I'm 17, 11th grade, I want to go to university but if I do I won't be able to get money to pay for my treatments, even if I don't go to university how long will it take until I'm able to start doing what I need.

There's also my boyfriend.. in Australia, who I'm supposed to move with, but how can I get the money for that and all of these things? If I want to go to university I have to do it here in Portugal so it'll delay my transition even more, meeting him in person, and I'm not sure that either my mental state or our relationship will be able to hold that long.

Also to clarify I'm only out to a few friends and some family members, not to everyone around me, and I still dress and go out in boy mode every time. My father doesn't know because he's an old man and extremely transphobic so I don't want to deal with his reaction..

TLDR; I'm just lost, no idea what to do, where to go or how to make my life work out.. things are looking really dark"	"Not looking after your body is very common. I  have never had the best hygiene, because. . . . i felt disconnected. This was just some flesh lump i was chained to, sure i need to keep it running but why bother trying to look good or nice?  Now i‚Äôve realized it, im taking steps to look nice because i realize i can finally look how i want. 

I would consider- are you able to be yourself in university? Many universities are more open and accepting, so thats a possibility. I would also say that its easier to move countries by going to college in that country- perhaps you can start in portugal, and then transfer to an australian university?
If it weren't so important, her saying that you're not looking after your male body says you aren't female would be funny. 

The sad truth is that some parents can never be persuaded even with incontrovertible proof. They don't want to hear it. 

I don't know the Portuguese healthcare system, so I can only make guesses about what you might do. One possibility would be to try and get your next appointment on-line, as I would imagine that it's not till you get to the medication stage that they would need to take blood and the like. Otherwise you might need to wait for financial independence first. Sorry.
I'll say


1: Get things right with your mom. People don't know what being trans is invite her to talk to the therapist if he/she is down or just sit down and talk her into it. Make a good presentation about your feelings she for what you say may agree.



2: Therapy, University or boyfriend? I don't know. My feeling says that therapy should come first, then university but this on you to decide what's your priority in life



I wish you best of luck i feel you aren't in the worst position your mom sounds uninformed not transmophobic wich is great im sure you can work this out



*Virtual hug*
You might look into taking loans for university if you can. Way easier to get loans for education than any sort of financial help for trans stuff.

In fact, education loans are some of like the easiest loans to get - you aren't expected to have some good credit score or financial history, you are expected to be young and inexperienced and have like no income, and they are a pretty worthwhile investment on the other side because either the country is investing in its citizens and GDP, or a financial institution is making a long term investment with lots of money that is almost guaranteed to end up with a debtor who makes more money after. It's like a business loan where the business almost always succeeds. I'm not sure if it fucks things up with you going to another country, it very well might, but I'd see if there are ANY options for educational loans. Then you get both.

But maybe there is also services for trans people to help you out. I wish I could give you some examples but I haven't looked into this.

I'd do your research and see how you can get both things independently rather than pick between this good thing in your future versus this other good thing in your future.
Thank you very much! I don't know how and if I can transfer to a different university but I will try and get informed by asking at my school.
Thank you very much for the kind words, sadly no matter how many times I try to explain it to her she just won't accept it, she does act like she known about this sort of stuff, but I can tell her information is coming from incorrect sources.. won't believe me when I show her the proper information either though

Trans Men Are Men	"I've noticed that many people will performatively say ""trans men are men"", but they mean ""trans men are the same as cis men and, therefore, have the same societal power to oppress people that cis men do"". They assume that gender roles work the same way for trans people that they do for cis people. Yes, trans men are men, but we are TRANS men specifically. We're also oppressed by cis men, especially black, brown, and/or queer trans men. We're fighting for reproductive rights and adequate healthcare just like every other oppressed gender, yet we're excluded from feminist groups because they assume we're the same as cis men. Some trans men may pass as cis, but that doesn't guarantee we'll pass as straight or gender conforming - which means we don't have the same privilege as cis men. The first trans man to be elected in U.S. history, James Roesener, was voted into office THIS MONTH years after trans women and nonbinary people have been represented in government. Other countries have still never had trans men or transmasc people in government. Most cis people don't know we exist. Stop treating us like oppressors. Stop punching down. We can't punch down because we're at the bottom."	"It makes me mad when people say stupid stuff like ""i hate all men"" and i say (as a trans man) oh me too? and they say i dont count, it makes me think about 2 things  
 1. they don't see me as a man like other men,   
2. why am i even talking to this person  


I know its a small thing but even such a stupid and small thing as ""Oh this person doesnt hate me becasue of my gender? does this mean they dont see me as the gender they hate"" but it still makes me feel bad in many ways. :(   


thank you for reading sorry if this sounded weird
Thank you!  I have seen that in our community trans men and enbys get much less recognition than trans women. I love who I am, and it has really opened my eyes and heart to the rest of our community and I agree that we need to be much more equal in our representation. 
I hope for a better future for us all, and better understanding of the different aspects of being trans.

It's so fucked. Like gender societal value. Yuck. Life is hard sometimes. And seriously much love too cuz as an mtf I marvel at you guys ftm but also overlook your struggle. The can of worms that is masculine value is a mess as a whole.
I was talking to my transmasc pals about this exactly. Specifically how ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù is outdated as it doesn‚Äôt include the struggles of many trans women and trans men, as well as non-binary folks. There are ‚Äúwomens meetups‚Äù where the language inherently exclusionary towards transmasc people, for example. Imo the voices of trans men are some of the most important ones against misogyny and understanding the pitfalls of a strict binary society. I have so much love for y‚Äôall ‚ô•Ô∏è
I know my pal is ftm but thats only because i know them for a long time ..no one in his life now do, he is just a man..men are diverse in physique and type, same with women and personally as a man i never think oh wonder if this guy i am talking to us ftm...if he lives as, reacts and and is a man visibly to me then thats that. I think this is normal for cis men...only those uncomfortable with their own gender or sexuality i think react about ftm men.
No, I am a man specifically. I only say that I'm a trans man when it is necessary for the context like in medical situation or sometimes in trans communities. Otherwise, I am the same as cis men. I grew up with the same gender roles and sexism as cis men and I even enforced them more than most cis men would. I am your stereotypically masculine toxic guy and I used to be a huge sexist. While I don't think that men are superior than women anymore, I still have parts of my mindset back then and I am still able to oppress women. Being trans doesn't make me less capable of oppressing people. Society has no way of outing me unless I show them my genitalia, which I will not, so I hold the same power as cis men. Stop putting all trans men in a group, many of us are just the same as cis men in every way except for the sex transition.
I definitely don‚Äôt think trans men are at the bottom
I feel the same way. ""I hate men"" is 100% a TERF dogwhistle.
To be fair when I have my ugh men moment. I usually mean very specific men and not the men that have proven not to make me go ugh. I dunno how it is for others tho
Riiight, we're only at a higher risk of public sexual assault than cis women. We only experience both misogyny and misandry. Such privilege really.
Yep, they use misandry to justify their transphobia. They should just get a life

Why are we considered an afterthought?	"Lately I‚Äôve been feeling so frustrated and at times feel hopeless. I hope none of this is considered triggering but on the topic of abortion the trans community is hardly mentioned if at all. Even by the party that supposedly supports us. And for healthcare or anything else that impacts the trans community there‚Äôs not much people being outraged about it. At least it never makes much media attention. I know there are people who do fight for us but it just feels like many claim they support the trans community but forget about us until they are reminded of us.

And on a side note my pride center near me sends emails on events and one in particular was a lesbian meetup saying women only and in parenthesis trans women are welcome. I understand the language is meant to be welcoming but it really makes me feel like an afterthought like my title says. Maybe changing the way it‚Äôs worded would be good or maybe it doesn‚Äôt need to be changed. I could also be misinterpreting but just feel like garbage lately so my headspace might not be the best.

Sorry if this is a long post. Just tired of feeling like this and feeling like the whole world is against us."	"Trans folks have always been been on the front lines fighting for rights for the entire community (especially trans femmes of color) and the cis gays' response has generally been to act like we don't exist. I think they want to be accepted by the mainstream so bad that they're willing to step on us and ""make consessions"" for it to happen (I've also seen it in binary trans spaces in response to nonbinary/genderqueer folks). What people don't seem to realize is that if *anybody* can have their autonomy taken away, no one is safe
LGB..............T?
That‚Äôs one of the things that has hurt me most. Our enemies are our enemies, AKA the fascists who want to wipe us out of existence. But, I‚Äôm more hurt by progressives who have said NOTHING about the attack on the trans community. I‚Äôve been screaming about it to anyone who will listen. Even people who say they love me won‚Äôt do a single god damn thing about it. To say I‚Äôm bitter and hurt is an understatement.

And I do feel like the rest of the LGBTQ community has really not been on our sides either. Matter of fact, I feel like most trans people aren‚Äôt even doing that much, even when they‚Äôre told what they can do about what‚Äôs going on.
Trans people are an afterthought for cis society.

That includes for cis LGB people, feminist cis women, etc.
Don't fall into the trap of believing the Democrats are our friends just because they're the lesser of two evils. When Obama was president he said he'd codify Roe V Wade into law he didn't though simply because he was only using that promise as leverage to get votes, at the end of the day neither party cares about us.
Trust me, levels don‚Äôt mean shit in ow. I have a friend is like 200-300 levels higher than me. Tbh he is really bad at the game
This sounds like a cry for attention. Not everything is about us. Not everything needs our opinion. Sometimes it‚Äôs okay not to be the main character. More trans people need to realize that.
the lack of attention to our health care and bodily autonomy is extremely depressing
I agree and it‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôm just not sure how this could change for the better. Just so much hate and misguided fear lately in the world in general.
With friends like these who needs anemones?
Confused by the response here? Sorry for not understanding.
Sadly I feel like your right. I‚Äôve been feeling let down by it all. It hurts the most when it comes from people that say they support you but you see them just not mentioning the trans community at all. And not showing any support either.

I just feel like there‚Äôs not much any of us can do at this point. I tried and struggled to find hope but it just feels like nothing will change.

I‚Äôm so sorry you felt a similar way also. Thank you for sharing how you felt. I felt like I was the only one honestly.
bro, you sure that's the right post?üíÄ
tho true levels have no meaning in ow
It‚Äôs not about a cry for attention rather that so many people forget or exclude the trans community. Issues that affect the trans community needs to be addressed and spoken out about. When the trans community is erased from conversations it makes us invisible and not seen. Which is not good. If anything we need to be more vocal and inclusive in general.
okay but like we literally do need attention lol like our rights and the injustices against us deserve attention! what's wrong with that?

it's not about being the main character, it's about even being featured at all. or not being an extra in the background or a minor villain everyone hates

reproductive justice for trans people brings reproductive justice for cis folks with it. if we focus on reproductive justice for cis people only, it's much more likely they will get their justice without us getting ours (also true for the focus on white cis abled women getting rights while Black, indigenous, latinx, and disabled people who can get pregnant still get sterilized or have their kids taken away, in addition to now not having access to abortions)
this is a human rights issue. we dont want more movies made about us we just want to exercise bodily autonomy holy shit
I think it's a visual text representation of trans people being an afterthought.
Yes I put this in the wrong post lmao. I apologize
Oh I didn‚Äôt think of that but thank you for letting me know."	wh1s3i	trans	79	0.96	2022-08-05 17:50:35
Do people realize there will always be trans kids regardless, if you tell them about trans people or not?	"This is from my own personal experience I can‚Äôt say how common or uncommon something like this is. Also sorry for formatting I‚Äôm on mobile. 
So for some context, when I was about 7-8 I went from a girly girl to a tomboy because I had started feeling ‚Äúgross‚Äù in girls clothing. My mom wasn‚Äôt happy about it but, she was alright with it I guess because she let me do it. There was also the bonus that it was easier for me to shop and the boys section because I was a tall kid, which is why I think she let me do it in the first place lol. Anyway, that goes on for a couple years and I always have this kind of ‚Äú feeling‚Äù and I can‚Äôt place it, I don‚Äôt know what it is until one day, when I‚Äôm about 10ish. I buy ace bandages from cvs or something like that and I put it on under my clothes and get dressed. I don‚Äôt remember why I finally decided I wanted a flat chest bc this was like 13 years ago but I think it was to prank a cousin who was gonna visit?? Or whatever excuse I convinced myself it was lol I feel like I knew what I was doing before I realized it. When I saw myself in the mirror, something clicked and (surprise) it‚Äôs not that I like boys stuff, or that I behave boyish, or that I‚Äôm tomboy, it‚Äôs that I‚ÄôM a boy. 

I was 11, I knew I could NEVER tell anybody, and I had no idea what to do. I was convinced I was completely alone in this and that nobody would understand and I could never let anybody find out what I was actually doing  because I had no idea why I felt like this, I thought I was crazy because I was POSITIVE nobody else felt like this, nobody else could ever feel like this. I don‚Äôt even know how long it took for my mom to confront me on it. Could‚Äôve been 3 months to like 2 years because we fought about how I looked and dressed all the time at this point before she finally came out and asked me why I was making my chest flat and why my friends are calling me a different name and why people at school think I‚Äôm a boy and I lied to her and denied all of it. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and when I was 12-13 I came out to her by telling her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a boy.‚Äù She was clearly unhappy but she was like ‚ÄúI already knew.‚Äù 

And still at this point when I knew that I was a boy in the wrong body, enough to the point I came out to my mom without even knowing I was coming out to her. I still thought I was the only one like this. My mom was the first person I ever told and I still had no idea that being transgender was a thing, I didn‚Äôt even see or hear the word transgender until 2ish years later when I was almost 14. I had already been presenting as male for 4 years before I learned of even the concept of being transgender. Where the FUCK is this concept that trans people are ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù kids into being trans? There‚Äôs ALWAYS been trans kids and adults, and there always will be regardless of you tell them about our existence or not. All you‚Äôre doing is isolating these fucking kids so they have to hide themselves like I did because they think they‚Äôre alone and can‚Äôt tell anybody and stripping their access to the healthcare they need to live. I straight up wouldn‚Äôt be here if I didn‚Äôt get access to gender affirming healthcare when I did and even then it took to a failed suicide for my family to take it seriously. I fucking WISH I had heard about, met, or seen another trans person when I was a kid so I could‚Äôve done SOMETHING instead of always having severe behavioral issues that wouldn‚Äôt get any better no matter how much medication, therapy, counseling, etc I got until I magically started began improving when I started wearing boys clothing in the 3rd grade. I could‚Äôve skipped being terrified and suicidal and depressed for YEARS until I got the help I actually needed. None of these people having ANY care or concern for children it‚Äôs all complete fearmongering bullshit punishing kids for trying to be happy and live. The only thing this is gonna lead to is children being hurt and parents learning a very hard fucking lesson when they‚Äôre burying their kids."	"Very few people actually believe the LGBTQ community is turning kids gay and trans; the ""grooming"" they're always referring to is telling those kids it's *alright* to be LGBTQ. Trans kids have always existed and will always exist and I'm pretty sure even transphobes at least have the capacity to understand that. Transphobes would just rather those trans kids be confused and repressed and in the closet than be openly trans.
Not telling kids about queerness just makes it so they grow up thinking something is inherently wrong with them and makes them depressed and potentially suicidal. It‚Äôs like if you raised a black kid around only white people so they just thought they had some kind of skin condition but everyone told them they were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
What u/mysterydevil_ said.  They realize that there will always be trans kids, but they believe their magical sky daddy's book tells them that its wrong, so they'd prefer them to off themselves or repress it for their entire lives than to be happy in themselves.  There is no arguing with someone whose beliefs are rooted in dogma instead of logic.
Oh, they know we have always existed, and they have always used violence to keep us in the closet.
The other part is they want us to harm ourselves. That‚Äôs why the argument about dead children doesn‚Äôt gain anything. They know it‚Äôs true and it‚Äôs a feature and not a bug to them.
Of course there will and always have been Trans kids. The whole subject of Trans people have been handlet differently throughout many cultures.
When I read the paragraph following the head title, I recognized that that could have described me in the early 80's growing up in a Mormon household. But I'm MtF- the same concepts apply.

I had NO idea why I felt better dressed as a girl.
I thought I was the only one.
I had never heard the word ""transgender"" (back then it was called transsexual).
I had no language to describe the way I felt dressed as a girl.
I was forced to dance with a girl several times- once at a church dance and once at an inpatient mental health facility. I felt all gross and didn't want her to touch me.
I was expected to get married to a woman and have kids. No attraction to women at all- I don't know HOW to be attracted to women like straight men do.

We exist. We have ALWAYS existed. We will ALWAYS exist. And as long as physical sex and brain gender develop at different times during pregnancy, the possibility will always exist that they develop asymmetrically.

Statistically, the longer a system exists, the more likely improbable events become inevitable. A .5% chance of a child beong born transgender is going to be inevitable, seeing as how there are BILLIONS of people on this planet. In 1 billion people, at .5%, that's half a MILLION (500,000) transgender people.

Half a million people is not a tiny population.
This psychological conditioning effect us something that ears its head outside of LGBT issues. After she became the center of attention (and hate) as the first black student in a previously segregated white school, Ruby Bridges developed a habit when okaying with crayons of drawing black people as missing body parts and white people as whole.
As someone who never learned much of anything about quietness until meeting an lgbtq person j can confirm
Ugh... poor baby! :("	1142eci	trans	79	0.97	2023-02-16 22:00:15
Ellie's Master List of Trans Resources	"(Last Updated 2/12/2020)  


Hi Everyone!

This is a repost of my original guide that can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/bc4uuk/ellies_incomplete_master_guide_to_transitioning/) I am reposting it to give myself room to expand, as well as in the hope that more people will be encouraged to share things that they feel would be valuable to the list.

I'm writing this guide because during my early transition, and even now, I found it incredibly hard to find resources and find advice that was relevant to me, even with the help of our wonderful community. This guide represents my ambition to make sure that those that come after me aren't in a position of not knowing what to do, or where to look.

If you know any resources at all that would be valuable to this, please share! I spend a lot of time trying to look for these links on my own, but I'm just one girl. <3

Tips for being trans in Japan?	"I'm planning to move to Japan in a few years and I'm wondering how smoothly I'll be able to adjust over there. I'm non-binary transmasculine, just started T a little less than a month ago.
How does transgender healthcare work over there? Will I be able to continue HRT? (Also I'm on antidepressants, if anyone knows how to go about that too)
How are transgender and non-binary people understood and treated?
Anything else I should know??"	"I don't have any answers in particular but just know that Japan is a rather socially conservative nation and it may be challenging, at least at times, to receive gender affirming care or having your identity understood or respected. Japanese people are culturally very polite though so if you explain it to them they're likely to try to understand you and respect you.
Being trans in Japan is, at best, not a problem, and, at worst, a big fucking problem. You will not be celebrated. You will not be validated. You might be exploited.
According to Japan it's a disorder. Also you need to follow certain criteria to be recognised as your gender. By changing your genitalia, being unmarried/childless, 20+, and not have gonads or lack functional gonads.

If you can follow all of that your gender can be recognised and you can live peacefully your life... Well except some to a lot of social pressure which causes that people might take their lives out. Though the hardest time to live in Japan is I think the time when you are going to school. So the rest of the life there is easier
I don't know about the specifics of Japan, but if possible and desired, try to change your legal stuff \*before\* moving out, it'll save you a lot of hassle and potential roadblocks down the line.
I feel like there is some modern acknowledgement of trans people having seen references in some media, anime, etc. 

That being said, you may recieve better care if they see you as ""a guy who has to deal with low T""?

It may be pretty easy culturally to disappear into a crowd depending on how you present.

Let us know what you find out! I love Nippon and wouldn't mind returning someday!

üíöüôè
Japan is really only just getting around to handling gay rights and is no where near properly recognizing trans people. I‚Äôve lived there for a bit pre coming out and read/write/speak it and keep up with news, so I can tell you it‚Äôs not very comfy there for a trans person. My good friend‚Äôs brother has been living as a closeted gay man his whole life and has only now been able to come out to family and friends and he‚Äôs 40 something, and still not out to work or very public about his relationship. 

Want to go to the hot springs? You‚Äôre going to be put in with your AGAB and they won‚Äôt argue they‚Äôll just politely kick you out. Similar issues with restrooms and changing rooms. 

I don‚Äôt want to tell you that you shouldn‚Äôt go to Japan, but I do want to prepare you. It was actually one of the things I considered when I came out that I likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to be comfortable in Japan anymore and definitely couldn‚Äôt use the hot springs anymore, which was really disappointing.
Japan is conservative and what people are saying is true for a lot of Japanese people, but not everyone. Japan has a term for non-binary, x-gender. Some onsen or sent√≤ are starting to be more genderneutral. I want to move there more than anything. I'm not letting fear of transphobia stop me. I might have to make some compromises to be safer, but it would be worth it for me. 

I never thought about my antidepressants though. I'll have to look into that.
Look up a series hosted by Elliot Page called Gaycation. The show has an episode on Japan, and if IIRC you can pretty much not count on getting trans healthcare. LGBTQ issues are far behind most of the developed world. From what I remember the only place for trans people are these cross dressing night clubs. Also Japan is incredibly xenophobic in general. You'll probably commit a taboo without ever realizing it, especially being raised American. I don't mean to hate on Japan, I've always wanted to go myself for a vacation, but a vacation will more than likely be your best experience of Japan.
So, LGBT in Japan is a little different as a foreigner than as a local. Because it sort of gets written off as a ""foreigner thing,"" you are already an ""other"" so being gay trans or whatever doesn't really change a lot. 

That said, in Japan there are really 2 ways it tends to get treated. Either with surgery or as simply cross dressing. So just be ready for a lot of folks to not really get it.
I personally wouldn‚Äôt do the move, considering the cultural view of trans people in Japan. In time it may change, and I believe you should do what makes you happy, but the risks are to be considered.
He WILL be exploited too, their work culture is the worst of the world
Yeah, I am hoping to finish all that long before I go. It's difficult as a non-binary person because even in America we're not totally recognized. I've considered changing my gender marker to M if only to keep things simpler, tho I don't know if I'd even be able to do that üò£
I was just thinking about the hot springs and how I might have to miss out üò≠ thank you for the insight
Moving to Japan has been my dream for almost ten years now. I think I have a similar mindset, I'm moving there no matter what, I'll just have to learn how to navigate life there with a few added challenges (I mean, story of my life, constantly adjusting to new challenges!)
I hope we both make it there!!
It's not exploitation when everyone gets exploited /s
Just work at home for an European company, only comw out to enjoy the city without worrying about the social pressures
I feel you, I'm enby and my marker is F just to keep things simpler with awful bureaucracies.

Strange email	I just received this email from Mt Sinai. It gives off a strange vibe especially to consider a sudden ‚Äúregistry‚Äù given all the recent government moves to harm trans patients in the US. Be careful out there	"They have specific names of who to contact.  Just call up the medical center and confirm their employment and ask to speak with one of them to ask your questions. 

These are scary times, but we do need to be able to research this field if we are going to have a real fighting chance against those seeking to take away our rights.  Also, anything that can help improve treatment or help catch signs of those who will actually regret transition will benefit us all.
Thaaat looks like a phishing email. Do not trust it. Call the clinic and ask.
Check who it came from. This looks fake.
If it is real, despite trans health research being important it feels really dangerous to me right now to create a list of people who are trans. I wouldnt join, I dont trust people
It's bold of them to use the word registry. Seems exactly like something a total nerd would write. Ha!

I would definitely vet something like this before I agreed to it. I'm very much for better research on trans issues and metrics, but medical practitioners and researchers don't have a good track record when it comes to trans people. I suppose the good has to start somewhere, though. Be careful and be safe.
That seems sketchy af call the hospital and confirm employment for anyone named there do not call them directly
Fake. Real. The ‚Äúwe need to store your data in a registry‚Äù is a big ol‚Äô red flag.

So it‚Äôs getting a big NOPE from me. 

If it‚Äôs legit I‚Äôd be getting ALL my data away from that medical system ASAP. 

You‚Äôre right to be feeling weird about this.
It's also on their website. It's probably legit. It's the only real way researchers can get enough data to understand more about trans issues. (am not just closeted trans, but also a medical researcher)
given it says felix.castro, without capitalization and also not an organization name, I would agree with the others saying its a phishing email
It‚Äôs probably for research. Medical studies use patients for clinical trials or data, so they can publish evidence based practice
Cybersecurty analyst here.
That's fake.
Please call the hospital directly to verify, do not use any numbers that may be in that email as attackers will swap them for their own numbers. Google the number for the hospital (or grab it from any paperwork you may have). The hospital wouldn't be sending email from a personal address, and I'm pretty sure in the background it has no subject as the title unless your preview is over some other emails you've got.
Aaaaay, this is something I deal with at work. I'm not familiar with this specific registry, project, or doctors, but I can give you a general idea of what they are talking about. (Assuming it's a real registry/study, and not a scam email)

Basically this has to do with medical research, and they are asking you if you want to participate. They cannot do anything with your information unless you actively contact them and very clearly consent to be in the registry. So if you are not interested in participating it is safe to ignore. You can't be opted in by lack of response.

A registry in this context is basically a large database of patient information specifically for research. The one I deal with the most in my job is a large registry of tumors, and all of the information that could be used to identify who the patient is has been removed before the data was stored in the registry. To my understanding this is more common, because storing identifiable patient information is a pain. Registry data can be used over and over for multiple studies, so participating in a single registry relating to transgender healthcare can enable you to potentially assist dozens of studies to improve transgender healthcare.
If it were mount Sinai their name would not be felix.castro in gmail. Prob gonna get your data stolen/puter hacked
I would love to see an update on this.
I am a patient at Mt. Sinai.  I received the same message on my patient portal.  I thought it was a bit odd as well, but I strongly support research in to Trans medical issues and have participated in a study previously.  I do agree that the idea of any kind of ‚Äúregistry‚Äù is weird and scary though.
Even if real, do you want this information easily obtained under a President DeSantis administration after he is sworn in after January 2025? Because it could happen. I am not trying to scare you. I am trying to prepare you.
Where I live we have our own patient portal. And my doctors are the only ones that can interact with me through the portal . I would not trust anything like this.
Even if this is real (call and confirm), ask specifics. Depends on your state as well‚Äîif this is Florida, Texas, etc., could especially be a danger. 

However, it‚Äôs important to inquire WHERE the data is going. To the state gov? Or other health pros? 

Also try calling mount sinai in other states, or other major hospitals to confirm if this is safe.
That‚Äôs weird so they‚Äôre trying to make who‚Äôs transitioning public knowledge they‚Äôre trying to unsealed that information. That‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm getting because at least for me I got help or I am getting help still in the process of changing my name and my gender marker and all that and the lawyer said she could probably most definitely get you know all that stuff approved, but the judge is a little bit of a person against trans people and would probably refuse the seal the documents which means anyone could just go online if they chose to and look up that I change my name and all that it‚Äôs public knowledge
This is likely a phishing scam.

Especially as it came from a named person rather than an official account. Something to note is that Project Veritas and similar shitbags like Matt Walsh have been doing this for the last few years.
Definitely looks like a Scam I go to CTMS and didn't receive that Email! I'm currently doing laser treatment at CTMS for my upcoming surgery with Dr Jess Ting April 26 2023 You should reach out to CTMS TO confirm and make them aware that someone is sending out emails if it is a scam so that they could let current patience know what going on!
Yeah don‚Äôt sign that. Just delete the email, thats creepy as fuck
Catch signs of those who actually regret transition... 

This was the whole reasoning behind the medical gatekeeping that kept me from accessing HRT for a decade of my adult life 

I don't like how the conversations are moving even in our own community back to medical gatekeeping
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099405/

This is a small study (less than 10k) but it IS peer reviewed and cited with research detains. 

Out of 7928 people, LESS THAN ONE PERCENT (0.97%) regretted their Gender Affirming Surgery. And most of those who did regretted it for social reasons like discrimination. And this is ONLY surgeries. This is not counting HRT. 

The idea that there are swaths of people who are regretting transition is, plain and simply, false. And anyone who spooks that rhetoric is no ally of the community. The insane amount of hoops and gaslighting doctors put us through is discrimination. Plain and simple.
And this is precisely why I am not getting mental healthcare directly from the state where I live through their county services.
If the data was stored anonymously (ie. no identifiable information) i wouldn't think twice. I would call the hospital and confirm the email is legit though.
Gate keeping to some extent exists in much of medicine for multiple reasons, some not good.  But there is a difference between what the original standards of care were and other medical diagnostic  screenings.  The old standards were from a strict cishet misogynistic worldview.  I am saying we can find a path for both informed consent methods and diagnosis of medical necessity. Part of both should present data on known factors that lead to detransition.  I want the ""I wasn't warned and just rushed through "" narrative to be either actionable and provable neglect or verifiable fabrication, not a tool to deny anyone else access to care.
Yes, definitely confirm it is legit before participating (if you are even interested, it's okay if you are not)

I‚Äôm not going down without a fight	TW: suicide mention. I‚Äôm sure everyone on trans reddit has heard the news about Missouri, and unfortunately for me I live in that hellhole. I‚Äôm lucky enough to already be on T, which right now means that I‚Äôll get to stay on it, but if Republicans are willing to go this far then who knows what they‚Äôll do next. The way things are going, I‚Äôll already have to look out of state for top surgery, and all day long I‚Äôve been alternating between panic and numbness at the thought of being detransitioned. For a while now I‚Äôve been looking at all the genocidal laws being passed around the country and thinking that if I can‚Äôt transition I‚Äôll kill myself, but now that that‚Äôs looking more and more likely I‚Äôve realized that for the first time in a long time, I give a shit whether I live or die. I‚Äôve improved so much in the short time I‚Äôve been on T and I‚Äôve been so excited to see more changes come, and I‚Äôm not going to let them take that from me. Whether it means going out of state for healthcare, moving in with one of my sisters in a blue state, or just hunkering down here and waiting out the storm, I‚Äôm not giving up that easily. I‚Äôm going to take the energy I‚Äôve used to hurt myself in the past, every bit of anger and spite, and direct it toward surviving, because fuck doing Republicans‚Äô dirty work. If they want me to die, they‚Äôll have to kill me themselves.	"Too angry to die is my vibe too.
I'm right here with ya bud this place seems like to be getting worse all the time but I try to remind myself that we got folks trying to look out for us like the HRC and ACLU and whatever others have been trying to help out around here so I don't feel so fucked about being stuck here (that and at least we aren't Florida)
Republicans are not going to be in power for the next 20 years. They have pissed off so many people with their bullshit, How did it go for them last time? BAD. HAs their bullshit gotten any better? NO> The majority of Americans are beginning to believe they've lost their qanon minds and don't ever even think about voting for them again. Next election cycle when they lose so bad, they have to take up arms and have a real insurrection. The pendulum swings both ways so just hang on till 2025. If Dems can rid the congress of enough of them we can right the ship and go after the haters of democracy and actually do something about these criminals.

Until then be safe.

Exactly this. These lawmakers know what they are doing is unpopular, not to mention none of these laws will pass legal challenges. The problem is that the courts are slow and we have to suffer this nonsense until they are resolved.

Yesterday my dad (who‚Äôs usually supportive) told me that I should concede on the issue of trans women in sports because it ‚Äúhurts the trans rights movement‚Äù	I was trying to explain to him about how Kaitlin Jenner is transphobic even though she‚Äôs transgender herself, and I brought up a lot of issues the trans community has with her, including her opposition to trans women in sports. My dad said he thinks it‚Äôs best for trans people to concede on that issue and focus on more important things. While I agree that things like healthcare are more important, banning trans women from women‚Äôs sports is still discrimination. He also deadnamed and misgendered Kaitlin the whole time even though I repeatedly corrected him. Even though I hate Kaitlin Jenner it‚Äôs still wrong to deadname and misgender her. Now I‚Äôm rlly upset and kinda mad at him but I don‚Äôt wanna talk to him about it bc Ik it‚Äôll just make me more upset. I felt so unheard and now I feel like I don‚Äôt trust him to support me as much as I did	"Sounds like he doesn‚Äôt understand that it will not end with sports. They will use it as ‚Äúproof‚Äù to say we are  too dangerous to be around cis women, and call it basic biology.
You are obviously completely correct about trans inclusion, Jenner being shitty, etc. I would just remind yourself that its super unlikely your dad will change his mind no matter what you say on this issue. Sometimes people have to compromise in order to maintain a relationship; sometimes people choose to end relationships. That decision is up to you.
Never give an inch. It took no time at all to go from sports bans to health care bans.
He, like many moderate people, doesn't understand how bigotry works: let bigots discriminate an inch, they'll take a mile. 

It's not even something little, it's destroying trans athletes' careers because of ignorance and fear.
Jenner is not the messiah of trans people. Most of us hate her.
People still watch sports?
The dad might be a fan of Kaitlyn Jenner. Sounds like it, at least."	ueud69	trans	66	0.96	2022-04-29 20:07:22
Just got denied for free health care :/	"Considering I don't make a lot of money, and I'm currently supporting two it was my hope for getting hrt. (Mainecare covers that stuff) 

apparently I make just a little too much to be considered and now I feel lost. I had a plan for when I got healthcare, but nothing for this outcome. 

How did all you all first start HRT? The process seems daunting."	"I started with plume. I think all together including meds, it was like $125 a month and they were really really amazing to work with. I told my story to someone who understood, I forget my counselors name but he was great. Like after a lifetime of dysphoria, all it took was about $100 and a video chat? Heck yeah. Good luck.
Aren't you required to have insurance under the ACA?  
Depending on who you sign up with and what plan you get, some HRT should be covered (although I'm still figuring that out myself.)  
If your income is that low, there should be subsidized plans as low as free, although they will probably have pretty high deductible and copays.
Called a bunch of places, got put on waiting lists. 

Complained to my overpriced therapist, he suggested trying Planned Parenthood. 

Hemmed and hawed for a while before calling up PP. Got an appointment for about 10 days after my call. 

Walked into PP 10 days later, walked out a few hours later with a script for HRT sent to the pharmacy. Everyone at PP was fantastic to work with. Extremely friendly and affirming and took as much time as I needed to go through things. 

Getting the pharmacy to fill the script on time has been a different story.
So sorry about it :(
So healthcare in the US won't cover stuff if they think you have enough money to pay for it?
You should still contact PP in Maine and see about their fee structure.  If you can afford the out of pocket test / consult you can get the prescription from them.  

Then with GoodRX or wiseRX or whatever prescription discount program you can probably get HRT for not too much money.  I think oral E is really really cheap, and so is Spiro with those programs fully out of pocket.

I think this is a better plan than plume if you're strapped for cash personally.
Ugh I hate that for you =/ it's so dumb that they just draw an arbitrary line and are like ""If you make a penny under this you can't afford X, but if you make a penny over you can!"" like life and personal finance doesn't have a butt load more nuance than that üôÑ
assuming you are in the US, most planned parenthood locations offer hrt with informed consent, and they offer financial assistance if you need it. my appointment (for T) was less than $200 without insurance, although it may be more if you need bloodwork or things. and follow-up appointments are usually cheaper.
Oh man really? Like lost your insurance? What state are you in?
> How did you all first start HRT?

I called the gender health clinic with my insurance provider and signed up for it. Spoke with one of their social workers a few days later to talk about my goals and just kind of start a dialogue. Followed up again with said social worker after a week or so to go into further details about where I was at and what I wanted to pursue treatment-wise. Got a few recommendations for new primary care providers with trans health training. Made an appointment with said PCP at the earliest opening, roughly 3 weeks from then. Went to PCP appointment and talked about wanting to start HRT, left with informed consent forms and another appointment a week later to return them and get my prescription. Went to that appointment, turned in my paperwork, left with my prescription and picked it up on the way home.

And that‚Äôs pretty much it. Took about a month from the initial inquiry to get my hormones and in total I paid ~~$30~~ for the copays, and I think $9 for the estradiol at that point.

Edit: now that I think about it more I paid less than I thought because I emailed my signed forms and my second appointment was a phone call. There‚Äôs no copay on virtual appointments, only office visits. 

This was through Kaiser. It was super easy and not very gatekeepy. Maybe a *tiny* bit in the sense that they just want to make sure you know what happens from taking hormones and are sure it‚Äôs the right choice for you. 

No therapist required, no initial labs because it wouldn‚Äôt change the starting dosage anyway, no endocrinologist visits unless you have an anomalous test result that requires a specialist‚Äôs point of view. Super easy and super cheap all things considered.
Try your local LGBT center if you have one, also there is another called folx healthcare I think online
I was looking at plume, but now I'm gonna consider it further!

thank you!~ üòå
One of the only things the Republicans were successful in repealing in the ACA was the individual mandate.
Thank you~

I don't really have the money to pay for healthcare, so I applied for free healthcare and they denied me on the basis of making a few hundred dollars more than the income limit >_>
It does suck, I think it's a lot harder when you're young and single.  When your an adult with unemployment and children and a spouse it's much easier to qualify! Haaaaa...

Believe it or not it used to be even harder.  I got denied when I was in college because... I don't even remember.  I owned a motorcycle and had like $2000 in the bank or some shit.
Maine. I haven't had health insurance since I lived in Staten Island.
As I understand, they didn't repeal it as much as they stopped enforcing the penalties. But I thought Biden reversed that.   
I guess I was wrong.  
Some states do have their own individual mandate: California, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  
Still, as the ACA does exist, everybody should sign up for insurance. The subsidies can be huge if your income is low enough.
Oooh got it :(
I really hope you can find a way <3
I'm trying too lol
Literally a couple hundred dollars too much?

I really hate how dumb things can be.
I‚Äôm so sorry. Look into the funds or scholarships you can apply for through trans programs online to help out
Problem is that sometimes there are some crazy hoops to jump through and there are some sharp cutoff points. Was chatting with someone earlier today that missed the cutoff for their state's medicaid by $300 per month.
aw, good luck sis ‚ô°Ô∏é
The income limit is 1,400 monthly and I make 1,900. it's so fucking stupid.
thank you :) i hope everything works out for you too ü•∫
Hard limits like that are just terrible and it really sucks that you're having to deal with this BS. 

Back of the napkin math and you're making about $4000 per year too much money so you get no help whatsoever? Meanwhile, insurance for a single parent and two kids is probably going to be $1000+ per month."	tycdyt	trans	63	0.94	2022-04-07 12:51:13

Damn, us Americans are envious of your system. Here in America trans healthcare is...yea.
I was buying direct from Thailand.
Was using too many characters - but yeah it‚Äôs a lot safer and it‚Äôs essentially the same stuff you‚Äôd get from the NHS but pay for, I made my app a couple of days ago and just had a information gathering video call with them about 30mins ago for 40mins.

Thank you so much üòä
I feel you :S America is a beautiful country, it‚Äôs just a real shame how expensive it is for any form of medical care. I hope soon though you get some whether Bernie gives it you in the future or someone else.
Are hormones not publicly funded in the UK?

Three year wait list to get seen before you can get those hormones x
Thank you, hope you manage to sort out the issues you have with them or find something better for you x
Oh geez, how long has that been the case? Here in New Zealand I thought the six week wait list was long, and that's *after* the number of enquiries more than doubled after many more people discovered themselves in lockdown.
Prior to lockdown it was bout a two year wait list but has been like this for ages (I think it‚Äôs more about what area you live in England depends on wait list times too)"	nvzgde	trans	61	0.97	2021-06-09 16:05:56
My GP is willing to discuss accessing HRT privately!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è	"For some needed context: I live in the UK, and to access gender affirming healthcare through the NHS (our public healthcare provider) there is a waiting list of several years for a first appointment.

Willing GPs can prescribe hormones under the guidance of private clinicians in the meantime, and although it's a gamble, I've ended up lucky to have a GP that's willing to consider it.

I feel so happy knowing that I may be able to access feminising hormones in the next few months!! I'm super excited and nervous, knowing I'm about to take my next big step after socially transitioning. 

Much love to all the trans people out there who through various circumstances can't access the healthcare they need. Hold on to what you know is best for you and keep moving forward <3"	"May I ask a process question?

I have accessed HRT in Australia under an informed consent paradigm. I am paying the doctor privately but my scripts are heavily subsidised through out pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so I'm paying $7AUD per script.

Is there no similar scope in the UK?
My GP has been unwilling, looking t changing GPs
Good luck, currently just started the process as well and my gp was very willing thankfully.
There is no informed consent here. Either wait for to be seen for gender dysphoria by the NHS, approx 5 year waiting list. Or get a private diagnosis of gender dysphoria, then see an endocrinologist who will assess your blood tests and work out dosage and what medication to put you on. Then see your gp (nhs doctor) who should write you the prescription providing the doctors you have seen are credible professionals. 

Some GP's have been known to make this difficult tho although there is guidance for them that this shared care approach is what they should be doing if its requested.

I am currently going through this process and hoping to start HRT sometime in September :)
That seems like the best bet. I wish there was an easier way around it. Wishing the best for you <3
Thank you so much!! Best of luck to you too :)

Inequality in the trans community	"This is written from a South African perspective. 

It is common knowledge that the legacy of apartheid lives on. One of the worst ways this manifests itself if in medicine. The colour of one's skin can often determine whether or not they will get medical treatment of a good  quality,and in some cases,medical treatment at all. 

The vast majority of transgender youth who have bee able to medically transition in South Africa are white. The reason for this is mostly socio-economic. Historically,those who are white have always possessed  a lot more material wealth,and this has made private medical care more accessible.  We have not had to go through the struggle of shitty state healthcare in provinces like KwaZulu-Natal,and wait for ages only to be given Premarin instead of something bioidentical. Generally,we have been able to afford travel,and we have been able to come to terms with who we are because of access to the internet(which many South Africans  do not have) as well as less progressive schools usually being those in poorer areas. 

This is by no means fair or just. I am not proposing a solution,because I do not have one. I am simply highlighting  what I have seen"	"I haven't the first clue about anything to do with South Africa, but sadly you see stuff like this (perhaps not on the same scale) most countries in the world.

Even here in the UK where gender affirming healthcare *is* available on the NHS, the wait lists for it are absolutely absurd - to get it in even a semi reasonable time frame costs absurd amounts of money.
Yeah,the UK is an absolute  hellhole for trans people. The NHS is well-resourced (would be even better resourced if the Tories weren't  in power),but despite that,yeah,the waiting lists are absurd. This is not for pragmatic reasons. It's about deprivation and bigotry,bit at the same time having the excuse that at least they allow it....sorry for the incoherence."	ubm2oh	trans	55	0.89	2022-04-25 14:11:20

Welp, looks like I have a prescription for estradiol now!	I went to talk to a doctor about HRT yesterday. This was the first time I've spoken to any healthcare providers about transitioning. Apparently my provider uses informed consent: the doctor just asked me about my transition goals and what medications I thought I want, then ordered some bloodwork and wrote me a script! Holy crap! Picking up my E from the pharmacy tomorrow!	"Congrats!
You're on your way now!  ‚ù§Ô∏è

Approaching 1st HRT anniversary	"I'm 11.5 months on HRT and I look different. My body is different. I'm about to legally change my name. I'm out to everyone now (except my family; who abandoned me years before I came out for being generally queer). People know me, think of me, remember me how I look now, they know me as me, with this name. It all hit me earlier today...I'm doing it. I'm living my life comfortably. I'm jogging in the city park in a sports bra. Im walking the dog in a crop top. I'm confidently going about my business. People say ma'am and miss, and honey and sweetie to me. It's kinda surreal how all the changes quietly started coming together almost without notice. I'm so happy that I literally forgot to overanalyze myself. It's also surreal to consider that this is probably like the baseline for cis people.  The things we can take for granted, you know? Transitioning saved my life. Helped me enjoy my life. Denying access to trans affirming healthcare to trans children is morally repugnant and tantamount to torture. We don't want to ""trans"" your kids, we want trans kids to survive. Don't deny this life saving experience to the people who need it most.

 Trans Liberation Now!"	"Inspiring words. Gives me hope for my future transition goals.

So grateful to read this kind of post even if we have a long journey to finally get into real equality for all the trans community around the world.

Good for you <3
Ok this post made me happy. Starting HRT in the Spring, and i feel terror for the unkown, but fuck maybe it can be done, and I should let it happen naturally, not overthink it, sigh!

My therapist said being trans is a choice UPDATE & QUESTION	"Hi y‚Äôall! I posted some months ago a topic in this sub regarding my coming out to my uneducated and quite transphobic therapist. It kinda blew up and had quite a lot comments, for what I feel truly grateful for, since it really made me feel valid and less lonely. Because of this, I feel like it would be justified to give you an update, especially since quite a lot has happened over the past couple of weeks. So in case you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôll give an overview of the weeks after my coming out. 

Let‚Äôs start with the bad news ig. After coming out to my therapist, I got kinda pressured into coming out to my (transphobic) parents, which I eventually did. It didn‚Äôt really go great unfortunately and I was forced to live for some time with my friend to be able to finishing school. I‚Äôm, however, home rn, due to the summer break, so yeah. Things aren‚Äôt great atm, but at least my parents calmed a bit down in the meantime so I feel save enough to stay. I do have quite a lot of support from my school (I‚Äôm in high school), which I‚Äôm really thankful for, so I‚Äôm optimistic for things to become better as soon as school starts again in a few weeks from now. 

Talking about school, after I came out to my parents I actually decided with my school counsellor to change my name in the school system and at school to my own (chosen) name. I didn‚Äôt really thought of it as an possibly due to my parents, but since I already ended up coming out to them, it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue anymore. I‚Äôm a bit worried regarding the reactions from my schoolmates, but apart from that I‚Äôm happy to be able to be myself a bit more at school.

Regarding the therapist mentioned in the post, I actually succeeded in leaving her. I just turned 18, so I finally have full responsibility now of my own healthcare. I‚Äôm currently on a waiting list for a new therapist, which isn‚Äôt ideal considering the current circumstances, but yeah, I‚Äôll survive ig. Waiting lists, especially in de psychological health care, are kind of a problem here in general.

So yeah, this is where we stand a few months later ig. I still want to report, like you recommended, somehow my previous therapist due to her outdated views on transgenderism, but atm I don‚Äôt really know how and where to do this, since I don‚Äôt want her to be able to lead it back to me (if that makes sense). If anyone knows how you could report a health caregiver (In The Netherlands), while staying anonymously, And would like to share it, it would be really appreciated.

Apart from that, I (again) want to thank you for your support on my original post, and I hope things will get better for all of us, someday,  in the future:)

Roe v Wade and Prescription Meds	"Perhaps it was naivete, perhaps it's exhaustion from this life-consuming fuckery afoot at all levels of the government, but I didn't see this coming while we were falling down the ladder of depravity. 

The news/ word on the street is that lists of drugs that will be banned for anyone that has ""female"" on their ID are being passed around to pharmacists by state governments in anticipation of anti-abortion bills becoming active. 

The position that the christo-fascists are taking is that any drug which has miscarriage as a potential side effect could possibly be ""abused"" to cause an abortion, thus should be banned for women. This affects so many medications, from blood pressure meds to fucking SSRI's. I also have a lot of additional concern for our trans men and transmasc population that testosterone could fall under this list while transgender rights to healthcare in these christo-fascist states are still being mitigated. 

It's most likely that a pharmacist will still only be able to go off of the gender marker on your ID. I'm sorry that I don't have more information. Not much is out there on this right now, and we won't know the full list of banned medications in the states that are implementing these bans until it's too late. The clock is winding down for states with trigger laws. 

Look up your medications *now*. See if miscarriage is listed as a possible side effect. If you're in one of these red states, check with your pharmacist to see if they will give you *any* info about the medication bans for those ***apparently*** unlucky enough to have ""F"" on their ID. Fuck this country.

Any trans people working in Healthcare?	"I'm considering taking a primary care paramedic cert because I was in a crisis not too long ago and Ireally want to help people. My biggest concern is how ill be treated (by patients and coworkers.) My voice doesn't exactly pass (I'm MtF) and I know it can be a high stress job, but I'm willing to go through it. I'm thinking about becoming a psychiatric nurse later down the line when I have more money saved.

Just curious if any other trans people have experiences in basically any healthcare job because damn it feels lonely."	"I'm a CNA in a psych unit who came out at work. I've seen nothing but support throughout the hospital even when I floated the first day after coming out everyone in the ED used my name and pronouns. My voice doesn't pass either and patients can sometimes get confused by my gender, but I feel more free to face the stress of the job now that I'm not stressing in the closet. I hope you have as good an experience as I did.
I work as a phlebotomist in a hospital, and we have nurses and physicians here that are trans as well. People have been supportive,  though I have been stared at in the bathroom quite a few times (but then again that happens other places too). The staff i work with have all been polite and supportive! It can sometimes get awkward with patients, but there are also trans patients and it's nice to help them feel more comfortable. 

I remember waaaay back when I first started hrt I was terrified, but my nurse told me she was trans and I felt much more relaxed and comfortable
I honestly think that it's incredibly important that people like you go into health care. You're the kind of psych nurse I hope that every trans patient gets to encounter, and I really hope that you pursue it! 

While I don't work in the field, I do work in a caring profession (teaching) and I've found that being visibly trans doesn't seem to negatively impact my relationship with parents or students. Maybe your voice will never pass completely, but I'm not sure that it'll matter. Passing seems to matter most in situations where you encounter people as strangers; when you have any kind of relationship with them, especially a professional one, it seems to matter a whole lot less. And while I haven't met any other trans people in my profession to compare notes, I have encountered a couple of trans doctors, and it seems that their visibility enhances their ability to care for patients instead of restricting it. 

Good luck to you! I really hope that it works out!
my doctor is trans. idk how she gets treated by others though. but yeah it'd be cool to have more trans people in healthcare so people feel safer coming out and transitioning
I'm actually getting certified to be a Peer support specialist
Trans/NB doctor here, I‚Äôm only partially out professionally but my colleagues have been really supportive. I‚Äôve thought a lot about this kind of thing, and it sucks being early to the party but we have an opportunity to show those around us that we exist and that trans people do grow up and have careers and function in the world. Im still not bold enough to be fully me every day but I‚Äôm finding less overt pushback than I expected.
I don't work as a paramedic but do work in the health sector.

There will always be assholes but honestly they are such a small group compared to all of the amazing people that are respectful. Plus it's always a powerful moment to have a trans person come in and instantly feel seen and see a wave of comfort come over them.

So honestly if your heart is in it and you can cope with the occasional asshole you will be fine
[removed]
In general i would say heathcare environment is supportive now, at least on an institutional policy level. Its not driven by protecting employee rights however but on protecting patient rights. As with anything regional differences remain, as well as if its a unionized hospital or facility. I think because of lawsuits trans patients are treated with outward respect at most large hospitals/clinics now - probably more from a fear of litigation. Staff wise, you‚Äôll see as education level decrease you‚Äôll invariably see more ignorance and biased view. Also with increased age, as trans issues have not been broached at all in med school until relatively recently. I think the difficulty in all honesty will be from patients if you‚Äôre on a patient sided occupation. They in general can be a pain to deal with and it will be your job to treat them with respect even when they show you none.
i work in a hospital as a nurse (ftm). most of my  colleagues at work dont mind / never said anything bad about it. on the other hand theres not much time to talk shit about each other as our work is often very stressful

younger patients are all usually nice to me, its just the older patients (70+) who  sometimes get unfriendly or are making weird comments/jokes
I‚Äôm an enby femboy. I was a firefighter before I moved states, am currently working at a Cancer research institute/hospital, and will soon be back firefighting soon if I did well on my most recent test
Trans here working as something like a nurse specific for older people (we have own apprenticeship in Germany for it). At first I thought I was non-binary and I changed my working place to another retirement home (due to other reasons). For the job interview, I chose my chosen name and explained then why I have a different name on my ID Card and all. They where all super supportive! They asked me which changing room I prefer or if I need a separat Toilette and all. Now, I found out that I am a transman. I told my working tutorial about it and again, she was super nice, told me how good I look as a a man and all. When she is fit again, I will tell my boss about it, with my totural.

For the patient we have. I work nearly only with dementia patients, so for them it is a bit more difficult. But I don't mind that. When I can look more masculin, they call me he, when I look more feminine, they call me she. If I explain that to them, they are kind but thanks to the dementia, most of them can't remember that. They friends and family on the other hand are supportive and nice again.
Thank you, this is very reassuring.

Dad of a trans son!	"Just want to start by saying I love my 13 y/o son, and couldn‚Äôt be more proud of him for coming out to my wife (34f) and I (35m)! We‚Äôre here for him in any way that he needs, and want to help in his journey.

He came out to us as a boy last November, and ever since, we‚Äôve been doing our homework to make sure we know as much as possible to help keep him happy and informed. He‚Äôs been seeing a LCSW for quite a few years, and his LCSW is very supportive. According to our son, he‚Äôs been feeling this way for a few years, and slowly been doing his own research. After he came out to us, his grades skyrocketed, he became much more outspoken and open, and his sense of humor has really started to shine! He‚Äôs now very open with us about his perceptions, feelings, and what‚Äôs on his mind. Even before he came out to us, he cut his hair real short, prefers to shop in ‚Äúboy‚Äù sections of clothing stores, and we got him his first set of binders yesterday after much homework as a family.

He came out to his biological mother (my ex-wife (40f), bitter divorce, divorced for 10 years, share 50/50 custody) about a month after us. He already has a strained relationship with his mom, but she refuses to acknowledge him as ‚Äúhim‚Äù - she dead-names him daily, even when he corrects her, and treats this as a phase. His relationship with his mom deteriorates by the day, and his LCSW is going to inform bio-mom that if it gets worse, she will recommend to the courts that our son primarily stay with us - which is what he‚Äôs wanted for the past few months.

My wife and I have been doing our homework on puberty-blockers, hrt, surgeries, the whole gamut. I‚Äôm full-time military, so with our healthcare, we set him up with adolescent medicine, which will help provide the appropriate resources (behavioral health, GP, psychiatrist, etc.) to help him in his transition. We want to be there for him in any way that he needs, so I jumped on this sub to be better informed, and I‚Äôd be a bad parent if I didn‚Äôt ask:

What should my wife and I consider? Anything we need to look into more? 
Any recommended reading, websites, books? Anything to recommend to his pediatrician? Terms I should and shouldn‚Äôt use? Advice for dealing with the bio-mom?

Thanks so much for any advice - this community is so beautiful, and for those of you who need a dad - I‚Äôll be your transparent (cheesy dad jokes included)!"	"I honestly can't see much more to be done -- you're doing very good! Keep standing up for him when people deadname him or misgender him, listen to him and how he feels.

There's one thing I'll point out just in case: if you have to discuss health/anatomical changes, you can ask him if there are words or terms that make him uncomfortable so you can adapt your language -- for instance I know some guys who are uncomfortable with the word ""breasts"" and prefer referring to that as their chest. It really depends on the person.

Other than that, I don't believe I can think of anything else. Keep being an awesome dad and supporting your son, it's very heartwarming to see. I'm glad your son is doing better and better. It's obvious he feels supported and happy. It's wonderful.
Sorry I don't really have much advice to give you but I just had to comment.
As someone with *very* transphobic/homophobic parents this kind of post is very refreshing and makes me so happy. Since I didn't have the best relationship with my parents (to put it lightly lol) it's so nice to see such an amazing and supportive family. From what I can tell you and your wife are already doing a wonderful job helping your son. Keep up the amazing work and I hope everything goes well for all of you!
I think anyone would be proud to call you their transparent <3
Ok. So first off, you have a very smart son. Having that kind of self knowledge that young is impressive. If I had known what trans was, I'd have come out at a similar time to my voice starting to drop because I was freaking the fuuuuuck out and holy shit I wish I did. (Instead my research told me ""FETISH. BE ASHAMED). Coming out at 13, that dudes gonna end up having a pretty normal life. Just listen to the issues he's having and be supportive. Sounds like you're doing a good job of showing him he can come to you with anything. If you wanna understand gender dysphoria a bit better for yourself, everyone always links the ""gender dysphoria bible"" here so I'ma do that but it seems like he understands that so that would be for you.

Coming out at that age, he's gonna need help with the medical system, but he's only gonna have to figure what surgeries he's gonna need when he is older (if he needs any. It is very ok to not want certain surgeries.) It sounds like you've been doing your research in these areas, so you should be fine continuing with that. 

Child raising help books are usually cancer in my opinion other than listing puberty changes, which will be a bit different in his case maybe anyway. They're usually just some random parent who has forgotten how it feels to be a kid giving unsolicited advice, although I'm sure some of them aren't bad. Just take them with a grain of salt because no one really has the ""right"" answers. I'd probably just go with what you've been doing and just treat him like your son. And when puberty is affecting other boys different because he's probably just on blockers rn, just be understanding and try to help him feel like it's not anything to be worried about because what happens will happen, just maybe a bit later (just like I'm sure you would if you had a cis son who was sad he wasn't getting as big and strong as some of his friends yet/sad he isn't able to grow a beard like one of his classmates can XD) So yeah, thinking back on being a child and trying to remember what it felt like will be a decent guide, (assuming you had decent parents because he seems to have one) just try to remember that not every solution that worked for you as a kid is guaranteed to work for another kid. Try instead to remember what it was like to struggle with shit with only a kid level of perspective. It can be hard to give someone perspective, it's life and friends that does that, so just help him get through it and be understanding.

Only other thing is just help him feel normal and not like he's any less for being trans.

Oh, and don't be too hard on yourself if he doesn't turn out happy all the time just cause he caught the gender dysphoria early. You're about to have a pubescent teenage son. If my brothers are anything to go by, that can be pretty unpredictable in a predictable sort of way if that makes sense. Just do your best and I'm sure you'll do just about as well raising a son as any other parent who cares about their kids. People don't say being a parent is hard for nothing XD

Oh, and thank you. Some tentative faith in humanity has been restored.

And also, yeah, if his biomom doesn't respect his identity, no wonder he doesn't want to go be with her.
You're doing great already! Though after a smidge of profile stalking, it makes sense. Nobody who picks the *best* JL color could possibly be a bad person.
Thanks for the advice! We‚Äôve tried to change up how we talk about biological stuff, and have used words like chest instead, but I‚Äôve been trying to take the taboo of it all away, and he seems to be opening up even more.
That‚Äôs really sweet, thank you. We‚Äôre trying!
Awesome advice, I appreciate the perspective. We‚Äôre trying to find that balance of helping him along without pushing, which right now is talk less and listen more. Thanks!
Bikini Pearl for life!
You sound like you're gonna do fine. A lot of people here wish they had parents more like you. Just don't get that into your head like mine did and tell him how he should be greatful that you aren't worse when you fuck up/he gets upset because ""OtHEr PARenTs dOn't EvEN LOVe THeiR KIDs YOU SHOULD BE GReAtFuL YoU LITTLE SHIt"". Cause that would be shitty and it will set him up to not take his feelings seriously. I ended up tolerating a good amount of emotional/mental abuse/trying to groom me into a perfect wife from a much older than me creepy asshole because of this framing between the ages 20 and 23.

I want to believe I'm overreacting but I'm scared for the future."	"Unfortunately, we do get locked in institutions in various red districts, and states. No one talks about it. After I came out last summer, it happened to me. It was very traumatic. I‚Äôm still recovering‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π. And thankful I got away from the abuse. Democrats need public messengers that‚Äôve been in my position to speak, and get tough on their messaging. Just gotta keep using our voice, organize, and hold onto hope. Believe in the blue is the best we can do.
I‚Äôm personally leaving America because I noticed this country does not give two shits about any minorities. If I didn‚Äôt have the choice to leave the country, I would be hella terrified.
I've said this on some political subs, but I'll share it here too.

2022 is the definitive test for whether Trump's ideas have any staying power in the US. He's backed a lot of primary challengers against traditional Republicans, promising to oust them for ""disloyalty."" 

Even if his candidates win in the primaries, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. That only shows how much support he has among Republicans. The real test will be when one of them goes up against a democrat. It will show if the general public would rather choose a Trump candidate or someone else. 

So what exactly does this have to do with control of the house? Well, the best case scenario is that Trump has high support among Republicans, but low support in the general population. What it means is that when it comes to house races, people will have to choose between any Democrat or a crazy Trump approved candidate. The incumbent they would have voted for is knocked out by Trump's primary, but if people really don't like Trump, then the Democrats will win big since anyone will look better than a Trump candidate.

I think 2022 midterms will be the moment of truth. If Trump's candidates get in office, then it'll be time to worry. Otherwise, I'd say there's not anything more to worry about than usual. As always with posts like this, my suggestion is to wait and see what the midterm elections look like, then we can see if we should be worried or not.
I'm not worried about insurance at all. I'm guaranteed insurance through my company until I decide to quit or get fired. Now if Republicans take over and start making anti LGBTQ laws like they have been trying for the last decade, then I'll worry. My concern is kind of slim to nil though on that particular topic because how can they start making anti-lgbtq laws when they just put a transgender woman as a four-star admiral as the US assistant secretary.
I'm a bit uneasy. Ngl.
I‚Äôm not terrified it usually works out ok our biggest problem will be if trump gets elected again he‚Äôs a loose canon no telling what he‚Äôll try
Why are they set to lose the HOR? Yeah I'm worried about that.
Well, in Germany we're shifting heavily left, so...
The Dems ain't doing much for trans people, and the Republicans will do the same, they'll slowly pull back on out rights and then the Dems will slightly slow it down and over and over until we are not allowed to exist. That's why I'm throwing my vote to either the socialist alternative or the greens, it'll help build a party that actually does more for minorities of all kinds.
I grew up in psycho Texas so I‚Äôm used to it. Not really overjoyed but I‚Äôll manage.
Im just going to move to canada if im being honest.

Id rather emigrate when i get the chance to instead of waiting and eventually losing my chance as the country turns fully fascist and starts locking us in death camps.
A lot of stuff is decided by the states.  If you‚Äôre in a blue state you will probably be okay.  If you‚Äôre in a red state, well it‚Äôs probably already a little worrying.
Good, both parties are evil. Vote third party
No, i'm more afraid we simply wont *gain* anything important. Even if they do get majority in the House, they'll just get up gridlocking the whole legislative system because theyre petty assholes.

I'm not worrying about something extreme like this until 2024 when the presidential election is up again if the republican's get another trump in office that can sign their shit into law.
Vote! VOOOOOOTE!!

I have a local race that was won by 32 votes!

Organize!  Get your friends out of bed and to the polling station!
Yeah I‚Äôve been pretty worried about, hopefully nothing happens though. I wish I could get out of the USA so bad but won‚Äôt be able to for a long time
Pissed is a better description. I only wish I had a useful skillset so I could apply for asylum in canada or something.
America has shown time and time again that it really does care about minorities.

Well, one minority really, the rich.
USA doesnt care about the majorities either lol
America is actually better for trans healthcare than other countries, it's better than Canada and WAY better than the UK. If you are trans I definitely do not recommend moving to the UK, it's a wasteland for us.
There's a fun narrative going around that he won't chance losing the race outright so he isn't running. Sadly if true he can just back whatever pos he decides on.
[deleted]
Because the GOP has steadily been attacking our voting system through several means, and while Democrats currently have their last chance right now in office to do somthing about it, they're not doing jack shit, and more worried about ""negotiation"".
It's actually pretty normal for control of Congress to change during a president's midterm. If things are looking more normal politically this cycle, we're expecting a red wave where people see what Biden has been doing, want change, and vote for his opposition. 

Now whether or not that actually happens is totally up in the air right now, but it is a pretty normal trend, even without the gerrymandering and changes to voting laws.
Same here in New Zealand, both sides don't actually care despite a lot of rhetoric, best option as you said is to get rid of them all and give the minor parties a go!
Exactly. America has priorities but people like me aren‚Äôt part of it.
Absolutely true, the problem is that the majorities take it out on the minorities because to do otherwise would be to admit that White Supremacy and Capitalism are both shams and they aren't some ennobled soon-to-be billionaire ruling class.
Trump is def running. Because even if he loses he‚Äôs going to claim he won, and with Congress and most state legislatures republican, all he has to do is have them void the election and call him the winner
I don't think ""entertaining"" is the right word to describe Trump's term. ;/
Thinking about new Zealand's minor parties, I am kind of ashamed to say but I don't know too much about new Zealand's parties that are not in the house of commons. Do you know any parties or organizations that could build an effective party?"	r013bs	trans	46	0.88	2021-11-23 01:09:05
Why do I visit r/detrans?!	I really do empathize with some of what I see there. However, I can‚Äôt understand the shock and dismay from posters ‚Äúsurprised ‚Äú that testosterone causes facial hair and even male pattern baldness. Like, you didn‚Äôt think that being male would be like‚Ä¶. Being male? In addition, many seem completely taken aback that they don‚Äôt fully ‚Äúpass‚Äù or appear cis after treatment. I‚Äôm ok with passing as a goal in transition but it‚Äôs never a promised outcome. They seem to feel as if they were somehow duped or conned into treatment. Many take their own personal anecdotal experience and draw blanket conclusions about trans healthcare. Some of these post just have to be trolls, right?	"That sub is pretty notorious all around,  from association with terfs and terfs pretending to be detransitioners to mods comparing transitioning to lobotomy and then doubeling down like 5 times. 

~~r/actualdetrans also exists and is supposedly better~~ nevermind it‚Äôs locled apparently
Went on there for the first time the other day and felt the major imposter syndrome creeping up. I also just came out to my parents and it didn't go ideally so I've been feeling imposter syndrome and a lotta doubts bc of that, too. So all around, just a bad decision to visit that sub. I have no problem with actual detransitioners (they're just cis people, also lmao??) and empathize with what they go through. But the blatant transphobia and false information on that sub is insane.  It's so harmful to look at. The worst is seeing people on there talk about their trans friends. I feel terrible for the trans people who have a bunch of transphobe for friends whether they're aware of it or not.
I honestly have no clue, at this point there's barely any actual detransitioners there, more just terfs.
[deleted]
I mean people draw irrational conclusions from personal experience all the time. I mean for years as a kid my personal experience proved the Santa Clause was real, but I was sincerely mistaken. I think it‚Äôs a mix of trolls and people who expected HRT to be a silver bullet that would solve everything. It‚Äôs not by any means. Transition is about wellness and HRT is just one pice of the puzzle.
[deleted]
I think its great to see different views even from ""terfs"" ""farts"" whatever you want to call them, the interesting thing is that bias on any both extremes is just stratospheric. Always use critical thinking, question things and use some common sense. Starting medical transition and then thinking everything will be business as usual is some dumb ass sh*t, also doesn't surprise me that someone could get ""duped"" as intelligence is actually declining in world overall, also people sometimes just jump into conclusions instead of going step by step and think they will get x y z result without second thought.
i think you're looking for r/actual_detrans
You simply can‚Äôt say that something is false just because YOU disagree/don‚Äôt like it.
It's weird, even the legit stuff I found was like extremely self hating? And noone ever seems to suggest anything related to therapy, which would probably help immensily, and probably could've prevented them from being pushed into a transition they didn't want
Idk man, if you go on R/detrans there's an insane amount of hatred toward trans folks. Not just ""transitioning wasn't right for me"" but ""trans people should accept their AGAB, kids are trans because they're being groomed."" The sub is very TERF-leaning, hence the existence of r/actual_detrans
No, it's not worth listening to TERFs in any capacity.  The platform and belief system is one based on exclusion and hatred, and they rely on decorum in order to get their shit message and fearmongering out to the populace as a whole and radicalize them against trans people. The ""different view"" that trans people shouldn't exist is, in fact, stratospherically terrible. Taking any exclusion-based ideology to its logical conclusion inevitably leads to pink triangles. 

The ""bias"" of the other ""extreme"" is that trans people should be able to live their lives with the same rights and quality of life as anyone else. With a little critical thinking you can quickly see that this is a false equivalence: one side wants to exist and the other wants a group of people to be permanently marginalized or to not exist. These views are not opposings ends of a spectrum of beliefs, and TERFs employ the language of political discourse in order to legitimize their platform of exclusion. 

You yourself used that language by asking to reason with a hate group with ""common sense"" when you should have used your purportedly above-average intelligence and critical thinking skills to realize there is no legitimacy in a hate-based ideology and to realize you shouldn't have posted this dumb shit.
Aaaah thanks
Is that discourse that on the basis of any polarization, saying that anyone doesn't want to listen whatsoever. Although i understand the point of view you're coming from i cannot agree. People are not all the same, there are in fact some extreme people that consider we shouldn't exist but that not the case for most people, most people don't care about any of our issues whether you exist or not just want to be in peace. I'm not here to agree with you or anyone but i do respect you opinion. Not everybody, not all ""terfs"" are out to get you somehow. You're one of those people who take offense from a differing opinion so you say what my opinion is dumb shit, pretty low. Then again i do this for fun to express a different opinion not just to try and propagate some specific ide of what hate is or anything. Everyone is worth listening even if it is to know what i don't want hear. Also you're fighting a worthless fight as Sun Tzu once said, ‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù You may know yourself but i think you don't know the enemy all that well just because ""it's not worth listening"". Take it at face value, an opinion is not objective truth i respect yours though you don't need to attack like that. Thank you"	y29vqh	trans	46	0.89	2022-10-12 17:24:01
What do you need from your doctor?	"I'm a doctor and training to become GP. There is a lot of talk on trans health and minimal training for us on it, as well as few resources.
My question is what kind of approach/support you would ideally want from professionals like me? Is there an area we are really bad in? Anything else?
More specifically, do you feel there has to be some thorough psychological assessment or mostly acceptance and support during transition? I am baffled on this, as there are (not many) cases who regret transition and blame doctors.
It's a developing part of healthcare so I value any input from you! Hopefully helping you in my practice"	"Most transgender people are terrified when it comes to seeking healthcare due to being disrespected.  Be aware of that, *ask* and then *use* preferred names and pronouns.
I appreciate when I'm not treated like an experiment and please don't make your patients feel like they're children incapable of thinking for themselves, I hate that so much.
Yes, there are a few people who regret transitionning and blame it on the doctors and it sucks, but remember a lot more need your help and care.
This could help you: [https://journals.tdl.org/jrwg/index.php/jrwg/article/download/97/50](https://journals.tdl.org/jrwg/index.php/jrwg/article/download/97/50)

From what I have heard and/or experienced:

1) listen, really listen.  When it comes to transition related care, many of us are very well informed and could rival endocrinologists (for this one topic).  That said, we can also hold outdated information or outright misinformation.  Have recent journal articles handy to share to show your level of knowledge or ask for citations to update your knowledge if new claims are made that you have not heard about before.  I provide my PCP with peer-reviewed journal articles concerning aspects of my care to help make sure he and I are on the same page or so that he has a chance to refute my source with a source of his own.

2) Set the expectations for your staff.  There are many people that get into healthcare that are in it for the pay or believe that they are truly just helping ""save"" people, but hold their personal faiths closer than any factual knowledge presented when acquiring their credentials.  I am married to an ex-anatomy and physiology professor who kept a list of student names that she said ""If you see any of these names working on or treating me if I have to go into a hospital, drag my body out of there"".  They are capable of jumping through the hoops, but out on their own, they put their personal beliefs over the needs/care of their patients.  So in short, if you make a point to ask preferred names and pronouns you set the example for your staff.

3) as for your question about psych assessment, yes and no.  I personally encourage seeking a qualified gender therapist to help navigate transition (both for official gender dysphoria diagnosis/check for comorbid or contra-indicated conditions and help form a viable plan for transition including: support structures, employment, financial planning, navigating gender change policies, etc).  However, I also believe that grown adults should be allowed to make their own health decisions, ie ""informed consent"".  For these, I recommend stressing the potential risks, side-effects, and avenues for mitigating those risks including ensuring that the patient is legally able to give informed consent.
Don‚Äôt blame everything that‚Äôs wrong with your patients on them being trans (same as don‚Äôt blame all health problems on weight for fat patients). Instead research what HRT changes in trans women and trans men and use that information alongside other tests/doctor shit. Also know that basically none of your trans patients will be willing to give up their HRT to reverse whatever health things drs think the hormones did to them. That‚Äôs always my biggest fear in going to see any health professional (hell, even mental health professionals) - that my doctors will tell me that all my problems would be fixed if I just stopped the testosterone. 

Don‚Äôt do that to someone. Don‚Äôt tell someone they have to choose between being their authentic self and living. If you could fix it in a cis patient without altering their hormones, you can fix it in a trans patient without making them detransition.
I just started to transition and one thing what would really help is, inform your patients on your website that you are lgbtq-friendly. Espacially when you're living in a region or country where everything else but being cis isn't ""normal"". I'm living in a small village in Germany and people here are super religious and everyone knows everyone. Have to drive 30km to see a doc cause if someone here finds out I will be hunted. 

Thank you for asking btw. Guess your one of the docs everybody dreamed of!
My opinion as an ex nurse and Transgender MTF, acknowledge the person we strive to be. Listen to our situation. If you want a compliant patient, call them their chosen name. That alone signals so much to them. Most transitioning will have medication questions, answer and educate them. Encourage transitioning patients to seek counseling, if not already going to one. A personal thanks for being open minded on our needs!
Being informed on common trans terminology. Like for AFAB people, knowing what a binder is and how anatomy is preferably referred to. I've read about so many instances where trans men had to explain to their doctors what a binder was... I definitely wouldn't trust someone who didn't know about an essential part of my transition to provide my healthcare.
Thank you all for the comments, hope I will help people with their transition in the future ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Spend a lot of time learning about misinformation and disinformation so that you can recognize it and correct it when you see it.

There is no end to the hate and lies spread and shared about trans people, and sometimes even the best intentioned people or a trans patient themselves might have misinformation.
The best thing you can do as a doctor is listen to your patients, all of them. Give them time to talk and make sure you understand each other. Also please refrain from assumptions and remember that everyone has their stories.
CURIOSITY.

Yes, we are underrepresented - because of this, we know a LOT about our own experience and share this information often (r/transgender_surgeries has it's own wiki and people verify information within it, dig in!). This also means that we share a lot of information that is unverified, because no one is taking the time to verify it for and with us.

Having people who want to learn more and will help us understand what is and isn't true about us, medically, or who actually want to form true science around our experience, would go a tremendous way.

In the way of bedside manner, don't consider us an oddity. Consider us as people first.
I feel like I wish it was guaranteed that doctors knew the like basics of being trans. Like my doctor uses my preferred name and marks that I'm MtF but doesn't know anything about transitioning.

Other doctors also don't even understand trans women vs trans men. So if they could know the basics of what being trans means and why people transition and the common medical ways people transition would be great. This could include a basic understanding of top/bottom surgeries and what HRT (both estrogen and testosterone) typical does for your body. That's about it, otherwise I just wish there was just more acceptance.
A good thing to keep in mind is that people with contact the healthcare system at various stages in their journey. Some might still be questioning their gender and be in need of sorting that out, while others might be completely done with that and are ready to start medical transition. 

By and large, my experience is that people know their gender once they see through the denial and suppression, and any mandatory psychological assessment thereafter is purely transphobic lawmaking.
On intake forms: section for ‚Äúpronouns‚Äù and ‚Äúname you‚Äôd like us to use‚Äù. Make it a thing in your system. Make it a big deal. Slam it into everyone‚Äôs head that the entire staff must use that name and those pronouns. Make it in bold on the forms, on paper. I know the nurses don‚Äôt know my name, they have to read it. Forcing me to have to out myself every time I meet a nurse is the worst. 

Also, as a side note: make sure it‚Äôs clear that weight is optional. You do not HAVE to step on that scale. The nurses also don‚Äôt have to say it out loud. Weight is such a struggle, especially since hormones and such can cause weight shifts p dramatically sometimes. Make it clear that you don‚Äôt have to step on the scale, you don‚Äôt have to see or hear your number, and don‚Äôt shame people if they have a larger weight anyhow. 

Also don‚Äôt assume that every medical issue is gonna relate to them being trans / overweight. Like, no doc, me having migraines every other day *isn‚Äôt* because I‚Äôm transgender.
Is disrespect about pronouns or being dismissed for being trans? So bad it still happens
Makes sense! Would you be mindful of some signs/behaviours that may show uncertainty regarding the decision to transition? What would make me think someone may not be sure/have other issues, without judging or questioning them? Do you think that the ones who regret it may have not been well informed or assessed some way?
Yes to both. ‚òπÔ∏è
Maybe you should be looking at the signs showing the person is sure about themselves instead. People who've been questionning themselves for years very rarely change their minds.

You might meet a lot of people struggling with other issues like depression or substance abuse, and dysphoria might be the root of it.

I think the people detransitionning either didn't reflect enough on themselves or simply thought it would be a cool thing to do, it's not, not in our very transphobic societies.

Finally, you might meet people wanting to ""try"" transitionning (HRT especially) to see if they're happier this way, and there should be nothing wrong about that. Inform them about what changes they may see on their bodies and make it clear they can't choose an effect and not all the others and that their genetics are very important in determining the results.
I don't sympathize with the pronouns issue but let's say it's an innocent mistake sometimes. The second though should not be common anymore.
I come from a country with zero trans health or awareness and accept it.
Thanks!!!üòä
mistakes are totally okay. We are just so used to people using it (""if I make a mistake I will be cancelled"") as an excuse for not caring or trying or as a kind of dog whistle for how trans people are just whiny and oversensitive. I've so far met one trans person out of dozens who is so sensitive about unintentional mistakes.
Please find an organization that can provide you with Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Training. You'll find the use of pronouns are necessary to provide care with you setting the tone by providing your pronouns first. Pronouns do matter. Patient Center Care if you are familiar with the model advocates for what is best for everyone. Ask the patient...how may I help you?  This reduces stigma. Are you a WPATH Provider? Enrolling in WPATH will ensure that you are understanding how to provide care. They offer training and discussions on care/treatment. What are your bias? Are you using language appropriate for the patient? Do you understand cultural humility? Have you received trauma informed care?

Standing up to colleagues and specialists when one of us has been misgendered or deadnamed at an appointment. Contacting that person and advocate for your patient. Recommend training to overcome this happening again. Validate your patient when we come to you to discuss being misgendered in medical care. Not medical gaslighting or minimizing what's happened.
Also bear in mind that the detransition rate is 2% and around 1.5% of that detransition due to social pressure, not because they aren't trans.

So maybe don't give ""what if they regret it later"" too big a piece of your time. The probability you actually get a person who regrets transition is extremely low."	x5zah3	trans	46	0.96	2022-09-04 22:11:41

The worst thing we can do is to prop up the failing status quo.

The two party system and Electoral College are outdated notions.  They're leading us to our demise as the once great nation-state that we were.

We actually need less red and blue and more orange, green, yellow and purple.  There is a third party that better represents you than the Democrats continue to make you think they do.

The lesser of two evils is still evil.  The enemy of your enemy is rarely your friend.

No, unless you are brainwashed and forcibly red or blue pilled, neither party represents your ideals and morals, yet other parties do.  Support change, support third party candidates.
I don‚Äôt disagree with you, but now I live somewhere I don‚Äôt get mocked in public. I‚Äôm treated as a normal person by almost everyone I meet. People respect me and my life choices, preferences. People smile kindly when I pass by, not laughingly.

I'm beginning to get a bit hopeless about transitioning.	"I just turned 18 and am MTF pre-everything. I live in the UK (sorry) and trans healthcare here is abysmal as many know already. Pairing the recent surge in transphobia paired with the fact that transitioning in the UK is virtually impossible, I'm beginning to lose hope.

My next best option in my head was DIY, but after going through so much research, it all seems way too complicated to take in and it just makes me exhausted. Bear in mind: I really don't want to DIY; I'd much rather go the safer, more legitimate route. However, once again given that that's basically impossible because of the UK, it's not a very viable option for me. 

I want to begin as soon as possible, because my dysphoria is beginning to really catch up with me in a way that I haven't felt before. I'll be in class on the verge of a panic attack and not be able to tell a single person or do a single thing about it. I'm getting more and more uncomfortable in my own skin by the day and it's affecting me in many ways, be it academic, mentally, physically, etc. I am very worried that, if left untreated, It'll get much worse. 

I'm not sure what I hope to gain by writing this. Whether it be advice, comfort, or whatever, if this post even gets seen then I'll be satisfied. I hope that at least one person sees this and has anything to say. Doesn't have to be much, just anything would be nice. <3"	"https://diyhrt.cafe/index.php/Main\_Page

I'm sorry you're going through it and I wish I could do something!
had this page pinned on my browser for the longest time. probably just a me problem but i literally have no clue where to start with it all its very overwhelming ahaha
tysm ill give it my best shot <3
i think it might just be a hoops thing yeah. a lot of info is thrown at me and im kinda sat there staring blankly haha, but i think i might try out a private clinic and actually get my shit together for once
haha its no worries honestly. i guess its just one of the downsides to living on terf island. comments have been wonderful though, really reinvigorating my spirits yknow :)
ive started looking into that as an option. even though its private and gonna be pretty harsh on funds, im gonna see if i can give it a go in the future
youre right, just baby steps for now of course haha. DIY was just a lot of information thrown at me all at once and i get super overwhelmed by all the numbers and names, but ill figure something out <3
ive certainly considered that, my on the spot location probably wouldve been canada or something. however, that wont be until another couple of years considering im going into uni next year
hey even this comment was more than enough to make me feel a bit better <3

Once you get started tho it‚Äôs really simple: take your HRT as prescribed, then every three months have your bloodwork done to see how it‚Äôs all looking. The doctor will tell you if anything seems to be going wrong.


Good luck I‚Äôm rooting for you!
I‚Äôm glad to hear that. Wishing the best for you!

Mass shooting at one of the only LGBTQ Clubs in Colorado Springs last night	"https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/11/20/us/colorado-springs-shooting-gay-nightclub/index.html

I was there when it happened. Heard yelling, gunfire, saw people dropping and did what I could to provide First Aid. 

I went there because I have been trying to build up a social and support network following a suicide attempt last year. I spent the entire week before fighting the military healthcare system for basic dignity and care and I was just done.

Now I am completely wrecked, really wishing it had been me instead of those who died. I just can't with this fucking society anymore, and I am sick of being a target and a punching bag for these monsters because of the way I was born. The thought of going back to a fight over healthcare on Monday is utterly exhausting."	"I'm just extraordinarily sorry you had to experience these things. If you are as it appears active duty, I can only hope your chain of command recognizes the value of your actions: this can give a strange form of closure, sometimes. Try to be charitable and acknowledge the chaos as you review your actions. As someone with an apparent difficult deployment experience I'm sure you understand the value in processing these experiences with a professional and getting as far ahead of emerging post traumatic stress symptoms as possible. Having our personal lives erupt with the traumatic stimuli of a wartime environment is extraordinarily taxing for anyone. Take time to take care of yourself as best you can. There's a whole community of transgender veterans, myself included, who have an inkling what you're experiencing and are there to help.
Hey I'm a local queer trying to expand my circle and was looking up other people in CoS. I'm so sorry you were there, can I ask how you're doing these days??
That's the crazy thing, being in similar experiences on deployments made it seem like ""oh, here we go again"" in the moment, and probably helped me a lot to be able to respond and save those who I could. Today, though, it is infuriating that experience fighting ISIS in Syria and the Taliban in Afghanistan felt right at home in Colorado Springs. His cowardly attack probably won't be labeled as terrorism but that's exactly what it is.
I am just now coming back online after spending some time in Cedar Springs for Survivor's Guilt and suicidal ideation, feeling better but still a little shaky. I already have PTSD from military service, so it almost feels like this was just one more drop in that bucket.
I've had a similar experience, if not as significant and tragic, and it really took some time to process through the fact that it happened stateside, in my normal life, and felt just like combat - and that's without the sense of being targeted. I hope the upcoming week goes okay. I trust your chain of command has been notified you were present: you're going to need to be cut some slack with the days ahead.

Ellie's (incomplete) Master Guide to Transitioning.	"This is an old post. You can find the latest version of the masterlist [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/dn6qd2/ellies_master_list_of_trans_resources/)

This is my attempt at creating a comprehensive guide to help trans people in every way I can think of through the sharing of information and resources. The guide is largely community made, and while I continue to make as many contributions as i can find, I'm really happy for any help I can get in making it larger and more helpful. That being said, this will likely be reposted once every 3 or so months, in the hopes that new people will see it, and that it will encourage others to share. You may notice that there is **an imbalance of resources geared toward the mtf community.** This is my fault. I simply am not familiar with and have not had much luck finding resources for other parts of the trans community. It doesn't mean that I don't care. If you have any resources from other parts of the trans community, please please please share them! If you feel like there is an issue with the guide, feel free to pm me or leave a message in the comments.

Best European country for trans people?	"Hi everyone, 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any personal experience or resources that can tell me what some of the best European countries might be for Trans acceptance and healthcare?

Apparently ILGA posted a ‚ÄúRainbow Map‚Äù of Europe which lists Malta, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden as the top countries. 

I was wondering if this seems accurate? I know rankings like this tend to not always be correct.

For context about myself:

I‚Äôm a trans man living in Canada with an interest of one day visiting long-term (or moving) to Europe. I don‚Äôt have a timeline for this, but I hope to make this happen in the next few years.

I may be getting all of my desired surgeries before the possibility of an international move, but I am still looking for countries that have trans friendly clinics to provide hormones without too many barriers, as well as discrimination protections.

Thank you for any input. üôè"	"I'm from Europe but don't know so well, although as with all positive things about Europe, assume the nordic countries will always be the best, no matter the question.
Beware of Denmark, i would wait untill our next
election to gauge if we are going to stay in the top.

As of right now, social transistion can be relatively safe, but a lot of regular folk can be a bit lacking in terms of support, and public medical tranistion can be kind of nightmarish regular 2 year waiting lists to start HRT, 8 year waiting period for bottom surgery and its pretty common to meet conservative doctors and surgeons at a lot our clinics.
I'd say Portugal. Maybe not *the best*, but definitely on the top 10.
A while ago someone said Belgium (called it France but gay) and the German government just announced something they want to implement that lets you change your legal name and gender pretty easily. I don't know about healthcare here, but on the bigger cities of western Germany youre gonna be okay (I recommend M√ºnster, it's amazing and pretty, and pretty central)
Sweden and Norway are definetely best I think
Netherlands Sweden or Norway I think
Spain is ok, new law being passed soon which gets rid of sterilisation requirements for legal gender change etc. Similar situation in Germany but I feel like Germany has stricter gender roles
Iceland is probably up there with the better ones. Cost of living is high though and idk how the waiting lists are for gender affirming care.
Iceland
Not to undermine how difficult that is, but 2yrs is prompt for HRT compared to Ireland (>6yrs)
As a Portuguese trans girl myself. Yes but also no.
Sweden is by no means a bad country, but be aware that it's far from perfect. I can't speak for things like surgery or HRT - I'm still in the awkward 18-24 month phase before I'm called for a gender dysphoria examination - but I know wait times are pretty long. The Swedish law also states that there are only two genders, so there's no X option for non-binary people's passports and stuff
The Netherlands has a really long waitlist for trans healthcare
Im not saying its that bad at all, but compared to liberal systems like in the states with informed consent etc it is very different wait times, and its also against medical system policiy to wait more then 6 months for treatment, its a veery understaffed branch of our healthcare.
How so? I just started my transition (just HRT for now, not social yet) and I feel judged by most people on the street... Idk if it's in my head but I'm scared

Edit: I'm Portuguese too in case of confusion
I personally disagree with you. As a trans man, my experience has been alright. Yes, I've met one or two transphobic people but that was it. I was actually mostly blown away by how trans friendly this country is, not to mention the health care.
I've heard the wait times are pretty long but it's worth considering that the healthcare system is *much* better (cheaper) than a lot of places, even with hrt being free. That said even the best countries for trans people still have quite a ways to go. But i'm not swedish either so there's a lot that i don't know
The netherlands is very accepting of trans people and that's why I put it in my list.
Its not so trans friendly but again, not a lot of places are trans friendly. Portugal happens to be not as fucked up than some other countries in Europe
Honestly, might be me blaming binary but i think for transmasculine people its easier"	vpcjwr	trans	35	0.98	2022-07-01 22:15:27
Solid (and humanizing despite being at a medical event!) talk from a doc on healthcare for transgender people; refuting bad studies that were popularized by the current US administration, HRT science and an alternative route for HRT. Someone please repost this with a better title/summary please haha		"I think you‚Äôll like this sub

r/DrWillPowers
Wow. This was really good.
There's a few slides early on that are outstanding for advocacy--I think he lays out all the research for refuting various ""whataboutisms"" I'm new to this so not sure how to articulate some of the other stuff he raised yet but easily one of the top science/medicine lectures I've seen in over a year across fields and actually really accessible even for non-medical/science people too.
I literally stumbled upon this video by chance (I think it autoplayed or I misclicked but his delivery was really interesting and merited watching) so this is video is the only thing I know about the doc but I can't help but think:
""The man, the video legend, now in reddit form at r/DrWillPowers""
 haha thanks for sharing!
Agreed! 

It struck me as better than a lot if not all TED talks I've seen in that 1st hour, probably because of the density and clarity of actionable and contextual information mixed in with a pretty chill opening/intro to him and his story. The fact that he raised treatment / care as a way to intervene and prevent suicide among transgender people and how visibly institutional discrimination affected his career vs. his wife's because he served clients looking to transition vs. a ""regular"" practice really added scope to the impact of his work and the moment we're all in, even non-trans people.

I've finally escaped Plato's stupid cave	"my eggshell shattered into dust, I took the red pill, I woke up, insert some other analogy here.
A couple of weeks ago, I was still 'questioning' (more like in denial), but I've done a lot of thinking and now I know that I am 100% definitely a trans woman. Coming out to my friends was the easy part because they all came to terms with their gender long before I started really thinking about mine.

Trump‚Äôs video on transgender care has made me realize something	"Before anything I‚Äôm not sure if this is counted as possible trigger or vent so:

I‚Äôm ftm and a teenager and I‚Äôve been out to my friends as trans for a year. This whole time I‚Äôve been dreaming of the day I could start testosterone. Now bc of Trump‚Äôs video I‚Äôm realizing that by the time I‚Äôm of age it‚Äôll be a year too late for me. There‚Äôs constantly attacks against transness but I never really thought that my right to be who I am would ever actually be fully taken away from me. Any republican candidate that wins in 2024 will probably immediately come for our healthcare and I just dont know if I can handle it. Do these people want to see us dead if they can‚Äôt see us conform?


Edit: I do not want to seem like I‚Äôm spreading false information or fear mongering. I‚Äôm not saying any of these things will happen I just need a place to convey my fear as a young trans person. I love y‚Äôall stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è"	"""Now bc of Trump‚Äôs video I‚Äôm realizing that by the time I‚Äôm of age it‚Äôll be a year too late for me""

So much wrong here.

A, Trump has little chance of becoming president. 

B, Any republican president has to pass his healthcare laws through congress which is sharply divided and currently controlled in the senate by democrats. 

C, Even if they pass the senate, there is no realistic way for them to ban HRT since it is already prescribed and given freely to CIS people. The only change is who you get your medication from. Think how marijuana is currently in a weird grey market. HRT will be the same. 

D, It's never too late for anyone to transition. A year or two doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

But yes, they do want us dead, but there is very little the can actually do about it.
100%, that's been the republican mission statement since 2021 to see us dead. The best thing we can do is be advocates for ourselves. Protest, convince everyone you know what's on the fence to vote, and to vote Democrat. 
You dont want those same people to get snatched up by Tucker Carlson or Matt Walsh, because the next thing you know, they're going to be the ones with guns while we're all lined up at the death camps. Good luck, soldier.
I really wish the young people doom posting saw what it was like in the 2000s. 

I was alive for that time, and the things we're afraid of happening now were status quo then. Access to HRT and trans affirming healthcare were extremely extremely difficult to get then. Just bc there was no ""ban"" doesnt mean it wasnt banned. 

Things got better. Trans medical care is more advanced and accessible. There are doctors on our side. My therapist is part of a group of therapists and doctors thru Included Health that focus on trans healthcare specifically bc Doctors and therapists know trans health care is hard to access and they are making a stand. Theyve been doing this for a couple of years now. 

yes its scary that theyre coming for us with their propaganda machine, but it would take a lot for them to make things worse than it already was when I was growing up 

Its going to be okay. Cis people do care about us. There are allies in the medical community fighting for us as well ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT dont let the loud transphobes convince you that we dont have allies devoting their professional lives to our liberation. 

EDIT 2 You are not alone in this fight. Stay strong, dear one. All the love from Texas
You will start be able to start testosterone one day, I promise us older peepo will do everything we can to prevent anyone from taking away our, and your, future.
Here‚Äôs my hope for the 2024 election - the GOP is primed for ruination.  Trump will not go quietly into the goodnight.  DeSantis is too smart to be played by the orange freakazoid.  Both want the throne.  Neither will get it while the other remains.  Our best hope is that their inability to set aside pride will cause a rift in the base, one that will sink the GOP for good.
The decision on the Arkansas case that banned care should be coming soon.  Hoping it is found unconstitutional, which will help everyone!
If a national ban is passed, I think a lot of us (myself included) will be done asking for rights. Done asking, not done working towards them.
Don‚Äôt worry. Won‚Äôt stop him from using EOs. 

He has a good shot at winning. Don‚Äôt discount that. Until the election is in the books and a spineless dem is in office at least. If it‚Äôs not trump then desantis is equally if not more dangerous. 

Really our best hope is that they rip each other apart enough that they lose the EC. They won‚Äôt win the popular, but we know that doesn‚Äôt mean anything anyway.
Totally agree, we have to stick around to spite them. Being trans isn‚Äôt a choice, so we also have to hang on to try and build a better foundation for the future. We have to make a stand so they don‚Äôt keep killing us, they can‚Äôt deny the reality of advanced biology forever, the longer they try the more people they‚Äôll hurt.
When talking doesn't work (or work enough), action must be taken to protect what is right regardless of any public opinion.

I, for one, will not sit idle if there is any progress made in banning HRT or other medical care for trans people. I personally know what it's like to grow up in and live in a household that is transphobe and homophobe. I personally know the pain, and nobody deserves such.

I can't believe how much anti-trans laws have actually become real. Like, whatever happened to ""land of the free""?

We have to stick together and do what we can to do what is right, even if that is illegal.
I grew up during those times. People routinely got the crap beat out of them for even hinting they were gay or trans. Good luck having anyone come to your rescue, even teachers. It was a mess and I sometimes wonder how I managed to survive it.

Today it is so much better than it was and that makes me happy. What pisses me off is that the haters are still getting their way in a lot of areas and they need to be set straight.
Thank you for this encouragement :) I‚Äôm in Louisiana and it makes it so hard to remember there are people on my side when all I see is casual and even aggressive transphobia every day. I wanted to make sure that people knew that my post isnt me spreading any news its just my fear as a trans person. But even if no cis people were here for us I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd fight for ourselves. I love all my trans brothers and sisters <3
EOs don‚Äôt have the power to ban or legalize anything period. If they have both houses and the presidency, that‚Äôs a huge issue. Otherwise it‚Äôs not happening. And states that have passed trans safe laws will continue to be safe in a grey market most likely.
The EOs aren't laws though, he can direct his federal agencies but that doesn't change the law.
Yep!!! 

Like not just actual gay and trans people getting hate crimed, but anyone who LOOKED even slightly like they might be. I remember when the emo trend was in full swing and people were fucking PISSED about how GNC the style was and posting videos beating emo guys and calling them gay slurs 

Through out my childhood and pre teens the only representation of trans or gay people I saw were stories of them getting murdered. I was genuinely terrified of getting murdered for like, most of my life lol. Then one day I realized they could come for me anyway, for any reason, and I realized Id want to die as myself and go down swinging. Thats what lead to me coming out. So me even coming out was me getting fed up with living in fear and deciding this was life or death, and that I would fight to the end. 

Im glad we made it, friend ‚ù§Ô∏è I also think its a miracle.
I completely understand, my friend. I hope I didnt sound critical of you or anybody ""doom posting"", bc its completely understandable and important to reach out for support so youre doing the right thing, and Im just sorry all the transphobia is bringing you down.

It's natural to get lost in all the transphobic noise. I think about when I was younger than 18 and how scared I was of the world. And then when I entered adulthood and got my first job, of course I experienced transphobia along the way, but I also found so much support it really blew my mind. I feel like the world, even a rural TX town, completely opened itself up to me. I began to see other trans and LGB people in the world, I met 3 trans coworkers, had LGB managers, and realized how brainwashed I was and how badly the transphobes want to take away our hope so we give up before we can experience the real world and see how loving it can be towards us, and how many of us are out there. I have even found with Republicans, they can weirdly enough be strong allies IRL even if they vote for transphobic politicians. Its definitely weird, but showed me a lot of these people are brain washed too, to think trans people are a certain way and then they meet us and cannot help but feel normal human attachments and compassion. A Republican man in his 50s thanked my mom for supporting me, and was very emotional about it. It was definitely strange, bc Im sure he will still go on to vote for people who will Not support me. But it shows people dont inherently hate us, and there is hope that just by existing and living our best lives we are helping those around us see the real world for what it really is too. 

Sorry for rambling, I am just old and desperately want you to know it will be ok ‚ù§Ô∏è
And that‚Äôs stopped him, when?
Literally multiple times he wanted to do something and didn‚Äôt have congress backing him.
Can you be more specific? If you look at what he accomplished policy wise, it was actually very little (mostly enriching himself/his buddies)."	10tox56	trans	32	0.89	2023-02-04 19:28:39
Y'ALL. Don't forget to do monthly chest/breast exams!	"Cancer doesn't give a hoot about gender. Anyone can get breast cancer-- and for dudes who bind, that increases your chances, especially if you do it on the regular.

So give yourself self exams and if you find a lump, call your doctor. Here are some tips on WHAT TO DO. Because **knowing** is half the battle!

## How should a breast/chest self-exam be performed?

## 1) In the Shower¬†

Using the pads of your fingers, move around your entire breast in a  circular pattern moving from the outside to the center, checking the  entire breast and armpit area. Check both breasts each month feeling for  any lump, thickening, or hardened knot. Notice any changes and get  lumps evaluated by your healthcare provider.

## 2) In Front of a Mirror¬†

Visually inspect your breasts with your arms at your sides. Next, raise your arms high overhead.
    
Look for any changes in the contour, any swelling, or dimpling of the  skin, or changes in the nipples. Next, rest your palms on your hips and  press firmly to flex your chest muscles. Left and right breasts will not  exactly match‚Äîfew women's breasts do, so look for any dimpling,  puckering, or changes, particularly on one side.

## 3) Lying Down

When lying down, the breast tissue spreads out evenly along the chest  wall. Place a pillow under your right shoulder and your right arm behind  your head. Using your left hand, move the pads of your fingers around  your right breast gently in small circular motions covering the entire  breast area and armpit.
    
Use light, medium, and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple; check for  discharge and lumps. Repeat these steps for your left breast."	"I know I should do this but it hurts to read :(
deadpool has videos for breast cancer checks and testicular cancer checks. :D
I know I'm 2 months late but I'm to dysphoric to even dare looking at my chest or crotch
Yo, I actually found a tiny ""pea"" in my boob, 3 years ago! Got it checked, and it wasn't too serious. Just gotta watch it now. Cis men can have breast cancer, so you don't have to feel weird if something does pop up. I recommend going to your ""happy place"" while having a doc or nurse check it. Tell them first though, so they know what's going on. 
You can do it! Proper chest health is important. I know firsthand what a bitch dysphoria can be, but would you rather be distressed or have cancer?

Check your peck! Men can get breast cancer too. Anyone can. We‚Äôve all got breast tissue. 
Deadpool is a class act. 
I feel that dysphoria too. But self exams are the best way to make sure everything is okay. Early detection if you DO feel a lump is paramount. 

You need to set aside that discomfort for a few minutes to make sure everything is okay. Do some self care afterward. 

People who bind are more likely do develop lumps. It‚Äôs still important to make sure your body is healthy, even when you know it‚Äôs not the body you want.
Exams are super important-- doing them in the shower helps. But yeah, any and all men can get cancer. But binding DOES increase your chances of lumps developing.

CONSTANT VIGILANCE. 
Ok then. I'll make sure to do it soon"	b0205o	trans	31	0.98	2019-03-12 01:54:04
After almost a year my hard work has payed off	"In my last post a while ago I asked for prayers as I came out to my mom, and it went well (anon who said it was a bad idea get Fucked) and now things are really looking up. I came out online to my new friend group and everyone accepts me and treats me no different as they did before, and I finally broke up with my girlfriend which ended up being a good idea (lol). Over the past year me and my stepdad have been flipping his old house and after coming there every other day and weekend doing grueling work from 4-8pm while he yells at me for some stupid reason we finally listed it and sold.
I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm getting healthcare, which means my mom will help me start hormone therapy. (Hopefully by the end of the year!) Thank you to everyone who supported and talked to me as I went from wanting to do myself in and being in denial to being the happiest I‚Äôve ever been regardless of me not passing

I am new(cn: suicidal thoughts, transphobia)	"So, it took me about 31 years to understand the very basic definition of transgender. It was always something that someone else was going through.  And didnt matter that i wanted to be a boy from the time i was very young. My mom insists that because I like dresses(i hate pants) that i ""wasnt a lesbian""(yes. I know. Yes, she's still problematic, no cutting her out isn't a valid option at this time).  
 Well, sometime in the last 2 years something clicked. But now I'm so lost. 
So I am 33, still wearing lots of skirts and dresses (i have sensory issues so I'm not sure I could wear men's clothes even if they fit), and working in a very cis-centric area of healthcare. I'm suicidal and have been for the last 6 months. 
It feels like a door has been opened and all my thoughts and feelings that I had shoved behind it sprawled put into a hall way and I'm not sure how I even got that much shit in here. But I can't close the door. 

I was at a trans friendly therapy place last year, but couldn't afford to keep going so they had to drop me and now I can't get back in. So I had to find a psych for urgent medication changes, but still don't have a therapist. I'm waiting for intake at a place that does partial hospitalization program. 

I just keep coming back to what if I try testosterone and it makes me crazier, or if I hate it or what if what if what if. 

I dont know what I need or what from this post. I just want to say it to someone other than my sister. "	"If you ever need to talk, I'm probably not the only stranger willing to listen but I'm here. 
Hey new friend!  I'm glad you found a place to talk about how you're feeling.  It's definitely confusing and scary at first for a lot of us, because we grew up in places where we couldn't safely discover our identities.  So don't worry about not having it all figured out immediately!  You'll get there if you keep putting one foot in front of the other.  And even if you decide transition isn't for you, I think you'll benefit from having a space where you can explore who you are.

If you're interested, r/translater can sometimes offer helpful perspectives for those of us who didn't get to transition in our teens or twenties.  And there are tons of trans-friendly subreddits out there, with new ones popping up all the time (e.g. r/TransMasc/ ).  When I first came here I just searched ""trans"" and ""transgender"" on the front page search engine and I wound up spending hours poking through all the different subs and choosing the ones that seemed most promising.  You don't have to do that obviously, but just know that there are a lot of us all going through this journey right alongside you.
How strong are your thoughts of suicide? Do you have a plan? Can you get yourself to an emergency room?
Thanks you.
No plan, I'm safe. I see my psych tomorrow. My mom or sister has been spending the night for the last few months, but we're all fucking tired. I don't think the ER will do anything, and last I heard there aren't even any beds in any psych units.
It's like, persistent intrusive thoughts of selfharm/suicide.
Damn okay. I'm really happy to hear you're safe. Does your psych know about your suicidal thoughts?
Oh yeah. I have 2 kids under 10 so I'm scraping every finger hold I can grab for. I knew this was coming last July, and old(but lgbtiq friendly) place blew me off. And I JUST called a therapist(like 10 minutes ago) to see if I can get in. 
Wait really?!? Dude! Way to go! Making that first step to call and talk to someone can honestly sometimes be the hardest and I'm so freaking proud of you for doing it!

Listen, it's a long road but I promise that if you stick to it and you work hard, it will get better. You'll have setbacks. You'll have missteps. Sometimes you might feel stagnant. But it does get better. Keep reaching out for help and never give up. Come to us when ya need it.

Congratulations on having the strength to keep going. You're going to do great things."	8ssoc2	trans	27	0.95	2018-06-21 15:14:46
Show your support for the ACA and motion toward fully trans* inclusive healthcare! Spend 2 minutes and make a phone call (YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ANYONE!!!) and tell Paul Ryan you support the ACA!	"You can continue the momentum of the #Womensmarch by taking 2 min of your time to defend life-giving health care for ALL Americans. 

Paul Ryan is conducting a phone poll on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 

You can express your support for the ACA in 3 easy steps:

(1) Call (202) 225-0600 There will be a LONG (I mean 35 second) pause. Don't let them trick you into hanging up!

(2) Press 2 to share your opinion on the ACA. 

(3) You have to sit through some rhetoric about why Paul Ryan's right. Don't be fooled. Press 1 to support the ACA. 

I just tried this. It's legitimate, it works, it took me less than 2 minutes. You do NOT have to talk to ANY humans to do this, so if your socially anxious, no worries, you can still let your voice be heard."	"FYI: The silence at the beginning can last up to 2 minutes, maybe longer. It's completely silent - it doesn't even ring. It's like that on purpose to discourage people. Wait it out.

If you get a message about the voicemail box being full, hang up and try again. You will get through eventually.
They say they are busy and to call back later?
Currently calling. 2 minutes and 50 seconds in and they _finally_ go through the spiel
**The Senate voted 51 to 48:**

*1. To end coverage for preexisting conditions, veterans benefits, and aid to rural hospitals.

*2. To remove discrimination protection for women in healthcare.

*3. Against the provision allowing children to remain on their parent's insurance till the age of 26.

*4. To cut off funding for the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

*5. Against ACA contraceptive coverage and maternity care provision.

*6. To direct committees to send budget legislation to defund and repeal the Affordable Care Act.

*For those who get health insurance through work, no pre-existing conditions. 

*Lifetime caps for coverage are back for everyone.

Real and disastrous actions are being taken that will affect more than just the 20-30 million people who will lose their health care coverage and the 3 million people who will lose their jobs.

Despite their assertions of this being an action to ""repeal and replace,"" no viable alternative plan has been proposed.

The House votes Friday.

As of this moment, no replacement exists.

First HRT Appointment Experience at Planned Parenthood	"When I was getting myself started on things (MtF for me, though this will be exactly the same process for FtM as well!) I remember looking all around Reddit and elsewhere to try and get a clear and thorough idea of exactly what to expect when I was making an appointment for the first time with Planned Parenthood, since I get more than a little bit of anxiety over going into things like that without knowing! Now that I've done it all, I'd like to offer this detailed write-up for anyone else who might be wondering.

I put it off for MANY months just because I was kinda scared of the unknown, so hopefully this will help encourage those like me who like to know more before they take the plunge!

&#x200B;

***Making the appointment:***

Way easier than I'd built it up in my mind. Planned Parenthood in my neck of the woods (and I think most!) operates on informed consent, so you can make an appointment really whenever you want, without a referral or letter from a therapist. When I called them up, there was a brief phone tree and hold, then I spoke with the kindest receptionist I've ever interacted with. She asked for my date of birth and legal name, then preferred name and pronouns, and stressed that this was the only time they'd ever need to hear your legal name and would only use what you prefer from that point onward. If you're calling before you've picked your new name, they can update your preferred name at any point whether by calling back or just saying so at the day of your appointment. After that, she just asked exactly what service I was requesting (HRT for MtF), and then offered some dates about a month out for me to pick from. Easy as pie.

Do be aware though that sometimes their phones get backed up and you might need to be on hold awhile. First time, was on hold for less than 5 minutes. But I called back a week later to adjust the appointment time and was on hold for a bit over 30.

&#x200B;

***The appointment itself:***

I was slightly late to their office by about 10 minutes due to having trouble finding parking (this office is downtown in the biggest city in the state), but they have a short grace period for appointments, up to 15 minutes, so you don't lose your spot if you're slightly late!

When I came in it was pretty much like a normal doctor's office, colorful and cheerful, with loads of pamphlets about sexual health and LGBTQ+ resources around, plus free condoms on the tables. The receptionists were behind a glass window but all wore masks, and they took my info down and I went to wait in the waiting room while filling out a form about my personal habits, specifically asking about depression, drinking, and drug use. I think it was an optional screening form, but not sure. I filled it out.

They also asked about my insurance status and whether or not I'd be paying out of pocket, saying that if I was paying out of pocket, then they have a sliding scale for the fee that's based on your reported income, which is very nice of them to provide. Since I had insurance, I paid the copay up front. For me, it was $20.

&#x200B;

***Initial Screening:***

They came and got me before I even finished filling out the form, and went back to an exam room with a clinician's assistant for the initial screening. She was very nice, and said it was exciting to be in for a first appointment for hormone therapy, which it was!

For the most part, the questions were isolated to a few things.

1. She ran through the depression screening I'd filled out and asked directly about personal habits, and then made sure to let me know that Planned Parenthood has free counselling available to patients who don't already have a therapist or who just want to use them (good to know!)
2. She asked about my sexual history, which included some detailed questions about previous partners. (When, whether they had a penis or a vagina, if you ever knew if they had STI's, if I had ever been screened for STI's, etc...) and then asked if I wanted to take any tests for STI's. I declined at this appointment.
3. My personal health and the health of my relatives (Usual doctor stuff, what prescriptions you're on, if you have any particular health conditions like asthma, heart disease, etc..., if any known family members have the same, and things like that.)
4. What pharmacy I use.
5. If I'd like to get everything done today or just talk about the details before seeing them again at a later date for the actual hormones. I chose the former.

&#x200B;

***Seeing their doctor:***

After the initial stuff was said and done, there was a brief wait alone in the exam room before the clinician came in. She introduced herself and then got right into the topic of the visit, which was HRT.

The things she covered were straight forward:

1. First she asked exactly what it was I was looking for from Planned Parenthood, which was feminizing hormone replacement therapy.
2. She asked how I came to the conclusion that I wanted/needed HRT. I responded *very* briefly with the same stuff I'd been telling my therapist, she just listened and nodded, and asked no follow-up questions. **Never was I made to feel like I had to justify myself or defend my decision that I needed HRT, and the doctor was very understanding with everything I said.** 
3. She then asked if I understood exactly what it entailed and asked what I expected it to be able to do for me, to gauge how much I knew. I'd done my research so I just told her the biggest things I was hoping for it to help me with physically and mentally.
4. She made a point to also go over the things it CAN'T do, and also the things it isn't likely or guaranteed to do. (Like, how it can't raise the tone of my voice, how it can't change my bone structure, etc... or that it's possible for it to slightly affect height but by no means guaranteed, among other things like stressing that how it affects body hair or genetic hair loss varies from person to person.)
5. Then we went over exactly what medications would be involved and compared them against my current prescriptions to make sure it was safe. **She made the point that all HRT use of things like Estradiol in this context are** ***off label*** **BUT generally safe**. That is, there's not a whole lot of official research yet done on these, but that doctors in general know what it can do and that it's safe to use for transitioning.
6. She went over complications and side effects it might have, and mentioned them in the context of my other medications.

After all that, she basically just asked if I understood all the risks and benefits, and if I wanted to continue, knowing them. Naturally I said yes, so she had some paperwork for me to fill out that legally showed the informed consent for the treatment. Also filled out some release forms to send the info to whatever other doctors I'd like to send the information to.

Once that was done, she wrote out the prescription that was to be sent to my pharmacy, and that was that! She prescribed 2mg Estradiol once daily and 50mg Spiro twice daily for the first three months and then scheduled a follow-up appointment to check on hormone levels for adjusting the doses.

&#x200B;

***Bloodwork:***

Since I opted to do it all that day, bloodwork followed after the doctor left, with the same assistant as before. She took a single vial of blood from my left arm like bloodwork usually goes, relatively painless. It was sent off, and with that, I was done!

&#x200B;

***Time:***

I was in and out of that office in just a little over an hour. I was told these appointments rarely if ever take more than 1.5 hours.

&#x200B;

***HRT Cost:***

I have insurance through Anthem. Turns out they cover self referred HRT and a host of other transgender related healthcare, so I'm paying just $10 / 3 months for 2mg Estradiol and $25 / 3 months for 50mg Spiro. Your mileage may vary depending on your insurance, but most will have on their website a way to check costs and coverage beforehand!

&#x200B;

***Conclusion:***

It was such a pleasant experience and I was positively surprised by how easy and painless the whole process was. Had I known all this beforehand, I probably wouldn't have put off the appointment for so long and saved myself a lot of worry and time for progress. If you're able to and have access to it, I can't recommended Planned Parenthood enough.

I know Planned Parenthood may be inaccessible in some states, but as I understand it, most family planning clinics that offer informed consent access across the nation operate similarly. Here's a great map resource for finding them! [https://www.them.us/story/informed-consent-hrt-map-trans-healthcare](https://www.them.us/story/informed-consent-hrt-map-trans-healthcare)"	"Thank you so much for this! I have anxiety issues too and have been putting off making an appointment for so long even though I want to get started. I feel like I searched all over for what exactly the process is so I can be mentally ready, but couldn‚Äôt seem to find anything. I decided to try again today and found your post and now I feel a little better knowing the general process. I can‚Äôt thank you enough for writing this up!! üíú

Thank you so much for this!  I was about to post and ask what the process was through Planned Parenthood and I decided to search and I found your lovely post!  This answers a massive amount of the questions I had regarding this, so thank you for sharing!
I definitely know how you feel there! Dialing the number is the hardest part, the rest is easier than you'd imagine. <3

Fuck Swedens trans healthcare	I finally took the step last year and came out after a 17 years of struggle with my identity. My family is  supportive and we brought it up with my doctor, and we then find out that not only is the waiting list for a meeting at a clinic <2 years but also that the whole process can take more than a year (and that there is a risk that after all of that I could be denied HRT on some arbitrary reason). Another punch in the gut was that I couldn‚Äôt get on the waiting list until I turned 18. I just don‚Äôt fucking know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm not sure I can make it through the year, god knows I won‚Äôt make it through 3+ years.	"I'm just going DIY, I'm not fucking waiting 4 years to get a diagnosis that I'm trans and then get shit on cus I'm autistic or something arbitrary, I'd rather pay for my own hormones and blood work than that
Try asking in r/transnord for advice and loopholes. We have quite some waiting and gatekeeping in Germany, too. Sometimes you can speed that up. Just gotta keep looking.  

Edit: they dropped some sweden specific links [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/transnord/comments/fwgl84/resources/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Swede here too. Planning to move as soon as possible. France or the Netherlands seem pretty good overall. Either that, or suffer in this fuckheap of a country where the language is shit, the culture is shittier and only method of HRT being GenderGP which costs more than fucking education.
Sweden is in the EU no? Check GenderGP, they aren't GREAT, but are a recognized healthcare organization within the EU. So they can give prescriptions for HRT. There is some sort of a vetting process but it's mostly informed consent..

I am with them now. They aren't cheap, but the service is lifesaving. Speaking from experience here.
I've heard that private Healthcare is quicker. Is that an option for you? I'm not from Europe so I have no idea how trans healthcare works there.
there are rules and procedures for a reason, it is not a medicine/treatment for a deficiency in vitamins or something like that after all, if you really want, be patient and endure it.

If you do not have the maturity to understand that maybe they are right for taking the time and doing things by the book. Just a thought.
Isn't... the education free there?
Nope not even a concept in Sweden, you have to go through the shitty system for it
Excuse me but what the fuck are you saying? If I ask to get checked for cancer they wouldn‚Äôt tell me to wait for 3 years before even starting the diagnostic treatment, let alone the actual chemo. Think just a little before commenting
I may have formulated myself incorrectly or unclearly. Assuming you keep up with your studies you're actually paid a small sum each month. I was talking about costs if you're not an EU citizen. You've gotta pay up, and GenderGP is more.
you don't have cancer, you don't have a disease.

and that is why...be mindful, respectful and thoughtful like I was to you is the minimum you should be kid, going all out and crazy like that is exactly why they are gatekeeping.

Threat people the way you want to be threated otherwise do not complain about it and how people are unfair to you.

good luck
Oh right, I forgot about that. I'm going through GenderGP myself, since the waiting times aren't much better in the Netherlands.

Also, don't hate on your language too much, you might not have heard Dutch.
What‚Äôs unfair isn‚Äôt my reaction to a broken system, it‚Äôs you supporting it and telling me that I‚Äôm not patient enough. I might not have cancer but it is just as deadly. They‚Äôre keeping me from life saving medication because of outdated knowledge about trans people and pure bigotry. The science is behind me, not you. The earlier trans people get help the less likely they are to hurt themselves. And don‚Äôt you fucking dare talk about ‚Äútreat others how you want to be treated‚Äù because you have no idea the amount of discrimination and hate I‚Äôm subjected to just because of my identity
Ik leer Nederlands. Worst part for me so far is verb conjugation, articles aren't even remotely as bad as in Swedish. Whether a word is de or het doesn't change because of region, for example, but in Swedish some words do.

Thanks for discouraging me from relocating to the Netherlands though. France it is.
You live in Sweden, there are few places so liberal, democratic and understanding like that.

They do that because is their job to take care of the people, and because science (as you said) and research about transgenderism is still evolving, they (everyone) is still learning a lot about treatments and how to best approach it, when best to do it, what should be best required before and during the treatment, they do not do that because they have a ""beef"" with you or something like that. 

&#x200B;

Again, it is not like going to the bakery and ordering a baguette and a coffee. 

Life is not fair, is it difficult in Sweden? Well, dealing with it in a productive and mature way  is part of being an adult and demonstrating to them you are ready.
I don't know anything about French trans care, but I wish you luck. I hope you have a good transition <3
Ah yes, thank you for explaining the situation I‚Äôm currently living in so much better than I ever could. Do us both a favor, stop talking about things you know nothing about or educate yourself about the complexities and nuances of the topic
sure, you are doing a great job being respectful and mature, really good job kid.
I don‚Äôt have to be mature because it isn‚Äôt my job to educate someone about things they should be adult enough to research themselves. If you make a comment on a Trans subreddit you‚Äôre either educated enough to see that my post (clearly tagged as venting) is completely justified or you come in bad faith to diminish our struggles because you don‚Äôt believe we are being discriminated against
FYI: doing things properly and by the book is not discrimination, it is their job.

Every time I go to my monthly psychiatric assessments, I wanna throw up. Possible trigger.	"Hope you're having a wonderful year. I was keeping this inside myself for a while, decided to speak up. So I need to visit my monthly psychiatric assessments as a trans person receiving gender-affirming healthcare, it's not optional sadly. And doctors there can be very ignorant, or even worse they can act weird sometimes. Every time I go, it's a different doctor and the hospital staff is supposed to have knowledge and be willing to help transgender patients, hence it's the only hospital serving gender-affirming care in my area.  I really didn't felt safe there and I was very anxious. He asked me very intrusive questions that I'd never expect from a medical professional.

Part of our conversation was like this;

Him: ""Would you have sexual intercourse with someone if they offered you?""

I was like... whaat...?

Me: ""So... if I trust a person enough and we have trustworthy, reassuring communication, I would have, just like every other person.""

Him: ""I mean if someone just asked you to have sexual intercourse with you now, would you accept?""

At this point, I was aware that he was crossing the line. I've repeated my last sentence, explicitly.

Me: ""As what every person with healthy thinking pattern would do, I would be with someone I trust enough.""

This is also because I wanted to divert the conversation and let him know that I'm not comfortable talking about this, since it's something very private. Let me ask you, would he be able to ask this to a cis woman with that entitlement and ease?

What actually made me sad is, from a medical point of view, as a psychiatrist he's supposed to ask me if hormones and my further social transition are affecting my mental health positively, or negatively. Or if I'm experiencing diminishing/increasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. He didn't even asked about this. He asked me about the effects of estradiol on my body (not asking about psychological effects) with details like he doesn't know... heaven only knows how much trans patients he's treating. Like he could easily Google it or has already heard them from other patients like me.

Vent is over, thank you if you ever read this long. I'm a sad girl tonight."	"Any way you can get a psych that's not fucked up in the head?

Or complain about the existing one? I'm concerned that they are being unprofessional and harming you.
Wildly, Offensively inappropriate.

Please report that to the hospitals HR department.

No way is that kind of questioning allowed.
Wtf is this even?  One. That guy is edging into sexual predator territory, bitnpsychiatric assessment?  I just get my pills and live life.
I‚Äôm sorry. Unfortunately, some of the ‚Äúscience‚Äù community has been pretty ignorant and full of quacks.

Kinda like the Bedford Level experiment, complete bullocks.
Sadly we cannot choose them, all docs are picking random patient documents all I can do is pray that he'll not be there. I really want to complain but I'm afraid I might not be taken seriously, my country is so backwards.
I‚Äôll try audio recording my next appointments, so if something like this happens I can easily have evidence to prove. Thank you.
I was thinking maybe younger generations of doctors would be more professional in terms of treating transgender patients. Sadly, I was wrong. It hurts and scares me that my existence itself is enough for even a healthcare provider to easily fetishize me, and I really don‚Äôt want to think about the rest of the people like potential dates etc. I bet he watches too much trans porn‚Ä¶
I'm sorry that's happening to you. That's really fucked up. Take good care of yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Don't let them hurt you.
I always record my trans, and lately non trans related appointments, at least the first time I meet the doctor, there are too many assholes in the medical field and you never know if you might get a) hate crimed b) lucky, if you get lucky you could possibly sue and make some money lol

My coming out went horribly. Now I have 2 days to make a decision.	"I'm back home for the first time since coming out to my dad, and to spare the long and short of it, it did not go well. Like, *really* not well, saying that I'm ""choosing"" to be trans, God doesn't make mistakes and that he gave him a girl, not a boy, that I'm simply just being ""influenced"" by white people to be trans (because it's not as if trans people have existed in a myriad of cultures and countries for centuries outside of America, including people from Africa), and that he'll never call me by my name or see my identity as real. What's worse is that he kept saying I'm being ""selfish"" for coming out because he's been dealing with a lot of stress these past few months (hospital bills, school fees, etc.) and that me coming out has apparently been so painful for him to deal with; he admitted that he straight up cried in the days between my coming out and when I arrived at the airport. And the rotten cherry on top of it all, he had the audacity to call the coming out letter I sent to him as garbage. The document I spent over a week drafting, editing, and agonizing over, the document I poured my heart and soul into, detailing all the pain and frustration that I had kept down for nearly *5 fucking years* apparently has no more worth than a heap of trash on the side of the road. Including resources at the end for him to look at proved to be a mistake, too, because he was actually *insulted* that I included them at all because he's a doctor, he already knows *everything* he needs to about healthcare, right?

He's been keeping this from everybody in our family (if you can even call it that at this point), including my brothers, but he's not doing it because he's actually respecting my privacy like he *said* he would in his response to my email. No, he's just been too fucking embarassed by the mere idea of havinf a trans kid defiling his legacy and doesn't want anyone else to know about it...until Friday, that is.

This is where the ultimatum comes in, although perhaps I shouldn't call it that because it's really just blackmail. Either I choose my ""family"" and repress my trans-ness in order to keep a roof over my head, or I choose to embrace my identity, get kicked out and left to fend for broke myself, and my dad spreads the news to everyone, and judging by his reaction alone, I can almost guarantee that everyone else in my wack ass family will be on his side and just come bearing down on me with the insults and ridicule.

I've misjudged my dad and this whole situation so poorly. I expected there to be *some* level of pushback. I didn't expect him to accept me right away, and I thought that maybe he would just need time to eventually come around. He's typically the more rational one of my parents when it comes to conflict, so I thought that he'd approach this situation in the same way. But he didn't. He's so resistant to having a trans child under his roof that he'd rather cut me off and let me loose in the real world early as some sort of twisted ""lesson"" for being trans, as if I would *willingly* choose to be more oppressed than I already am.

This feels like such a sick fever dream. I was such an idiot for thinking he'd accept me. So far, I think coming out was one of the worst mistakes I've made in my entire life.

**TL;DR: Dad reacted poorly to me coming out as trans, tells me I have to choose between my family or being trans and risk getting kicked out.**"	"If you‚Äôre not financially dependant then leave.

Got to say, he doesn‚Äôt sound fit to be a doctor. He could be putting patients in danger with thinking like that.
Your Dad is a capital B bigot and sees you simply as an extension of himself‚Äî not as your own person. You‚Äôll eventually leave at some point‚Äî if it is safe for you, I would consider thinking about getting out of that space sooner than later. Especially if he continues to be verbally hostile. If you can, I‚Äôd start saving money. 

I would also look into any opportunities for pro-bono therapy if it is offered to trans youth in your area. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this. And I wish you had a parent who appreciated your letter. Do you have any friends nearby who you think would be accepting?
""God doesn't make mistakes""
Yeah but biology does. If he's a doctor he's spending a good portion of his time fixing biological mistakes.

Doesn't he know about intersex people with chromosomal abnormalities? Doesn't he know about Swyer Syndrome?

I'm not saying that being trans is a biological mistake but sometimes when you talk to bigots you have to make them realize it's not a choice, it is a biological abnormality.

It's hard for bigots to wrap their heads around it because it's unseen in the mind, you can't plug your brain into theirs and let them expirience your disphoria.

The ultimatum is awful but I'm willing to bet there are a few allies among your family. If he's willing to cut you out of his life then why on earth would you give up something that would significantly help your mental well being to stay with someone against you.

I hope you have people in your life who support you because that is so important when your family doesn't.
Im sorry but this is why ill never be religious. Ppl, and it sounds like this is the case are just using god as an excuse for bigotry. 


If they actually cared what god thought, they would love and accept you for who you are. But they dont they just have a biggoted opinion of gender and sex and use god as an excuse
If you‚Äôre able to be financially independent, I‚Äôd advise that you do leave ASAP. If you feel safer playing along with what he wants in the meantime, that‚Äôs entirely fair. It‚Äôs not morally wrong to lie in self-defense against bigots.

If you need more time to become financially independent, I‚Äôd advise keeping your head down, pretending you‚Äôve seen the error of your ways and playing cis but prioritizing an exit plan on the DL, if you can tolerate it for a while. Safety is important, and it‚Äôs often better to delay transition if that‚Äôs what you have to do to avoid homelessness.
Well, that's a bag of dicks. Sorry
I'm sorry this happened to you. Your dad is really being an ass. 
If he's a doctor can you get him to read some scientific articles about transgender? Is there anyone in the family that could help you?
Your father is making this all about him when it's not about him at all. 
Sometimes initial reactions are not lasting ones but in the meantime you may have to postpone transition to stay safe.
I hope things get better for you soon.
For his patients' sake, I sincerely hope none of them are LGBTQ+. I would hate to think that any of them have heard even half of the fucked up shit he said to me.
I've suspected for a while now that and he and my mom (who's currently not available) might just see me as a trophy that they can parade around and show off to their family and friends, and this, unfortunately, just proves it. I've been seriously thinking about opening up art commissions to start gaining some type of income, so I'm already ahead of the curve on that.

I never thought about pro-bono therapy, but that's definitely something to look into after the shitshow I've been through. Unfortunately, there's no in my area that I can turn to IRL, so I'm basically on my own with this.
Even if I did, he won't read them. Like I said, he thinks he already knows *everything* because he's been a doctor for 35 years, and according to him, being trans is white people shit that was made up just so being transgender was removed from the DSM because it was now oppressing white people...your thinking really can't get anymore backwards than that. And I really don't think I can rely on a single person in my family to help me out with this either. They're also pretty religious, and the country they originate from, Nigeria, is notoriously anti-LGBT, so they're likely just going to repeat the same stuff he said, too. I'm basically fighting for myself here.
Maybe it‚Äôs reportable. I bet he wouldn‚Äôt like that.
Even if it is, it's not really in my best interests to do that. He's the only person in my immediate family with an income ever since my mom landed in the hospital, so if he loses his license and can't practice anymore, we're basically kinda fucked.

I honestly think one of these days shit‚Äôs gonna hit the fan again. We‚Äôre way past overdue for another Stonewall style incident. Non queer people forget it wasn‚Äôt just a minor protest that thats marked in celebration by rainbows, it was a 3 day riot full of arson (with cops still in the building), people fighting cops, and cars overturned. When you keep pushing and pushing and pushing, people can only take so much pressure. And when you‚Äôre at the bottom of the barrel in the social landscape, people feel they have nothing left to lose.

***disclaimer: I‚Äôm not saying anybody here should break the law and try to fight this using dangerous methods that may land people in jail or worse. I hope we won‚Äôt NEED another stonewall style event to further our livelihoods. I‚Äôm just saying though, from a historical perspective? The republicans and bible thumpers are asking for it by continuing to light the fuse of a powder keg.
I have a feeling a federal judge will come in and block it (or something similar). I hope. It won‚Äôt make the law disappear, but it‚Äôll give it time to get tied up in courts until a higher court can take a look at the case.

Everyday, no makeup look while at home recovering from surgery (5+ weeks bottom surgery, 6 yrs HRT)	"If you think I look tired, it's because I am! üòπ A little more than a month after bottom surgery, it has been a tumultuous couple of weeks since then. I have had some of my most painful nights ever in my life during this time, so many body sensations I've never felt before, and my mood have often been swinging wildly. Getting horny for the first time post op was a wild ride in of itself! üôàüòπüòµ

No real surprises for the most part, most of these experiences I knew about beforehand. But I couldn't really know how these things would actually feel, or when they would happen. About two weeks in, I had come to learn to expect the unexpected! üòÖüòÜ

As for the surgery itself, it has only gone great! One of the surgeons did more or less a chef's kiss üëå upon seeing the surgical site again, I guess that speaks to something üòÜ No complications afterward, and it has healed nicely since then üòÄ Personally, I'm overall so content and relieved, and very happy with the result üòäüíñ

As for other treatments, I have been on HRT for six years now. In hindsight, I may have been too passive about the treatment. I have just let time take its course and wait for the hormones to take effect. But I have also had no idea what my levels were actually at, and I learned somewhat recently that my doctor may have intended for me to increase my dosage over time. It was written very vaguely, basically just ""increase if neccessary"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have talked to my endocrinologist now post op, and we have decided to try a higher dose. Also, I have not been the best at always taking my medication on time üòñ This is not exclusive to HRT meds, my ADHD brain makes me forget my other medications as well... üòÆ‚Äçüí® It is definitely something I need to improve on, and get better routines overall.

I'm still doing laser facial hair removal treatments, though most of the hair is gone or not noticeable by now. It is mostly some patches on my chin, cheek and throat, as well the most stubborn upper lip hair that are left. Anecdotally, I got my first appointment for laser removal quite a bit later than what's standard here in Sweden. I ended up in a strange bureaucratic situation where I basically had a guaranteed access to healthcare, but no actual clinic to turn to within its jurisdiction ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Neither I nor any medical profressional could really do anything about it, and more or less just had to wait until the legal department of the health care system had settled on a solution. So I had my first session roughly three and half years after starting HRT.

To end off, I must say that I haven't felt this inspired and determined in a long time üò§ I've been going through the motions the last couple of years, but after the surgery I've had time to reflect on tons of things and think of where to go next. Since I've become quite chatty since the surgery (caused by a mixture of boredom at home and shifting moods üòπ), I have reached out to a lot of people that I haven't talked to in years and feel more connected to others than I have in a long time üôÇüíï"	"Your post has been filtered into a queue for further review based on a number of factors.

What do you wish healthcare workers knew about being trans?	Hey y'all, I've been asked to put together a presentation/class on managing transgender patients for EMS providers. I'm FTM and a paramedic myself, but what are things that you would want paramedics, EMTs or other healthcare providers to know if you ever needed an ambulance or to be seen in the ER? What are some good and bad experiences that you've had in these situations? This can be literally anything remotely relevant, I'm looking to add some perspective that isn't just from my own experiences. Thanks!	"This isnt me personally but I know a lot of ppl prefer not to be marked on a bracelet with their sex. Maybe have a way to be able to add pronouns to those.  I know at least my paperwork stuff for my GP has my birthname but it has my preferred name and pronouns plastered right before after or near by.
How to treat trans patients. Most have little to no knowledge on how to help us unless they specifically have an interest in it. I feel like it should be general knowledge for Healthcare providers, but since there are lots of people who push back against our very existence that'll probably never happen.
Healthcare workers should be aware of things like binders, packers, tucking, etc literally anything that trans people do to avoid dysphoria. In any situation but especially in an emergency no one should have to explain what a binder is and why that person uses it.
That trans people are not all binary. 

The pronoun ‚Äúthey‚Äù could be used for‚Ä¶. wait for it‚Ä¶. get ready‚Ä¶ ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å ‚Ä¶Any patient they first meet! üò±
This is not strictly an EMS situation, but maybe ask for pronouns?

I remember back in December I had to go get a covid test, and the nurse introduced himself and asked for my pronouns (I looked quite androgyne and was still questioning).

It changed my experience because I was ready to be referred to as a woman, as usual in medical field, and I was so grateful that he simply bothered to ask!

I feel like it can ease off a non cis patient‚Äôs mind to get that out of the way, since being in an emergency is  usually already a stressful situation. 

Thank you for doing this!


ETA: I know you have to in extreme situations, but DON‚ÄôT cut my binder! Please? Lol I know that‚Äôs non negotiable, just joking ;)
That trans women get period symptoms and more should be done to support that.
The only real issue I've personally run into is getting bloodwork is always a bit awkward.  Because at the moment I'm still listed as ""Born as male"" at Duke Medicine where I'm very obviously a woman at this point.  But my blood specifically is analyzed and labeled *Male .*  In theory I can easily change all of my Duke information to Woman (which I'll ask my Endo about next time I see her).  

But since for bloodwork they are absolutely supposed to double check you are the correct person they're doing bloodwork for.  When someone new takes my blood there will be this look of shock and confusion thinking something is wrong with their paperwork, and I have to assure them that no, I'm definitely that person but I'm transgender.

Once new nurses get used to those situations at an endocrinologist office, they settle down and its no longer a big deal.
When I was in an ambulance they asked for my medical card and saw my name and even after seeing it they still asked my preferred name and pronouns which was really good for me. They then put it on my documents for other doctors when I got to hospital.
YES I always hated this!  I was really happy with my recent surgery that mine was ***not*** labeled.  Though that was still hysterically awkward since I was there as a woman to get my balls cut off LMAO.  They were great at that surgery center though and treated me with such respect.
I just read the whole thing.

Gonna talk from an MtF medicated standpoint. 

Transwomen medication generally have massive muscle loss and fatigue as standard so some standard activities are quite hard for us. It isn't something that's funny and it's honestly something most people don't know at all. So if we look like we are struggling with something presumably easy we likely are.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The government has constantly been brushing this under the carpet and the waiting times have been growing exponentially. Some GICs won‚Äôt even take new patients anymore because the lists are so long, clinics are seeing people who were referred in 2017.

It‚Äôs causing a detrimental decline mental health for UK transgender citizens, as the only option is private healthcare, which many can‚Äôt afford. NHS is supposed to care for everyone, and has a minimum standard of 18 weeks for an appointment in all cases, yet they‚Äôve allowed this problem to grow and fester for years.

Trans & Detrans Solidarity! ‚ù§Ô∏è	"I‚Äôm a trans man and I wanted to make a post to push for solidarity between trans and detrans communities! I‚Äôm constantly seeing the narrative of trans people fighting against detrans people, but the reality is many of us support one another and we have many common struggles! 

I think the media plays a large part in dividing us because we would be stronger together. A lot of the most prominently platformed detransitioners demonize trans people and our communities, or try to assert that because transition wasn‚Äôt right for them that it shouldn‚Äôt exist for anyone else. I believe this is wrong. However, I also believe it‚Äôs wrong to hold animosity towards detransitioners who haven‚Äôt done anything to hurt us. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with questioning something and realizing the best path for you is different than you expected. Additionally, many trans people have detransitioned and later retransitioned for a variety of reasons, so there‚Äôs a lot of overlap between our communities. The existence of one of our experiences doesn‚Äôt erase the existence of another.  

While we all have different experiences, I can think of a lot of things that would help a great many of us, like an increased acceptance for people who are (or are perceived as) gender nonconforming, an increased push for gender neutral spaces, affordable and accessible housing, and most of all easier access to healthcare including mental healthcare and gender affirming care (both for trans people and cis and/or detrans people). I would love to hear more ideas in the comments.

I‚Äôm a teenager and not a doctor or anything, so if I phrased something incorrectly or disrespectfully, I apologize and would love to hear constructive feedback. However I really wanted to start this discussion! I would also love to repost this in respectful detrans spaces as well if anyone has recommendations! (I went to check r / detrans but one of the first posts I saw was about how every trans person is in a ‚Äúcult‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt think it would be super productive lol).

Wishing everyone a nice day/night!"	"The only detrans people I don't like are the ones who use their experience to push the idea that it's a bad idea to transition and that most trans people regret it. Otherwise, I think detrans people should be given the same respect and help everyone else deserves!
are these the ones who transition very young and then make a career out of trying to ban anyone else from doing it
Yes you are totally right, we should stop letting transphobes put a divide between us and using detransitioners as a weapon. Transitioning is a process of discovery and people should be allowed to try things out without outside pressure or judgement.
Agreed ‚ù§Ô∏è
FWIW, I have seen only support respect for detrans folx around here. Their journeys take them down so many of the same roads we walk. Their experiences shed important light and validation on the importance and power of gender. And they, too, have their existence politicized.

I‚Äôve said before, and will say again: I‚Äôll still happily call them family. What we have in common are ties that still bind.

I‚Äôve gotten the sense that the sub you mentioned has been dominated by a vocal and non representative group. And that anti-trans ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù dominate a lot nominally detrans spaces.
as long as detrans folks don‚Äôt say ‚Äúi used to be trans‚Äù or as someone else said, push their experience as proof being trans is wrong or whatever
That‚Äôs definitely how I feel. Also who is the funky creature in ur pfp?
Detrans people are anyone who stopped/reversed their gender transition in some way. Some are cis and some are trans/non-binary people who detransitioned due to societal pressure or another reason.
They are one of the digital drawings I made, I'm not sure what I'm gonna call them. But It's a mix of a red panda and a bunny. (Maybe a little hint of whatever Grogu and Yoda are.)

A few friends and I painted a mural to highlight the state of trans healthcare in the UK		"I stared at the bottom for two minutes wondering why it was saying ‚ÄúJason‚Äù before realizing it was a few months of the year. I love the mural, though! Great work!
I now feel lucky to have waited 2.5 years for my first appointment at the gender clinic. Waiting for 5 years would most certainly have killed me. From first appointment to starting HRT it took an additional 1.5 years. The longer the waiting times are, the more it feels like weights are being placed on top of you, until eventually you get the treatment you need or get crushed. You did a great job with this mural."	janjyn	trans	22	0.91	2020-10-13 22:02:20
I don't look cis!	"This has been on my mind since last night. To make the point of this post clear, I do pass as cis, I just don't think being told think that it's a compliment when people congratulate me for it. Of course I am happy that people see me a girl and think I'm pretty, but when people know that I'm trans and tell me that I don't look trans something just feels wrong with that.

I understand that I'm lucky to be in a situation that prompts this thought. Even before I started taking hormones strangers would sometimes call me ""miss"" when trying to get my attention. It only took a few months of estrogen before people went from mistaken me for a girl to believing entirely that I was one. The most relevant of my experiences would be those with healthcare workers. I had an experience once where I was at the ER in the middle of the night. I was the only one there. A nurse had been running up and down the halls after poking his head into the waiting room so eventually I decided to approach him to ask if he was looking for me. I explained that I'm transgender, but I didn't say anything else. When I showed him my patient wristband he exclaimed that I looked totally like a girl to him. Something felt off about this, but I assumed it was because I hadn't told him if I was a trans boy or trans girl or if the name on my ID was my preferred name. More recently I went to a clinic and still hadn't updated my ID. I have had similar experiences before this and since updating my ID, but this one was the worst of them. I had been really sick for quite a long time and went to a clinic. I told the doctor there that I'm trans after he asked if it's possible I might be pregnant and why not. I guess he didn't quite understand because he sent me for an ultrasound and had ordered two different tests. The first one was the normal kind where they scan your belly. Then the technician asked me to take my pants off because the doctor had ordered an intravaginal scan to check the uterus I had already told him I didn't have. I must have spent at least ten minutes trying to explain to the ultrasound technician that it wasn't possible because I'm trans and don't have the organ that she would be looking for. Eventually she just gave up and said that if I don't want to do it she can't force me. I figured this felt so awful because she seemed to think that I was lying to her, that I was making stuff up to get out of an uncomfortable situation.

Maybe I was right about why those experiences didn't feel good, but I think there was something more. Last night I got a message on Discord from somebody I'm in a server with but never talked to asking if I'm MtF. Considering the server the answer was pretty obviously yes. She followed up by saying that she had seen a picture of me and then congratulated because I ""look totally cis"". I don't think this is an uncommon experience for anybody who passes. I understand that it's meant as a compliment, but something has never felt right about it. I thought about it for a bit and I figured out why. The issue is that I don't look cis. I'm a trans woman and so this is what trans women look like. When people try to compliment me by saying that I look cisgender they are placing cis people above trans people. Looking cis means being attractive and looking trans means not being attractive. In my context as a girl that means cis girls are pretty and feminine while trans girls are ugly and masculine. It means that being transgender is an ugly trait that we should hide from people or make up for as best as we can. This obviously isn't what people intend when they say this, but I think it's important for recognizing how we can hold these notions about others which go against our beliefs but are just so deeply ingrained from our past experiences that we don't really recognize them. Maybe I'm a little off because I'm biracial and white-passing so I've never personally been told this, but I feel that it is comparable to telling a person of colour that they look attractive for a member of their race. I think in this day we all understand how this implies that an entire race of people is less attractive, so I don't know why so many people would say something so similar to trans people. My point is, I don't need to hide or make up for who I am. I am a trans woman and so trans women look like me. In fact, I'm not even the prettiest trans woman I've seen. Trans women can unbelievably beautiful! Transgender people are not lesser than cisgender people and it isn't a compliment to compare us. To tell us we don't look trans is just wrong because it is a fact that we do. We are trans therefore we look trans. Any suggestions otherwise show nothing more than a person's preconceived notions of what trans people are like."		fo4g0r	trans	23	0.9	2020-03-24 12:40:19
Holy shit it went fast	So about 7-8 months ago, the egg cracked, i came out to my SO like 2 months ago, i started the process to get hrt at that time and i might get the prescription on monday ! I'm so excited lol i can't wait for it ! I'm saving up for laser rn because that's expensive (120‚Ç¨ a session) but i just might declare to my healthcare that i need it to get it for free (problem is the fact i'm trans will be public for my employers and mortgage organisms). Only big thing left now is to come out to family ! I'm rly afraid to do so because i know for a fact my mom won't accept it and i don't talk to her anymore anyways and idk how my dad will react so i might wait until i'm fully independant to do so.	"Hey congrats! Time seems to fly for important things. Once you get your hrt the world will seem like a better place.
As fR as coming out to family, don't feel you need to rush it.
Either way, good luck, and keep on being awesome!
whats laser?
I believe they mean laser hair removal, a type of hair removal that basically lasers off the hair and makes it so it never/rarely grows back again. A lot of people use it for a more permanent solution to body hair related dysphoria.
i wanna do that"	qw0g04	trans	24	0.92	2021-11-17 14:28:07
"I'm reading a book about trans...everything...and I just got through the ""Law"" section and I am beyond shook. I am terrified for our future. What do we do?"	"The book is titled ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Trans"" by Brynn Tannehill. It goes into everything from what trans people experience that makes them trans to medical history to law and politics, etc. It's a really, really good book. I'm about half way through and I just got through the whole section on ""Law"".  

The book was published in 2019 and talks a ton about the Trump era, as well as his packing of courts across the country. And it makes some predictions about the future of SCOTUS and likely things the GOP would attempt with laws across the country, all of which are currently becoming realities.  

The roadmap this book lays out is BLEAK for us in the US. And has no end in sight in our lifetimes.  

I'm not one who's easily shaken. But I am visibly, physically shaken right now.  

The laws we're seeing in every red state about trans people are only the tip of the iceberg. We're going to see the fall of Obergefell and repeal of gay marriage. We're going to see trans rights stripped away through religious healthcare reform and removal of protections.   

My wife and I have the means to flee the country. But most people don't. And we don't want to. And I wouldn't want to just leave the rest of you behind.  

So what do we do? How do we stop this all from coming to fruition?  

I know this sounds alarmist, but it's really not. It's realist. If a Republican takes office in 2024, which is very likely, it's going to be chaos. The only thing between us and them right now is basically Democrats and that's really not enough. It's possible the current supreme court could pass some really terrifying rulings in the next 2 years with its current makeup.  

I'm just rambling at this point, but you can read some of Brynn's journalism here: http://www.brynntannehill.com/.  

I'm scared. What do we do?"	"What do we do?  We fight while we can, help each other who need it, and get out if we have the means and we need to.  

We do what our mothers and fathers and parents did for decades to bring us this far.  We march, and vote, and love proudly.  We arm ourselves if we can and defend ourselves against violence.  We build communities against marginalization.  

And when some of us lose the fight we remember their names.  

I agree things could get very bad.  They are already bad, and getting worse.  We survived the 50's, the 60's, aids, and we blossomed, at least some of us.  

We can bloom again.
If shit gets too bad and you have the means then go, if you want to stay and help you can't really vote to solve this issue, honestly I don't like to believe super bleak predictions of the future but if that happens then going back into hiding and dealing with the hatred isn't an option, not for me anyway, it needs to be made clear that trans people are not going to take people's shit anymore or from anyone, I would say riot or protest but maybe that won't work either and we're just gonna have to start funneling refugees out of the u.s.a. to neighboring countries.
I get that, but at this point I don't think it doesn't do as much damage as the conservatives talking... 
But I am located in Germany. Situation here is similar but not as bad as some states in the US...
Unfortunately riots would only reinforce the phobia and brand us as actually dangerous
Depends. Pride was a riot and it helped tremendously
You're right but voting doesnt really do anything anymore when there's a billion things conservative politicians can do to skirt around any real democratic change so that and the underground LGBT railroad is pretty much all I can think of.
Only riots ever change anything. Protesting peacefully does nothing
Are you talking about Stonewall? Because‚Ä¶ that was a very different situation
Yeah, I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt an option.. just that it‚Äôll be very hard to win, and even IF we were to come out ahead.. public opinion would be soured because we‚Äôd be portrayed as violent and dangerous and we go right back where we were
So our only recourse is to resort to violence because of the right-wing provocations? Then what? I don‚Äôt see an outcome through violence right now that would favour us. If they come at us first (such as Stonewall) then yes absolutely retaliate. Jumping the gun will just have it turned on us and only be counterproductive to what we want; while further cementing their case against us. Happy cake day
How so?
Well, they ARE coming at us first. That's what this post is about. They've stacked the SCOTUS in a way that gay marriage is all but guaranteed to fall in the next 5 years (likely in the next 2). And all the stuff you see happening in red states around trans people is guaranteed to get pushed to the courts as soon as the next GOP president is elected, as early as 2024.  

There hasn't been an actual ruling around whether trans people are a protected class in the SCOTUS yet and whatever the current court ends up deciding is going to become case law for literally decades. A conservative court is very very very dangerous for us and could take away our medical coverage and class protections nationwide, while rolling back all these things for the rest of the LGBT community on top of that.  

Blue states MIGHT be kinda safe. But it's hard to say. The courts could decide blue states can't do anything to go after trans/homophobic business owners who treat us poorly.  

Effectively, SCOTUS could rule that religion is a valid excuse to discriminate because otherwise the world is ""discriminating against religious people"". And that's basically the expected outcome of the current balance on the court.
Look at history. Peaceful protests do nothing.
Because it wasn‚Äôt just a riot for riot sake? Police went in with a very intentional agenda in mind. The riot that followed was reactive not preemptive. Protesting I can get behind, but going out looking for a riot is troubling at best.
Then go and do.
Ok that I get. 
But we've been protesting in peace for years now and it gets worse. Maybe it just isn't enough..
I will.
It‚Äôs not an easy situation to navigate, but jumping to the violent method I fear will just make things even worse than they are already."	vikoxy	trans	24	0.84	2022-06-23 01:13:29

I'm afraid being a trans person in the US. CW: transphobia, sexual assault	"I'm FTM and I've been transitioning for a few years now.

Transgender reality	"Maybe I've spent too much time in transphobic online spaces recently, but I feel like I'm frequently seeing comments from people saying the trans community is encouraging people to transition, that when kids and teens start questioning their gender, they go online and find a ton of support from people who push them to transition.

And, seeing the accounts of people who have detransitioned, it seems like a lot of them admit that they got sucked into the 'idea' of being trans, that they had other issues going on but that the trans community just swept them in ('like a cult' some say) and convinced them they were trans and had to transition.

I personally disagree with these accounts, and here's why:

I think the transgender community is very supportive because living life before you realize you're trans is hard, realizing you're trans can be traumatic, and actually transitioning is really difficult, painful, expensive and takes friggin forever. This community has compassion for those dealing with this stuff, and I'm constantly seeing people in this community being open to questioning people and not ""pushing"" people to call themselves trans or telling them to transition.

But, if you're suffering from any number of life's difficulties, the open support of the trans community can be a welcome salve, and I can see how someone would want to assimilate into a community like ours to have that support and sense of belonging. Unfortunately, only you, yourself can tell you if you're trans, and only you will be able to tell if transitioning is really right for you or not. If you try to transition just to be part of this community, you will probably give yourself gender dysphoria and want to detransition. And if that happens, I'm very sorry and hope the best for you, and the trans community will still be here for you, as long as you don't turn into a victimized transphobe who calls the trans community 'a cult'.

**For anyone questioning their gender and browsing this sub: Here's the truth about being trans.**

I'm fortunate enough to be in a position to have health insurance, and a very supportive wife, and can afford most of the trans care my insurance won't cover. And I live in a trans supportive state in a somewhat accepting area. Relatively speaking, my transition has been, well, 'easy'.

Transitioning is really rough. I'm 49 years old, been on HRT 2 years and recently have had some gender affirming surgeries. I've struggled with undiagnosed gender dysphoria since I was a little kid and only realized what it was in my 40s, and the realization and subsequent transition have been the hardest, most difficult, most emotional things I have ever had to do in my entire life.

Being trans means having to deal with discrimination, with bigots, etc. Being trans means healthcare isn't as straightforward as it is for cis people, and can be downright aggravating and discriminatory. Being trans can be full of self-doubt, anxiety and depression. There's frustration and anger and exasperation. There's mind games with people who knew me before transition, will they be supportive, will they be weird about it? Sometimes I wonder if the gender dysphoria I experienced before transitioning was truly worse than the shit I deal with now.

But, its also been one of the best, most rewarding, most fulfilling things I've ever done. NOT because being trans so great, but because I had this MASSIVE HOLE IN MY LIFE, and transitioning completed it for me. And I realize I can look at myself in the mirror now and its me, not some stranger. That is better than any of the anti-trans bullshit that I have to deal with now.

If you are questioning your gender, that's fine and I 100% support it! But keep an open mind about your life, and make sure your reasons for transitioning are entirely yours, not someone else's."	Great post, thank you	10o04g7	trans	25	0.94	2023-01-29 05:39:46

Decided to tell my grandmother about Biden's actions to free up trans healthcare.	"This is just a vent post

So, before this i should mention my grandmother is an extremely adamant Trump supporter, and i thought she was only mildly trans-phobic, mostly just not understanding.

Anyway, she was fixing dinner and i told her about the news. Her reaction involved calling Biden things like stupid, degenerate, and whatever else she said in the conversation afterward. When i asked her how it was apparently bad that people were getting access to something they should have the basic right to, she responded with ""When you are old enough you will understand why someone else limiting what you can and can't do with your body is a good thing""

She only said that because she didn't have an explanation, instead blaming it on me being to young, but i guess just add that to the pile of reasons i won't be telling her anything."	"[deleted]
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
Well let me tell you this he's only doing that because he knows that he might not win in 2024 so he's trying to make himself look good I mean it's exactly what Trump did with his voter pool he made himself look like the candidate that'd sort everything out when in reality he was a billionaire out of his depth and didn't really know what he was doing even his transgender military ban makes no sense so either he lied about them being a financial burden or he was just mistaken Biden however he's been in office for what 4 5 months and has already announced the spending of 4 trillion dollars which is what previous presidents spent in a year it's absolutely insane Trump is an unstable narcissistic megalomaniac and Biden is a virtue signalling clueless clown all politicians are the same if he truly cared about trans folks he A wouldn't have chosen Kamala Throw That Trans Woman In A Male Prison Harris and he would've done more far far sooner so please don't mistake his virtue signalling as him caring about trans folks he doesn't he's just trying to make himself look good despite being a hypocrite he criticised Trump for being a racist yet he's possibly just as racist as Trump let's not forget what he did back in the 90's I believe or what he said about Obama
Well shes actually my great grandmother, and isnt a boomer, i just have a much closer relationship with her than my actual grandma so i just call her that.
This post was just talking about my grandmother, j never praised him i dont think. I really didnt need an essay on your belief about Biden.
[deleted]
It's not my belief about him it's more my complete inability to grasp why anyone thinks any politician actually cares about anyone but themselves even going all the way back to Washington and the war of independence that was primarily about how the British were taxing tea too much and the rich didn't like that because it cut into their profits none of them were anti British they were just anti tax so they were like me libertarian bordering on anarchist
Thankfully my parents i believe would be understanding at the least, maybe not quite understand but still supportive.
Yeah, and i never said anything about Biden other than what he's just done, like saying that flys can walk too, just a fact and nothing more.

I personally don't like Joe Biden very much, haven't been super favorable of most politicians recently, but if you wanted to scream about everyone's inability to see his virtue signaling maybe say that on a post praising him while being unaware of his virtue signaling. All i talked about was my transphobic grandmother and her reaction to his statement.
Why's it not obvious that Biden is Trump's puppet Trump is still in charge he's controlling Biden via a chip the CIA implanted in his brain
Ok you can go now, i think you've overstayed your welcome.

I know this is a troll, but if someone actually believes that then holy shit.
For once I say something completely outlandish and someone says it's a troll and it actually is a troll usually when I say ""crazy"" things I'm being serious

Im absolutely terrified	"I'm 16, and a week from now I have my first appointment/consultation at the gender clinic.  I'm so grateful that I get to go to this, and that I have access to healthcare. 

However, since I'm only 16, if I want to do any medical transitioning it has to go through my parents. And yes, my mom made the appointment for me... but I'm scared she and my dad aren't gonna let me do anything. Thry know the next step I want to take is going on testosterone, but they haven't exactly been open to the idea.... My dad said I might get cancer and other health problems. And yesh, I might, but I literally can't live the way I've been living anymore. Something has to change soon. My dysphoria has gotten so bad that some days I can't look at any male without getting upset. I know that sounds kinda stupid and dramatic but it happens. I've tried everything I can to pass without any medical transitioning and I still get misgendered more often than not. Nobody actually sees me as a guy. Especially not my parents.

I've been worried sick about what's gonna happen at the consultation I can't focus on school or the show I'm in or driver's ed. I don't know what to do."	"If your parents were willing to get you an appointment at a gender clinic, that‚Äôs encouraging! Be honest at your appointment, and it‚Äôs likely that the people at the clinic will have your back with your parents. They can also explain factually the risks (probably not as much as your parents are imagining) and benefits of HRT, and as medical professionals specializing in such, are likely to be taken seriously by your parents. 

Worst case scenario, you only have two more years before you‚Äôre 18 and no longer need your parents‚Äô sign-off. I know that probably seems like forever to endure, but it‚Äôs tiny compared to the rest of your life after 18 that you‚Äôll be able to really live as yourself, and even if your parents won‚Äôt immediately sign off doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt ever if you keep working on convincing them that this is what‚Äôs best for you - they may need both information and time to process it. 

Good luck bro! Gender clinic consultation is a step forward on your journey, and odds are good it‚Äôll go better than you fear.

(And it‚Äôs not stupid and dramatic to experience dysphoria and gender envy at all. You‚Äôre in the middle of a really hard time, it‚Äôs normal to be feeling some kinda way. Try to at least be gentle with yourself, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with your emotions).
Just saying Testosterone won‚Äôt give you cancer lol. Your risk for certain health problems may increase but you‚Äôll be okay. I‚Äôve definitely had many times where just looking at other men made me dysphoric. One time I was talking to a cis male friend and I just felt so feminine in comparison lmao. Which is dumb but dysphoria can be dumb like that. Good lucküíô
Cancer and other health problems?  No you will not get cancer or other health problems from monitored HRT.  HRT does not increase your risk of cancer period.  And complications from medications can be mitigated to the point of no negatives so long as you monitor progress.

What they should be worried about is your mental health for NOT taking medication.  And I would reinforce that during and after your appointment.  I am happy to here your mother made the appointment and recognizes you need help.  Just be very forward at your appointment that you don't feel comfortable as your current gender and you see a happy future as your desired gender.

And do the same with your family.  That you are NOT happy and don't see a successful future as your current gender.  And you know if you start HRT, transition to your desired gender you see a future where you will thrive.

Also, big huggles and good luck!
Take a deep breath. If you got an appointment set up obviously your parents have your best interests at heart. It could just work out. If your dad brings up cancer again just point out that being alive is killing everyone, at least this way you could be happy too.

Also, i thought i was weird for freaking out everytime i see a woman and then know I'll never be that pretty. It's comforting to know I'm not the only one. Still sucks we feel this tho
I can't speak for every clinic, but my consultation at Planned Parenthood went really well and the staff were very supportive. Wishing you luck!

I am reading the DSM-5 at 11PM	"Context:


Good friend R and I have lived together several times. I'm NB, out to him for about 6 years, I started HRT and surgical planning while living with him and his wife.
R has many years experience of clinical assessment and several years of youth work. R recently started practicing therapy, focusing on LGBTQ and youth. I gave R explicit permission to ask me about LGBTQ stuff.


What happened:


R described a case of a 13 yo who identifies as trans. R's plan of treatment is social transition, no puberty blockers, rigid gender presentation (he/him no they/them because he is a binary trans person). I think puberty blockers should be on the table, but I don't know much about them. I was asking questions about gender dysmorphia v. gender dysphoria because I'm not a clinician. Conversation wraps up, we play Mario Kart.


I go home and look up my diagnoses, in particular because I remember getting a minority stress diagnosis which is funny to me. I text R a screenshot of my chart for the lolz. 

R: I don't think you have gender dysphoria, I think a lot of people misdiagnose.

Me: This is the diagnosis that gets me healthcare, so....

R: Fair enough





I feel it was inappropriate for him to say that I don't have gender dysphoria. Like, why did I go through 2nd puberty at 28, arrange my life around surgeries, and go through the horror that is 'dating as openly trans'? Plus, he's not my clinician! We're close, but I didn't give him my personal history or discuss in-depth my physical discomfort.


And now I'm reading the DSM-5 to see if I was misdiagnosed. And venting on Reddit instead of communicating with my friend. He's often impulsive and I don't want to squish his baby therapist aspirations. But this one is definitely going in the Queer Resilience Workbook later.


tl;dr: gender is as fake as money, nobody knows what they're doing."	"I am a therapist. Regardless of the specifics of your symptoms, your friend is in the wrong. Every therapist is taught over and over that it's inappropriate (not to mention unethical and sometimes even potentially illegal) to diagnose someone who is not your client. Telling someone they don't have a diagnosis firmly falls into that category. I'm sure he wasn't trying to do that and likely doesn't see what he did in that way, but the fact that you're upset and uncomfortable with this makes it even clearer he's crossed some lines he should know better than to cross. It doesn't matter that you showed him your chart and diagnoses, he's your friend and not your therapist. Mixing those roles makes for a dangerous dual relationship.

Tangentially, the gender dysphoria diagnosis in the DSM-5 is all sorts of flawed and controversial. You said it best, you use it to pay for your healthcare. Most therapists (at least in my circles) use it the same way, even if it's a poorly thought out diagnosis that significantly fallen behind the current research. A new DSM is due soon, so fingers crossed. I admire therapists that use diagnoses as the tools they are, as opposed to pretending that an F code or two can really capture the full nuance of a unique human experience.
Gonna preface this by saying I'm not a therapist, and I'm not part of an oppressed minority (other than being trans), so I am nothing even vaguely resembling an expert here. Disclaimer complete, moving on.

Minority stress seems like something that could easily be co-morbid with gender dysphoria, seeing as trans people are an oppressed minority that suffers social stress as a result of being trans. Basically, having one doesn't preclude you from having the other.
I think that they problem is with the definition of gender dysphoria in the DSM.

Its presented as a binary.  You either have it,  or you don't. 

I think that this way of looking at it is incorrect and I think that dysphoria (and euphoria) are spectrums (but humans like to put things into binaries for some reason).

I think that dysphoria can present in low levels,  low enough that they aren't easily recognisable.  For myself,  I only really recognised my dysphoria by the euphoria I felt with gender affirmation.


If you see everything as black and white, you miss all of the colours.
I had a similar experience with noticing dysphoria around my body because of euphoria I experienced when trying a binder, masculine makeup, etc. For the sake of getting the treatment I need, I usually lie and say I‚Äôve always felt it rather than telling them that I only discovered it recently. I knew I didn‚Äôt like my body, but I just attributed it to having low self esteem. Also I think a lot of people think that being trans and having gender dysphoria are equivalent. I think anyone who has the desire to express themselves differently than with the labels put on them by society has the right to do so.
The way I kind of think about it is... once I experienced euphoria, I realised that my baseline level of happiness was in the negative.   Ive had moments of happiness in my life and moments of depression,  but the euphoria made me realise that day to day,  I've just never really been... happy?  Happy with who I am.  Even content with who I am. 

I know that I have dysphoria,  because I experience euphoria so much more strongly."	stmo6i	trans	20	0.95	2022-02-16 04:16:41
Parents worried about me transitioning	"Ok, hello. For context I am a 16 year old trans girl who found out she is trans earlier this year, is starting to come out publicly, and has told her parents about 6 months ago

So, I was talking to my mam today in the car when we were driving. The topic of me being trans has always been a bit of a taboo topic with them and I have no idea why. My mother has said that she finds it hard to accept that I'm trans because it's like a son of hers has died, cause she's always known me as her son, but apparently I don't want to be her son. I tried to explain I'm the same I've always been and that's never gonna change but she said that she knows, but that she had two sons and a daughter, and now she has to come to terms with having a son and two daughters.

The topic of hormones also came up, because my plan is to go private with hormones ( because the Irish healthcare system is complete shit) and get a job asap so I can get prescribed hormones from my go and but hrt off of GenderGP.
My mam said that she thinks that it is a terrible idea to buy medication online, cause I don't know if it's a scam or what the hell is in them. I told her I did research on it and id ask my go about it, but then she said that I might decide I'm not trans in the future, and that I might regret taking hormones.

Her and my dad are adamant on the fact that I might regret transitioning in the future and that I should wait and see, but 1, I have no idea how long they want me to wait, and I don't want male puberty to make my masculine features even worse, and 2, there's literally no way I can argue with her statement, it's impossible to know what I'll think in the future. I'm starting to feel doubtful, but I'm really sure I'm trans, and I hate the thought that I'll transition and regret it 

I don't want that to hold me back though, so Id like for any of you to give me some advice on what to do, what to say to my parents or GP, or if there is anything I can do to prove that I am trans to myself.

Sorry for venting a bit. I can answer any questions you may have also."	"Idk how to help, but my parents are absolutely not on board. The only sources they accept are Christian ones, and those seem to utilize entirely anecdotal cases of regret, not like, actual studies of thousands of people who's lives improved from transitioning.

Their opinion is that our society and the scientific community is blinded by the trans agenda and they just refuse to report anything that isn't promoting people being trans. Not sure how to make an argument against ""statics are fake"".

Many anecdotes cited as someone regretting their transition have been corrected/challenged by the original authors.

Someday, I'll be unable to hide my transition. It's going to be real awkward at holidays.
Well, first, good for you for keeping them involved in the dialogue. It‚Äôs not about asking permission; it‚Äôs about making them feel like their own voices are heard, and recognizing they are part of your transition.

Give them space to let their opinions evolve.

Second, puberty blockers can be your first, easy, and reversible choice to buy yourself time to sort out a plan for estrogen/t-blockers etc.

Third, you all should read the WPATH guidelines for care (there is a forthcoming update that is in comment stage by the way).

Think about connecting them with a parental support group for parents of trans kids, but ensure it‚Äôs not some ‚Äúanti-‚Äú group. Everyone should understand that the open groups on places like Reddit are deeply suspect for accuracy (yes, especially Reddit).

On the ‚Äúproving you are transgender‚Äù topic:

The nature of why we are the way we are is a mystery. There are theories. But the ‚Äúprove you‚Äôre trans‚Äù or ‚Äúhow do I know I‚Äôm trans‚Äù is a rabbit hole that has no solution.

However, to address her argument about ‚Äúyou might regret it:

1. The regret rate for adult transition globally is around 2%-4%, historically.

2. Regret is something that all adults deal with in their lives. It is part of owning yourself. It‚Äôs difficult for parents to accept their child has reached a stage of autonomy and agency, but at 16, that‚Äôs generally considered medical age of majority.

3. Whether she turns out to be right, or turns out to be wrong, it is your body, and your decision, and you need to be willing to accept responsibility for the decisions you make.

I transitioned, quite successfully, from age 44. Slowly, and then fully at age 50. I have no regrets. If you want to buy yourself some space, look at puberty blockers first.

Being a transgender person is not necessarily about some biological difference in your body. It‚Äôs about how you best move through the world in the gender that makes you most comfortable. It‚Äôs not necessary to have a biological proof of why you feel this way.

Our societal difficulty with this concept stems from the historical link of biological sex and gender which we now recognize as distinctly different from each other.

We can use hormones to develop secondary sex characteristics that make it easier for a bio-centric, gender binary society to accept us (and for us to accept ourselves, although we can do that without HRT too). We can also use them to create shifts in our emotional bandwidth - there‚Äôs a big difference living in a testosterone filled body vs estrogen filled body to be sure.

My theory is that transgender people represent an evolution beyond a gender binary that has been reproductive-focused. When we discovered chromosomes, hormones, and more recently, CAT/CT and MRI scanning and studied the human brain more carefully, and developed the social sciences, we discovered there are a lot more factors that go into sex and gender than we knew before. Like 16 different  human chromosomal ‚Äúkaryotypes‚Äù that determine biological sex. However, the genes on those chromosomes and their functions are not fully understood*.

The point is, our understanding of biological sex continues to evolve. It‚Äôs not settled by any means, contrary to popular belief.

Our understanding of gender is equally evolving.

The only way you can really make a decision for yourself is, ‚ÄúWhat makes you happiest?‚Äù

In that I hope your parents will agree is in both your best interests.

Have you had counselling? Transitioning is a massive decision and you need to be sure it's what you want. My advice would be to seek out an LGBT friendly therapist before anything else. I really wouldn't let what your parents say make you doubt yourself, you know who you are much better than they do
I'm sorry to hear that, it's the worst whenever a parent just wont listen to reason and statistics just because the Catholic church says so. 

I hope the holidays go well for you. It's your life not theirs, so if they really want you to stop, fuck them. It's your choice
Just say to your parents that even Jesus was reborn and was still loved by his father. Also can we point out that society and religion have given a gender to god but can't accept people wanting to change theirs.
Agreed! Keep on trusting yourself and trying different ways to show them how confident you are. Somehow they might be convinced with some more time and persistence
At this point, I can just not talk with them about it. I'm technically out, but we'll probably just pretend I'm not until I can't boymode anymore. Then I either deal with it, or stop visiting.
They really think that the best call would be to find the underlying issue that's causing my gender mismatch (change the mind, rather than the body/expression).

The examples they can find where that's been a solution for people seem to be due to abuse or other mental issues. I've dived intoy subconscious as best I can, and the thing that's been repressed is my feelings about my gender, not something causing them.

My repressed feelings about gender ""leaked"" into my life a lot, I can't find any other such leaks so far. I'm not afraid of parts of myself anymore, which is the clearest way I've seen to find repression. Even if there is something, how would I find it?"	re77mx	trans	18	0.96	2021-12-11 19:44:43

Parents denied transition, feeling hopeless and awful [TW]	"My parents came to me (15 MtF) this morning to tell me they would not allow me to medically transition. I have been making progress with them for 1 year now, and I thought I was finally getting through to them, but they have now taken a huge step backwards. My ‚Äúegg‚Äù cracked almost 2 years ago, and came out to my parents a year ago, and I thought they were supportive, but it turns out they will not support my medical transition. They are mostly positive when it comes to social transition, it took 7 months for them to agree to use my name and pronouns, but they are doing so mostly consistently now, and are letting me buy clothes and come out to more people, but refuse to allow me to start my journey with medical transition. They want me to socially transition fully and live as myself for an arbitrary amount of time of their choosing, which of course they will not tell me, and get a full diagnosis from a qualified expert gender therapist before they even think about it. I have been seeing a regular therapist for 9 months now, who is very supportive of me, but her opinion is not good enough for my parents. Knowing how parents often are, after I do what they want me to, they will likely extend the wait time.

Male puberty is wrecking me emotionally, and rapidly eroding my mental health, and it is continuing to get worse and worse every day. My parents are forcing me through male puberty, and I am afraid that by the time I can get access to medication, puberty will have irreversibly damaged my body, and will worsen my results from HRT down the line, and this is very distressing for me, as I am at a time in my life that I can start medication before all the damage is done, and I will almost certainly regret not starting now, and mourn the years of my childhood I am losing now. 

My country (UK) does not have a functional healthcare system, it has wait times of 4 to well over 10 years for trans patients. There is only one private service that allows patients under 18, which my parents despise and distrust, as some pharmacies do not agree with how easy it is to get hormones from them, and it‚Äôs founder is no longer qualified to practice, as our government and healthcare system did not agree with how she prescribed hormones to under 18s, and didn‚Äôt always provide adequate follow up care.

My mental health is getting worse and worse very quickly and I fear that I will end up dead by my own hand in coming months and years, as my last hope for medical transition has gone, and dealing with increasingly severe gender dysphoria for another three years is not something I can manage. I feel like I no longer have a future, and it really hurts. 

My current school is a brutal and barbaric hellhole, and I have faced extreme bullying for the four years I‚Äôve been here, it is not safe to come out to them, as I would likely be in danger doing so. My classmates are incredibly bigoted, and would make my life into even more of a hell than it already is. My school separates boys and girls, and I would continue to be in boys-only classes after coming out, even if the school wanted to, they couldn‚Äôt put me in girls classes due to timetable issues, and the way exams work in the UK. I have to spend another year here, then I can either move to another school, and risk more extreme bullying (with no medical help I will be a long way from passing), or apply for an apprenticeship position somewhere, and try my luck at getting a job, which would be difficult as a 16 year old, especially after having to deal with workplace transphobia at such a young age, although the money would be very useful to pay for private care and to move away at 18, and I could make up for the rest of my education by taking evening classes at 19 or in my 20s post-transition, which seems like a very risky option. It would also be harder to leave the country (which I plan to do) because getting a student VISA without many education qualifications would be very hard to do as far as I know. So I cannot access medical care, and I cannot move out, and am left to the will of my parents.

I told my parents how upset I was that they were trying to control my body, and my dad said ‚Äúwe are not controlling your body, we‚Äôre resisting you from controlling your OWN body‚Äù

I am very upset, and feel hopeless and depressed, to any of those still reading, thank you, what should I do next?"	"Prevention you from controling you body is literally the same thing as then controling your body. They are just forcing the option inaction gives on you. (By this same logic making abortion illegal is also not controling people‚Äôs bodies)

Sorry that I don‚Äôt have a lot of advice though. Maybe look for a school that does not segregate classes by gender? That might help a little bit, but I have no real experience with this (in my country schools don‚Äôt segregate classes by gender. It just seems the absolute worst that would have made my life so much harder back then even though I still saw myself as a girl back then)
Have you tried talking to your parents about puberty blockers?  It might be a middle ground they could agree on so at least your body doesn't continue to develop in a way you don't want.

This article does a good job of covering the pros and cons of puberty blockers.  Maybe you and your parents could read something like this together and have an honest conversation about your concerns with their proposed plan.

https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-are-puberty-blockers/
You're still young and have so much of your life ahead of you, the one thing I'd implore you to take on as a fellow UK citizen is to be patient, your parents will be skeptical, especially if you are an only child as, chances are they've never experienced something like this before. They're uneducated, which is not always their fault. They're likely as confused as you are, which is not to say they are in the same situation, us trans folk struggle day to day with our identity and so on, but you need to understand that they likely want what's best for you, as evident by their supportive yet hesitant nature.

Try and think optimistically about these things, you've came out to your parents at SUCH an early age, that's fantastic. From my experience, going through puberty is not a huge deal and will not affect your hormone treatment much at all later down the line. The best thing you can do right now is keep your options open. Contact your GP if you're comfortable and certain and get a referral ASAP, then you're already on the waiting lists and can be on your way to transitioning. When you're 18 it's not really up to your parents what you do with your body, until then try and enjoy your teens. Relax and continue to make progress with your social transition.

As for school, I honestly can't say as much as I wasn't even dreaming about coming out at that point of my life. Was way too scary a concept for me. But thinking back, I'm certain if I'd told a head of year or my personal tutor about things they could perhaps understand and give advice or make you feel more comfortable in your situation. Preferably someone you trust. The way I see it there's different bubbles within your social transition. For me it was my various friend groups, family, and work. Coming out to one group might be harder than another. But you start with one person, one you trust the most in that group/bubble of people and gain some confidence. At least then you have some ground to build from, you get what I mean?

I know this is all hard trust me I've been through it all and I wish I had the courage to come out when I was 15. I also understand the frustration behind the waiting game after you've come out and want to start moving forward with your transition but you need to understand these things take time, but you have to think of the end goal here and think of how much happier you will be at the end of it all. That's how I and many others got through it, so stay strong for me and please feel free to reach out if you need to talk, love you and don't ever let anyone tell you you're not beautiful üíñ
Yeah, most schools in my country don‚Äôt do that either, my school is just weird
The only way I could get access to blockers would be through GenderGP, which my parents don‚Äôt like
Ah.  I'm sorry to hear that. ‚òπÔ∏è

It might still be worth having the conversation though?  I think your parents really care about you, they just can't understand what you're feeling right now.  It's so far outside of their experiences in life that it makes no sense to them.

I'm not saying that to make you feel like your experience is invalid, it's definitely not!  I've just been surprised at the conversations I continue to have with my family members because they just can't make sense of it.  So you might just need to keep talking to them about it in a calm and logical way."	w74pk8	trans	18	0.88	2022-07-24 20:12:47
Florida Ban Trans Healthcare for poor people	I had to cancel my HRT appointment I waited 10 years for because of the state ban on Insurance covered Trans Healthcare I am so heartbroken and can't stop crying	"It sounds like a nightmare.  I‚Äôm sure you would leave if you could.
What shitty insurance company was this that took such action before the bill has even passed one chamber of the legislature, let alone be signed into law?
Planned parenthood and sliding scale?
I just use folx only cost me 119 without insurance
This is so horrible.
It's more planned parenthood than my insurance, planned parenthood flagged me when I put in my insurance as my payment for GAC with a little box saying insurance cannot be used due to the ban. I'm guessing they're doing it preemptively so that people don't start HRT to just have it taken away ASAP.
I was using PP and I have 0 income for the sliding scale to apply to
I believe this same bill will ban telehealth for trans people.    We'll have no choice but to see a doctor a physician in person and to sign our lives away at every visit.
    Which is of course... Absurd.
 Also what are we supposed to do when we have surgeries (down there) are we going to have to lie and say we had some other kind of procedure done so that we can have access to  gac?
What!!!! The ever lasting fuck
Yeah, i know...
until we can actually get these laws reversed we should probably start some sort of buddy system and utilize any loop holes or resources we can find.

It became clear that even though most people are caring and helpful in healthcare there‚Äôs always a handful that will stand in our way to get even the most basic care. It took me one week, two hospitals, hunger , cruelty against me, and marginalization. If my primary care had not emailed me the detailed data about My condition, the infectious desease doctor at the hospital would have not treated me. She didn‚Äôt even want to look at the evidence.

my mom thinks im selfish for wanting to get gender affirming healthcare before leaving home	"around 2 weeks ago i(14 mtf) had a ""talk"" with my mom(f 47) not at all consented by me about my transness. I came out to her around 1 year and 3 months ago.

She started by cornering me in my room after i was talking about when was my next therapist session with her by closing the door and asking me what was my objective with my therapist (lets call her lucy) and my speech therapist (lets call her eva) and that she heard over the conversation i had with eva to try and feminize my voice and coming out to her. I said that my objective with lucy was to better myself mentally and try to deal with my anxiety and stuff like it and the deals that come with life, and eva to better my speech (all true btw), and she said that she hoped i wasnt trying to manipulate her into accepting that im trans.

After this she talked about her fears about this and read to me [this article](https://quillette.com/2017/10/06/misunderstanding-new-kind-gender-dysphoria/) and she said she feared that id become like him (she always called him by she/her) and i tried to explain to her that those are not true, that rogd is not a thing but she didnt listen and said that ""i am looking this only by narrow, rose tinted glasses"".

then she started to talk about friendships and how many bad friendships will appear and that i should measure my steps (this is about a friend(lets call her francie) that helped me start experimenting my presentation and my ex best friend(lets call him rex) that recently came out as trans too) and that good friends we dont just stumble onto.

she also talked about getting away from family, and brought as an example my gay cousin: he came out at the end of his diploma, almost non dependent to his family and everyone knew he was gay and he still got away from his, and id be getting even more because of the impact. i have no idea what she meant on this, is she putting the blame on me for getting away from her? also, shes a huge believer in rogd and that ill detransition.

And then she called me selfish because if she let me transition rn everyone would call her crazy because she let a child transition, and no mother would let their child in the house of a >!tr4nny!< and she would never let me get on blockers nor affirm my gender identity under her roof and shed be an accomplice to every damage testosterone does to my body for my own good, plus, she said that if i showed dysphoria since i was young, shed actually let me do it, but i showed a ""(very fragile) masculinity"" and ""aversion to anything even remotely girly"" and that proves to her that im not trans.

she actually made me so afraid to come out to anyone else now that i dont know what to do anymore. i was planning to come out to some of my teachers, now im barely able to express my sexuality (of which im really open at school) confortably. shes a master at mnipulating me. fuck.

she is also ""researching"" a lot on detransition and rogd now and is basically a terf. im afraid she'll get on agp soon. i dont know what to do. i regret coming out to them. im only 14 ffs aaaaaaaaaaaa."

Fine; I get my pain disregarded all the time. My experiences, when given, are disregarded.

I went to the ER for the same issue, and i was gawked at by many members of the medical staff and constantly misgendered and deadnamed.

Florida is about to deal a major blow to trans healthcare	"[A few hrs ago](https://twitter.com/ZJemptv/status/1553572825847533574) the florida dept of health published their trans healthcare ban, set to be voted on next week on [August 5](https://twitter.com/ZJemptv/status/1553573565601136642). This includes:

\- No puberty blockers for anyone under 18.

\- Mandatory 24-hour waiting periods for treatment, along with filling out new informed consent forms for HRT and sex reassignment surgery, which are littered with misinformation.

\- Forcing providers to give patients state-mandated misinformation.

WTF is this? All of the data here is so extremely cherry-picked my eyes are rolling backwards by 50 miles. If they can threaten the licenses of doctors who provide this care, does that mean transitioning in general will be outlawed? This is politicizing medicine and will harm thousands of trans Floridians.  
Christ, I (ftm 22) was planning to start with FOLX or Plume in august. Does this mean i won't be able to now because of this?"	"These policies seem to be specific to anyone under 18.  Although I wouldn't put it past ol' Ron to push for a total ban regardless of age.

Side note:  ""Florida Fact Checked"" is possibly one of the most useless stamps anyone could put on a document.
ugh im in FL and been using plume and queerdoc. its hard enough to find local healthcare.
These are guidelines. They are not law. They are also based on lies put forward by a special interest group not actual doctors that work in this field. It is made out of ignorance and fear."	wcnzde	trans	17	0.9	2022-07-31 12:50:07
Advice for a mom?	"Hi! I am the proud mom of two kids, the oldest of which is 11 and currently identifies as gender-fluid or non-binary. They‚Äôre on puberty blockers, they wear a binder, and we go to a great gender diversity clinic which offers everything from healthcare to psychiatric care (all of which my kiddo takes part in). Their dad, younger sibling, and I are fully supportive and accepting, and fight whatever battles we have to with extended family, friends, and people in general. 

My kiddo was AFAB and is starting to lean more toward wanting to be FTM physically than non-binary, and has questions about phalloplasty and what other options are available. I want them to be as happy in their own body as possible and, though I know we have several years before any surgery will take place, I want them to know all the facts. We‚Äôve done the medical research bit, but I was hoping maybe someone who‚Äôs been through it could tell me whether or not it‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs several procedures for what seems like sometimes iffy results. 

I realize I‚Äôm asking a lot of strangers. Check out my post/comment history or DM me any questions you have to verify that I‚Äôm not trolling or being weird. I just want my kid to love themself and know what is possible in the future if they choose to go the route of surgery. 

Thank you!"	"I'd say check out JammiDodger in YouTube.

He's FTM and literally has a PHD on trans issues.

He has a video talking about his bottom surgery and what it did for him so he's a good starting point, in my, admittedly cis, opinion.
If you didn‚Äòt know it yet, check out r/cisparenttranskid.  

As for a nice review what phalloplasty means, I recommend [Fins youtube](https://m.youtube.com/user/FinnTheInfinncible). He did several videos about it and also wrote a book called ‚Äûtop to bottom‚Äú about the mental aspects of transitioning.
Can't really help you but just wanted to say you are an amazing mum and your kid is lucky to have you
It sends like you‚Äôre doing everything right. Just continue to be supportive of your child‚Äôs journey to find their identity and continue to engage in conversation with them and their doctors but I don‚Äôt need to tell you that. Also couple years is long time for an 11 and they will change drastically in terms of identity and expression. It‚Äôs really good that you‚Äôre having these conversations now but a lot more clarity and assurance of the right thing to do will come with time and age. The worst thing you could do is to stop conversation and exploration, which doesn‚Äôt seem like the case. If anything you should be very proud that you‚Äôre giving your child the opportunity and cultivating a maturity, at such a young age, that many of us don‚Äôt get until much later in life, and it 100% will lead to better decisions being made and better result for your child. I didn‚Äôt have any ability to even conceive of my queer identity at that age, let alone articulate it to anyone else. Thank you for setting the example.
Thank you, everyone!"	twp83p	trans	17	0.91	2022-04-05 07:19:36
Future healthcare provider here. Patient came in trans M to F, came out recently, first appt about it. Guidance/advice/help needed	"Title. I haven¬¥t had this conversation before so I just screened for clotting risk factors (assuming estrogen is part of hormone replacement therapy), asked for goals of treatment and referred to the local transgender clinic. There was no discussion, just ""I¬¥m trans M to F"" ""ok""*screening for clotting risk factors* ""are you going for hormones or all the way to surg?"" ""to surg"" ""ok. Idk what I¬¥m doing but there¬¥s a gender clinic ____ so I¬¥ll refer you there"" ""ok"" done. It was clear I was out of my depth and just--can you tell me anything you think I should know about trans-focused appointments? How providers have done well by you, done poorly, your expectations, just literally anything. I¬¥m at the level of if someone tells me their pronouns when I enter the room/have them in chart, use them."	"I would suggest saying your pronouns to everyone and/or having a pronoun pin. when I hear/see that, I automatically know this is a safe person who is on my side. you clearly care though, and I guarantee that comes through. you should do some research on what trans healthcare entails. for example, transfeminine people who medically transition often take testosterone blockers and estrogen, while transmasculine people only take testosterone (no blockers), and what are the different forms of those medicines, and what surgeries people may be interested in, etc. I expect my providers to know the basics about trans people. Most don't, which is disappointing, but trans-competent healthcare workers are *the best*.
That's... Pretty good, honestly. There's some informed consent stuff that needs to be talked about, but the clinic would do that (and the necessary blood checks usually). You basically nailed it. No really invasive questioning or challenging their self id. Probably should have asked if they'd like a referral to a therapist or if they're alright otherwise (don't assume that they need it, as some folks don't/already have one, but it's nice to have an option/referral)

Honestly, for GPs, the trans community just needs acceptance and referral, and the ability to do maintenance. Read up on the hrt dosage recommendations for if they come back in and want to mess with it for whatever reason (I've had to educate my Endo on alternative meds because prometrium, the most commonly used progestin that's used in the U.S. contains peanut oil, and I'm allergic, so no one's really expecting you to be an expert on that type of stuff (synthetic medroxyprogesterone works just as well, but it has withdrawal drawbacks)); otherwise, the patient is just like treating a mix of both a male and a female. A trans woman will need screening for breast cancer, as well as screening for prostate; though they have a higher likelihood of breast cancer than prostate. Vice versa for trans men and breast and cervical cervical cancer. It's hard to give hard and fast rules here though, because things change depending on how far along transition the patient is. From a lay person's perspective though; it all honestly sounds really common sense to me. Like, it seems common sense that a trans man still needs an OB/GYN. A trans woman will have the endocrine system a woman, so treat accordingly.
The fact that you know the correct steps to take when you are out of your depth and know what to do next without trying to stop anyone seeking their medical care is a huge thing! Thank you for being genuinely accessible.
WPATH 8 is a great place to start because it does advise on practices. Though the WPATH 7 is  currently what is standard (the WPATH 8 only came out this year). It's likely that clinic you referred to has developed some resources both for providers and for community use that may be of use to you (maybe you can snag or ask for some, they're probably online too) They may also offer trainings or have staff that can perform outreach.

I'm not a provider but I do interact with many patients in my work and I always ask what their currently preferred name and pronouns are unless I know I've otherwise asked them.I also know Fenway Health has modules and resources for transgender cultural competency at [https://www.lgbtqiahealtheducation.org/](https://www.lgbtqiahealtheducation.org/) What other folx were saying about a pronoun pin might be a subtler and still good way to signal that you're down with the movement. 

I ask every time because, though it can be annoying and in some cases even unwelcome for trans folx who would like their pronouns to be ""implicit,"" is because in a lot of cases its the first time someone has been given that choice or accommodated in that way. Helps with the vibes and is practical.
personally, i appreciate it when a doctor copies the language that i use for my body. as a trans guy, it's deeply uncomfortable to be referred to as ""female."" and i find that it's simply unnecessary to say, as we already know what we're working with lol. another example would be calling my chest just my chest, instead of breasts. i know it can get tricky with terminology, but if we already know which body part we're talking about then i think it's okay to use what the patient prefers.
also, please just treat us like any other patient, and believe us about ourselves. i often get the feeling when i'm at the doctor's like i'm some sort of special anomaly that's exciting to look at. you can imagine how uncomfortable that is. or, that my situation is extremely unique and unusual. we are just normal people going through treatment. and often times, there are things we may understand better than you. many of the things you were taught are going to be based on cisness and cis bodies, and you will need to keep in mind that there are different perspectives. just be as respectful as possible, and u will be ok :)

thank you for taking interest in doing better, not everyone takes that step and being treated well as a trans person in healthcare is so important <3
First, thanks for taking the time to ask questions and try to inform yourself.  It sounds like you winged it alright largely because you knew you were out of your depth and tried to compensate for that by leaning on your local gender clinic.

Second, the suggestion someone already gave of reading WPATH 8 (and 7 since 7 is the current norms and 8 are the new ones coming in... you'll see the evolution in the thinking on trans health).

My own primary care providers reacted much like you did.  They felt out of their element and referred me to an endocrinologist.  Where I ran into troubles was when I started asking questions that had to do with interactions between my existing health issues and transition.  My GP got downright testy when I asked about whether I would be continuing my BPH meds once on HRT.  I only got a clear answer on that question when my urologist rang me up for an annual check-in on a different condition (and found out he's the local doc who does trans-related orchidectomies).  I'm finding myself grateful that my elderly GP is retiring this year and handing off his patients to some younger doctors who are more open to learning new things.  

The reality is that endos can't field every possible health question, especially stuff that is well outside their area of specialization, and they are absurdly busy anyway.  They aren't GPs for trans folks.  As the level of stigma has decreased, transition numbers are going up fast and having trans patients is not going to be unusual in a general practice, especially for younger doctors who are starting their practice now.  It honestly behooves GPs to get a decent basic understanding of trans bodies just like they would other populations with their own needs like kids or the elderly.  We deserve competent health care like anyone else.

Trans healthcare organizations often provide continuing medical education courses to help GPs get up to speed on trans health issues and even let them manage HRT starts on their own (it's actually just a few hours of CME and you could literally save a patient months to years of waitlisting depending on where you are located... that could literally save a life and helps avoid overloading the trans healthcare resources even further).  Here in my jurisdiction (Ontario, Canada), Rainbow Health Ontario provide LGBTQ+ education including training doctors on WPATH care standards and such.

 I am sure a local equivalent probably exists in your area.
Thank you for taking an interest in better supporting our community. Please make it a priority to add pronouns and preferred names to forms wherever you practice. I went to get my 9 month hormone levels today at Quest Diagnostics and got called ""Sir"" and by my deadname even though I'm getting my ESTROGEN checked and look like a woman...
Thank you! So getting to med category level of understanding would be good, noted. (Ex for blood pressure: ""blood pressure meds"" ""ace inhibitors"" (category of meds) and lisinopril (specific med)).
Yes this. I don‚Äôt talk to doctors I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt trust people unless I know them. A pin like this eases our fears of being infantilized, dismissed or denied healthcare altogether. 

Often it‚Äôs bigoted docs who drive us to ‚Äúblack market‚Äù HRT. Because we are told, by endos with decades of experience, ‚Äúsorry we won‚Äôt draw your blood here because we don‚Äôt do HRT for transes.‚Äù

But if I call in as a cis woman asking for the same thing - basic blood panel for a new diet, it‚Äôs sure ‚Äúno problem. We‚Äôll take care of that right away; we do that all the time here.‚Äù
Also, thank you for taking interest in our community and trying to be an ally. It is much appreciated!
Read WPATH 8. If other docs around you are in the same boat, start there. üòä

to ‚Äúlive‚Äù as the opposite gender for a year?	so i live in quebec, and one of the criteria to be approved for hrt is a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (this i‚Äôm fine with) but it‚Äôs the other criteria that states you have to *live* as the opposite gender for a year as well that i really don‚Äôt understand. like what does this mean genuinely?? like do i have to dress and present as hyper-femme, do i have to present myself with new pronouns for a year? i know a huge debate (amongst republicans) is the question of what a woman is but how do i prove to a doctor that i‚Äôve lived the opposite gender for over a year? what if i identify as a trans woman but also as a tomboy or as a non-binary and femme (my case). are there perhaps any other trans women from montreal or quebec in general here in the community who might be able to share their expriences with me? or just anyone whose regions enforce the same requirements. i‚Äôm just so tired of all this bureaucracy‚Ä¶ and canadian healthcare is such a mess already i really hate the idea of being put on another 3 year wait-list just to hear someone with an expensive piece of paper tell me what i‚Äôve already known for yearsüò≠	"Other people are going to give more detailed advice than me, but be prepared to lie. People (I don't know where) where denied estrogen because they showed up in pants to a doctor appointment. Have 0 qualms about manipulating whoever gatekeeps your transition. Bonne chance.
For the most part it means that you said yes to the question that confirms that's your trans to the cis people, ""Yes everyday I play dress up for you"". This is certainly belittling.

It may also mean that the required doctor (s) that you've talked to has known for a year that you're socially transitioning.
Are you a minor? I may be misinterpreting something, but... if you're talking about HRT and not surgery, then Quebec operates by informed consent for those 18 or older. You don't need a diagnosis to be prescribed hormones (you certainly don't need proof that you've been at it for a year). I started HRT in Montreal with zero issues. Just one clinic appointment. And I wasn't 'out' at the time (I only started socially transitioning after a month or two on hormones). 

For something like GRS (through GRS Montreal), you need to have been on HRT for 12 months, with two letters from therapists, which is pretty straightforward, and some other documentation.
In ontario i was gatekeept for 4 years before i moved to AB an was living as for just over 5 years i am now happy an on hrt dont give up <3
I think it means being ‚Äúout‚Äù as your preferred gender for over a year. Going by she/her in the day to day, etc.
My doctor said I needed to be ""full time as a woman"" before she'd give me a referral for HRT. So I put on lipstick before my next appointment and told her I was out to everyone. 

I'm not about to risk my comfort and safety to satisfy a cis person's standard for my personal journey.
oh wooow no waayy okay i will definitely keep this in mind. thank you!!!!
ah shoot i‚Äôd hate for a doctor to tell me they need to see me socially transition for a year, again, whatever that means eixirnejdiaiw

When it comes to shit the world wants to put us through...

 If you aren't cheating, you aren't trying. 

Usually horrible advice, but when it comes to this... lie. Are you depressed? Of course not!  You have social anxiety from gender dysphoria, but never depression. *wink wink*

Have you lived as your gender identity? Hell yeah you have! You've been out and socially transitioning for years. 

Just to keep the mood lite... here is an example were this advice is bad: 

If your partner complains that you aren't close with their family. DO NOT cheat on them with their siblings. That is not what they meant by being close.
I imagine health services will be able to point you in a good direction - they may even have doctors on campus or in nearby affiliated clinics that could prescribe, which could potentially save you a bunch of headache. They should definitely be your first stop. I might also look into the Concordia LGBTQ+ associations, as they may have a lot of useful information (and they're also places you can connect with people who have gone or are currently going through the exact same process). And it's definitely worth looking into seeing a therapist, if you haven't already - mine was able to give me tonnes of useful information.



Regarding my own experience - I came out after university, so I didn't have access to all of the same resources. I initially started at Clinique l'Actuel, which is public, but unfortunately, my doctor migrated to a private clinic (Clinique A/Centre DGL Hormonotherapie). You may have to face some wait times, so it's worth reaching out to a few places. Also, I'm not sure if things will work the same if you're from out of province and don't have a Quebec health card - if you're in that position, definitely bring that up when you go to health services. 



These are the clinics that were recommended to me when I first started (I believe they're all public?):

I'm a transwoman, I just found out recently and now I'm getting more and more anxiety every day please does anyone have any advise I'm feeling so bad right	"I'm a transwoman, I just found out recently and now I'm getting more and more anxiety every day please advise I'm feeling so bad right now

Last month I went from being my old self, it took about 11 days in total from not knowing and I've never realized it before to coming out as a transwoman, it happened so fast üòî 

Just writing this is making me cry, the same thing happened when I was figuring this out, I sat for 4 days and night I didn't sleep much, I wrote a coming out story or story of my life more or less, it felt like I broke down myself while writing over and over and over again I cried so so much but it felt better afterwards every time (I talked to 2 psychologists about and apparently it's called catharsis) 

I also realized I've had a life long depression probably since my teens, and coming out as Kazlyn broke it, I have a ADHD diagnosis and my symptoms more or less vanished üò≠ I still have it but it's gotten so much better in such little time it's crazy.

I thought I was a bi guy who likes cross dressing, I had a one night stand with a guy wearing full makeup and clothes it was ok but afterwards I was sitting in the couch just looking at myself with my phone camera and I was soooo happy it was a kind of happiness I've never ever felt before üò≠üò≠ that's when I realized it had to mean something more, I did a few online tests and every single one of them had the same result, that I was some kind of Transperson üòå‚ù§Ô∏è

My girlfriend was out of town, she has been encouraging me to meet guys. We got a open relationship and I love her of all my hearth üíï she's my penguin üíñ 

Anyways I told her when she got back that I thought I was trans, she took it very well üíï
After this is when I started writing everything down as I wrote above, when the story was done I posted it on Fetlife or Darkside as it's called in Sweden, the same day I posted I went to a bdsm party for the first time as Kazlyn.

I've never ever felt so relaxed at a party, I talked so much and just felt at peace with myself üòå just figuring this out made me happier and my girlfriend noticed of course and it made her happier seeing me so happy, she's been struggling with depressions and shit.

We went shopping clothes before the party and I also pierced my ears, trimmed my eyebrows and I waxed my arms. I've been waxing my whole body except the arms for years now uhm since 2018 more or less but I never removed the hair on my arm because I thought guys should have hairy arm but I'm not a guy I've never been one, I've been feeling uncomfortable in so many situations especially at parties sometimes I would just sit by myself and think or play silly mind games to keep myself amused, but now I'm a completely different person üò≠üíï 

My interests have changed, I can't wear my old clothes anymore, my apple watch doesn't feel like mine anymore I had to throw away all my old masculine smelling products like deodorants etc.

Now I'm getting more sever depersonalization symptoms every day, I had to take down all my mirrors but now everything with a reflective surface is trigger anxiety, EVERYTHING made of glass is trigger anxiety now I can't look at my computer because it has a glass side I removed it now but it didn't help my body reacts the same way, even mugs and glasses, windows, my loudspeakers they got a black piano glossy finish so they are reflective.

I feel ugly if I see myself, I lost a lot of weight and it's hard for me to eat now I can only eat a little, just going on rhr toilet now is triggering anxiety because I used to have a mirror there, even when I just wash my hands üò∞ if I have to go out and my clothes look too manly I get anxiety, my dad doesn't know and he's really old (89) he's the closest family I have apart from my girlfriend, my mom has Alzheimers and is in a home, all that stuff with my mom happened last winter and in the beginning of this year it was hard and every time I go and see her now I just start crying.

I've come out at work so I can be Kazlyn at work, it would have been impossible otherwise üòî

Yesterday I had a complete meltdown, I got really drunk I almost drank an entire bottle of whiskey, my girlfriends dad drove her here in the middle of the night because I was screaming and crying and panickin, everything triggers anxiety I'm staring to have a panic attack now, it's hard to write this stuff and my iPhone has a reflective surface so I get more and more anxiety when I use my phone or even look at the backside because it's reflective I don't know what to do anymore I've been in contact with the Healthcare here but it's gonna take a long time before I get to see someone üò∞ we decided to go to the psychology emergency room tomorrow morning, I dunno if I can work at all sometimes looking at pictures of faces triggers anxiety and I'm a software developer who works with fashion a lot of clothes etc, so kinda funny but also not so funny üòî also just looking at my body now sometimes triggers anxiety if my arms are too hairy or legs like they are right now, I'm gonna wax everything next week.

I used to be able to look at pictures of myself if my face was partially hidden but I can't do that anymore I can't look at any pictures where you can see my body anymore. I also get anxiety if people says my name wrong or use the wrong pronoun üòï

can someone please advise me on what do do? Or if someone has some tips and tricks i dunno what to do anymore, just being home triggers anxiety all over the place and I'm scared to go out sometimes I hardly go outdoors anymore I order food home and other supplies but it feels like I'm going crazy, like I'm a demon that has just taken possession of this body or something there are so many things that has drastically changed in such a short time I haven't really ""landed"" yet I'm so confused üò∞

Best regards,
Kazlyn.

Being trans in The Netherlands (as a foreigner)?	"Hello!

In a few months I'm going to start my first year at university abroad in The Netherlands. I am a coward, however, and would like to ask here if anyone could tell me what it's like to be trans in The Netherlands, in regards to safety and acceptation and the likes. Apart from that, I'll also need to find a GP there (for matters of health insurance) and I wondered whether there is some kind of database online with trans-friendly healthcare providers like the one we have in Belgium or not.

Trump Launches Nuremberg-Style Assault	"https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/national-trans-bans-both-trump-and

Donald Trump has released two videos over the past few days that detail his current plan to attack the trans community with the full force of the federal government.

Among *many* other things, Trump promised to:

- Ban gender-affirming care for trans youth across the board and reclassify it as ""child abuse""

- Ban Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA from funding gender-affirming care *for anyone*

- Ban hospitals which treat trans youth from receiving federal funding

- Overhaul the entire education system, compel every remaining teacher to teach Christian Nationalist principles, and only certify those who pledge to do the same

- Ban the recognition of trans people by any federal agency

- Force the DOJ to investigate hospitals and pharmaceutical companies which provide and/or manufacture gender-affirming medications and care

- Ban the federal government in its entirety from recognizing the legitimacy of trans people's identities

That last one is particularly striking for a number of reasons. Such a ban would necessarily prohibit the federal government and its agencies from recognizing the legitimacy of documents and registrations bearing the correct gender marker. This means that the following documents and registrations would be seen as illegitimate:

- Passports

- Driver's Licenses

- Birth certificates

- Social Security registration (and, theoretically, IRS filings)

- Voter registration

- Registration with the Healthcare Marketplace

- Registration with Medicare, Medicaid, and/or the VA

This is grimly reminiscent of the Nuremberg Laws, which - among other things - stripped away the citizenship of the Jewish people in Nazi Germany prior to the Holocaust.

*The only factor* that truly separates this kind of legislation from the Nuremberg Laws is that the gender markers on these documents and registrations could all be changed back.

***However***

Doing so would serve another function: the creation of an authentic transgender registry.

Ken Paxton's attempt to create a transgender registry in Texas using DMV records failed because the agency tasked with creating the registry couldn't verify that every gender marker change was the result of a trans person's petition. This would solve that issue by forcing trans people to change *everything* back in order to function as a US citizen. One agency can make a typographical error. *All* of them? There's no way. And that's the point. The sheer number of changes that would have to be made by each person through all of these agencies would certify the authenticity of every entry on the registry.

Now, you might say that Trump won't be the nominee in 2024. You could be right. However, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is the most likely pick for the nomination other than Trump, and if you know *anything* about Ron DeSantis by now, it's that he spends every second on this planet finding ways to abuse the powers of his office to attack the LGBTQ+ community and other minorities and stay firmly to the right of Trump.

The fact that extreme actions like this are being proposed this far out from the presidential election is a sincerely grim omen. I can only imagine what will be proposed as we move into the nomination process and the election."	If you ask me desantis' hardline anti-lgbtq stance is what's driving this from trump. I really don't think trump gives a shit about trans people but he's trying to outflank desantis from the right with the base.

Essay: Curse or super power	"I feel I should preface this and say that the reason I'm writing this is to share the beautiful parts of my journey as a trans woman, and to hopefully show that things do get better for us. Quite recently it has dawned on me that I've been openly trans for a decade at this point, give or take a few months. This realization has spurred me on to reflect on my journey, and how it's changed and taught me many things. There was a lot of hardship for me at first. When I was a teen it seriously considered it to be a curse, another hardship to bear. As I'm sure we all do I faced a lot of discrimination, and attacks. Those incidents compounded with my lack of experience with the Healthcare system made every day a struggle to just be okay with who I am. As I aged things became a lot easier, I learned to pass (which I feel blessed for) I was still pretty constantly terrified or paranoid about discrimination. Hrt was a huge battle for me, I repeatedly stopped and started due to money, insurance, or living in a rural area. Until I reached the age of about 23 I very much considered being trans as just another heavy burden to carry along with the rest of my crap. After continuous conversations with myself, my husband, and my allies, I realized how magnificent, and beautiful it is to be trans. Each day is a joy to me at this point, hrt has been hugely helpful, but the ultimate source of joy for me has really been my own relationship with my trans nature. When I was younger I shunned all elements of masculinity in myself that I could, and it wasn't til recently that I realized that those elements of myself are beautiful too and meant to be embraced and cherished. This unity of masculinity and femininity I believe is a real gift. It makes relating to people much easier, and more fulfilling.¬† The hardship of finding this beautiful dichotomy has given me the skills and emotional fortitude to face any issue with open arms and for this, I am profoundly grateful. So many of my relationships have grown so much thanks to being trans as well. It has also really (seemingly ironically) made me truly appreciate the goodness in people, many members of my family have completely shocked me with their support, love, and kindness, despite rampant conservatism, and transphobia in their social circles. There are so many ways that I find this path we all walk to be truly beautiful, despite my inability to capture it in words. I don't know if anyone else has experiences similar to this, but I thought I would share my story. I hope this helps, and I would very much love it if you shared some of your ""it's beautiful to be trans"" experiences with me.

[MTF] If you've been on HRT for awhile with little to no development then you might want to watch this video.	"**This is a video of a lecture from 2019 of Transgender Healthcare by William J. Powers.**

Around the **32:54** timestamp William talks about a mutation that some trans women have that in short inhibit/stop the progress of HRT after the very start of some development and will stay that way until something is done about it. He also talks about how he solves/fixes this issue.

**If you have a similar problem then I urge you to watch that part of the video and discuss it with your provider/doctor.**

Thanks, very informative video.
That's actually something that should be seen by doctors and endos. New findings and Research in the hrt field for trans seem to have not enough coverage. It amazes me that the DIY community often has to educate their doctors (and gatekeepers) in order to access proper treatment...

Is there ANY mental illnesses that invalidate being trans?	"Atm I'm in the process of finding out if I got any kinda mental illnesses and one if the doctors I talked to said she thought it's be a good idea to find our before I transition further with surgeries because ""what if your gender dysphoria is actually caused by some other underlying issue""
To me that sounds like bs. I've never ever heard of any mental illnesses invalidating a transgender identity. So I guess I wanted to ask if there are any mental illnesses that would actually invalidate a transgender identity. Cause if there is I've yet to hear about it ü§∑üèª

Also another thing, the doctor I talked to said she thought I might have a personality disorder so I'm gonna get screened for that soon ( by soon I mean probably after new years ). If I got diagnosed with a personality disorder would that make it harder for me to go through the system in terms of trans Healthcare or dtraight up gatekeep me ( I live in Denmark if that's helpful at all )"	"I'm a neuroscientist, so I can say with authority here that, under our current understanding, no, there is not. There is no evidence of anyone being treated for a mental illness becoming cis after symptoms of the mental illness improved (and you know transphobes would have jumped on that if there was). There is no evidence linking any particular presentation of mental illness with identifying as trans. We can't identify any changes in the brain caused by mental illness that correlate with gender identity, and gender identity is too complex to be identified in the brain so we can't even consider a possible physical mechanism that a mental illness may affect your perception of gender identity. 

In conclusion, your doctor is either being transphobic or is part of a system that is trying to discourage transition because of systemic transphobia (which is basically how it is in the UK at the moment where they are trying to put more barriers to transition that would mean a diagnosis of autism or something would make it more difficult). I dunno what Denmark's system is like but I would be wary of getting a diagnosis of a personality disorder if it is anything like the UK.
Un treated body dysphoria and gender dysphoria can cause mental illness, not the other way around. As far as I‚Äôm aware theirs no mental conditions that cause gender dysphoria.
I'm not a medical professional, but to me it sounds like this doctor is either an idiot or transphobic, or both. But without a medical degree, I couldn't say. Perhaps you could seek a second opinion from another doctor?
No.

(Thread over)

As for 2nd question, not really, but individuals and some systems vary. For informed consent, it only matters that you are well enough to give.. informed consent... and the rest shouldn't matter.
Short answer is no. If you had a mental illness severe enough to make you feel like another gender, you wouldn't need to be screened for it.
I am a mental health professional- mayyyybe if someone were having psychotic symptoms, I may take more time working with them to find out the root cause, but I have NEVER heard of someone not being referred for trans affirming care due to a personality disorder or other mental illness. It is not culturally competent and it is very ignorant. 

In our field, the patient is the expert on themselves, we are helping them on a journey of discovering their true selves and healing themselves. We are not supposed to be here to stop people from exploring who they are. Trans affirming care is part of that exploration.
Here in the USA the political rhetoric has become so vile, that members of the LGBTQ community live in fear for their lives. The southern USA is worse. As a transfem AMAB person, I get looks just for my fingernails. You are not mentally ill because you are trans! I wish I was born a woman. Does not make me mentally ill! My manic depression and anxiety along with being on the ADHD spectrum make me mentally ill. It‚Äôs not because I want a vagina and a female body.
Not thst we are aware of.  Even systems of parts/alters that have multiple gender identities tend to be in pretty firm agreement about being transgender.
While it's not mental illness, I have been told that apparently a lot of autistic people say they're trans, while they might actually not be. I call that bs, I think I know what I want and only I know who I really am. Then again, autism isn't a mental illness so....
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt tell them you have any, I told my doctor when I started I had bipolar and she was cool and started me on hrt but not all will do that
So there are moments where people can have an acute episode of detaching from reality. They can become very unaware of who they are, if they're real, etc. Sometimes they make rash decisions and don't think clearly. Doesn't mean they're not trans, it means those moments they may think they're one thing when they're really another and they realize it after they come back to reality.

Other than that, I don't think so. I think they mean that they want you to figure out everything that can be affecting you emotionally and mentally before making that big decision because some things are irreversible when transitioning, and it can have either a positive or negative effect on someone. Sometimes people's dysphoria lessen to the point where they don't feel like they need to do anything to feel comfortable in their body after getting their anxiety under control. That doesn't make them not trans, it just makes them more able to cope and handle things differently. Everyone's different, ya know?

Take me, for example: my underlying issues didn't stop me from being trans, but transitioning (or at least attempting to) made everything worse for me. Dysphoria, depression, anxiety, all of it got worse. So they began blaming non existent issues I had to try to make sense of it, only to blame me when they realized it wasn't those either. My mental issues didn't make me not trans, ya know?
The only thing I could possibly think of is if you have multiple personalities. But even then idk.
>I dunno what Denmark's system is like but I would be wary of getting a diagnosis of a personality disorder if it is anything like the UK.

I think it might be slightly better here cause from what I've seen at least people don't know a lot about trans stuff and aren't thus being actively transphobic cause of the media they're just ignorant and thus transphobic cause they don't know/don't want to know any better

Tho when I was at the danish gender clinic ( Rigshospitalet ) the woman I talked to lied to my face and said 80% of the people they had referred to the clinic were ftm ( I looked up the statistics. As of 2020 52% were mtf ) and that there was an epidemic of ""teenage girls identifying as transgender"" and then proceeded to imply my trauma made me trans.
Is there a link with Autism and being non-binary?
Yeah that's what I thought too. Just wanted to confirm there's literally no evidence of this in case some doctor tries to tell me I'm just trans cause [insert potential diagnosis I might get]
I don't think that doctor was trying to be transphobic she just sounded uneducated on transness cause that's not her field. Plus it didn't sound like she was trying to be malicious just a bit dumb for lack of a better word
What about a personality disorder like borderline where a common symtom is not really having a stable sense of identity or self? Not that it ""disqualifies"" you from being trans or anything, but is it possible someone struggling with a sense of identity would be interested in transitioning due to this? Or would it be more likely that exploring a new gender identity would be successful in helping form a better sense of self? /gen
Sounds pretty reasonable. Thank you :0!
I can try to not mention it but I'm sure I'd eventually be asked about it and I can't really lie cause it's in my papers cause I had trauma therapy üòµ‚Äçüí´
> that there was an epidemic of ""teenage girls identifying as transgender"" and then proceeded to imply my trauma made me trans

That is the same rhetoric the UK government have been using to justify their new plan for the Child Gender Identity service to block as many referrals as possible (I read their proposals that they put for public consultation a few weeks ago and they literally said they wanted to reduce referrals to the service) so to me it does sound like there is a problem in the system that might make them gatekeep you
Non-binary identity is more common in people with autism, but there was a recent analysis of studies attempting to determine why (which included some very outdated and discredited theories of autism) and found that none of the hypotheses had enough evidence to support them. The authors said that the most likely explanations for further study into a link were the autistic traits that led to resistance to social norms and reduced perception of gender differences. I personally would wonder whether those two traits only mean a person is more comfortable labelling themself and coming out rather than  a reason for being nonbinary, but to figure out if that's the case that needs a lot more work to understand the lived experiences of people who are autistic, nonbinary, autistic and nonbinary, and neither autistic or nonbinary.

link to the study if you want to read it in full (warning, it does briefly take the Extreme Male Brain nonsense seriously)

Really on, even undereducated, it could be helpful for another opinion.
I am trans and have been diagnosed as borderline. Now I'm no expert, but I don't believe that's how identity disturbance works. Or at least that hasn't been my experience of it. And no mental health expert has suggested my BPD somehow invalidates my gender identity. While I'm sure my dysphoria and my BPD have impacted each other, it's absolutely not to a degree that invalidates my autonomy.
I suppose it could be worth exploration, but I still, as said above, would not rule out a recommendation for trans affirming care if someone felt dysphoric for a long period of time. identity disturbances in the sense of a PD are often very rapid if that makes sense.
I hope my explanation helps! Sometimes I know people have to go to a few providers before finding someone who really listens!
Yeah probably.  I heard that one clinic is known to be very transphobic so as soon as I turned 17.5 and was allowed to be referred to another gender clinic I did so. However the waiting list is insane and I got my first appointment the 18th December 2023 ( yes, next year. And that's just the first consultation where they even consider helping me )

My GP who referred me to that clinic btw technically threatened to not refer me because I'd started HRT through a private clinic instead of go through the system. Which may also have something to do with the fact I probably got put last in line for trans healthcare ü•≤
I agree, I was just curious how a disorder that impacts your sense of self would affect your gender identity in general. I have ASD, so I also struggle with a sense of self and identity, although its probably a bit different as opposed to BPD, and I think it has genuinely impacted my exploration and identity. /gen /nm
Noted, thank you!
>My GP who referred me to that clinic btw technically threatened to not refer me because I'd started HRT through a private clinic instead of go through the system. Which may also have something to do with the fact I probably got put last in line for trans healthcare

That one is also a UK proposal, penalising any kids who don't go through the NHS. If your doctor is copying TERF Island policy, then there's definitely some transphobia going on
For me, the identity disturbance is more about conforming my identity to other people's expectations to avoid abandonment. It exacerbated my fears, contributing to how fervently I hid my true gender, because I knew that people would leave me if they found out I was trans (which some did). I believe this is why I was closeted for as long as I was (into my late 30s).
Yeah definitely with my doctor I'm thinking more in terms of regular people on the street. Most of those are just ignorant and not intentionally hateful ya know plus maybe doctors in the system who don't specialize in lgbt stuff or deal with trans ppl"	zmjk56	trans	13	1.0	2022-12-15 12:09:25

I am so grateful for the doctors who help me. For their kind words and immediate understanding. For helping guide me through this process.

For the scientists who figured out how to help me. And for the pioneers of trans healthcare who were persecuted for their work. 

For my voice therapist who helps me do what medicine can‚Äôt. And who has done so much more‚Ä¶ teaching me how to stand and walk‚Ä¶ teaching me how to cough and sneeze and laugh and sing.

For the kind laser technician who broke the rules and gave me a larger treatment than I could afford. And for her holding my hand and crying with me when I was overwhelmed with emotion from her kindness. 

For my therapist, who helped me come out of my shell and realize I was trans in the first place. For comforting me and accepting me before I even accepted myself. 

For my group therapy members. Who share their own stories and offer support. And for the close friends I have made from group.

For my wife, who has shown me more grace and acceptance than I though possible.

For my parents, who try so hard. Who work to love me and treat me with respect despite their extreme right wing politics. 

For my elderly boss, who surprised me with their immediate and unsurprised acceptance. For their complete support. For never misgendering or deadnaming me once. For not treating my transition as a ‚Äúbig deal‚Äù. 

For the random guy who asked me out and made me feel so pretty. For his kind smile and charismatic charm.

I am even grateful for the creepy old men who sexually harass me. Who unwittingly through their denigrating words give me so much gender euphoria‚Ä¶ for I know that I have fully passed.

I am grateful for the online spaces so carefully protected by dedicated volunteers. And for the ability to connect with and speak to other people like me. 

For the allies who defend us and speak up for us so we don‚Äôt always have to do so alone.

For all of you for being here.

Grandma has my back	"CW: mentions of old age, death, Covid 


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-


I grew up being really close to my grandma. She lived through World War II and a revolution, had to survive both nationalist fascism and a communist dictatorship which made her have a hard time letting go of material things. She was quite a hoarder which I absolutely loved because I could go with her to flea markets to find weirdly amazing things like a mini hand forged sword or a small pipe (for some reason I was obsessed with pipes as a kid). Whenever I needed something she always seemed to have it somewhere in her drawers or cupboards and she just had a solution to everything whether it was making a friend a birthday gift or repairing a broken toy. 

She passed away earlier this year at the age of 94, after a few years of health issues and due to Covid.
I‚Äôve been grieving her since she‚Äôs gotten ill and started loosing her memories, so her passing away just made me be able to tap into these feelings more and also bring a release, knowing that she isn‚Äôt suffering anymore.

I converse a lot with my ancestors that I know and the ones I don‚Äôt know as well being a spiritual person, so the other day when I was feeling really dysphoric and isolated in my pain I called out for her to help me and give me guidance. Later on I fell asleep and had a dream about being in a school of some sort and she was there to pick me up (which she actually used to do back in the day), I told her I needed to use the toilet and that we could head home after. I ended up sobbing on the loo and stepping out she looked concerned and ask me what‚Äôs wrong so I just broke down and told her that I‚Äôm trans and that I want to go on T and I‚Äôm scared and feel so lost, not knowing when I will be able to afford it since public healthcare‚Äôs waitlist takes up to 4 years. 
She just said with empathy ‚Äòoh okay, so you just want to go on testosterone?‚Äô looked like she was trying to gather some thoughts and come up with something to comfort me but instead she went to one of her cupboards and pointed at it saying ‚ÄòI have Testogel.‚Äô
That‚Äôs when I realised that I was dreaming but for some reason it just made me laugh while I was still in tears in my dream and I just said to her ‚ÄòOf course you do.‚Äô And woke up laughing and feeling so held and accepted by her even though I never came out to her irl. 

TLDR:
My grandma who passed away recently visited me in my dreams I came out to her and she got me Testogel."	"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Awh this made me cry, bless her

I don't have a very strong connection to my granny.
One of them lives in Britain which isn't to far away. But still a few hours like at least 10 hours.
And my other granny died 2005 or 6  I think. She was 102 years old and lived through both ww1 and 2 she was for certain a trooper. But I was born 2004 so I never got to know her. But I hope she's proud of her grandchild aka my mom cause mom is awesome.

I feel as though I‚Äôm years away from finally being able to live comfortably, and it makes me ache. I already feel as though I‚Äôm mourning my childhood and now watching my teen years escape me feels like a blow to the gut. I‚Äôm not at all who I want to be. I mean this in the way that people look at me and see something I‚Äôm not and treat me accordingly, I hate it. Getting healthcare has been a nightmare with a doctor who is uncomfortable doing anything to help me. I feel completely paralyzed watching what is supposed to be the years with the best responsibility to freedom ratio slip by. Completely unable to slow it. 

It gives me such a peculiar combination of having so much hope for the future, when I can be happy and free, and a  common pang of dread when I think about how much needs to be done and how hard it‚Äôs all going to be. 

I am so happy for the people on here who are happy to be trans and are proud of who they are, but I‚Äôm not there yet. I hope one day I am."	One thing at a time. Order one new piece of clothing, make one phone call. That is how I am getting through it.	nispy0	trans	14	0.9	2021-05-22 21:35:54
Alabama: Fuck Weisberg.	"He sent a letter to my friend's insurance stating in no uncertain terms that they did not have dysphoria, because they're non-binary.

He also stared at another friend's tits the entire appointment.

On top of that, he has this fucken... paladin complex? Like he's a hero for being down here and he expects to be treated like one? I don't feel comfortable at all working with him and I feel like he holds me in contempt any time I disagree with him. He sent me on a validation letter quest that it turns I didn't even fucken need and straight up said he's covering his own ass.

He almost held off on my HRT because my *fucking triglycerides* were high.

He also expects to be your sole primary care provider, and I had to make a scene not to lose my family doctor.

It generally feels like he *expects* you to be incompetent w.r.t. your own healthcare.

Not to mention he's determined to use His Pharmacies? I had to insist twice on actually having the prescription sent to my fucken hometown instead of his partners pharmacies in B'ham.

If you're a student at UAB, or if you have *ANY* way of getting up to Nashville or Atlanta, I strongly advise against working with him."		ek7ck3	trans	14	1.0	2020-01-05 03:28:42
How is Ohio?	So, I have been given the opportunity to celebrate Halloween in the US togheter with a friend and his family. But what I understand from international news and social media is that some states are trying their best to prevent trans healthcare. I'm mtf and now about a month on hrt, and also 18+. Would there be any legal risks or other dangers for me if I go? I really want to go, but I'm a bit scared... Thnx in advance üòä	"I've been openly out in Ohio for 4 years now. As a whole we arent bad. Stay away from Cincinnati and rural Ohio. Akron has a huge trans and LGBTQ population and Cleveland is pretty accepting as well. I haven't had any real issues here.

Ohio is pretty decent if you stay in the major cities. I‚Äôve been out in Cleveland, Akron, Columbus and Toledo and everything was cool. But the rural areas can be hit or miss‚Ä¶..

I‚Äôm in NW Ohio, and I‚Äôm trying to rebuild the resources we lost to COVID. We have an active community with nowhere to celebrate. Ohio as state is pretty shit though.
Stick to big cities and be cautious. Generally people there are pretty receptive to LGBTQ people, but there's always a few bad apples, and people can be crazy here. If you know about ""Florida Man"" jokes.. that happens everywhere, Florida's journalism laws just make it appear like that's the only state that happens in.
Good to hear
Why stay away from Cincinnati may I ask?
I'll keep that in mind
Thnx for the info, it helps with erasing some doubts

Extra note: my mom is aware of my pref name as I‚Äôve told my therapist who is connected with my healthcare provider so, whenever I get mail from them it‚Äôs under my pref name.

Need help! ...Companies with trans-inclusive health care?	"Hey y'all. I could use some help. Currently, I am fighting to improve my guild's trans healthcare coverage. To be blunt, we are lagging. (Especially considering the coverage we provide cis folks.) I've been working to build a compelling and undeniable case for our health plan to offer the¬†*full*¬†list of WPATH recommendations for trans-inclusive care, but I've been told I need to point to known/reputable companies that are already setting the bar. (Companies like Starbucks and Amazon.) Without these examples, apparently the health board trustees are unlikely to budge.

**Do any of you know of companies that offer WPATH's full list of recommendations, or that at least come close? Bigger/more well-known companies would be amazing.**

(Unfortunately, our health plan is privately funded, so as much as I'd love to threaten to sue  for not adhering to certain California standards, I can't.)

Thank you for any help xx"	"Target, Best Buy, Wells Fargo.
I work for Target Corporate and all plans have coverage for trans health, only not covering things like FFS and BA but covers all therapy, does standard coverage of HRT.

Edit: if you want specific plan details and docs DM me
I work for Unity3d, and I'm not aware of anything that's _not_ covered. There are a lot of office locations and insurance options though, so maybe some aren't as robust as mine.
Nike is another with excellent coverage.

Also note that the popular legal opinion on the impact of Bostock v Clayton County is that transgender exclusions on employer-funded plans violate Title VII. Unfortunately, getting employers to respect this ruling may require bringing that issue specifically to court.

(Also also, I'm dealing with this issue with my employer now, who has multiple locations including one in CA. If you want to compare notes and/or see if it's the same employer, feel free to reach out.)
Say what you will about the company for how they've affected the US tax code (no really, that would be extremely valid criticism) but Intuit has amazing trans health coverage. They have nearly 11,000 employees, and cover the full range of trans health for all employees AND their spouses. My wife works there, and my transition is fully covered. From hormones to hair removal to FFS to GRS. All covered and enormously appreciated. ü•∞

Missouri bill set to prohibit youth from receiving transgender medical care, and allows adults to be denied coverage for the same by insurance.	"https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB2649&year=2022&code=R

HB 2649 (Known as the ""Missouri Save Adolescents from
Experimentation (SAFE) Act"") is currently working it's way through the Missouri state legislature.

The bill specifies that, a physician or other health care
professional cannot provide gender transition procedures to any
individual under 18 years of age or refer the individual to any
health care professional for gender transition procedures.

The bill would also allow companies to deny coverage of transgender healthcare for adults.

Sad that I can‚Äôt be a woman	"So I‚Äôve been transitioning for the last 3 years (MTF) but it hasn‚Äôt been what you‚Äôd expect. I started hormones but there‚Äôs been no psychological shift. Hormones haven‚Äôt done a lot for me but I do like the changes I‚Äôve seen even though I still look like a guy. I present femme and I like that but it feels like I‚Äôm being dishonest. After transitioning for the first time I felt like I knew what I wanted to do with my life (I want to work in healthcare). My transition has been moderately successful (I pass most of the time) but despite this I still feel like a guy pretending to be a woman. 

I‚Äôve decided to listen to these feelings and I think I‚Äôm going to detransition. It makes me so frickin sad though that I couldn‚Äôt be a woman. Women are so amazing and they get to do so many great things. They‚Äôre just so graceful and beautiful and well womanly. I wish I could have that and feel comfortable being a woman but it just doesn‚Äôt feel like me. And that makes me feel really sad. 

Sorry I‚Äôm just kind of bummed out about the whole thing and was hoping someone would be able to offer some advice or share their story."	"it sounds like you need a gender therapist, not to stop taking hormones.  you seem to have some internal ""feminine ideal"" that you don't think you're achieving.  honey, that's the essence of being a woman in our society.  the whole thing is designed to  make you feel Not Enough, so you'll buy a product to fix it.
Research imposter syndrome within the community.

There are many others who feel like you.

Also you say you haven't noticed changes but have you made sure to check your blood levels to see if you are in fact on the right track?

There's a lot more than just swallowing a pill and calling it a day.
How it sounds is detransitioning would be the worst choice for you right now, i suggest going to a therapist for what is likely internalised transphobia.
Take this spiel with a grain of salt because I'm bigender and can't transition but

There isn't a correct way to be a woman; you aren't being dishonest by presenting yourself the way you want to. If being fem makes you happy then you should do it. Even if you were a 'guy pretending to be a girl' that wouldn't really matter. There are nonbinary amab people who are feminine presenting, there are males who prefer to be feminine presenting. Basically what I'm saying is that even if you feel like you didn't hit womanhood right on the head, you are still right to present feminine and continue your transition. You can present however you want, if it feels right then your gender doesn't matter.

Another thing, my limited experience with depression has told me that negative thoughts exist, no matter their truthfulness or usefulness. Listening to those thoughts can lead one down a nasty path. If you believe detransitioning would make you happier then no one can stop you. But, if its negative thoughts about what you should be that are dragging you down, then you should try to attack those thoughts rather than the good thing they've attached themselves to.
If you are a woman than you are a woman. If your a great big hairy woman with a deep voice, your a great big hairy woman with a deep voice. If body mods make people feel happy I think they should go for it, but that‚Äôs not all being trans is. If estrogen didn‚Äôt make you feel how you wanted to you don‚Äôt need to take it. Your the master of you and society is the problem.
I would just admire woman if you can't be one. Have them as friends, mentors, lovers if you can even do that. Be an ally to them, assist them where you can. It's a very scary world for a woman, you can be there to honor and protect them.
What makes you say that?
more specifically the fact that you aren‚Äôt detransitioning because you aren‚Äôt trans but for other reasons

Banning Underage Trans Care Rant	"
TW: Discussion of dysphoria, sewerslide, self harm, puberty, depression, abuse, etc. 

So. Obviously this isn‚Äôt a new thing but it‚Äôs coming up more and more in the news lately as states are continuing to make their own choices about government interference in people‚Äôs healthcare. 

There are increasing mountains of evidence every single year that trans youth benefit from age appropriate transition care and that it does very very little documented physical or emotional harm to those who need it. These decisions are *110% between the trans kid, their parents, and their doctor*. International organizations and medical boards such as WPATH, APA, and the Endocrine Society, have had guidelines regarding transitioning youth for years. 

I want to be very clear about this. MEDICAL TRANSITIONING IN TRANS ADOLESCENTS SAVES LIVES. Is it for all trans youth? No. Are there trans kids who change their mind about their identity down the road? Occasionally, yes, (though it‚Äôs much rarer by pubescent ages). The point is: it is healthy, it is critical, NEEDED, healthcare and it saves countless lives of trans kids with dysphoria. 

I knew I was trans at 13. I was begging for T by 14 and I was never more certain of my identity or my needs at any other point in my life, even now as an adult. I was actively suicidal. I was self harming. I wanted to peel my skin off my body and rip my hair out. I didn‚Äôt want to continue living. I cannot describe in 1000 words just how bad my situation was, and the abuse that followed. And you know what? My parents never got me any form of that care and have left me permanently traumatized both physically and psychologically because of it. They went on to neglect my autonomy and invalidate my identity for years. I never once, was able to even start getting better, even with therapy, until I was able to get on hormones at 18. And I‚Äôm a completely different person now that I am. I‚Äôm confident, happy, extroverted, social, handle stressors in a much healthier way, and am overall a better person and true version of myself. 

I had a friend who discovered they were trans at the same time as me. Their parents got him on puberty blockers and testosterone and he had top surgery at 16/17. It was medically necessary for him. And he was sure about all of it. Had I been provided even an inkling of gender affirming care, I can almost guarantee I never would‚Äôve attempted sewerslide, I‚Äôd probably still be in touch with my parents, and I could‚Äôve been saved YEARS of absolute, pure AGONY of an existence during such a critical time in my life. 

Trans healthcare for trans adolescents, (and more importantly, access for their parents who are willing to seek it out), is a NECESSITY. Everyone transitions differently and that individual plan is up to providers and mental health professionals and what parents know about their kid. But ultimately it should absolutely be a legally guaranteed, *option*. I am so fucking SICK of bitchy, old, saggy ass republicans dictating our autonomy, right to healthcare, and saying that this healthcare is ‚Äúabusive‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. And I am absolutely furious about it and you should all know it will only continue to get worse, not just for us but for all queer people, unless we put a stop to it. 

Feel free to continue this bitch fest in the comments. 

Don‚Äôt forget to check your voter registration and vote on or before Nov. 8th so we at least have a chance of reducing this rhetoric and these policies."	"100% agree with you. I don't live in the UK, but I have heard there have been huge problems there especially with trans rights. The Prime Minister of the UK recently said that they want to remove trans rights from the Equality Act of 2010. That made me feel sick. Why would you want to remove rights from a group of people? It doesn't affect you in any way whatsoever to give those people rights, it just means that the people who those rights will affect will have the ability to live their lives as the person they are and not the person they are forced to pose as.

As you said, a lot of people use the excuse that you shouldn't be able to make decisions like that until you are 25 because your brain hasn't developed enough or some shit. If such a law was implemented, countless lives would be completely destroyed. If I lived in a country that had that law, I would be fucked. That would completely remove my ability to get any care whatsoever and I would have no way of coming to accept myself. I'm already in a bad enough situation with my mental health, if I became unable to get trans care, I would have no reason not to just sewerslide. Why someone would want to remove rights from others in similar or even worse situations than mine is beyond me. That would indirectly kill many people, and cause unimaginable harm to anyone who's life isn't completely ruined. 

In conclusion, fuck anyone who tries to remove our rights, and stay strong all fellow trans folks, I believe in y'all!
The bottom line is that they simply don't care. Because we don't fit into their narrative of an American way of life. They see us less than them. They would rather see us dead and gone. Like a mice in their nice home. And they got that idea from their parents and their grandparents. Who murdered and lynched thousands native Americans, Chinese and Irish immigrants, black people and gays. It's a generational hate and disease. 1970 is only 50 or so years ago. And for some of them, nothing has changed. They treaded on the rights and destroyed the lives of millions of people. What made you think that they will take a second look and hesitate when it comes to our rights and lives? So fight like hell, fight like your future and your life depends on it! Write letters to your congress people and governors. Write letter to the highest office in the land! Vote, petition and protest! Walk with your head held high like many brave souls before us, like Ruby Bridges, Malcom X, MLK, Rosa Park... Draw inspiration and courage from your sisters and brothers in arm. Show them the true meaning of the American way of life! 

Ask yourself this: How would you like the future generation talk about us? What kind of legacy and impression do you want to leave on this land? We are all here to plant üå¥ for the future, under whose shade we do not expect to sit. Do not be afraid, because all your hopes and dreams are on the other side of fear.
Well said! We all need to fight for our rights and for our future! It'll be a hard fight, but we can do it! We're all strong enough!"	ymbc4w	trans	11	0.86	2022-11-04 21:42:18

Trans Healthcare in Finland, a TL;DR	"Here in finland, HRT is almost free and the government partially pays for a lot of different treatments.

**Difficulties:**

Unfortunately, it takes on average 1-1.5 years to get diagnosed because the two hospital units that deal with trans and nb people's issues (yes, I know) are criminally understaffed, and for some reason there are no private pathways for trans healthcare as far as I know.


NOTE: It is also possible that such treatments are just ungoogleable and you would have to get hormone treatment for some imaginary unrelated illness from a doctor who is willing to risk their medical license.

The aforementioned understaffing is probably due to the increasing  amount of people realizing themselves, while the number of trans-specializing doctors stays roughly the same as the only way to get a job in the sector is to work for public healthcare. 

**Other things (CW: transphobia):**

From 2016 to 2020, by the request of the person previously in charge of the Tampere City Unit (TAYS Trans-poliklinikka), care was without warning entirely cut for nonbinary people due to ""insufficient evidence to show that it is beneficial"". The same person has apparently said about transmasculine people ""it is a shame when beauty is thrown away"". Also transness is considered a mental disorder in the ICD-10 dicease classification standard, which will be used until sometime next year. The current standards also don't allow for non-binary people to get any corrective surgical treatment. This means that many transfeminine/transmasculine non-binary people have to lie. The distinction will probably be dispelled when ICD-11 starts being used (next year, as mentioned).

TL;DR (even shorter): Some care is very affordable, but getting diagnosed takes a long time and the system hasn't yet caught up with how gender is viewed nowadays."	"Most sources I used are my memory of reading a bunch of different articles from trans-positive non-profits and patient blogs and I've read through the official sources as well. For any further questions, ask me. I just listed a bunch of things that I found interesting.
That‚Äôs awful
Well, with all the flaws, at the very least it's not inexistent. Ideally tho everyone everywhere would have as easy access anywhere. But alas, we don't live in an ideal world.
yup I've been trying to get diagnosed for 1,5 years now and I still dont know when my next appointment is.

I have an ftm friend whos been trying to get diagnosed for even longer than me and the clinic told him that they dont want to give a diagnosis just because hes had depression in the past...

pretty fucked up system

edit: also one of the caregivers deadnamed me EVERY TIME even though I told her my name but nope she never remembered it and used the wrong pronouns and was just overall very very passive aggressive.
The longest distance you would have to travel for care is probably from the most northern village in Finland, Utsjoki to TAYS. It is a total of 1141 km, or 709 miles, and would take about 14 hours by car or 5h + 12h by car and then train. I don't know if flying and/or getting a taxi would be free for the patient."	py4v1l	trans	10	0.87	2021-09-29 21:13:55
Dealing with transphobia is taking a toll on my perspective of humanity	Ever since coming out socially and waiting for the insanely long queues in my country's mess of a transgender healthcare system, I've found myself spiralling down. Suddenly I notice transphobia in places where I never expected it. Other subreddits, the media, friends of friends, even a few friends with whom I've cut ties. It feels like all I can see is the worst in humanity and trust has become a rarity. On the streets I'm just counting down to the next time I'll be harassed. I've found some kind souls who are accepting, but there is just so much fear. Where coming out is objectively a step towards happiness for me, every step I take towards making sense of myself and my life is at some point thwarted by people actively pursuing hate speech. Where do these people even get the energy to hate on people wanting to just exist? All trans people ever ask for is for a place in society without fearing for their safety. It is such a test of my patience to not respond to hate with hate. Trying to educate people who simply don't want to understand differences is tiring me out. Do you lot manage to stay positive at all? How do you do it?	"[removed]
I've been thinking about this a lot lately too. How can we really hope for a better future, when people are so easily manipulated to hate us. It's hard not to be a doomer sometimes lol.
You've missed the point of OP's post.

This is not about ""our healthcare has been deprioritized because of the pandemic."" Our healthcare has been deprioritized because right-wing populism, in some cases, outright fascism is on the rise globally in response to capitalism's failures, and under fascist and proto-fascist regimes any and all perceived differences can and will be used to justify othering and dehumanization.

OP, I stay positive by reminding myself that the kinds of things you're seeing are symptomatic of a deeply unhealthy cultural malaise and I do my best to isolate myself mentally and spiritually from it. I look for others who also see how toxic the world has become and I do my best to help keep their spirits bright.

Why can't nonbinary people just be treated and seen as not part of the binary, and with respect??	"So hi this is just gonna be a random LONG rant/vent about the struggles of being nonbinary (and trans in general), because I'm really pissed off at the way society views gender and gender roles so yea.. 

For context: I'm 16 & I (currently, still kinda figuring it out)identify as nonbinary transmasc, I present mostly masc/andgrogyne, although my style is usially a mix of punk, alt and goth, which kinda changes how I actually present/ come across to people+ my style also prolly is a part of this problem, while it shouldn't be but yea! Oh and btw I use he/they/(it?) pronouns! :) 

So yea.. now that you know a bit about me I'll tell you my strong opinion on society's view on gender& why society is really crappy and toxic to every trans person, as well as some cis people! (Not even mentioning other minority groups, that have nothing to do with gender or presentation) 
Soooo... I think we all know that society stupidly thinks of gender as only two categories, either male or female, and everyone even unknowingly fit/ categorize everyone as one of the two! (To be clear, I'm talking about most, but not all people! With society I mean the majority of people/ the population, and I'm not excluding people in the trans or the LGBTQ+ community from that, because some people inside of this community invalidate, ect, other people and certain identities) so yea.. MOST, if not almost all people categorize everyone, even unknowingly and unwillingly, because that's what we're all taught from a young age! For starters we need to change the way that people think of gender as a whole, and get rid of that mandatory categorizing, or AT LEAST expand the categories & create more of them! Firstly, the argument of ""there is only two biological genders"" is scientifically wrong, as most people fail to recognise intersex as a third biological gender! So yea.. firstly we need to recognize that intersex people do exist, and it's a biologically different gender from male and female! Then we need to recognize not only biology, but also identity & different identities! Now, at the minimum, everyone should recognize atleast the categories of 'intersex' and 'nonbinary' identities in addition to those traditional 'male' and 'female' categories! Now this would be a great start, and would allow so much more people to be seen & treated more fairly, but we'd still need to expand the already existing categories, and make them more more flexible! So ideally  we'd get rid of the stereotypical gender rules and norms completely, but that's not really realistic in the world we live in right now, so we'd instead have to get rid of atleast some main issues/ change the norms to fit more people in them! So for example I think society needs to give up/ completely change the biggest gender roles & norms, that cause the most issue not only among trans people but among everyone who wants to present in a ""non conventional"" or ""a gender norm breaking"" way! Now the biggest issue that kind of holds/ allows most of  the other issues, is society categorizing literally everything from objects, to colours, to mannerisms, to how we are allowed to speak to eachother and what we are/ should be allowed to do, to the pieces of fabric that we can wear, all the way to what we can do with our lives (what jobs are for who, the quality and kind of education that we get/are allowed to get!) Some of these issues are more prominent in other countries, and less of a problem in others, but generally these are the main issues that also hold the smaller issues! The thing that we would ideally completely change is how people look at gender, but more specifically how we let it affect our opinions about, (and how we see, and treat) a person or a group of people who don't fit into those norms in some ways, at all, and who choose to break the ""norms""! We should at least change the norms, or at least our opinions and acceptance of people who break/don't completely, or at all follow those norms! We should all be able to accept those people and to learn to treat them with respect, human decensy and in the way that they want to be treated as! (No, I don't mean that if a person wants to be treated as a god, they should automatically be accepted and treated as such! Lol) I mean we should be able to mold the way we treat (and ideally also how we see) an indivitual who isn't part of the binary or doesn't follow the specific rules that we set! 
For example: A person who identifies as a trans man, but is pre transition and/ or chooses to and feels more comfortable presenting as ""feminine"", so he might wear dresses, makeup, have long hair, and maybe he doesn't even want to transition medically! Now, I know most people would most likely see him as a female when first meeting him, and that isn't really even the issue, the issue or the thing that we need to change in our behaviour is how we treat him and see him after he expresses that he isn't a female, and identifies as a male! We should all be able to atleast learn to treat him as a male (so using the correct pronouns, using the correct terms and just generally treating him with the same respect and human decency, as you would treat someone who also presents, and identifies as a male! Ideally we'd all be also also actually see him as what he identifies as after he had expressed to us that he wants to be seen as male, no matter how he chooses to present and/ or if he chooses to medically transition! I know this part especially will take society and most people a lot of time and practice, but we should all atleast be able to treat a person as what they choose to identify as and especially no matter presentation, or how well they might pass in your eyes, or if they choose to medically transition or not!

 Even if just half of the general population would treat trans indivituals as what they identify as, respect them and treat them equally no matter identity or presentation, it would partially or even completely fix many of the daily struggles and issues that trans people face! It would make especially public spaces and environments such as schools, shops, businesses and especially using public restrooms and changing rooms so much easier and much safer for most trans people! It would also increase most of our mental health, since a lot of our dysphoria, ect, originate from other people's opinions, words and how they are treated, especially when presenting as they feel the most comfortable with! Even if fucking half of the population learned to simply respect us and our identities, and not even see us as suck, just simply respect us and treat us with equal kindness instead of harassing, physically or verbally abusing, judging and staring, saying rude or innapropriate stuff (Especially completely unrelated stuff/ random hate comments and/ or asking us very personal or invasive questions), and not making us constantly feel uncomfortable or even physically or mentally unsafe, and instead just treating us as normal fucking human beings, that would make a lot of trans people's daily life's more bearable, easy, and it WOULD better our mental health and even save lives!

Like.. why can't people just atleast accept us and treat us as human, and not treat us like weirdos, or like we're some animals, or like we're on a showcase, or like fucking trash! Every single person on this planet needs to at least understand that we are human, we have feelings, and we deserve the same treatment as any other person! People are fucking dying, people are killing themselves or wanting to die because they are treated badly, or constantly judged, or not seen as themselves! A lot of trans people, I'd say more than ¬º of us have wanted/ or still want/ or have tried to kill themselves because they would rather die than live like this, being treated badly and judged, not seen as yourself, hating your body and how you look, being stuck in the wrong body and being punished for it! So many small things that we could all or atleast most of us change in our behaviour, as simple as calling us by the name we prefer, and as fucking simple as not fucking harassing and abusing us for needing to use a fucking restroom!! So many small and easy things that everyone could so easily change, learn and so quickly get used to or at least try to learn, that would save so many fucking lives! THE MAJORITY OF trans people want, or have wanted to die! MANY  of us sh/ have self harmed in some way because of other people's actions/ for hating themselves for not fitting into the norm! WAY TOO MANY trans people are completely denied, or it's made very hard for them to get a job, healthcare, or an apartment to live in just because of their identity! MOST IF NOT ALL trans people have/will/constantly experience some form of harrasment, verbal or physical, and TOO MANY OF US are beaten up, even to death, just because we want to be ourselves so badly!! Is it so goddamn hard to just make us feel safe and seen and understood?? Why is it that you feel the need to treat us worse than you would treat fucking actual trash!?? WE ARE HUMANS WITH FEELINGS!!? We don't choose this, we can't choose to be cured, and we can't change! We just are the way we are, we just don't feel that that the body and or the identity that was given to us is correct! We just want to be ourselves and be safe and respected and not judged literally every where we go! And I think I can speak for most trans people on this, we are born this way, this ISN'T a choice and we just want you to treat us as you would any other human! If this were a choice, I think most, not all of us, but the majority of us would choose to not be trans! I mean why tf would so many people choose to live in the wrong body, to hate themselves and the way they look, to want to die, to be treated badly and judged by almost everyone, for other people's unacceptace and own conservative ideas to make our daily life, going to a public place, and for them to make our lives a living hell!? Why would anyone choose to be harrassed, beaten up, thrown out of their homes, and to be disowned by their own families, who would choose to lose friends? Who would choose to try to change themselves according to what other people think you should look and act and be like, to the point where we don't even recognize ourselves anymore, to the point where we lose ourselves completely and to the point where we are constantly miserable?  Who would choose the possibility of getting beaten up for needing to use a restroom in public? Or for just entering any place where there might be people? Who would choose to adapt to being on their toes all the time, to always be aware and afraid of people who might not accept or understand us, who would choose to eventually not trust anyone, to have anxiety among other issues, to live as someone else, who would choose to give up a successful happy life, a safe one?? NOBODY would just want to give all these things up, and more, for no reason! WE JUST WANT TO LIVE AS OURSELVES! Because if we can't do that, then what's the point in living at all, right? That's how so many of us think! And accepting ourselves completely is made so hard by other people too, it's sometimes impossible to fully accept ourselves for a long time, and to feel comfortable with ourselves, to wear what we like, to act as we like, to just feel comfortable at all fully, is made so hard for most of us, and for some, that lack of comfort is enough for them to fucking kill themselves??! It's so stupid and annoying and crappy how most, not all people but most people treat us so badly to the point where we want to die! That shouldn't be acceptable or ok in any way! Every person should have the opportunity to live as theirselves, present as how they like, and do that unapologeticly in a safe and non judgemental environment! It's just not fair for me, or for any of us to even experience one of the many struggles that I listed, nor should ANYONE have to live with a set of these struggles, if not even most of them in our daily lives and the fact that were just often told to ignore the judgement and the comments and the bullying, excluding, people treating us differently, having to be alone because ""who would wanna be friends with the tr4nny?""... We're just told to ignore all that and accept that not all people are educated in this stuff and that ""they're from a different generation, they don't understand this"" and they tell us that as if they can't learn anything new? As if them being older or from a different generation or them not being educated about different identities means that they're allowed a free pass to treat us like crap? You tell us to ignore those people as if they don't know how to treat people with kindness and basic respect? We are not the ones who should accept it, all those people who still don't understand or respect us as human beings should be the ones to accept that we are not gonna go anywhere! We just want to live our lives in peace, they should be the ones who are constantly told by LITERALLY everyone to JUST ACCEPT IT, AND MOVE ON! We should have a safe life as ourselves and that shouldn't be taken from us just because some people, most people, can't apparently learn anything new or atleast, as a bare minimum accept us as human and it shouldn't have to be learned or thought that we shouldn't be treated that way! Every single person should know and follow that, or they are the broblem, NOT US!! 

FUCK THE SOCIETY, ITS GENDER RULES AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE A PART OF THE PROBLEM! ESPECIALLY EVERYONE WHO MAKES ANY ONE OF US FEEL LIKE WE DONT DESERVE TO BE ALIVE, AND THOSE WHO TREAT US SO BADLY THAT WE END UP GIVING UP AND FUCKING KILLING OURSELVES! THE SOCIETY IS FUCKED UP AND IM SO TIRED OF LIVING IN A WORLD LIKE THIS, WHERE I AM NOT SEEN OR EVEN RESPECTED BY MOST PEOPLE! 

Ps: I felt happy today bc my mom used my preferred name ONCE  today! I, or any one of us shouldn't have to be so happy over a small thing that should be less than the bare minimum! That isn't fair for anyone! No one should feel happy just for someone actually treating you as you should be treated, especially for just that one single time, we shouldn't have to settle for that! We all deserve so much fucking better! If you read this, completely or partially, have a nice day/night and remember that you are valid and you deserve to be treated well!

My parents voted for Trump - again - is it finally time to cut them off?...	"I've (26F) posted ranting about my parents (60-ishM, 60-ishF) before.

My parents have not at all been the most kind to me over my three+ year transition.  At first it was refusal to use my name/pronouns.  Then came the belittling that I'd never be a woman, nothing I could do would ever make me one, and that everyone on the street would know I'm trans.  That all my friends are simply playing along with my little ruse because ""They're my friends and they'll say anything to stay your friend,"" .

It then escalated over the months to my mother asking me how my transition made THEM feel, how I affected THEM, how I was forcing them to use pronouns I so desperately wanted them to use.

Later I realized they were only tolerating my existence because I was their child. LGBTQ rights meant nothing to them.  Gay marriage didn't matter.  They didn't fight for me.  They never tried learning.  Out of both sides of my family (and my sister) nobody has such a huge deal with me than they have.

As the years passed I noticed as long as I didn't talk to them about their view on trans rights, gay marriage, what they felt about my relationships, that I'm a lesbian... everything was fine.  As long as I never mentioned a hot-button issue we were peachy keen.

Then today happened.

I asked the ill-fated question,

""Who did you vote for?""

Of course the answer was Trump.  I asked them if it mattered that his re-election could mean the end to my rights.  No comment beyond they voted for him because he'd ""Make the biggest difference to more people"" than Biden would.  I don't like either of them but it's the lesser of two evils.  My mom told me they were too busy to watch Trump talk about the community and she didn't know even though I told her months ago how our healthcare was in danger.

I'm extremely disappointed in them.  Not that I'm surprised.  But I want to cut them off more than ever, yet at the same time am I overreacting?  Am I making a bigger fuss out of the past three years than I should?  If they weren't my parents the answer would be obvious: **Yes, of course cut them off.  Fuck them.**  I don't find the answer that easy... their treatment of me isn't hostile.  It's not malicious.  They've come around a little to me and the community.

But not to the point where they respect us as a whole.  That ALL of our rights are in danger.  That our very existence is shadowed with regulations, rules, hate crimes, everything.  They so easily marked us for dead without so much as batting an eyelash.

I know it sounds stupid.  I've been debating this all night in my head.  I feel like I'd be making a terrible decision.  I don't know.  I don't know anymore.  Some days are good, some days are terrible.   I can't tell if they really support me or if they're doing it out of obligation.  I want to cry so fucking much...

&#x200B;

TL;DR: **My parents generally disrespected me for most of my transition, had little regard for trans rights, failed to educate themselves when they've had time to, and had zero intention of voting in favor of trans rights.  Should I cut them off?**"	"Youve already considered cutting them off if they werent your parents. Well, id say that is reason enough to cut them off.

You do not get to choose your parents, and sometimes, the child turns out so much differently, that going no contact will be healthiest for all. Its going to be a hard decision for sure, so before you do, do the following.

Consider all of your interactions up until this point to the best of your abilities. Does the bad outweigh the good? Does the negative happen much more often? Does the happy occur when youre holding yourself back?
I believe so. If they're unable to change for the better, it'd be best to show them that their unwillingness to change has consequences. IE: Losing one of their children who is danger of becoming a victim of far more heinous hate crimes than most others due to being themself. I've already written off my parents, both of whom are in their early forties, one I haven't spoken to in a very long time, the other I live with and have to constantly remind them that I'm their daughter now, not their son. 

I do hope that things get better in this godforsaken land, especially for those of us in the LGBTQ+ Community.
I honestly feel like it's up to you, in the end. I'm trans as well (m to f), and it seems like my dad doesn't support me at all. If you'd feel happier after cutting your parents off, then by all means, do it. In the end, I'm just trying to help ya out.
They don‚Äôt sound worthy of the name ‚Äúparents‚Äù to me. The utter lack of concern for your wellbeing is alarming. 

But really, I think you already know the answer to your question.
I've restrained myself more times than I can count regarding topics that are important to me but cause a lot of pain for everybody involved.  


My mom kinda wears the pants when it comes to decisions but my father is more often understanding 1-on-1.  But a lot of the time both of them have equally handled parts of my life... *not well*.  


I had a really good childhood, but it's hard to say if that makes a wide difference to me *because* I'm such a different person than I was back then.  Not as many things were effecting me, nothing horrendous had happened.  I was a pretty normal kid until I turned 15 and everything went to shit from there.
Definitely... I wish I could tell them to fuck off but there's more riding on my relationship with them than my rights. (i.e. sort of involves them helping me with my car)  Which... really fucking blows but I can grin and bear not speaking my mind and just limiting or telling myself that contact is cut.  


Trust me girl I do too...
Are you willing to sacrifice mental health for the sake of familial bonds? 

You shouldnt be looking to the past when evaluating relationships. You should be looking at the present. Are your parents giving you support, or are they a constant drain on your well being?

If you can manage, id suggest this. You sit them down, talk to them one more time. Explain everything written here. If they get abusive (mental abuse is also abuse), start shouting or generally unwilling to realise and amend their mistake, you say goodbye, walk out, and never speak with them again"	jleikj	trans	9	0.68	2020-10-31 07:52:02

Arkansas Anti-Trans Bill	"In short, Arkansas has proposed a bill that bans trans people from accessing gender-affirming healthcare at any age.

This will have a detrimental effect on trans individuals living in Arkansas and prevent them from being able to express their identity.

To add on, it will also have an impact on other states and the country because if this bill is passed into a law, it only encourages trans and homophobic laws and bills from other states. The entire LGBTQ+ community is affected by this and we need to fight against this bill.

But it's not hard to asume I'm trans, mostly because I have a pronoun pin. I had to get some blood work done and ever since the pandemic I try to wear my mask to healthcare facilities.

Do you need your mommy to hold you?"" I ignored her and answered my moms genuine questions of how it went, but on the way home my mom brought up how she was making fun of me. She mentioned how it was because ""she saw you as a boy"" and seemed almost happy for me. In a way, I do feel some sense of gender euphoria but I also feel very offended.

Vent - Why Do I Feel Worse About Myself After Coming Out?	"It seems like I only visit this lovely sub when I feel sad, I hope to change that in the future. Thank you to all the kind people who have given me their time and interacted with my previous post.

TW: Food, issues with eating, gender dysphoria, menstruation and health care.

So I was cleaning out my Google photos as one does, and I came across old photos of myself form when I was in my early teens - this was the beginning stages of me experimenting with gender. After looking at them for a while I felt really sad, ugly and even less content with my gender presentation (for context I am a Trans-Masc Non Binary). [(Said pics and pics of me now.)](https://imgur.com/a/n5VhvfV)

For the rest of this rant I will have to explain that I was born female. I did not menstruate for a large majority of my 'pubescent stage'. I had my first menstruation at the age of 10, I stopped menstruating at 12 and consistently told my mother that I thought something was wrong. She told me not to worry, 'everyone misses their period' (keep in mind that I mentioned that I hadn't had it since I was 12 and brought it up through the ages of 14 to 17). After telling my dad when I was almost 18 he took me to my general practitioner where I was told that I suffer from PCOS or 'Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome'. I was prescribed a high dose estrogen birth control. After starting my medication I began menstruating at a 'normal' rate again - however I now suffer so many side effects I would much rather take my chances with the illness itself. Hairloss, increased appetite, severe nausea and quite a few other more graphic thing I don't want to mention. I went from being under weight to being severely overweight (as you can compare in my Imgur photo album), had to shave my head because washing my hair and pulling out clumps made me mentally distressed (I cried almost every time I took a bath) and was told by my doctors to just 'deal with it'. It's just 'the expected side effects'. I find it poetically sad that I am forced onto female hormones when in reality, I just want to live with my overly high natural testosterone levels. I want to have my reproductive organs removed, but 'I'm too young to make such an important decision'. I wish that I lived in a country like America or the UK where I could even make an attempt at transitioning, where there are actual medical professionals to help me with my gender identity.

I've been trying to diet to lose all this excess weight, go back to being the weight I felt most myself at. Today I ate two bowls of food, and I felt disgusting. I spent the week prior eating a lot, I was having a really bad menstruation and had food cravings like I've never had before. I'd been doing so well before that, eating one meal a day and not eating after 12 in the afternoon. I can't get back onto that, I keep eating and eating and I feel like I don't pass as masculine and never will if I can't lose this weight. I've always had a rough time with my body - going from overweight to underweight back to overweight -but it just somehow feels worse now after coming out. I feel empowered after coming out, a weight off my shoulders but I also feel like I will never achieve what I want to with my appearance. Not to mention I can't afford to buy binders for every weight stage I am at, so I feel like I have to race to being skinny so I can finally buy myself a binder and achieve that epic flat chest.

Do you feel like the LGBTQIA+ community pushes a certain 'look' for certain people? I love watching trans tiktoks and alternative tiktoks but I feel like all I see are slim or fit trans men/trans-masc nb's (which are all perfect in their own way, of course. Not taking away from them and their amazing achievements) but never any slightly chubby or overweight men/nb's. I guess it makes me feel just like I did about my body when I presented feminine, that being fat just isn't something people want to see - the lack of that representation makes it harder to live vicariously through others I suppose. If you know of any chubbier nb/trans-men I could follow I'd love for you to share them with me!

I don't really know what the purpose of this rant was, I guess I'm just going through a lot of dysphoria at the moment and don't have anyone to talk to about it who would understand entirely. I don't feel like the handsome boy I could be, and I just want to feel happy with myself. Also just angry at the lack of trans recognition in my country's healthcare, being told I'm too young to make a decision about my own body at the age of almost 20 (let us not forget my only purpose is to pump out kids, so why would I want to remove the reproductive system causing me great pain and dysphoria?). Oh, and do you think I looked masc in any of these pictures? I might just be looking through rose tinted shades. "	"You look especially masc in that first one, but you look cool in all of them. You certainly have style.

You don't have to take the birth control if you don't want to. The side effects sound pretty wretched for you in particular. My wife opts to live without the hormones, and frankly, we find not having to deal with menstruation to be an advantage. The biggest problems for her are the on and of skin breakouts and the thicker facial hair (which is much more noticeable to her than me). I don't know if you have more severe problemsl, though.
Metformin is a known treatment for PCOS as a prevention for a lot of the health risks associated with it; high cholesterol, heart disease, high blood pressure, risk of diabetes, etc. For some people who struggle with PCOS caused weight gain it can also help with weight loss. You could ""treat"" PCOS without being on birth control. I was on it and was just slightly nauseous at first, but that went away. I'm off now because I'm 41 and haven't shown any tendency toward these previously mentioned health risks.  You can also get a mirena IUD with progesterone (a significantly lower dose than the pill) as a treatment option. I have it and it helps with my main symptom of PCOS, severe acne. As a bonus it stopped my period. If your doctor won't discuss these options with you get a new doc period. I'd also highly recommend seeing a gender therapist. That's also been very helpful for me.

It seems you think people can only be desired if they look a certain way. Why is that? Do you only desire a partner because of their looks, or do you also desire them for less superficial things like their personality, talents, how they treat you and others?
I'm going through some shit. I'm... a very horny person. I wouldn't dream of assaulting or harassing anyone but I see some women (and some nonbinary people) and I yearn to touch them. I want someone to feel that way about me, I crave that validation. 

I probably have some deeply rooted ideas about what makes a woman attractive and have summarily disqualified myself. I know there's more to me, to any woman, than that.

Advice for creating a trans-friendly practice	"I'm starting a career in family medicine (I'm a nurse practitioner) in a fairly rural area in New England.  I'm want to do my best to make sure my practice is a safe place for any/all GSM individuals, and thought I'd reach out to see if anyone had advice/suggestions or wanted to share ""what-not-to-do"" stories.  My main concern, honestly, is educating the front staff and medical assistants who might not have any experience with trans or gender queer folks and might say/do things that are unintentionally offensive or create barriers to good care... the area in which I'll be working is fairly conservative.  I know that a lot of trans individuals (understandably) avoid the healthcare system to avoid the discrimination/misunderstanding/awkwardness it often involves, but I hope to create a practice where all are welcome and comfortable! Obviously I'm not planning on managing hormone therapy in family practice (that'll be for the specialists!) but everyone still needs a general practitioner once in a while! All advice/suggestions/thoughts are welcome.  Cheers!"	"I think the biggest thing is to educate your staff to use the gender they're presenting as regardless of their drivers license or current legal name. Also a spot for preferred name on patient information forms and to make sure they use the preferred name when calling the patient back would be good.

I think the biggest thing that helps is simply educating people about the subject. A lot of people are completely ignorant about trans individuals. Although you really can't educate bigots, I find, haha. So it might be something worth touching on when you're hiring people. 

And I definitely understand about conservative areas, being in Oklahoma, so good luck! On the bright side, there's a lot of awesome people, like yourself! 
What helped us the most when we were starting to transition was that the place I went to (and am still going to) was the first place that treated us like it was any other condition someone could have, nobody was surprised that we were asking about starting to transition or anything, nobody was like oh wait we need to figure out what to do, we didn't feel like a freak. We felt like a person, a person with a medical condition, but a person. There weren't awkward questions about why we were doing so, there wasn't any questioning our judgment or suggesting alternatives or acting like they knew better than us. It was the first place we felt safe. So... yeah... do that?
Where in rural new England? Fenway health will be happy to help -- their resources are pretty good. If you're in CT I have some local resources and can help. And -- yes you Can provide hormone therapy as family practice! Pm me and I'll give details. :)
Please educate staff on gender non-conforming people too! Aka people that don't use she/her or he/him but maybe they/them or other gender neutral pronouns. I had a bad experience with an NP in a clinic in rural New England who said people would think she was ""crazy"" for putting down they pronouns for me.
Make sure all your patient record systems allow for more than just male/female preferably with a custom input option and any forms people are asked to fill out have a blank line rather than only two check boxes.  Also they should allow for chosen name to be more prominently displayed than legal name so that no one slips up.

If you get this and the training suggested by the other comments, the next thing that I would suggest is community outreach.  Make sure any public facing information on a website or clinic listings mention that you are directly working to be a safe space.  Go seek LGBT organizations and volunteer.  All the advice and reading in the world wont help compared to interacting with people.  Also, for most trans and otherwise GSM people, merely finding a safe place to seek medical care is very hit and miss so getting your name into places they might look will be hugely beneficial for the community.  

Finally, hormone therapy isn't really as complicated as it may seem.  Try and tap other clinicians who have practices that do work with HRT for trans people.  I would suggests as your staff's understanding of trans issues expands and you start networking with other clinics that do similar, considering offering informed consent HRT.  
Be prepared for headaches with insurance...
Yeah, I might have to battle a bit since my practice is part of a big organization, but the pronoun thing is definitely going to happen.  And education will be super important.  Thanks.
Lol ok sounds like a plan.
Thanks! Just getting started but will reach out once I'm a little more settled in.  I'm up in Maine, actually.
Ugh. WTF.
Great advice, thanks.  Once I'm established I do hope to do some outreach and to get involved with the local GSM community if I can... I heard a fantastic lecture by a trans outreach educator at a conference a few months ago, and could start by reaching out to them.  

And yeah, a few people have mentioned that HRT is do-able in primary care... my concern would be the bigger picture, making sure the full support system is in place, not just a Rx, but definitely something I'll look into.
Of course! We need more trans-friendly care providers. :)

I don't specifically have resources in Maine, and I'm a second year medical student in CT. BUT please do let me know when you settle in -- I would love to assist in any way I can -- even if that's just sending links to resources.
Sounds great!  Access to HRT tends to be a very annoying issue (at least from my limited perspective) as it's one of the very common concerns of anyone entering into any sort of medical transition.  The idea that you need to go to a specialist for something that will be a ongoing medical topic for the rest of your life, places that sort of care out of reach for those without insurance or those who are underinsured.  It also adds the connotation that HRT is a hugely complicated and risky path to go down and this only serves to increase the stress of starting/continuing through transition.  Being able to form a strong relationship with a single care provider who can be seen for anything as opposed to several providers, can ease the process both logistically and emotionally."	3p6nkq	trans	8	0.84	2015-10-18 02:30:55
US petition for federal transgender book of rights	"We, the undersigned, call upon our government to recognize the inherent dignity and rights of transgender individuals in our society. We believe that every person, regardless of their gender identity, deserves equal protection under the law, including access to healthcare and safe and dignified restroom facilities.

We call for the passage of a National Transgender Bill of Rights that would guarantee the following:

Healthcare Access: All transgender individuals, regardless of age, should have access to comprehensive, affordable, and culturally competent healthcare, including hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery, and mental health services. Discrimination based on gender identity or expression should be prohibited in all healthcare settings.

Restroom Access: All transgender individuals, including minors, should have the right to use restrooms and other gender-segregated facilities that correspond with their gender identity, without fear of harassment or discrimination. This includes access to gender-neutral restrooms and changing areas, as well as appropriate accommodations for individuals who do not feel comfortable using gender-segregated facilities.

Protection from Discrimination: Transgender individuals, including minors, should be protected from discrimination in all areas of life, including employment, housing, education, public accommodations, and healthcare. This includes protections against harassment and violence based on gender identity or expression.

Legal Recognition: Transgender individuals, including minors, should have the right to legally change their name and gender marker on all official documents, without excessive barriers or costly requirements.

Access to Gender-Affirming Services: Transgender individuals, including minors, should have access to gender-affirming services, such as counseling, support groups, and legal assistance, to help them navigate the challenges of gender transition and affirm their identities.

We believe that enshrining these rights into law is essential to creating a society that is truly equitable and just for all. We call on our government to take action now to ensure that the fundamental human rights of transgender individuals are respected and protected."	"I support this.  Though it may be better put into a perspective of bodily autonomy.

That all people should have the right to make their own healthcare decisions.  That all people with medical conditions should have the right to access all available treatment options.  That only the individual in question has a right to their body.

This would increase solidarity with women‚Äôs rights proponents and intersex rights proponents.  Kill three birds with one stone if you will."	11abcu0	trans	9	1.0	2023-02-23 22:53:12

Status of Canada's Gender Identity Bill	"I e-mailed Bill Siksay (who tabled the last bill and is pretty awesome) about this earlier this year and he directed me to Randall Garrison. After not hearing from him for awhile, I got the following reply today:

>Hello Friends,

>Spring is upon us and so is the fight to protect the rights of Transsexual, Transgender and gender non-conforming Canadians in Parliament.  I am taking the Gender Identity Bill, Bill C-279,  back into the House of Commons for its first hour of second reading for debate in April.  This Bill has made it through the House of Commons once and I believe that we can do it again.  This Bill would add gender identity and gender expression into the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, this may sound small but this Bill could have monumental changes regarding equality in employment, housing, healthcare, mobility and protection for Trans Canadians.

>We need to stand up and tell the government that the rights of Trans people need to be protected, that we are talking about Human Rights not special rights and that we are talking about dignity that is supposed to be enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The NDP stands unanimous in its support of this Bill and now we are looking for the support of all other Parties.

Mercury Stardust (the Trans Handy Ma'am) is Amazing!	"I just finished watching Mercury Stardust's 24hr live on tiktok. She raised over 100K for Plume which provides gender affirming care to people in the US. I'm from Canada, but still supported it and cried when we reached the goal. It means at least 100 trans individuals can get their HRT and labs for free for a whole year. With all the extra hate that has been directed towards transgender people in the US lately and the fact their healthcare is so terrible even for cis people, they really needed this. It's going to save lives. It's a huge boost in positivity! I needed to share my excitement with more people.

I came out to my mom, and I was so scared about it. She accepted me even though I didn't think she would. Mercury's live kept me busy through a stressful time and hitting the goal was like a heartwarming gift at the end of a long 2 days.

I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not going to come out.	"I‚Äôm going to cut my abusive parents out of my life and move to the UK. I‚Äôm going to start a new life, new name and all. Im only 15 and I‚Äôm not going to be able to move until I‚Äôm 21, because I live in Israel and I must serve in the army. I‚Äôm going to serve as a cis woman because the service is shorter for women. I‚Äôm not going to come out. My closest friend knows I am a man, and he supports me so much. I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôll probably fall out of touch with him as well, but that‚Äôs a sacrifice I feel I have to make in order for me to live happily. Maybe when I finish my transition I will come back to visit for the high school reunion. I don‚Äôt know why I am planning so much ahead but it makes me feel better, putting my expectations of my future into words gives me a sense of certainty in a world of constant chaos. I might go to my healthcare provider and discuss the option of taking a pill to stop my periods, reason being that it‚Äôs so painful it disturbs my day to day activities and causes me anxiety. On my last period I had a panic attack when I was thinking about coming out- this is another reason I‚Äôm certain I should not come out, even though my parents are supportive of my sister who is in a lesbian relationship. 

What are your thoughts?"	"if u plan to get hormones in the uk the best way would probably be to go through private health care as the waiting lists for going with the nhs are insanely long. hopefully they‚Äôll be better by then bc that‚Äôs a while away but it‚Äôs definitely something to consider
If you‚Äôre in israel you can get out of serving in the military on medical reasons, just talk about your anxiety and all your other mental issues and they‚Äôll probably give you an exemption. You can also flat out refuse and just do max a few months in prison before you can leave. Much quicker than going through with it, and you avoid becoming a war criminal at the same time
Any chance you can emigrate at 18 claiming political asylum? Just tossing words that I've heard into the wind.
I will always say this its not always best to come out if it puts you in danger or at risk of something bad happening to you
Hey umm... You can get an exemption and not serve if you want to.. also the gap between women's service and men's is like 4 months total of you're not getting any special roles or something.. also, you can transition in Israel too, and in the army..
That‚Äôs good advice, except for that part about prison. I don‚Äôt know how it is in the UK, but in the US if you‚Äôve been to prison for any reason at all, you cannot adopt a child. And I‚Äôd like to adopt a child in the future, even if I would be able to freeze my eggs and have biological children, adoption is still something I really want to do. I will try not to serve in the army, thanks for that advice.
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm considering doing community service instead of doing military service. But honestly I just want to get as far away from here as soon as I can.
I know, I just don‚Äôt feel safe living in the same country as my family. I never want to run into them afterwards. I just really want to start fresh."	pdj9xn	trans	9	0.91	2021-08-28 22:25:10
I (M16) Am Transgender. My Dad (M49) Has Expressed His Disapproval And Is Likely To Refuse Me Access To HRT. My Aunt (F50) Also Does Not Seem To Be Too Supportive.	"For 16 years, I lived with my mom in NYC. However, she was very ""emotionally abusive."" I'm hesitant on describing it that way though. Here's a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/msddrw/what_can_i_do_to_escape_my_mom/) to give some brief perspective. I'll provide more details if you ask. Anyways, I left her about a month ago. For one month, I lived with my aunt. During that month, I came out to my aunt. Then, on June 10th, my Dad came from Korea and now I live with him.

So, my primary goal is to get HRT. And in order to get HRT, I need my dad's consent. 

When I told my aunt I was transgender, she was ""confused."" She did say to me that she didn't really understand being transgender. She compared it to wanting to lose weight once. She also told me that it would be a long process to transitioning. Like, she told me once that I would have to see a general therapist once before I see a gender therapist and before that gender therapist sends me to a doctor. She also told me that I don't really understand what being a woman means, like periods and stuff. She also wants me to not permanently end my connection with my mom. She wants me to take care of my mom after all of this. Now, during the month I lived with my aunt, I scheduled a lot of appointments at a lot of hospitals that allowed a first appointment by myself. I didn't tell her about all of these appointments. And I was probably vague about whatever I told her. I didn't feel like I should tell her any of this given that she didn't really help me in making these appointments. I didn't even tell her when I went to a hospital sometimes. Plus, I have the feeling she doesn't like me being transgender at all. That she wants it to go away. But I don't know this for sure though. It's just a hunch. 

Anyways, she told me before my dad came that I need to convince my dad. Maybe she means ""convince"" in a different way than I understand, but I feel like I shouldn't have to convince my dad of anything. That I should just have to ask him to approve HRT, and that's it. I shouldn't have to explain my feelings of wanting to be a girl. All he needs to know is that I was diagnosed with dysphoria and that I need HRT. This feeling also applies to my aunt. I am uncomfortable about telling either of them that I want to be a girl, about how I was always jealous of other girls in middle school, how I loved being in a skirt when I was like 5, and how my anxiety regarding me being a guy got worse. I shouldn't have to wait for my dad or my aunt to understand or be convinced before I get my treatment. I shouldn't have to delay my needs because of their ignorance. My needs shouldn't have to wait for their convenience. 

Now, during that time I was making appointments, I purposely did so while my aunt was working. And I did repeatedly ask her about convincing my dad, about my dad's parental rights, etc. She was sorta dismissive. She said my dad was coming soon so I should wait. And that she couldn't really guarantee me HRT, that she could only really try to convince my dad at most. I just got the feeling she would be okay with my dad saying no, which is not. I'll say this. I will no hesitate to kill myself if my dad ultimately refuses. I have no intention as living as a guy anymore.

Anyways, onto my dad. He already knew for a month. My aunt told him over a phone call once, and that was all. He reacted by laughing and asking her to clarify. He didn't really seem to take it seriously. When he was in Korea, more recently, my dad asked my aunt if it was because I have a small penis. And my dad says I need to live as a guy, that these thoughts aren't normal. He's okay with me going to like a therapist, but not actually transitioning. He wants me to be a man. He said this like he's a father figure nicely talking to a son, teaching him a lesson. He was calm, and I think he was thinking he was ""fixing"" me, enlightening me. Like, this was just a phase. It's not. My aunt said he doesn't really like it, and she said that he's old-school. He doesn't really get this. This is really new to him, shattering. I don't think this is a justification at all. I don't know if she's trying to present it as such, but it's not.

Now, onto more recent events. Ever since my dad came, I haven't really been open to him. I've avoided looking him in the eye, haven't openly started a talk about being trans to him, and have generally not talked to him at all, only giving him one word answers. When he asked if he was giving me stress once, I said no because I thought that he wouldn't change his mind on letting me transition. I've even lied to him about going to an appointment, instead saying I was going to a school meeting. 

Yesterday, I came back from my doctor's appointment. My aunt came over to my apartment and asked me what happened. I told her some vague stuff, and when she asked for more info. I asked if I needed to tell her this. She reacted to this with indignation. She said that of course I had to tell her this stuff. She also said I wasn't really seeing her and my dad as people; they were just a means to an end to me. She said I was wrong, that I have a wrong mindset. She also said I don't even bother trying to start a relationship with my dad, even though he came all the way here, even though he cares about me, even though he paid for my apartment. She was angry that I don't really care for him or for her. She said I was also in the wrong in my relationship with my mom. I didn't how my mom the respect she deserved as a mother. And that I was selfish too, such as how I didn't want to help my mom with getting government benefits. Maybe she wasn't trying to victim-blame, but it definitely came off that way. Keep in mind, I haven't really told my aunt any of this so far. She said I have to convince my dad. She also brought up how she supported me too, taking me in and doing other stuff for me too while I was living with my mom. She also brought up how I was also selfish in the past too, like how when my dad got surgery and my aunt tried to call me to tell me, I didn't pick up. I didn't pick up because I thought my mom would find out, and how my mom would get pissed. I was scared of my mom. She got angry when she brought this up. But I think this is ridiculous to get angry over. Anyways, today she came too. She said I have the wrong mindset again, that I only see her and my dad as a means, that I'm not even concerned about fostering a relationship with them, and that I still need to tell my dad and convince him even though he already denied my identity. I really hate that convincing part. And she said I should try to understand what she said. I still don't get it. I'll update my post as I remember more info, but this is all I got.

Next Wednesday, I'm bringing her along to my gender therapist to talk about me being trans. I'll say I'm very uncomfortable about talking about being transgender with my aunt. I won't even tell her my new name. I also avoid using the words ""transgender"" or ""hormone therapy,"" instead saying the words ""medical care"" or ""healthcare."" I obviously haven't talked to my dad about this either. And I haven't really tried to talk to him either."	"Where do you currently live?

Look at this [list of minimum ages to run for office](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/candidates/guide/2020/qualifications2020.shtml) in Texas (where I live) and tell me you couldn't do one of those jobs! Is it hard? ABSO-DAMN-LUTELY. Would you be a pioneer affecting change and setting new standards for trans people across an entire nation? Yes. Would you be a voice representing millions of our gender nonconforming brothers and sisters? Yes.

My mother always told me, if you don't like the rules of the game, change them. Getting elected is one way to do that. Legislating trans rights is one step closer to ensuring we receive equal rights. (You can also fight for amazing things like universal healthcare. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to just go get surgery? No crazy hoops to jump through.

"I really hope to see more trans individuals who are strong enough to put themselves out there in politics, soon! I, for one, don't think I'd be able to fit it around doing the job I love (archaeology), so I'll have to leave that mantle to the other UK trans people who can and want to do so. In the UK, I'm pretty sure you can also go into politics once you're eighteen, so I'd love to see some people who want to do it, doing it and making the world a better place.
Love that energy. I definitely approve of the sentiment. If you want to make a difference, go out there and make it. Sometimes, the best way to get what you want is to reach out and grab it! If you don't get it the first time, figure out why you didn't, fix it, and try again.

Good luck on your bid for City Council!
Here in the Netherlands we already managed to vote a party who's big into trans rights into the government.
Because the game is rigged, to stay in it you basically play by the rules already made and if the other players don't like you, they have a whole lotta money and power to ruin your life. Changing from the inside always fails, because the longer you're inside, the more of an insider you become. 

Also, if the press ever looked at my history, no one would vote for me, hahaha. I couldn't get one by buying a detoxing alcoholic a drink in exchange.
Well I couldnt do that because I'm a mess and am better suited to working with dogs than people! XD
I dont run for anything political or public because I do not want everyone and their brother looking into my life and my past so they can blast it everywhere. I am great unoticed and unknown in the shadows away from lights and prying eyes. Plus me holding a political office would not be good because I would end up arguing all day long with everyone that is wrong and things would go no where. Not to mention my devil may care attitude and fuck it lets find out attitudes would get me into too much trouble to keep an office.
I LOVE hearing from folks in other countries sharing their perspective! I know there are several democratic countries where technically a trans person should be able to run for government but I'm unfamiliar with the systems/nuances.
Which is amazing but without trans representation, can you truly say those representing you understand you and what you're going through? 

P.S. Yay Netherlands... Making America look like the backwards ass racist, bigoted, capitalist piece of crap it is!
When I first started transitioning in the late 90s, the only way to pay for anything was sex work. I have criminal history but nothing since 2004.

If all goes well, I'll be the 1st out and proud transwoman elected in Texas. If I can do it, anyone can.
Admittedly, going from stealth to getting international hate mail wasn't easy. It's not for everyone.  But, if we don't fight for our brothers and sisters who will?
Without them we'd still be decades behind since our needs are quite specific and wouldn't come up in any regular party their program.
I am happy and proud of you for fighting for thankful as well. But my past is full of bad decisions drugs alcohol and full sends of fuck it lets find out moments.

Traumatic doctor‚Äôs appointment	"Today I (16MtF) was brought to an appointment with the kids mental health services for the UK national health service. The doctor in question told me that it would still be several months before my assessment (not for GD mind, for autism, which is not what I want since they often use it against trans people), it‚Äôs already been well over a year and not a single assessment or diagnosis for anything.

The doctor also said that most trans people detransition, and that anyone who doesn‚Äôt work for the NHS is lying. She also said that trans people are ‚Äúbrainwashing our children‚Äù

My parents, who are pretty transphobic already, heard all this, and then had another conversation without me, which I couldn‚Äôt hear, but they all definitely sounded angry.

I‚Äôm so upset and worried, I will likely start DIY in the near future to avoid destroying my mental health completely, (I‚Äôm absolutely making sure to do everything safely) and I‚Äôm scared of what my country and its healthcare system is doing to us.

Wait lists are already 5-10 years long, and they now can send police and doctors to investigate kids who they think are transitioning, under the illusion of ‚Äúsafeguarding‚Äù

I‚Äôm really scared of this country, and can‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôm 18 or 19. I just feel I needed to share this."	"Look in

The doctor is completely wrong to say that most people detransition. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality's report ""The U.S. Transgender Survey,"" of those who had ever started a medical transition process, nearly three-quarters (74%) were still taking hormones. Additionally, only 8% stopped taking hormones due to side effects, while less than 1% reported detransitioning altogether

I would definitely communicate this information for your parents and explain to them that many people have are prejudice towards trans people due to the wide spread of mis information online. My best advice for anyone is to not trust word of mouth information today as it‚Äôs often very unreliable. Rely on .gov or reliable .org websites for your information instead. 

Medical professionals in many countries are required to provide accurate information and avoid giving false or misleading advice to their patients. There are also laws protecting transgender individuals from discrimination based on their gender identity, which it appears is what you experienced."	y7z8ml	trans	8	0.91	2022-10-19 10:38:41
The state of trans healthcare in one of the supposedly most progressive countries in the world	"I read a report today from Amnesty on trans healthcare in my country (from 2016). I knew it wouldn't be good, but I thought, ""Hey, we're a progressive country, we're very open, it can't be that bad - maybe I'll even be pleasantly surprised!""


Boy, was I wrong. The report described how trans people are basically seen as insane, as sub-humans incapable of making decisions about their own bodies and as sexual deviants. Trans people who apply to be considered for transition have to go through a specific center where they're subjected to numerous interviews with psychologists and doctors - sometimes almost a decade's worth. They may be asked things such as ""do you think about your father when you masturbate"" or ""what sexual positions do you use"" or ""what sexual partners have you been with"" or ""when you have sex, who penetrates who"", and they're even sometimes assumed to be pedophiles or practicing bestiality. Mind you, my country is probably seen as one of the most progressive in the world. Yet this is how trans people are viewed by the healthcare system. As inferior, unintelligent, mentally ill and sometimes even as abusers. I'm at a loss for words. All I can say is, trans rights right f*cking NOW!"

Trigger warning: Trans Sexual Assault Survivors Paper	Hello friends! I am a psych major, with a minor in gender and women studies and doing a paper on Transgender sexual assault survivors, specifically in regards to how healthcare professionals treat transgender folk. Would anyone feel comfortable sharing an instance of sexual assault? If so, how did health care and law enforcement treat you if you chose to seek treatment? Thank you all for sharing such an intimate and personal topic.	"i was sexually assaulted about a year and a half ago, i was a minor and pre T. Had a hospital visit and i was actively misgendered and deadnamed the entire time. even heard staff talking about me using she/her a few paces away like i couldn‚Äôt hear them. i dont think i would ever contact law enforcement at all. I tried talking to my therapist about it but it was kinda shrugged off.

TW for talking about bodies and transitioning
NSFW (possibly and please let me know if this needs to be taken down/needs to be asked elsewhere) 

My partner started T two months ago. We‚Äôve done so much research and found as much as we can but there is little information on the smaller changes that happen during the transitioning process (this is also a smaller area with no LGBTQIA+ healthcare resources). Basically we couldn‚Äôt find any information to tell us if the changes happening to the downstairs area (specifically in ‚Äúintimate discharging‚Äù) were normal or not. If other people who have gone through the transitioning process with testosterone would be willing to share what kind of changes they experienced in their intimate lives (not pertaining to pleasure necessarily but the details of their bodies changes) either here or direct messages I would appreciate it so so much. Any information to help us make sure that the transitioning process is progressing in a healthy manner or if we need to go the distance to seek out other LGBTQIA+ healthcare resources for help is greatly appreciated."		m3v0nx	trans	8	0.91	2021-03-13 00:21:52
OP-ED: Transgender individuals should not be left out of universal healthcare			1rp6fp	trans	9	0.8	2013-11-29 08:07:44
hey, im trans and wanted to ask a few questions (sorry my parents know my reddit account so I had too create a sock puppet account)	"so, I'm trans but haven't told any of my friends or family yet,mtf,  So anyway here's my two questions.
*1) so ovary transplants, have they worked for trans women and if not can we get them in two years or more? also, can they menstrate?
*2) How can I come out to my homophobic parents that hate me for being bi? and how can I see/ask if hrt/gender reassignment surgery is a part of their healthcare benefits without drawing suspicion. thanks."	"1) Ovary transplants - I don't think that these are a thing yet for trans women, or at least, not commonly available or else you'd see droves of transwomen flocking to get this done.

&#x200B;

2) No idea, but you can check out r/TransDIY if you want to get it without telling them 
Nope transplanted organs rejected by the body is a huge medical and also a huge ethical issue that still need to be overcome. Theoraticly they could do it if you have a twin sister that diseased, but that is how far it goes and that already would be over the top.
1) sorry no and no

2) sorry I cant help  you. Be strong and keep the hope up for the future!
Others answered your first question already, so I'll tackle the second.

Get a reason, any reason, to get a look at, or a picture of, your parent's insurance card. Get the group number, the ID, the company, the primary holder's name, and any phone numbers you can find on the thing. If you copy down everything, that works too. Then, when you're not in the house, call them and ask about your coverage. It's highly unlikely, and in some places even illegal, that an alert would go out to your parents about an *inquiry*. Actually using the insurance is likely to send them some form of notice, though it may be passive. For example, my parents don't get an email or a phone call if I use their insurance. But if they went online, they could look over a list of all claims against the insurance plan.
First, no worries on the sock puppet account, it‚Äôs very normal to see that here. 

To your questions: 

1)maybe in a few years we will have overy transplants as a regular thing, but plan on 50 years before they are a reality for trans women. Maybe longer. 

2) safety first. A massive amount of teens are homeless because their parents force them out for being lgbt. You know your parents and you know their limits‚Äîwatch how they react to trans stuff in the media or culture and gage your chances first!

3) hrt comes after all that from your primary care doctor in combination with a therapist. They will get you the rest of the way :)

Good luck!!!
Step 1: get a job and save as much money as you can

Step 2: figure out which company and insurance plan your paremts use, and Google the list of coverage

Step 3: be careful about when you start hormones. Although doctors aren't supposed to share information about you with anyone, sometimes the law can let them share information with your parents if they think you're in danger. (Some doctors think unscientific things)

Step 4: let your parents know once you are old enough to be emancipated or just move out (this is why keeping the job and saving money was step one) you're a grown-up with an apartment (or dorm if you go the college route) and if you're parents want to disown you, sad as a thing like that is, at least you'll be able to say that you own yourself."	axkr63	trans	8	0.8	2019-03-05 12:44:24
German Transgender Articles, situation with trans issues in Austria, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands.	"Hello!   


My name is Ada. I am a MtF transgender and, apart from that, do participate in Russian LGBTQIAP+ community, mainly for the letter T. I translate foreign articles, write some of them and, overall, try to help Russian transgender community as much as possible.  


One of the most important themes for Russian transgender community is immigration, because Russia becomes less and less friendly for trans people. I don't want to go into details, I bet, you can just plainly google that to get a great grasp of transphobia there :(  


This is why I am trying to educate Russian transgender people on a topic of where they can go in case of total disaster: murderous relatives, Chechnya, police and etc. However, I don't like to look at the world through the rose-colored glasses and also know that you don't live in heaven there either. TERF Island, Donald Trump, Orban Hungary and Duda Poland indeed do devastate me and other transgenders in Russia. That is the reason I try to tell people in Russia about the situation in other countries before they choose a place to escape.  


As german-speaking countries are notorious for being trans-friendly in Russian transgender community, I would like to hear, if it is true, from trans\*persons, residing in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. In particular, if transgender healthcare is available and if it is, how accessible it is, how people usually perceive transgender people there, if there are transphobic extremists or not, how large is the part of feminism, which TERFs form, in those countries and et cetera. I would be especially happy, if you'll provide me with some articles on that case (english, deutsch, nederland can suit \^\^), so I can  translate them.  


Have a nice day,

Transgender healthcare by state	"I live in California and am low income so I have free transgender healthcare. It includes things like hair removal, facial feminization, and bottom surgery. It‚Äôs wonderful even if it is slow and convoluted to actually get care. But my partner and I have been thinking of moving because of the rent/housing prices here just being far too much. I‚Äôm worried about being able to transition at all though if we move out of state. I have everything covered right now and if I didn‚Äôt I won‚Äôt be able to do any of it pretty much, and a few states I‚Äôve looked into don‚Äôt even have health coverage for anyone under 65 at all. 


So what is it like where you are? Government healthcare programs, subsidized plans, and other info about what it‚Äôs like to be trans in your state. Feel free to discuss employee healthcare but we don‚Äôt have traditional jobs so it won‚Äôt help us much personally, but maybe it‚Äôll help someone else. Thanks!"	"I‚Äôve been dealing with the same dilemma. I moved here to L.A. because I could get transgender healthcare, but almost wound up on the streets. I‚Äôm worried that if I move I‚Äôll lose it. AZ covered my HRT when I first started my transition. But, I don‚Äôt think they cover anything beyond that.
Tennessee has routinely put roadblocks in the path of trans healthcare, including one stupid bill that denied puberty blockers for (get this) prepubescent minors. Which, y'know, does nothing. We're also the only state in the US that does not allow you to edit your legal name.

In other words, dont move to Tennessee. It is a very trans-unfriendly state.

Trans woman with Factor V Leiden on HRT	"Hey folks, sharing this in case anyone finds themselves in a similar situation as they try to navigate healthcare providers and varying levels of competency from doctors.

When I went to start HRT, my endocrinologist recommended that I see a hematologist first, due to blood conditions in my family that might be aversely affected by being on HRT. When I went to a hematologist and got a full work up done, I found out I was homozygous for Factor V Leiden, meaning I have a genetic predisposition to developing blood clots.

The hematologist, however, did not have experience working with trans people, so she told me i should not start HRT, due to the assumed risks.

I was devastated, but several months later, I sought out the opinion of a hematologist who had experience working with trans patients. After speaking with her, and having her collaborate with my endocrinologist, we were able to figure out a regimen that worked for me. I use a transdermal estradiol patch i swap out twice a week; as a t-blocker, i get a lupron injection once every three months; and to mitigate blood clot risk, i take a 10mg dose of xarelto. Every 3-6 months i check in and get blood work done with my endo and hematologist.

I‚Äôve now been on HRT for a year and a half with no issues, and all of my hoped for changes have been happening.

I hope this helps folks, whether you have the same medical condition or you are trying to navigate medical providers as you seek to start HRT. More than anything, i share it in hopes of underscoring how much of a difference it can make to have competent (and on the other side,uninformed) medical providers when seeking trans healthcare."	"It‚Äôs not much, but you might find this useful

https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_factor_v_leiden
I have factor v too and I was basically told i could only do the patch for estradiol too and avoid oral meds for that part. Sounds like we have had similar experiences. Only difference is I have been doing this for almost 8 years and haven't had a single blood clot issue thanks to good medication balancing, working out, diet, regular check ups and testing, etc.  Takes finding good doctors to help you manage it all safely and carefully, but it can be done. ‚ô•
Thank you!! Didn‚Äôt realize this resource existed‚Äîthe posts about Factor V were really reassuring üíô
This makes me so, so happy to hear
If you have surgery in the future it would be helpful to others if you could make a post about it.
too many ppl are afraid of the cost, especially when it comes to other medical issues you might have; but if you work with the medical group and hospitals and such, you can often get help. There are plenty of nonprofits that help too. So even those of us with medical issues that make it tough to, can find options that work. The doom and gloom narrative is not reality thankfully. always nice to share that there is hope and lots of good options out there, just sadly takes some work on our own part to make it so. ‚ô•

Research	"I have a MUN (Model United Nations) Conference at the end of this month and I want to write a resolution on the question of transgender healthcare. 
But since I‚Äôm a cis male I don‚Äôt really have that much experience with dealing with the situations you guys go through when it comes to healthcare.
Would you guys and girls be able to give me some insight into what problems you face when it comes to healthcare. But also what is positive healthcare that you have experienced and or would like to experience.
This doesn‚Äôt just have to be related to trans healthcare. It could also be to do with discrimination in healthcare environments or anything else that relates to both topics.
Thank You to everyone who shares their thoughts. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è"	"I don‚Äôt know too much as I live in Canada where our healthcare system is doing alright in terms of trans-related things. But, I think in the US most of the issue is parental consent for people underage being a barrier to proper treatment, as well as the cost (which can be in the three digits per month, not including surgery and all.)
thanks for looking for community input.

A huge issue in trans healthcare is accessibility.  Issues with accessibility come in many forms in different jurisdictions and even different trans people in the same jurisdiction.  In some places minors are banned from transitioning, in others they require parental consent, and others allow minors to access care without parental permission.  In some places we are outlawed altogether.  In some our healthcare is outlawed all together. In others wait times are so long that people die before they can be seen.  In others healthcare may be too expensive for many to obtain or insurance creates numerous obstacles to repeatedly deny us healthcare.

Less so than the past, but most transgender healthcare is still incredibly degrading to the patient. 

What committee are you in? What country are you representing?  What is the general issue you are being asked to address in committee?  i can probably give you some tips.

Model UN is role-play, while it‚Äôs wonderful that you want to learn from us about trans issues, that‚Äôs not necessarily the role you are being scored on.  Traditionally you are scored on how accurately you model your nation on the given issue.  So you need to research your government‚Äôs policies and positions and think about how your country/country‚Äôs administration would approach the given issue in the UN.  The devil doesn‚Äôt need an advocate, but there‚Äôs a good probability you‚Äôll be scored on how well you can play devil‚Äôs advocate against trans rights.
Outright worldwide ban on conversion therapy and any countries who don‚Äôt enforce this, can be expelled from the UN.
Even if you have insurance that covers transgender care (which is exceedingly rare) a lot of the doctors who you would actually want to do your major procedures will not take insurance at all. Unless you have enough money to buy and sell god, you'll be settling for sub par in some aspect. 

My perspective as a US based trans woman.
So you would say in some states that money is a problem. Thanks for the input. üòä
I‚Äôm the UK and there is no need. it is student level MUN (13-18) and I only made this post to learn more about my topic from people with experience. Thanks for the offer anyway :)
No UK government has been favorable on trans rights.  And UK trans healthcare is in shambles (people are dying on waitlists waiting for care).  The accessible way to get care in the UK is to buy hormones on the grey market and DIY without a doctor or have the money for private healthcare.

Progressive countries will be criticizing the UK and you‚Äôre government would want you to deflect.  You can sign resolutions that emptily says something should be done like educating doctors, but you won‚Äôt make actual commitments to improvement.

If you want to learn from people with experience, I HIGHLY recommend you watch this video from Philosophy Tube.  She‚Äôs a prominent trans woman in the UK who‚Äôs quite knowledgable on the current trans healthcare crisis in the UK.  She also links sources if you need them for a research/position paper.

Hello!	Hi! I'm a cis 16 yr old student and for my ap lang project i'm doing a podcast with my friend on trans healthcare rights, and part of said podcast includes personal experiences, if you have any sources please let me know, or if you'd like to share a personal experience of not being able to receive proper care simply because you're transgender. I really want to portray exactly what trans people go through in the aspect of receiving care, even unrelated to their transition, and I'd like to gather as much info possible to assure that this really depicts what it's like to be trans in a country where healthcare is already not so accessible.	From my personal experience I‚Äôve had to travel farther to get to a place where I can receive healthcare from people that know how to treat me with the same care and respect as a cis person. I‚Äôve lived in 3 different states since I started hrt. I‚Äôve had a primary care physician that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel comfortable‚Äù prescribing and monitoring my hrt so I had to go to a different doctor for that. According to the  LGBT center in California sometimes they have to get creative with insurance companies to get certain things covered for example a trans woman that may need a prostate exam. In order for the center to get it covered they have to fudge the record and put that it was gynecology exam. I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to be able to travel as far as necessary to receive care. Any health clinic that deals with trans or non gender conforming people may also be able to give you some insight on the what they go through in order to get proper care for their patients. There‚Äôs a bunch more stuff I could tell you but I don‚Äôt wanna put my entire life story up for public viewing.

I am trans, but I don't want to do trans. tw: detrans stuff, substances and suicide.	"So to start this off I'm a minor, and I've socially transitioned for about a year now. But the road to just be able to do that has been really tough. TL;DR at the bottom.  


To just be able to socially transition it took a lot. I live in Denmark, which has good welfare options for minors and even trans teens but imo abysmal trans healthcare, especially if you're not like 20. This'll be important later. I grew up in a pretty religious and bigoted family, and when i came out to them it didn't go very well.  


I got admitted into a psychiatric emergency room back in November, months after I originally came out to them. I didn't really need to go to the hospital, but I was sick and tired of nothing happening for months, so I decided I had to do something radical to get my parents attention that I wasn't mentally ok, and to get consent from them to be able to go to the trans clinic here in Denmark (one of the worst places on earth but I didn't know that at the time). Both of these things wen't well. And I actually got an added bonus! I got offered a spot in a youth institution (an institution for young people that can't live at home basically. It's sort of laid back and not just for mentally ill individuals).   


From December I moved into the institution and that was when i socially transitioned. I could finally be called my actual name and pronouns (Erica and she/her), and I could wear whatever i wanted!   
But other than those things, living there for me was really uncomfortable from the start. I have really bad anxiety and diagnosed with the symptoms of Avoidant Personality Disorder (a disorder that makes you really vulnerable in social situations, and then makes you avoid them). I thought I just had to settle in, but how uncomfy i was didn't change.  


And it all got worse when someone told me that one of our roommates was a seething transphobe and was saying shit behind my back. Basically it all went downhill from there with the institution.   
To make it even worse, this place was actually shady as shit and with time this place got super uncomfortable.  


This all just piled up and made me super depressed and isolated. I never left my room. I didn't go to school. I never ate. I started doing drugs. It wasn't good.  
Not to mention how I was living a double life. Any time I'd go outside I would have to be eagle-eyed and look out to see if anyone that knew me as a dude saw me girlmoding or vice versa.  


Everything currently is shit. My mental health issues are piling up and transitioning has been abysmal. I've only been able to socially transition, but even getting on hormone blockers hasn't been a reality. The clinic even told me that they aren't giving out any treatment to minors! So I have to wait years with my body just destroying itself.  


This leads me to the end. Sorry for the long rant.  


Should I just detransition and wait till I either end myself or somehow get hormones and can live on my own. Or just tough it out through a valley of shit?  


TL;DR: I'm a minor and have only been able to socially transition in a toxic institution that has made my mental health really bad. Should I just detransition and wait till I'm 18 to actually live my life, or just tough it out?"	"Do whatever you need to in order to survive until you can be who you want.  You can detransition if that makes things easier for you.  Don't do drugs they don't help anything ever.  Go back to school if you still can And ignore everyone.  People are transphobic, racist, sexist and religious shits.  Doesn't mean you stop being because they exist.  That is how they win by scaring us into compliance.  When I hear someone is transphobic I simply point out to others they know who the nasty sad horrible bully is now.  Because it doesn't matter what they think it just makes them the sorry sack of shit they are.

Hello everyone, I work in Healthcare (UK) and wanting to learn how to help the trans community better. I'm a straight AFAB woman and don't have any friends or colleagues who are trans people, so please be patient with me learning! üôÇ		"Do you have any specific questions?  
you can also check out r/transgenderUK. 

In general, not misgendering patients and treating them like normal people goes a long way.
Are you able to get any funding for training? If you are I would recommend the Pride in Practice course run by the LGBT Foundation. It was originally set up for NHS staff but is now open to more - I did the course as a trans woman working in a women's centre. It covers all aspects of LGBTQIA+ and how they can be supported in healthcare. Lots more info here - https://lgbt.foundation/how-we-can-help-you/pride-in-practice
We're not really different from anyone else. Treat us respectfully. There's no secret trick.
Personally, ask. As much as it sucks you do have to ask them what their goals are. Do they plan to medically transition? Do they plan on getting surgeries such as a mastectomy? Do they plan on going on HRT? 

For me, I personally plan on getting a mastectomy but I don‚Äôt know if I want to get on HRT or transition in any other way. But that‚Äôs just me. 

Beyond asking, listen. Be aware of each patients plans for themselves and their transition. Listen to what they say and their fears, hopes, plans, etc. 

Keep up to date with the requirements for your individual state for people to transition. Some may have requirements such as age, others require letters from doctors and psychiatrists. It can be a lot and you should be prepared to explain it to a patient. In this vein, be aware of any and all procedures that they may be able to do (such as hair removal, surgeries, HRT, etc). Keep up to date with medical literature and news about trans and non-binary people. 

Beyond that, read. Read memoirs, books, stories and etc in your free time if it interests you. I don‚Äôt have any specific recommendations, but they help a lot.
Thank you all for the positive responses üôÇ
That's just basic person centred care. It would help if people shared what they would like to improve?
I guess I'm just trying to learn from poor experiences and how I can improve them. Thank you for your help.
Like, in general or in the healthcare setting?
I'm currently doing my degree in Nursing, but can definitely look into that, thank you :)
That's the kind of thing I need educating on as laws and guidance seem to change frequently. Plus I can appreciate it's a very personal choice and journey for anyone needing Healthcare.
I guess in general, but more so in Healthcare as think more could be done.
That‚Äôs why I recommend looking into the requirements for your state. It can get confusing on a large scale and for your purposes it likely isn‚Äôt needed. The laws change all the time, so you just need to focus on the specific subset that will apply to you and your patients. Your job doesn‚Äôt require you know every law and everything; a functioning knowledge of the requirements to transition and what constitutes those transitions (such as risks, benefits, etc) will be more than satisfactory. 

I recommend ‚ÄúTomorrow Will Be Better‚Äù by Sarah McBride. It‚Äôs a great book and something I highly recommend. It will provide a great overview of everything.
In healthcare: treat trans people with dignity and respect. With exception to immutable physiological processes that have some clinical impact, treat us as who we say we are. Lower the barriers for gender affirming care, and if that is impossible, remove the bottlenecks that make obtaining the official dx take so long.

In general: embrace the philosophy of Bill & Ted and just ""be excellent to one another."" Don't vote for people that want to curtail our ability to exist in public. Push back on casual transphobia. You don't have to go into a rant, but a simple ""eew, not cool"" can shut things down."	11t75jk	trans	8	0.72	2023-03-16 21:40:12

I for one definitely want to go on Hormones in the future. If that is banned in my country, I‚Äôll probably die. I‚Äôm pretty sure that banning us from healthcare would also include gender-affirming surgeries.
So if pre-op trans people can‚Äôt get those surgeries or the hormones we need, what will become of us?

For now, I‚Äôm just going to hope that my country is smart enough to not even think of passing bills like the ones in Arkansas."	The trans community has needed to cut the faux rad shit for a while. Homebrew some hrt, talk to other trans people, make an actual community to lean on for things like hrt bans. We need a hefty dose of self reliance, the status quo will never act in good faith to protect you.	mdij2f	trans	8	1.0	2021-03-26 06:40:33

Older trans people, how do you approach more gendered healthcare? I‚Äôm FTM and trying to prepare myself for that reality	As I get older (I‚Äôm FTM, mid 20s) I realize that it‚Äôs gonna be more difficult for me to get trans affirming healthcare (especially if I get off HRT).

Not sure if I'm actually a man. Sorry if this doesn't belong here.	Up until the past month or so I've never questioned my gender. I don't feel uncomfortable being a male, I just just feel really nice thinking of myself as a girl. I also get an erection when I think of myself as a girl which is weird. A couple weeks ago I felt some really weird gender things which passed quickly which I didn't think of that much. However now (at 2:52am when I'm typing this and earlier tonight) I felt like like I'd be really happy as a girl. I'm also confused since in my dreams I'm always male. Any input is appreciated however I mainly just needed to get my thoughts down. No offense but I hope I'm not trans since my family is socially conservative, most people where I live aren't friendly to LGBT people, and healthcare in the USA costs an arm and a leg. This might sound kinda stereotypical but im also on lgbt tik t ok and autistic so its it a possibility I could just be mirroring what they're saying?Thanks for reading all this, this is all new ground for me. I won't be able to respond to everything immediately since I need to go to sleep. If something I said doesn't make sense its cause autocorrect is annoying and its almost 3am.	"Hiya! Based on what youve said it definitely sounds like you could be trans. It may be worth investigating further.

Dysphoria doesn't necessarily mean you're miserable or you hate your body or you can't stand the idea of living as a guy. For a lot of people it's a whole lot more subtle than that. ""I wouldn't mind staying a guy, but I'd rather be a girl"" is dysphoria. ""I wish I had dysphoria because then I could transition"" is dysphoria. [Cis guys would not rather be girls](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/). They actively *like* being guys. They aren't just settling for it because they're stuck with it. The point isn't that we're all miserable tortured souls who hate our bodies and want to die every time we're misgendered. If something different sounds like an improvement to you, that is a manifestation of dysphoria.

Remember that ""transition is scary and seems daunting"" is not why cis people don't want to transition.

Trans with doubts doesn't equal cis.

Trans and terrified doesn't equal cis.

Trans and in massive denial doesn't equal cis.

Trans with abysmal self-esteem doesn't equal cis.

Trans with depression doesn't equal cis.

Trans with impostor syndrome (google it) doesn't equal cis.

Read [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) and [That Was Dysphoria?](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) I think they'll both speak to you a lot.

Forget doubting whether you should transition. Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared ""what if"" question and change ""transition"" to ""not transition"". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.

Don't angst about being 100% sure. You do NOT have to be 100% sure to act on your feelings, and there's loads of non-permanent things you can do. I'm guessing that you think if you come out as Trans you have to do ALL THE TRANSITION THINGS and there is NO GOING BACK and you have to be VERY VERY 110% SURE or else BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN and you will be MISERABLE FOREVER. None of this is true. Transition is a process, not an event. Just do whatever you need to do to feel as comfortable as possible in your own skin and in the world as you move through it. That's the entire point; the rest is noise. Transition is not a roller coaster you strap yourself onto. *You* are in charge. Try stuff out, keep what works, chuck what doesn't. That's really all there is to it. That doesn't mean you have to have surgery or live as a girl or anything else. If you want to be seen as a girl, put yourself into social situations as a girl, whether online or offline. If you want to try wearing jeans from the women's department, go get a pair of jeans. If you want this or that surgery, go for it. If you want to take hormones, take hormones. If you want to stop taking hormones later, stop taking them. If you want to go back *on* hormones later still, do that. Etc.

Spend a lot of time with http://t-vox.org/resources/trans-book-list . It'll help.

I despise the trans healthcare system in my country	"Ive been on a waiting list for a fair while now. They pretty much promised me I‚Äôd have my intake before my birthday (in 2 weeks) but I just called them since I didn‚Äôt hear anything. It‚Äôs postponed by multiple months. 
The system is so ass. Even if it‚Äôs my turn it‚Äôs only an intake. Than I need to wait approximately half a year for actual conversations/help and proof I‚Äôm ‚Äútrans enough‚Äù for a diagnosis and than I still gotta wait half a year for hormones.
Not only that but I need to go to the other side of the country to get surgeries because there‚Äôs only 2 places in my country where you can get them and only 1 of them does ftm surgeries.

i‚Äôve come out to my parents and they are quite supportive and have even said that they wouldn‚Äôt mind taking me to (not homophobialand) like once a month to go to a gender clinic and hopefully be able to get HRT and do check ups and stuff

but can i even get prescribed HRT if I don‚Äôt actually live there. idk if doctors are capable of prescribing me medication if i dont actually live there."	"You might have to ask a Dr there. As this is very difficult to answer without knowing a whole lot.
I don't want to be intrusive and ask what country but it really depends. If that country offers ""hospital stuff"" to your family when they don't live there I think it's safe to say they would give you hrt."	rayih2	trans	9	0.92	2021-12-07 12:50:21
Need advice, about family and future! Thank you whoever reads whole thing [long post].	"Hi everybody,

**Bit of background**

I am coming 25 (AMAB MTF) , I am Polish, currently living in Northern Ireland (since 2008), United Kingdom and knew 'something was off' since age 7 pretty much. You know I would get interested & inspect girls, their clothing etc.Eventually would start experiment with girl's clothing and secretly dig in mum's closet. I guess she never find out, because I was really stealthy about it.It wasn't until later in early teens I really started feeling sad and dysphoric. You know instead experimenting, it was proper jealousy and envy to AFAB people and strong desire to be female in all aspects.  
Unfortunately, teen years were worst time of my life and combined with gender dysphoria, bullying, home situation and other things, I've been really unhappy about life.I never was able to build good friendships/relationships outside the house.I've have no real friends since leaving my home country at age 11 until now 25. My family situation is really bad too.  
I've developed several disorders such as Borderline Personality Disorder, Social Anxiety, Depression and others. This made me a shell of a person and being alone is completely normal for me now and forming relationships and keeping them is near impossible.

**Bit about family**

My mother and father are divorced. I never saw my father once in my life.I only heard bad things about my father and really don't know him at all, he never really made attempts to contact me. Therefore, for me he doesn't exists.  
Mother and I have really bad relationship, we had OK relationship during childhood, but during teen years things went sour. Mostly because of the disorders I've developed and pretty sure she has many mental ilnesses too and she is very narcistic - she denies that too when I tell her.I currently live with her in a council house (she doesn't support me financially), but really really need to move out because I hate living with her. I came out to her about a year ago and it went as I expected - bad. She is a religious person or at least claims to be and directly said to me 'I love you, but I will not support you with this', which to me just seems like empty words from her. She wants to help me, but her idea of help is finding 'cure' for trangenderism and rejecting who you are and stop being trans. She is really damaging me mentally and I feel uncomfortable/unsafe expressing myself at house with her around.  
I also have one brother, but we're not very close and he lives in another country. We got separated once he was taken to drug rehab, when I was about 9 years old. He is a better person now and has his own family and kids back home.  Unfortunately, I don't think I can build relationship with him again since his family is also religious and trans/homophobia in Poland is really big.Same goes for my grandma, I know she cares for me, but it would break her heart if I told her I am bisexual or trans.

**Situation**  
I am still stuck living at home with my mother, even though I have enough money saved, I have lost my previous job due to my mental disorders. I live in Northern Ireland, which has almost non-existent help for trans people, as we have only one public  facility in whole country that deals with this. They don't accept any new people on the list...... shit :(  
I think my only option is to go to England, where there is much more help for trans people through free healthcare and privately. I've tried moving out there by paying rent in advance \[even year's worth rent\], but landlords refuse to take anyone in without a job. Then again jobs refuse to take you on if you don't live locally.  
I am really struggling to deal with this all alone, I am stuck in this hostile environment and my dysphoria is reaching its peak, as I had enough courage to go shopping alone in women's only clothes and didn't even care people gave me looks for it. I never done that before, I thought I could hold my dysphoria until I move out, but I am getting desperate now. My mum will not appreciate me doing stuff at home.

If anyone has any sensible advice, especially if you're from the UK I would be really grateful."	"Czesc!

I dont have any tips but I am going through something similar here so perhaps the thought of being in the same boat helps.

Baltic country born person in the UK here, with conservative parents who will probably disown me when I eventually tell them how I feel. I realized I'm either genderfluid or trans ( still not sure lol ) at the age of 25 but did nothing about it. Thought its just a fetish and in some regards it does feel like it. A few years later still a full on dude and dysphoria is eating me from the inside, especially on outings. Im married and have a child now which doesn't help the situation either. I told my partner how I feel and as supportive as they were,  it's a divorce If I went onto HRT - they're not interested in living with a female whatsoever.


Right now I'm sticking with expressing myself as female occasionally in the comfort of my home, trying to lose weight fast and potentially going out in femme clothing and make up with a few people I trust. Autumn is great for that because trench coats can hide a lot of masculine features. I do need to learn the intimidating art of make up for that + 
 I know I'll never pass as a female without HRT since I have fairly wide shoulders, buff calves, etc.

I really wanted to have a chat with a gender dysphoria specialist but the waiting times here in the south are 4years+ and I can't afford the several thousand missing in the family budget to get told a lot of things I already know.

I am lucky enough to have some very supportive friends (a few of them back at home surprisingly) and siblings to chat to when feeling really down.

If anybody here leaves some more useful tips I'd be happy to hear those too!"	pbwsiy	trans	7	1.0	2021-08-26 10:32:14
Trans healthcare in Italy	I recently moved to Italy as an American on a study visa.

Finally Becoming Who I Am (TW: S)	One year ago, I was stuck living in some shitty small town in rural Florida, where every other house had confederate flags, and I was stuck living with my father, who was literally a member of the Aryan brotherhood. Six months ago, I tried to kill myself because I thought things would never get better. Then I went to rehab, where I was given hope my future, where I began to believe that a good life for me wasn't just a fantasy, that it was actually possible. When I got out of rehab, I went to live in a halfway house in southern florida, where I thought I could get my new start. It turns out, that just wasn't in the cards for me. Covid got worse and worse, and I wasn't able to find a job. Eventually, I couldn't afford to live there anymore. Then, my parents disowned me for being trans. So, I made a choice. I decided to leave everything behind and go somewhere I'd always wanted to live. I drove my car for three days straight, from Florida all the way up to Seattle. Then, with no money left, I slept in a homeless shelter for several weeks. Then, I was accepted into a transitional housing programme for the LGBT+ community. They helped me to get healthcare, to get food stamps, to get everything I needed. And today, after wanting it for more than two years, I've finally started HRT. I never thought I would make it this far. A year ago, I genuinely believed I would die in Florida, never having escaped my family. But here I am, wearing feminine clothes, starting HRT, and finally feeling as though it is safe for me to go places by myself. I may still be poor, I may still be homeless, but I am infinitely happier than I was back in Florida, and coming here was the best decision of my life. I'm glad that I wasn't successful on that day six months ago, because if I had been, I would never have made it this far, and I would have never realized that things *can* change for the better. So to anyone here who's in a similar situation to me, who thinks that things can't possibly get better, and things will never change, I've been there, and trust me, they can. Good luck to all my trans brothers and sisters out there. My DM's are open if anyone wants to talk. It might take me a while, but I will answer.

Because she has a mainstream audience that would be more bigoted than the more educated intersectional feminists who don't have much to gain by spending time watching her videos.

Which countries have free transgender healthcare?	I really need to know because i have unsupportive parents and i wont be able to afford it	"the yukon in here in canada seems to cover a lot from what i‚Äôve seen on the news recently
canada‚Äôs not completely free, but we‚Äôre pretty cheap
A lot of European countries, though experience, gatekeeping and wait times vary heavily. I've heard Germany and France can be pretty good in terms of process if you live there and find the right doctors
It's going pretty well for me in Canada, BC! There's a free government program to assist with all covered medications (estrace, spiro, other HRT meds if you get permission, but it'll help with more than just HRT, if you need it) based off of your income. The government will also cover the bigger, more common surgeries like SRS, top surgery, and BA (with limitations). There's another comment suggesting the Yukon, which I've heard covers ffs too, but BC and Ontario are the bigger centres for Canadians. For example, bottom surgery is covered, but we only have two clinics for it in the country: one in Vancouver, and one in Montreal (Quebec). If you're considering coming here and want to know more, PM me!
The U.K. but it‚Äôs very slow. Waiting lists 3+ years long for your 1st appointment in some areas.

Why I unsubscribed from TYT	"If you are not aware, Ana Kasparian, one of the main anchors of The Young Turks online news network, has recently been making statements very similar to a pre openly terf JK Rowling. When hosts of other online left wing shows pointed out the problems with her statements, her response was to double down - this time with the support of owner of the company, Cenk Uyghur. The failure to even consider the viewpoints of people who are on the same side - and in many cases had actually cohosted the main TYT show before - made me realize that I really didn‚Äôt want to give TYT my money anymore so I cancelled my membership last night and sent them this email as to why. (And yes I know this shows an inflated sense of self importance but isn‚Äôt that what Reddit is for?)

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Earlier today, after 4.5 reasonably happy years as a subscriber of TYT, I cancelled both my website membership and my YouTube membership. Since my reason for doing so was the actions of two members of the leadership of the network (and two people that I actually greatly respect and used to admire quite a bit) I am writing you an email to explain why.  


Simply put, I canceled my membership because I refuse to ignore comments that I know are dangerous to my existence as a transgender man just to remain a fan of a television network. My friend (who is also trans) is a devoted fan of Harry Potter to the point that he writes HP fan fiction and I have spent years watching him contort himself into knots to justify why he continues to do this when he knows that the creator of the work doesn‚Äôt believe in his basic humanity. After a couple rounds of tweeting ‚Äúwhat I think Ana means is this‚Ä¶‚Äù and then explaining why what she said is wrong in the hope that she will read and learn from it, I have realized that it is futile to do so when Cenk and Ana‚Äôs response to their peers doing the same was to attack them on Twitter and on the main TYT show. 


I am not sure exactly what led to Ana starting to believe transphobic talking points when as recently as a few months ago, she was criticizing people on the ‚Äúright‚Äù for doing the same thing but I hope for the safety of trans people that it stops soon. As a transgender man who until a few years ago was a person with a uterus but not a woman, I intimately understand the importance of inclusive language especially in healthcare.  People die when healthcare workers don‚Äôt take into account the fact that someone who does not appear to be a  woman could be pregnant or suffering from undiagnosed reproductive system cancer and consequentially fail to check their patients‚Äô reproductive systems. Before I had my ovaries, uterus, and cervix removed, I had to get a Pap smear while still having a deep voice and a full beard from my HRT. No amount of imagination would have described me as a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù but I was for sure a ‚Äúperson with a cervix‚Äù that needed that examination. 


I am concerned that Ana and Cenk will intentionally (or unintentionally) influence their followers to also believe that recognizing the healthcare needs of trans people somehow harms cis people thus leading to even more erosion of trans rights and the time has come for me to stop acting against my interests.  


This is not a decision that I take lightly as discovering TYT in 2018 basically saved my sanity by showing me that other people held similar political views to me. It showed me that the world was crazy, not me. But it also taught me that when an institution is doing something wrong, I should vote with my feet and leave it. And that is why I have cancelled my subscription. 


I sincerely hope you listen to your well meaning colleagues and realize that inclusive language isn‚Äôt meant to harm cis people. But until then, I will be watching from the sidelines.

So I found out I'm trans at 36 - looking for a best place to transition!	"So I'm 36 and found out I'm trans. The egg cracked 3 weeks ago after a year long search phase. I live in a country where I would have to wait for 3-5 years to transition.   


But I'm also financially independent and willing to sell my house and move to get better healthcare. The thing is: where?   


If you were in my shoes - you had a pretty unlimited budget to travel & transition, where would you go? I'm looking for comprehensive quality care urgently. Any tips are greatly appreciated! <3"	"Your options are either moving to a country with an informed consent model of treatment (certain US states take this approach AFAIK), or moving to a country where estrogen is available OTC (my knowledge isn‚Äôt great here, but I know it‚Äôs the case in India, at least). Alternatively, it would be worth looking into private healthcare. If you have an unlimited budget, as you say, then being prescribed hormones by a private doctor can cost as little as ~¬£40 a month. I‚Äôd be happy to talk over DM if you need further support! 

Edit: it‚Äôs worth adding that ‚Äòcomprehensive care‚Äô is quite rare - trans healthcare globally is still in a pretty woeful place. A lot of us end up becoming our own doctors after a while. That isn‚Äôt to say that you won‚Äôt find a great doctor who can help you, just that it hasn‚Äôt been mine or many of the people I know‚Äôs experiences."	wwlfti	trans	7	0.77	2022-08-24 14:46:50
Not so sure where to start	"I'm 26 and I wish to transition from female to male. I've been stuck in this really comfortable state of my body, since early high school. It's caused me a great deal of stress and it's almost feels like a tipping point as of late. I don't know what to do.

I was talking to a therapist last year and I was hoping they'd help me more with dysphoria and other parts of my life, but honestly it didn't go that good. Constant rescheduling, no shows, being late and at times I found it hard to talk to them-

I'm at the point where I want to make a change, but I'm not so sure where to start? I don't have a lot of money or healthcare atm. But when I can I'm not so sure if I should see a doctor, psychologist or therapist? 

I was even thinking about trying to talk about it with my Dad as he's very open-minded, but I'm still scared. I really struggle being open with my emotions with family.

Right now I'm just doing my best to present myself in the way I want to be seen. My chest is pretty big though, so that tends to give me issues (DDD). But I'm trying to workout to lose weight, hopefully lessen my chest size and just trying to have a healthier lifestyle

Thank you so much for reading this! Any kind of advice would be appreciated, I feel really lost and confused--"	"Depends on where you want to start and where you are. Do you want to start transitioning socially first (coming out to people, trying different clothes, maybe names or pronouns) or starting medial transition (like hrt or surgery)? Unfortunately, good therapists are hard to find (especially for trans related stuff).

 If you're in the US, you can see if planned parenthood does hrt in your state and if they're close or do telehealth. Informed consent clinics like those are the most cost effective, easiest way to get hrt. Before I head insurance, I was paying about $180 a visit (that's every 3 months for the first year and then either once a year or every 6 months depending on your preference and labs are included in that). I also recommend goodrx to help with medication costs, I was paying$17 for a month's worth of t through them. I'm also a DDD and I wear this binder to control them a bit: https://www.underworks.com/tri-top-chest-binder

Note: you can't just buy a binder and wear it all day when you first get it, ease into it so you can let your body adjust, don't sleep or exercise in it, and don't wear it for more than 8 hours
A binder for that size might be tricky though the underworks link from PurpleDragon looks like quality. In fact a lot of great advice in their post.

What you are doing now is a good start and getting the weight down will help reduce many of those highlighted areas but it is a tough journey, hope you get there. 
From some of the DIYHRT talks, FTM medications are harder to source so a good Endocrinologist  is recommended to get you started though in most places you need a referral. In Australia there are other options but I'm not sure about other nations.
I think right now I want to look more into medical surgery. I would really like top surgery or at the minimum have it reduced. I've also been curious of hrt as well and been doing more research on it.
I'm trying what I can socially mostly with the way I present myself, but I struggle coming out to others.

I'll definitely take a look into all of that tonight though! I had no idea about most of that information and I'll take a look into it

I will admit before in the past I have thought about a binder, but was concerned due to my chest size- But I'll buy one soon and I'll keep what you said in mind too!

Thank you for responding too, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the response!

Are more people trans now than before?	"Edit: **I think my real question is: Is the idea that there are more trans people now than before a transphobic trope?** It's something that transphobic people say a lot. BUT trans folk and allies only push back against it very gently. (There are currently five comments below. Four of which explain why the answer is ""no,"" but only one person has straight up said, ""no."") I'm thinking that it's straight up false. It's giving me transphobic lie.

Original post: I just assumed that more people would be but I was doing research on transphobia and read Irreversible Damage (Contrapoints' description of it as a ""transphobic screed"" was, in my humble opinion, very polite), a book built on the premise that many more people are identifying as trans because of iPhones, social media and easier of access to healthcare.

I decided to check the receipts, because a lot of the stuff the author says in that book is just nonsense. In all the scientific literature she cites, none of it actually supports that claim. Most supports the claim that more people are seeking to medically transition, which isn't quite the same thing. In fact, the book cites one piece from the MMWR in 2017 that found the same percentage of trans teens as these two other studies from 2015 and 2009. That IS a scientific claim that the percentage of trans teens has NOT increased and not increased during a time when both trans visibility across media and smart phone use among teens have exploded. This really challenges the central claims of her book.

Then it got me looking at Bill Maher's video ""Along for the Pride"" where he apocalyptically suggests that everyone is going to be trans in 35 years. Again, checking receipts, the article that he cites very explicitly says that the increase in people identifying as LGBTQ is driven by more people identifying as bisexual.

It got me thinking: Are there reasons beyond those articles to believe one way or the other about rate of people who are trans?

If there really is no change then the rhetoric about such an increase is a transphobic lie.

A transphobic lie that I legit believed until a week ago."	"More people are *openly* trans now.  Just like more people started being openly left-handed when they stopped beating kids in schools for being lefties.  People stop hiding things about themselves when being open about those things becomes less of a danger to their physical safety.  In other shocking news, the earth maintains a stable and predictable orbit around the sun.
More people are allowed to be open about it now than in the past. Twenty years ago, you just didn't talk about it, tried to live a ""normal"" life, and usually buried it and all the other self loathing under illicit (usually illegal) sexual encounters and/or substance abuse.

I was a child in 1998 but I knew that if I tried to explain my gender, there would be terrible (probably fatal) consequences and I bottled that up so well I didn't even realize I wasn't straight until my mid 20s
No, more people are just aware that this exists and is an option.
Know what the internet, smartphones, and social media have done to trans people? Let them know it exists. I am almost 40, and I didn't know trans people even existed until my 20s, and that non-binary existed until 3 years ago. In certain parts of the country (world!), it's not even acknowledged that there is anything except (cis) men and (cis) women. Younger people are learning there are words for the way they experience life at younger ages, and they're in a place where they can talk about it. They're being exposed to other people who feel the same way about their bodies as they do, and realizing that they're not crazy for feeling that way. 

Furthermore, as society grows more liberal, support for trans people is increasing. It's one thing to say you feel a certain way, another to know there is something you can do about it. The closest you could get to ""transitioning"" a few decades ago was to be a ""tomboy"" or ""drag queen"". Now, there are resources to actually become the way you want to be, which encourages people who feel the need to medically transition to reach out and do so.

Dr Jusung Hwang endocrinologist for T british columbia - ACE health care	I recently was sent to ACE healthcare to get on testosterone, and the doctor i was given Jusung Hwang was not on any reviews or websites at all! turns out that he's straight out of grad school and even the people for blood work had to call in to get the proper information as he's not in the system. I wanted to make this post to tell anyone who's been sent to this doctor that he is incredible! very sensitive to trans folks, asks preferred name, pronouns, identity, explains everything clearly, and asks very good questions and allows you to ask questions. When i searched reddit for this name i found nothing so anyone who's looking up this name you're in incredibly good hands!	"I also have been having the same great experience with him! I've had a couple appointments with him now and every time I've been so impressed with his manner and care. Highly recommended, especially as someone who was really nervous about starting T initially.
I can‚Äôt recommend Dr Junsung Hwang enough! I‚Äôm a queer cis woman and I have PCOS. My doctor referred me to Dr Hwang and what a gem! My testosterone levels are super high because of my condition. Doctors usually tell me straight way to ‚Äúlose some weight and it will get better‚Äù. He heard my concerns and difficulties. And he was so polite, informative and caring. I saw this post after seeing him and wanted to chime in a positive review too.

[TW: Transphobia in Government] Alabama Passed SB219, please help Alabama trans youth by contacting their officials and speaking out. Additionally, if you are a minor in Alabama, please protect yourself and be careful who you share your identity with.	"Hello all, as I'm sure you're probably aware of, Alabama has recently passed Senate Bill 219, the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. This act makes it a class-C felony for any healthcare provider to provide hormone blockers or hormone therapy to any person under the age of 19. The penalty for doing so is up to 10 years in prison or a $15,000 fine. Additionally, the bill makes it a requirement of any school staff aware of a child's questioning of their gender or self-identification as another gender to report this to their parents or legal guardians.   


Effectively, this bill has criminalized being transgender and being a minor at the same time. It is a direct gateway for abuse of transgender youths, and it does exactly the opposite of what it is purported to do.   


Below, I have included a list of the 22 Alabama Senators who voted yea to the vote, as well as the sponsor for the house bill version of this, and their email addresses according to the Alabama state legislature website, as well as a link to the contact page for the Alabama state governor so that you can reach out to the highest offices of the state. Below is also a template email, which I have typed up and already sent to these 23 individuals which includes sources cited with information about why this is going to lead to the abuse of transgender youth in Alabama. Feel free to either send them this email or to write up your own and send it to them, they need to know what the consequences of their actions are and they need to know to fix this. It is an injustice that it passed at all, and any amount of support to the trans youth of Alabama will help.  


Please, share this post to your communities, but do not spam them. This is a very serious issue and, like with similar issues in other states, needs more attention.

Subject: Vulnerable Children That Have Just Been Guaranteed Will Be Abused by Their Parents or Guardians 

Text: Hello, I am not part of your constituency, but I have heard of the recent transgender bill that passed in Alabama, the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, and would like to say a few words about it.   

This bill is going to guarantee that a number transgender youths are abused by their parents. Being transgender in the United States isn't something that's widely accepted in many places, especially not within the American Midwest or the American South, typically due to religious and/or conservative backgrounds. Alabama, as I'm sure you're aware, is a highly conservative state (of a sample size of 511 adult citizens of Alabama in 2014, 50% reportedly identified as conservative according to Pew Research Center, https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/political-ideology/by/state/) and a state whose citizens are majority religious (77% religious as reported by Pew, https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama) and there is a very clear trend of discriminating against transgender people within the workplace, public access to amenities, healthcare, et al., according to the 2015 US Transgender Survey findings for Alabama (https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTSALStateReport%281017%29.pdf). With all this in mind, one could easily come to the conclusion that many in Alabama are not accepting of transgender identities and that many are probably, actively opposed to transgender identities. It is a fact that transgender people (and others in the LGBTQ+ community as well) face abuses or rejection by family, especially parents, for being out to them as transgender (refer to chapter 5, page 64 onwards, https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf).   

In the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, the following is one of the provisions (https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB303/id/2143816/Alabama-2020-HB303-Introduced.pdf):   

Section 5. No nurse, counselor, teacher, principal, or other administrative official at a public or private school attended by a minor shall do either of the following: (1) Encourage or coerce a minor to withhold from the minor's parent or legal guardian the fact that the minor's perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor's sex. (2) Withhold from a minor's parent or legal guardian information that is relevant to the physical or mental health of the minor, including information related to a minor's perception that his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with his or her sex. (SB219 version here, https://legiscan.com/AL/text/SB219/id/2163125/Alabama-2020-SB219-Engrossed.pdf)  

This provision basically states that a child who goes to an adult who they are supposed to trust for advice about life and assistance within their home environment is to be outed to their parents or guardians about their identity regardless of their [the child's] preparedness or their home environment. This provision is going to cause children to be abused by their parents or guardians, specifically due to them being outed as transgender. Many children go to their school's staff to talk to them about what they are experiencing so that they don't have to confront their parents or guardians with it, specifically to avoid ostracizing and abuse from their parents, guardians, and even siblings. By putting this provision into this bill, effectively one of the only avenues, if not in many cases the only avenue, for a child to learn about themselves, seek appropriate resources, and receive appropriate mental health counseling without consequences from their parents or guardians has been stripped from them.  

Regardless of the bill's inaccurate understanding of the effects of puberty blockers and gender transition, as well as its lack of understanding of the various forms of transition, this provision alone will cause harm to vulnerable children, is not compassionate, and in fact it is endangering children. I encourage you to veto this bill and if this bill gets signed into law, I encourage you to repeal this bill, so you can mitigate the inevitable harm has just been enacted on potentially hundreds of children."	"""Child Protection Act"" they say as they not only deny treatment to vulnerable trans kids, but also require their trans status to be outed to potentially harmful or even deadly relatives which may spark instances of child abuse, neglect, or even murder.
And Alabama was finally doing good... Or better I mean."	m0dvc9	trans	8	0.83	2021-03-08 11:36:08
I'm planning to come out to my dad soon and I'm fucking terrified	"I've been planning to come out to my dad for a while now before Christmas break, and that time is coming up soon. I've wanted to come out for years, or at the very least just express my gender in ways that felt comfortable for me, but felt like I couldn't because of my parents' cisnormative attitudes around gender and gender expression. Now that I'm away at college and have been able to express myself more freely, including using my chosen name and pronouns, I can't stand the idea of returning home and going back to pretending to be something I not. But as tired as I am about hiding who I am, and as much as I want to be open about my identity, I still can't help but feel absolutely terrified at the idea of what my dad's reaction might be. He's a Nigerian immigrant, and Nigeria isn't exactly known for being a shining beacon for the LGBT+ rights movement--quite the opposite. He's mildly queerphobic himself, as he once said that Caitlyn Jenner is ""still a guy"" and had a tendency to flip the TV channel to something else whenever pride related segments were being shown on the news back in June. He also follows gender roles pretty closely; he never pushed femininity on me nearly as hard as my mom did, but he still thinks that I should follow certain behaviors based on my assigned gender, like wearing traditionally feminine clothing and having an affinity for the color pink.

Despite all of this, he's an overall left-leaning person, and while he's also religious, he's not devoutly so; in fact, he hates when people try to use religion as a justification or excuse for bigotry. He's also a doctor and understands how important it is for patients to have easy and affordable access to the healthcare they need, which is a mindset that could work in my favor if I tell him I want to go on hormones, although I still worry he won't agree with it because it might seem too ""extreme"" of a change.

We've been keeping in touch ever since I left for school, and I can tell he genuinely loves me and cares about my well-being, so I don't think I'm at risk of being financially cut off or disowned or anything like that when I come out. That being said, I'm formulating a back up plan to stay at some kind of shelter if he does react badly when I go back home for break. I really doubt it'll come to that, but you can never be too sure. I sincerely hope it doesn't, though. I don't expect him to be immediately supportive of my identity--in fact, I expect him to push back at least somewhat at the idea that he's ""losing"" his ""baby girl""--but I'm just so scared about what could change, what's *going* to change, especially if he takes it badly. I don't want to live the rest of my life living a comfortable lie for him or my mom, but at the same time, I don't know if I can handle potentially losing all of his general love and support for me when I tell him this."	"My parents are the same way Conservative Republicans both sides and I‚Äôve heard them make fun of trans people when I was younger. I had a lot of push back at the beginning specially from my dad because he felt I should read the bible before I make a final decision little did he know since I was a little kid I was reading the
Bible and praying it away, but it did nothing other then making me hate myself. It sounds like your dad loves you and he might surprise you (: shoot my conservative religious dad traveled with me to Thailand for my surgeries which shocked me. I mean he still not an ally lol, but we talk more now then before the transition even if he doesn‚Äôt fully agree with my choices. I hope everything works out for you because you deserve to be your true self and to feel happiness. <3 Once you tell him you‚Äôll feel a weight lifted off your shoulders.

I don‚Äôt know what to caption this	This is just a question, I went on a sub which ended up being _very_ transphobic, and there I saw several cis men complaining that it‚Äôs easier for trans men to get access to testosterone that cis men with low testosterone levels. That just sounds blatantly incorrect to me, especially when countries are now stopping trans people get access to basic healthcare. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt find anything to disprove this though.	"Lol, that‚Äôs a lie. I‚Äôve actually heard of trans men back in the day pretending to be a cis man with a testosterone deficiency in order to get their t easier, because cis people were given less trouble and didn‚Äôt have to deal with all the barriers, the psychologists, the real life experience thingy, and what not that trans people did

Why is it so difficult!!	"I just looked into changing your gender in the UK and you have to get assessed (3-6 appointments) and they can just say that you are not trans and then deny hrt. They can also deny if they think you're not responsible enough to make an informed decision.
It also seems to cost money to legally change your name, which is strange considering that this is a country where you get free healthcare and if you're are below the age of 17 it looks even more difficult to do.

I'm not even out to my parents yet but this has stressed me out to the point where I don't want to come out as all of this makes me so anxious.

(Also I might be wrong on some of this but this is what I saw in my brief research)

I honestly don't know if coming out would be worth if it if I go through all of that and then get told no"	"You've managed to put into words what I could never quite phrase about being trans in this country. It's seen as a disorder, not a natural part of being human. And one of my biggest blocks for going to a doctor's is as you said, the decision is in their hands, not in the hands of the patient. We need to be an informed consent country
So a couple of things.

Deed polls do not have to cost money. Free deed polls exist and are just as valid. You do need to pay for some things - new passport, new driver's license (if you're going to update your photo) but the name change itself does not cost money. It's nothing like as awkward as the US where you need a judge to confirm your name change and it's like $500+ BEFORE changing any ID.

Transitioning on the NHS is very slow, and they are gatekeepy AF. There are multiple private clinics, most have licenses to practice in the UK, but unless shared care with a GP is a must for you (probably for cost reasons), even that isn't mandatory.

In terms of whether it's worth doing something? It is. I was out of my egg by the age of 15 and repressed everything until I was basically 30. The dysphoria, gender envy, however you feel doesn't go away and will sit in the corner quietly until your lowest moments and jump on you. I regret those lost years so much because I never got to be me in them.

Hope this helps you out.

I'm so sorry that you're going through this.

Society is slow to change, and medical thinking can be even slower - homosexuality was decriminalised in the UK in the 1960s but was still technically identified as a mental illness until 1992. Awareness and understanding of trans issues is a long way behind that; it's growing, but it's painfully slow going and I'm afraid you're in the generation at the forefront of driving the change through mainstream clinical thinking.

There are people in your corner, and not just here. You haven't mentioned being in contact with any of the support and information services for young people; may I suggest [Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/young-people/)? They exist to support young people in positions like yours, and they have a very good reputation. 

I wish you the very best on your journey.
Right? Like I understand an assessment just incase they want access to hormones for other reason (especially testosterone because if not tons of bodybuilders would take advantage of it) but there is no way on earth that I'm going to sit through 6 months of appointments (including family therapy) just to be told no.

The worse part is that one of the easiest ways to get hormones from a doctor is to start by buying from an outside source because then they will give an official prescription to ""prevent the risk"" 

And ontop of that there is apparently fucking waiting lists that you have to deal with!!
What they don't seem to understand with this is that through this process they are pushing people towards either getting their hormones from extremely dodgy place or bankrupting themselves by going private!
It is a disorder
Honestly my only problem on going private is that my parents might not be willing to pay it especially as they might think that my dysphoria is just a part of my anxiety. I'm relient on my parents right now due to my age.

But thank you for the help!! :D.
Thank you for linking the website I will consider using it (especially as they seem to have a we chat option aswell a button that you can press which kicks you off the website!!)

Other than that the only thing that I am involved in or scheduled to be involved in are for other things about my mental health.

Once again, thank you!! :D
You're very welcome,  sweetheart. I hope they can offer you something."	rqsgmm	trans	7	0.78	2021-12-28 23:09:44
I don't want to fight, I just want to live	"Here in America we're hearing calls for genocide, laws preventing gender affirming care, blatant attacks against our livelihood. Unless we push back, our human rights will be curtailed‚Äîand in many cases already are.  
  
But I don't want to fight. I was aggressive when I was repressed and I don't want to be like that again. I just want to live my life. I want to be able to go to work, read at a coffee shop, go to yoga...without wanting to kill myself. I just want to be left alone.  
  
But they're not leaving us alone. They're scapegoating us, attacking us, preventing us from accessing healthcare. They're not okay with us living our lives. I live in a progressive state, so for the most part I've been sheltered from the awful anti-trans bills being passed in other states. But if a republican wins the presidency in 2024, it won't be long before they're banning trans care at a federal level. Republicans have proven the thing they're best at it hurting other people.   
  
So what are my options? I don't want to fight. I want to live. I'll have to go to another country, one that won't persecute me for being who I am. Yesterday my sister told me she would help me move to Canada. I'm scared. I don't know where I'll be able to live. But it seems like moving is my only option, if worse comes to worst. I'm scared and I'm sad. I hope it won't come to that, but I never thought I'd be in this situation.

Trans friendly European countries?	"I've been vaguely considering emigrating before I settle down & have a family because, yknow, the US is a hellscape and I want my children to have better childhoods than I did.

A lot of googling has told me which countries legalized gay marriage when, what politicians are openly queer, etc. But what about healthcare? Is there a different process for trans men who have transitioned (I'll have changed name/gender documents, maybe gotten top surgery by then) as opposed to trans folks actively transitioning in that country?

Yall, I don't want to stay here. Could any non-American folks give me some advice?"	"[removed]
The process will typically be a bit easier, assuming you're just moving a hrt prescription over, then going through everything right from the beginning. How good healthcare is and how gatekeepy a country is can vary wildly. Its pretty common to use something like gendergp since public trans healthcare is often the first to lose funding when things get tough in my experience. Or just isn't prioritised at all- ireland currently doesn't meet international standards of care for example, and there's one public clinic in the country that only sees 200 people a year. That being said, private healthcare in Europe is typically way cheaper than America, so there's options.

You can find sites with survey data on what users think the general consensus is on trans people in each country. How the local news reports on trans people isn't a good indicator at all, they're as bad as the Internet with the rage bait in the English speaking news anchors anyway
From what I hear the northwest is the best area for trans people. UK, Germany (and surroundings), Scandinavia (not the balcans tho, they're shit) and maaaybe Switzerland allthough I'm not super keen of it.

The laws there are generally fine or are being worked on, the people are nice-ish and there's a lot less people who wanna kill you. Absolutely avoid the east under any circumstances, it's horrible there and you're generally illegal and the people will hate you there.

Southern Europe is a bit of a grey zone, the people are pretty nice and accepting (in my experience) but the legal situation is rough.
Yeah I've heard about your Tories...still leagues ahead of our GQP tho. Thank you for the info!
Only 200 people a year?? Holy crap. & yeah, I'm hoping that since I'll have a prescription, I won't have to do the psych eval/dysphoria diagnosis/endo visit dance that I know a lot of the folks w/ universal healthcare have to go thru. & I'll try looking for those, the surveys. Thank you!
Yeah üò¨üò¨ if I do, I'll definitely stick to like...Germany, or further west/north than that (Scandinavia, the UK, maybe Ireland or Belgium?) Moving from the u.s. to someplace less progressive doesn't sound like fun. Thank you for the info!"	zk9zs0	trans	8	0.89	2022-12-12 20:13:06

I'm a medical student in the US interested in understanding the experience of trans individuals in the US healthcare system. I'm not trans myself, so I apologize if I use incorrect language or terminology, I'm always open to being corrected!

Specifically: 

Have you ever experienced being uninsured and unable to access hormones and other healthcare needs? What was that like? Have you ever found this sort of care in a free healthcare setting (and was it satisfactory?)?

For those of you with insurance, how easy is it to find a provider? Do you find these providers to be well-trained and competent in providing trans care? What is trans care like in urban environments as opposed to more suburban or rural?

I understand this is a really personal topic, and I truly apologize if posting this is somehow inflammatory or unwelcome given that I am from outside the community. 

Thank you for your time :)"	"I'm too new at this to give you answers but I do want to say thank you for considering our input! It feels lately like a lot of well meaning cisgender people think they know what is best for me, so when we actually get asked for input it brings me hope!! 

Thanks!!!!! üôÇ

I would recommend checking out World Professional Association for Transgender Health at wpath.org.

I applaud your desire to learn more about transgender medical care but based on my observations of the transgender community information gathering inquiries like yours get little response.  The more questions being asked the lower the chances of getting a response.

Lots of people are talking about transgender medical care and insurance coverage but you have to browse through postings on the various sites catering to the transgender community to find them.  Transgender care and insurance coverage can be dramatically different depending what town and doctor you see.  

I've read a fair amount of discussion at transgenderpulse.com and susans.org on the subject at hand.  I've had several doctors give me the bare minimum of care as they really don't understand what its like to be transgender and have done a minimal amount of study on the subject.  Its like they learned just enough to pass a test and no more.  It felt very much like they didn't believe being transgender was a ""real"" thing and were only humoring their transgender patients.
I applaud your desire for knowledge, but this is such a huge topic and you've come to a location where we use our few, small spoons to hype up other transgender individuals. Not many people are going to take the time to answer because you can google this and we're tired of cis people wanting us to do all of the labor. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Long story short, medical providers would be a joke in our community if it weren't so damn tragic that so many of us can't get proper care. Many of us have to see specialists for HRT and even getting to see those specialists is a series of jumping through hoops. And that's for people WITH insurance. Gender confirming surgeries... Well. Generally, it takes years if you're lucky.

If you're looking for more information, there are tons of articles about it. I googled ""trans healthcare experiences"" and the first list of results is specifically for scholarly articles. I highly recommend giving those a read. Nothing on the front page is saying we have an easy time with it, so it seems about right.

If you want to engage with the trans community and build a better understanding for and camaraderie with trans individuals, then maybe volunteer for organizations that support trans people. I bet there's at least 1 near you. Later on, work on finding a residency that helps the trans community as most generalized locations (PCPs, hospitals, etc) will be fairly clueless.

If you want to continue to engage in this subreddit, then think about how you can help here and (after helping) post individual questions. You'll get a lot more answers if you ask about the process to get the first dose of HRT, the best/worst experiences with a medical provider, or how people without insurance get medical care... After you google it.

I truly hope this helps and you're able to spread some of this information to other meds students that you're studying with.
gendergp.com is a private online service that a lot of European trans people use as multi-year long waiting lists are the norm for public trans healthcare here, they have a lot of information on their site. Idk if that helps
Thank you for your response. I completely accept the criticism too. The thought entered my mind after posting that here I am putting the burden on trans folks again. Apologies for that. My intention is to get more ‚Äúfirst hand‚Äù experience, but I believe my questions could have been more specific in that case. 

I did call a few offices known to be ‚Äútrans friendly‚Äù in my area only to find that perhaps they could be doing much better. From an outsider looking in, the hoops you refer to just seem so numerous. 

Anyway, long story short- you‚Äôre right!
It helps a lot, thank you!"	ni0l03	trans	7	1.0	2021-05-21 19:21:47
Tavistock/GIDS situation (UK)	" I've seen a lot of fear/misinformation, so I thought I'd provide a quick summary of what is absolutely known.

\- The *children's* (under-18) Tavistock gender clinic is closing  
\- Tavistock will be replaced by 2 different clinics: one in London, one in Manchester  
\- Everyone currently under the care of/on the waiting list for Tavistock will be transferred to the care of one of these clinics  
\- This is expected to happen by spring 2023  
\- This is done to reduce waiting lists and increase quality of care (workers will be less strung-out)  
\- This is not because of fears around children transitioning  
\- There are currently no confirmed changes around what will happen with hormones/blockers

A *lot* of news sources (BBC, Guardian, etc.) are spreading misleading, and even false information. Whilst the transition (no pun intended) between these two systems may be somewhat rough, there's no immediate cause for panic. I'm currently being seen by the Tavistock clinic and have an appointment with them on the 8th of August. I'll try to squeeze as much information as possible out of them then. I'm posting updates on the stories of my instagram (@bookshelf.monkey), I have a ""Tavistock"" highlight on there.

In the meantime, here are some slightly better sources to check out:  
[NHS Tavistock youth gender clinic to be replaced (pinknews.co.uk)](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/07/28/tavistock-portman-trans-gender-identity-clinic/)  
[NHS replacing Tavistock gender clinic could herald vital change (pinknews.co.uk)](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/07/28/trans-youth-healthcare-tavistock-nhs/)  
[Publications ‚Äì Cass Review](https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/) (this is the official review)

Edit: This is my understanding of how the situation currently stands, please correct me if you think I'm wrong.

Edit #2 (some stuff I'd like to add): I've had no official communication from GIDS as things currently stand, which kind of sucks, as you think they'd contact the relevant people before stories like this come out

I know that this still feels alarming. I don't blame anyone for panicking (I absolutely did when I first saw the headlines), but this looks like it could ultimately be a good thing. Stay strong and hope for the best.

I'm also open to questions/anyone who wants a running commentary of how things stand, you can PM me on here or on my instagram.

Also, just a general warning to never trust mainstream UK media. They're all fearmongering transphobes."	"Thanks for this.

I saw the headline initially and thought 'oh no'... but the actual article contents sound like a step in the right direction. The devil will be in the detail naturally, but the clickbait headline implying it'll be removed with no replacement is just emblematic of everything bad about social news media in the 2020s.
Yeah I fully panicked before I read some of the articles. This should actually be helpful, it's just a shame they didn't do anything sooner."	walpkz	trans	5	0.64	2022-07-28 21:21:22
Question for people using Plume	"Hello, I'm Frida mtf pre everything. I'm looking into getting hormones soon and my main option for healthcare provider is Plume. Unfortunately I don't feel safe enough to tell my parents I'm taking hormones so my question is. How does plume send the medication, through a farmacy or do they mail it to your house?

Thanks everyone, I really appreciate your comments"	"You pick it up at a pharmacy
I'm starting the same process  as you in the same situation, as I read they send to local or pharmacy  of choice.
They send the prescription to the pharmacy.   Honestly I was kinda wary of picking it up, but almost two years later now and the same people are there treating me like an old friend.
Ohh cool, good to know
Nice, thank you!
I'm a little worried to but as long as they send it to a pharmacy in good, I was worried that they would send it on the mail to my house cause then someone else can see it
Folx only does mail but they use discretion in packaging I believe.
Yeah that's why I was confused, I think I'm gonna stick with Plume just for the mailing situation"	10vgr29	trans	5	0.86	2023-02-06 20:11:48
Where it would be better to move out as a trans?	"All there is to the question is in the tittle, honestly. It's just that living where I currently am becomes more and more unbearable and I am open for alternatives.
I am interested in what countries, cities are better for trans.
Multiple categories of ""better"" for example the healthcare, open-mindness, acess to hrt, possibly your trans experience in the country. Would love to hear from any of you your opinion or a story!"	"the front range in Colorado is pretty great. CO is a consent state for hrt, so as long as there are no underlying health concerns you just have to tell your doctor you want to take hormones and you are gtg. Fort Collins is a nice city and cheaper than Boulder or Denver. Loveland is also nice
I'm commenting in hopes that this gets more engagement. As someone in the Bible belt of America, I'd love to get somewhere a little more accepting.

Edit: I will say, I myself am very lucky to be right where I am though. There's a doctor just barely down the road from California that both diagnoses gender dysphoria and actually sets patients up with hrt. He's a great guy and I want to spread the word about him but I'm worried about doxxing him lmao.

I'm in Brooklyn and am never fucking leaving.

There are a lot of other socially hospitable enclaves, but the city has a level of legal and financial power and autonomy that makes me feel safer here than even in other cities in New York state. 

We have both state and city laws against anti-trans discrimination in education, employment, medical care, health insurance, and public accommodations (including restrooms). And the city's size means we have social infrastructure that isn't possible in most places, including multiple large trans health clinics, legal aid organizations, social groups, etc. There are a lot of trans people here, so there's some safety in numbers.

NYC had a reputation for being very expensive, and it is, but it is possible to live here on a tight budget. Almost half the city lives at or below 150% of the poverty limit, which is about $20k/hear for a single person.

The biggest difference in cost of living is rent, and lots of people cope with that by having roommates, often several, well into adulthood. I'm 40, an IT professional, and live with my brother plus two other roommates who are also trans. The two of them are both 21 and recently moved to the city, one escaping Florida and the other a bad situation in NJ. They work in food service and are broke as shit, but minimum wage is $15/hour and they get by. We met one through a friend of a friend, and the other through a Facebook NYC queer roommate group.

It's definitely a different way of life here than most people are used to, it's not for everyone and it can be a difficult adjustment. But if you can acclimate to it the city may be the safest place left in the US.
Oregon US has good trans healthcare coverage. They cover surgeries and hormones.

NEED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BADLY!!!!!!	"Hello Friendly pals your friendly neighborhood Non-binary  pal here and I am in dire need of emotional support my gender dysphoria is really bad these days since I just got my period which is one of the worst causes of my dysphoria so I just want someone I can talk to.
(My Facebook name is Phoenix Ameri the one with the cat pfp) 

I don't really like my family so I'm not comfortable of coming out to them and to say my mother is really religious so that's one of the reasons I'm scared of talking to her (if I come out I'll have to say to her that I'm an Apatheist too!) And one of the sources of my trauma is religion itself so I really wouldn't like it if I come out to her both as an Apatheist and Non-binary then she'll just say that I'm lost and need to pray to God (yep she's those type of religious people) Also context! my family isn't really that open minded, my dad always assumes that when someone drives badly then the driver is a woman then I'll go laugh at his face when I see that the driver is a man, then there's my mother who didn't like my phone case because it's a ""boy blue"" she also thinks that when a guy plucks his brows then he's gay so yup my parents are a bunch of stereotyping pricks  

So yep I feel really helpless right now, my mother has contacted a therapist but I haven't actually talked to them (I can't even guarantee if that therapist is gonna be LGBT+ friendly because they're just a local therapist that we don't even need to pay for) 

And to say in the end of the day even if my family accepted me it would still be useless since being trans or Non-binary isn't allowed in my country (yep I live in a religious country with a shitty government) and my family isn't that rich to pay for my healthcare needs or move to another country 

I've also haven't gone to school for more than a year! My parents doesn't know that I didn't go to school for months but my teachers actually still gave me grades and passed me for the school year even doe I didn't contact them about my depression that being said because of all that I have cut off my friends for more than a year now I've also moved to a different school but again I stopped my school year this year since I had to tell my mother about my depression and she agreed so that's something I'm happy about 

Long story short I just really want a helping hand, been depressed for more than a year now and even attempted Su!cide a few months ago but then I remembered that I wanted to celebrate my birthday and that I still want to become an Astronomer or a biologist in the future but I feel like I can't hold on this life any longer living and pretending as someone I am not.
 I don't have anymore real life friends or online friends that could support me because my family isn't there so I just really really want someone to talk to (‚äÉÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅ‚Äø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)‚äÉ please contact my Facebook messenger"	Dm me if you want to talk	rbja3v	trans	5	0.86	2021-12-08 05:02:47
Tips for getting on testosterone blockers?	"Hi! My name is Athena (MTF, 17), and I‚Äôm going to turn 18 in 2 days!!!!! So I‚Äôm exited that I finally get to get on testosterone blockers!!!! I have a couple questions though I need help with. 

1. How do I go about getting the t blockers? Do I go to my healthcare provider and ask? I used to have a therapist so he moved companies, so I don‚Äôt have one right now, but he told me that he could give me the green light for t blockers and estrogen. 

2. How do I take the t blockers? Is it like pills? Or injections. 

3. How will certain substances, mainly nicotine/tobacco, and marijuana affect my body if I am on testosterone blockers? 

4. Is there any changes I should make to my lifestyle, so that I don‚Äôt accidentally harm myself once I am on testosterone blockers? 

Thank y‚Äôall so much for your responses, they mean the world to me."	"talk to PCP, or make appt with endo
What country are you in?
Hi! I just recently started so I'll answer the best I can! 

1- if your former therapist is able to, I think that would be the quickest way, otherwise ask your primary doctor for a referral to somewhere that can

2- it can be taken a couple ways, but I personally take pills

3- with Testosterone blockers they wont really hurt, however with estrogen they can cause some major problems, such as an increased risk of heart attack or stroke

4- just try to eat healthy. If you're gonna take estrogen as well, it can mess with your magnesium and potassium levels, both of which can cause problems if levels are too high or too low

I hope I was able to help :)
United States, California to be specific
Thank you so much, you were really helpful. I think the headrest one will be number 4, to eat healthy. I‚Äôm currently recovering from an eating disorder and my transition has been my leading motivation to recover so that I can get on estrogen and t blockers. I‚Äôve bene doing good too, about 2 meals a day. And yes I‚Äôm gonna stop smoking cigarettes by the time I‚Äôm in estrogen, somehow, but I was condensed that nicotine would kill the testosterone blockers in my system, the way nicotine kills estrogen if it‚Äôs taken in pill form."	p6spy4	trans	6	0.88	2021-08-18 14:51:42
i hate being politicized	"people who hate me know nothing about me or being trans - they think we have some goal other than just existing

when i have republican relatives telling me how they've never seen me happier now that i transitioned it just tells me how little they know about trans people...

like, what did people expect me to do?? im just living my life - im finally free to do it without my dysphoria getting in the way and then people will tell me their 'tax-payer's dollars' don't deserve to be spent on my healthcare üôÑ

i just kinda give up - i could live stealth going forward if i wanted to but i just don't have the motivation to continue on while everyone else suffers idk im just not in a great place mentally i guess üíïüíï"	"What Republican is paying for anything resembling public healthcare? It certainly sounds like something a lot of them would complain about, though. But, yeah, it's the nature of fear to be self-centered. The people terrified of ""The Trans Agenda""^TM think trans people's lives revolve around them, which is vindicated in their minds when we protest having our rights taken away. Their fear grows so rampant in their minds that it seems resonable that, say, all terrorists are plotting to hurt them personally, and all gay people meet together to talk about how to hit on them and turn them gay. It's the life they live, and in a lot of places, that fear is encouraged throughout. It's in their music, their friends, their job. They look for it until it's all they see. It's an easy trap to fall into.

How Credible Are These Claims?	"I just recently came across this lecture by a Dr. William Powers: ""Healthcare of the Transgender Patient.""

He claims to have devised more effective HRT protocols than the standards set by WPATH, at least for MTF, and he certainly seems confident enough in the delivery of his lecture. He sounds to me like he knows what he's talking about.

But I'm not a medical professional at all. ""How he sounds to me"" is worthless as a measure of his credibility. Do we have anyone else around this sub that *is* qualified to judge his statements?"	"I am under the care of PFM and also active on their subreddit.

Basically they are trying to recreate natural puberty hormone levels  to get you the best results.

WPATH is about getting your hormone levels to match an adult range.

They also use labs and patient feedback to adjust your treatment to get you individualized care.

In my case I told the P.A. that I was getting a rash from the patches, so they put me on more pills to compensate.

The changes seem slow right now but I am also focused on losing weight at the same time. But the care I am getting at PFM has been top notch.

I am only 4 months into my HRT. Switching to injections at the 6 month mark hopefully.
To my understanding he's a bit controversial to some. On one hand, he's is radically into listening to trans patients and trying to customize care to fit their goals and needs, even if those goals or needs differ from standard, and is willing to break the mold in ways other providers might not be. But on the other hand he's also said some questionable things now and again, can sometimes be a bit over confident with his methods, and if you're trying something new and experimental... well you're trying something new and experimental, and there's some risks in that. But for people who aren't getting what they want or need from other HRT providers, he's the guy who's most willing to help anyone (for a price I guess. He can be expensive and has a waitlist.) and try something different and make it work for ya.

Finally reached out to my local trans community‚Ä¶	"I met girl who‚Äôs much older than me and advocates for better access for trans healthcare in my region. There is no gender clinic for adults in my area and the nearest one is in Toronto 5 hours south. Many doctors here don‚Äôt have experience with trans patients; I‚Äôm my doctor‚Äôs first adult trans patient. I called my doctor in March 2021 to schedule an HRT appointment and the she scheduled it for March 14, 2022 - 12 whole months before I even begin the process‚Ä¶ yay‚Ä¶

When I told my friend about the wait time she said she‚Äôs going to ask if her clinic is taking new patients, and if thing go well I can start HRT in a matter of weeks! She said she has never seen anyone who already looks like they‚Äôre 100% socially transitioned be ‚Äúdenied‚Äù HRT and she asked if my doctor was fucking blind. Well, because of covid all of my appointments have been over the phone and nobody at my doctor‚Äôs office has seen me since 2019. 

‚ÄúThis is exactly the fucking shit that I hate, and why I do what I do.‚Äù

I have someone in my corner who understands finally! She‚Äôs not gonna tell me to DYI or get on Plume (plume is not in Canada lol most disappointing Google search everrr), and she actually believes me when I say that I think nobody cares about transgender healthcare in my city! 

Lol but the mouth on this one! My superpower is that I can never be annoyed and my curse is that I have a lot of chatty friends. I already know we‚Äôre gonna be tight üòÖ"	"I‚Äôm sorry your doctor did that to you, and I‚Äôm so glad that you found an ally to help you out. Since HRT is just informed consent in Ontario, I don‚Äôt see any reason for her to push your initial consult that far back. Maybe she‚Äôs trying to push you to go to another clinic by delaying you.

I live just west of Toronto in the suburbs, so I‚Äôm hoping my doctor is more understanding when I have that talk with her in probably a few months.

I look extremely cis right now, and my game plan was to start HRT first and start socially transitioning afterwards, so I hope that doesn‚Äôt impact my appointment."	qsxgsc	trans	6	0.88	2021-11-13 09:08:52
TDOV	"Today is the transgender day of visibility, a chance for us in the T category of the LGBTQ+ to show that we are not few in number, and we come in all shapes and sizes.
The beauty of this day however is somewhat lessened this year.
Multiple states in the U.S. are not only proposing, but also passing anti-transgender bills that seek to limit healthcare (in many cases lifesaving) to transgender individuals.
This year alone, 492 bills have been introduced by law makers across 47 different states.
Out of these, 43 have failed to pass, but 25 have passed, and the remaining 424 are still active with lawmakers.
Some of these laws seek to prosecute parents of transgender minors as child abusers if they seek gender related medical attention, and any doctors providing gender related services to minors as well.
Meanwhile, in places like Melbourne Australia, anti-trans demonstrations are taking place with the open support and participation of neo-Nazis holding up a banner reading ""destroy paedo freaks"".
The world is unfortunately not a welcoming place for people like me, but still we march on and continue to be ourselves.
This is not a day of pride, this is a day visibility.
A day to let people know that we are not invisible.
A day to let people know that we are many.
A day to let people see how we are treated.
A day to hopefully show our governments of all countries and states that the invisible boogie man they believe us to be, are just regular people.
People with jobs.
People with education.
People with families.
People with positions of power.
People, just wanting to be treated as such.

HRT abroad?	"Hi, I'm looking for advice regarding continuation of HRT when abroad. For context, I live in France.

As part of my uni syllabus, I have to study abroad for a varying period of time (most likely two and a half years in Japan in my case), but there's also a high likelihood that I will be starting HRT at the end of October / beginning of November (appointment with endocrinologist on the 27th). I seem to remember that Japan allows gender-affirming healthcare (albeit with the requirement of GRS), without it being an overly welcoming place for trans people. But even if we overlook the country I'm going to, how do I ensure that my treatment stays relatively the same?

My question is, are there any Japanese people on this sub that could share their experience with HRT (in DMs if need be), or even point to some transfriendly endocrinologists (I would be in Sendai, if that helps)? On the other side of things, are there many people who had to go abroad for a long-ish period of time while on HRT? How did you get through it? Was your endocrinologist able to do anything about it?"		pztyiw	trans	6	1.0	2021-10-02 12:09:25

"Try informed consent websites that provide HRT. I‚Äôm so sorry you are in such a shitty state. Also save money, and apply for jobs in some big city on the west coast before your state becomes a right-wing wonderland where you will be criminalized for being trans.
That's so shitty... I'm so sorry TC"	1109fc5	trans	6	1.0	2023-02-12 06:53:45

HRT-iversary coming up!!!	"So mid-July is my 1-yr of HRT, and I really want to celebrate, given that I've had to hide it from my mother like a friggin secret identity. It's been such a long journey and I really want to commemorate it. I'd like to go to a local con to meet one of my favorite voice actors, but given that I've been unemployed for 2 months, I don't know if I can do it. I've had to say screw it and start working for Starbucks just to pay bills (and maybe get some good healthcare while I'm at it).

What are issues you encounter with healthcare?	"I‚Äôm a dutch medical student starting a community research project, and I‚Äôm looking to investigate problems in trans healthcare in the Netherlands. I figured the best way to know which direction to go is ask trans people. Are there any issues in healthcare that you think deserve more attention? 
I‚Äôm working within the dutch healthcare system specifically, but I‚Äôm sure many problems arise internationally, so any feedback is appreciated!"	"The way the huisarts is *no fucking help* at all. I don‚Äôt want to be referred to *yet another* psychiatrist who after another 6 months of waiting will tell me what I already know, or referred to a hospital only to later find on the day of that appointment that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do trans care here‚Äù, meaning I‚Äôd wasted another half a year , and when I finally got my INTAKE gesprek it was another 24 months before the dedicated gender team would even see me.

They‚Äôd honestly rather we just died because then they wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with us. 

At least mine still orders blood tests from me so my self-medicating is more safe, but beyond that the idea of ‚Äòtrans care‚Äô in the Netherlands is laughable.

Edit: ‚Äòself-medicating‚Äô in this context includes the use of online informed consent and private clinics. Dutch GPs don‚Äôt believe an adult can make that decision.
The prices. I'm struggling to pay $200 a visit and $100 for medicine. It sucks because my insurance covers literally nothing pertaining to transitioning.
I'm American in America. So I don't know how pertinent this would be, probably not at all
Yeah I‚Äôve heard about that run around from my trans friends as well, it‚Äôs deeply problematic. It could be necessary to rethink the role psychiatry has in trans healthcare. Could you speak on which part of psychiatric care you had was useful, if there was any, and which felt like a roadblock?
If I‚Äôm being completely honest, psychiatry didn‚Äôt help as much as I believe psychiatrists think it should. Whilst it was initially funny, to be told I know as much about gender theory as some of their colleagues, it really highlighted to me that they just want to sit you in a chair and prod you with all manner of inane and uncomfortable questions before sending you away, so they can feel like they‚Äôve done the bare minimum. 
Psychologists make me feel like a criminal or a zoo animal or something and tbh *they* told me I‚Äôm already self-aware so I‚Äôd far rather have an informal support network of peers than some clip-board-wielding shrinks who I get nausea when I have to go to their office.

Edit: it formally codified things I already knew I felt."	qo0clm	trans	7	1.0	2021-11-06 13:34:14

Trans guy freakin LOSING IT HERE	"I'm closeted, under my transphobic parents' health insurance. Its kickass coverage and I know if I used it to get trans healthcare, my parents would immediately take me off as soon as the physical changes showed.
I tried coming out five years ago, it went horribly and was extremely traumatizing, so I plan on going stealth and being as independent as possible. It'll be months before open enrollment to join my job's health insurance. I'm going freakin crazy, my dysphoria is the worst it's ever been. I just want to look like myself.
Anyway, my main question is this. Has anyone else been in my situation, and how did you deal with it? I feel very alone, but I'm glad to have anyone listen. Thanks y'all üíñ"	"Hey, I'm sorry you're going through this.I wish I had more helpful things to say or any practical advice, I only recently came to terms with being an enby girl recently as an adult... but with age I can at least tell you that even when everything sucks, months come and go and you'll get to your independence. Do you have a concrete goal to work towards? Do you have anyone you can talk or confide with who knows you're a man? In the meantime, see if you can find anything to sink your mind into (a hobby, games, books) that can at least temporarily distract from the dysphoria? 

I don't know if this is any help, but I see you, I believe in you and I wish you the best of luck <3"	gdvplp	trans	7	0.83	2020-05-05 11:01:52
best state for transgender healthcare?	Howdy! My fiance and I were planning to move to Washington but I want to know if anyone has had experience receiving healthcare/HRT medication there or know other states that are good about it/affordable?	"I know that Minnesota has some good trans healthcare laws that require insurance companies to cover all transtion-relted care and procedures acknowledged as beneficial by WPATH (including hair removal and FFS).
So - Washington is an interesting mix. The state as a whole is quite liberal and friendly for trans healthcare. However - once you‚Äôre outside of the Seattle metro/Tacoma/Olympia corridor (and some places along there as well) things often get much more conservative. Eastern Washington, or some places out on the Olympic Peninsula, can be extremely conservative. And the big metro areas are quite expensive cost of living-wise.

There is a lot to recommend Washington nonetheless! But wanted to give you a heads up.
Ooooh thank you :O! I'll keep it in mind!
Thanks! It's a lovely state weather wise and environmentally, but I'm not familiar with the cities and stuff. I had a friend also suggested Estes Park, Colorado which, also beautiful, but I'm not familiar with Colorado either x.x hopefully we find a nice place.

Any trans peeps from Canada ?	Im planning to move from the UK to Canada in the next couple years does anybody have anybody here experience with trans healthcare in Canada ? I'm just wondering because Im looking into trying to start HRT in the UK but it's such a mess here, would I be better off waiting till Canada ? Are things better for us there ?	"Healthcare in BC is great. The province covers gender affirming surgery, hormone therapy, and puberty blockers. All free. I think you might need to be a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident to have this health insurance though. The waitlist to see an endocrinologist is a bit long (a few months), at least it was for a friend of mine. Then again, this was for a paediatric endocrinologist, so it‚Äôs probably different for adults. Top surgery felt incredibly fast. I first talked to my endocrinologist about the possibility when I was nearing 16. We were called up a few months later and had a consultation with the surgeon. I had surgery 3 months after that. It was amazing actually. Acceptance is also high, especially in Vancouver. Anyway, welcome.
Regardless of if you do or don‚Äôt wait till your in Canada, I would highly recommend staying very far away from Alberta.
I live in Ottawa, Ontario. The healthcare I've received has been very good, my GP has written all my referrals no problem and there are quite a few options for HRT. The only thing I would say sucks is that the waitlist can be pretty long from 4-5 months up to almost a year depending on where you go. If you have citizenship and you move to Ontario, OHIP will completely cover estrogen, and bottom surgery. However, anything else such as FFS, BA, Psychologist will all have to be covered by insurance. Im lucky and that my wife and I work for the federal government so our plan covers quite a bit of the costs.

Hope this helps!!!
Montreal is the best in terms of the surgeries provided but Ontario is the largest province and has more coverage in different fields!
...I live In Alberta lol Oop-
I'm planning to move to Ontario. What the deal in Alberta ?
So just having my healthcard should cover most of the expenses for hrt? I'm only asking as I live in Ontario
Holy shit this is SO helpful you have no idea ! Thank you so much. I'm hoping to move to Kingston with my wife so everything you said is exactly what I was asking for ! 

4-5 months up to a year to start HRT ! That's a dream tbh, it's a three year waiting list to even talk to a gender specialist about anything here in the UK, and even then they will put you back to the bottom of the list of you shoe any doubt at all. 

Thank you again, you are brilliant !
Now I just gotta get my ass over there...
This province is not the safest for trans people.
Highly conservative location, designed to shit out rig pigs and drug addicts straight outta high school, bigotry is smiled upon, there‚Äôs extremely small and scared communities of trans people that do live here, with zero support options available through any service, government or otherwise. The people here are mean.
OHIP covers a specific brand of estrogen (so you will be prescribed that one first) and it covers bottom surgery. Im not sure about progesterone. I know it doesn't cover FFS or BA, or anti-androgens. If you have insurance then the anti-androgens and progesterone will most likely be covered through that.
Oh....well then.....only issue is with my parents plan I won't be covered cause they won't want it. So I just hope for now it covers what I can. I hope it's the correct kind for estrogen for coverage and glad it works with bottom surgery costs as that has been one of my biggest fears
Sadly it's not perfect (I am very lucky with my situation), but I think it's pretty rare that the OHIP covered estrogen doesn't work. If it helps I'm fairly certain the anti-androgen drugs aren't overly expensive so it could be doable without insurance
I hope so too. I planned on starting hrt when I moved out then getting surgery after a 3 or 4 years before I went overseas to teach
Also can I pm you to talk about this. We can relate fairly well and I'm still pretty knew about being trans and it'd be great to have someone who can understand me and help coach me through it
To be honest I am also quite new to being trans, I've fully socially transitioned but I have started my HRT yet due to the waitlist. I've done a lot of researching into the OHIP coverage and what my insurance will cover.
That's good tho.... It would still be nice to be able to talk to more that I can relate to
Oh yes feel free to pm me :) we are all in this together!"	kf9zlo	trans	6	1.0	2020-12-18 00:23:32
Why and how are US states allowed to ban trans healthcare for adults?	"When it comes to banning it for minors, I don't agree with it (as in I don't agree with banning it) but I can understand how they're able to get it through. Minors tend to have less rights overall.   


But for adults? Why and how are they allowed to ban our access to healthcare? We aren't hurting anyone by transitioning! The regret rate is insanely low! I shouldn't have to escape to other parts of my own country to seek refuge. Why are states even allowed to have such radically different legislatures? Every day it feels more and more like we aren't even a country anymore. We're just 50 small ones in a trenchcoat. My state has yet to place any bans or write anything into law, but I'm sure it's coming soon. I live in the deep south. In Texas the healthcare for all ages is being banned, and now I'm not sure where I'll get my HRT from. My HRT doctor is in texas. I planned to get top surgery done in texas. I am scared for my future, and I don't know what to do.   


And why the hell are they allowed to cite religion when writing these hateful bills? Isn't the state and church supposed to be kept separate?  I know corruption runs deep in the government but this is a violation of human rights and it feels like no one really cares. We haven't even done anything wrong. We just want to live comfortably in our skin. (edit: typo fix)"	"because fascism

how were states allowed to own human beings?

same answer.

this is who we are, this is in America's DNA
It will probably be ruled unconstitutional. Donate to the ACLU. They are fighting these bans in court.
A shorter answer is that if they weren't allowed to do the things that you think are wrong, minorities like the LGBT community would never have gotten rights in the first place.  Everyone thought being queer was evil, and it took a system that allowed the hated group to speak to get us to where we are.  In order for this system to work, we have to let people that disagree with the majority speak their opinion.  No one can draw a line and say that this bill isn't morally okay to present, because the laws of the government would be subject to the person gatekeeping the bills.  Basically, if you want democracy instead of being subjected to the morals of those in power, you have to deal with the people that you don't agree with.
First off, I'm trans, I absolutely agree that we should have the right to get medical assistance to change our body to fit our true gender.  Don't interpret what I say here as supporting anti trans legislature.  I'm simply answering your questions and explaining things from an objective viewpoint.

The law is not morality.  They are separate things altogether.  The law is a set of rules and procedures that we have agreed upon, and since you can never get unanimous agreement on complex matters, we have developed a system that we believe is the fairest way to decide these rules and procedures.  Why are the U.S. states allowed to do (insert action that is immoral from your perspective)?  Because the U.S. government isn't something that came into being naturally.  Humans had to create it and humans had to bicker over what is and isn't okay.  The laws we have were created by lawmakers that had differing opinions on how things should be run.

Why are the states allowed to have such radically different legislatures?  Because that's actually one of the fundamental definitions of our country.  Rather than have a country with an absolute ruler, we decided to break up power in many ways to avoid corrupted or insane people doing whatever they want.  One of the ways we decided to do this was to separate the country into small countries that have their own governing body so that the main government doesn't make all the decisions.  This is one of the fundamental things that makes us us, and is why we are called the ""united states of america"".  If you think about the name from an outsider's perspective, it sounds like a group of countries that all happen to exist on the continents of America.  We are not designed like most countries.  Mexico is a country in and of itself and it's government has total control over the whole country.  The United Kingdom is a kind of fusion between multiple countries that are governed by a larger power, but each do things differently.  We're similar to that.  You could see the difference between california and the federal government as being similar to the difference between scotland and the U.K. government.

On the separation of church and state:  This is misunderstood by most americans.  This phrase, like most phrases, boils down a very complex issue with many subtleties and shortens it to something everyone can understand the reference quickly.  This always causes a problem where the actual meaning is lost over time because people just hear the short phrase rather than the actual meaning of it.  The phrase refers to a line in the first amendment which does two things.  First, it protects religious freedom.  This is in response to the U.K. outlawing religions and punishing people for following whichever one the government doesn't like at the time.  It basically says that you can't be punished for being a muslim or whatever.  Believe whatever religion you want, the government isn't allowed to stop you.  The other thing it does is subtle and it's implications have always been debated.  It says that the government cannot pass laws that favor one religion over another or declare an official religion.  This sounds cut and dry until you realize that for the majority of citizens, at least in the past, religion and morality go hand in hand.  If you believe that theft is illegal because it is a sin, because you believe in the old testament, does that mean that you aren't allowed to voice your opinion?  Your belief in the difference between right and wrong are guided by your religion.  Does this mean that only atheists should be allowed to vote or speak publicly on matters of politics?  Obviously this is nonsense, so the true answer lies somewhere in between.  We must allow religious belief to have some effect on our laws, as the public's morality is guided by religious belief.  Where do we draw the line?  We still haven't figured that out yet.
Fascism and christian freaks, it's a shame
Remember that stacked supreme court...  I wouldn't bet on their moral or intellectual integrity as a body these days.
A well reasoned comment.
>Mexico is a country in and of itself and its government has total control over the whole country.

You should stop listening to stupid US propaganda. Mexico's official name is literally United States of Mexico, and it, like *a lot* of other countries, is divided into several administrative regions with their own separate laws.
yup
This is what I‚Äôm really scared of, the fight. It goes to the supreme court and we lose our rights, period. They‚Äôve already said they want to go after things like gay marriage, and that alone was concerning enough for Biden to work on the marriage equality act.
That's good to know, and I have looked into the history of Mexico now because luckily I don't get offended easily and I was able to look past your insult and educate myself.  I'm not sure what country or political group you are a part of, but please don't assume that just because someone hasn't come across the same information in their life as you have in your life is due to propaganda. I know things you don't just as you know things I don't.  This doesn't make me the enemy, it makes me a human, and all humans deserve respect until they show that they don't deserve it.  I'm obviously someone who cares about history and political structure, and just because I had a misunderstanding about one of the literally hundreds of countries in the world doesn't mean you should talk to me like I'm a mindless sheep.
Arkansas should be receiving a ruling soon on the ban on gender affirming care. Thus far, the ACLU has been successful getting the ban blocked. I‚Äôm sure Arkansas will appeal if the ruling does not favor their hateful efforts.
I know you are not my enemy, and I believe that you don't think you formed your opinion based on propaganda.

But also... as your specific example of a country that is inferior in that it isn't federal (you certainly did say being federal is superior, and for larger countries, I in fact absolutely agree with you), you chose *Mexico*. I don't need more than one hand to count the countries more villified by any Republican politician of your choice than that one.

Like, obviously, it's okay to not know the administrative structure of another country. Case in point: I had no idea the United States of Mexico were a federal country before today! The difference is, I didn't make baseless (as you said yourself) assumptions about a country I didn't know anything about.
Okay, this helps me understand your viewpoint better, but I'd like to say that I'm not Republican and I don't believe a Federal government is superior, I just have dived into the reasoning of why the U.S. was set up the way it is.  Just because I understand the reasoning doesn't mean I think it's the best way.  Actually, I have severe issues and the government basically abandoned me, so if I had the means to move to a country with a better healthcare system and survive until I gained citizenship, I would do it."	11tb715	trans	7	0.82	2023-03-17 00:16:05
