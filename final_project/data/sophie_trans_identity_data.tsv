i am being forced to detransition and i’m so scared	"for context, i’m a teenager and i’ve been out as trans (ftm) for 9 months. my parents are perhaps the least supportive parents i’ve ever met, but the situation at home was just about manageable until now. to give an example, they have contacted my school 6(?) times now to tell them not to respect my new name etc. and of course the school has ignored this as is their legal duty in the uk. they’ve taken away everything they can from me, including my phone which i haven’t seen since february and my money, but i’ve been coping until now.

recently, they told me they were taking me out of my school and sending me to an all girls catholic boarding school (where they assured me no one will accept my identity). they said they could not live with me anymore (i’m not a bad kid, i get straight 9s/As, have never gotten detention or even told off at school, and have never touched drugs alcohol or anything like that; my only downfall is that i’m trans). my school is like my safe space as it’s the only place where i’m safe to be me so i cannot bear to leave it - it’s like leaving home for me. so i asked them if there’s anything i could do to stay at my school and they said i’d have to detransition completely. i agreed.

so they wrote up a contract and made me sign it. i tried to attach a picture of it here but reddit doesn't let you do pictures and text so ill just summarise it:

i have to: 
- ""be known as"" my deadname with she/her pronouns (so telling my teachers and friends to call me by my deadname);
- ""dress as a girl, walk as a girl and generally present myself as a girl in all situations"";
- wear girls' uniform at school and wear a dress to prom;
- have a 2 month period of no social media access;
- ""avoid exposure to all LGBTQI+ materials in books and other media""
- ""discontinue all forms of breast compression"";

in return, i can:
- remain a student at my school
- be treated equally to my brother
- ""have use of a mobile telephone and sim card""
- sleep in my bedroom

(looking at it now, i dont actually get anything in return, i just get to keep the things i should have anyway)

so i signed it (because if i didn't i would lose everything i have) but now i'm really scared of how bad it will mess me up in the head. 

i'm scared i'll forget who i am (if that makes sense) and i'm scared i'll start (tw) self harming again as i did before i came out. i learnt to love myself when i was open about my gender and i am so scared i'll lose that. i don't know what on earth to do, i dont know how im going to go into school in girls' uniform in two days and how im meant to tell my teachers and friends to deadname me. 

i'm also just so so sick of them saying they're doing this because they want me to be happy and they care about me. it's borderline gaslighting i swear.

so i just have no idea what to do, either way i'll have to live as a girl and the thought of that makes me sick to my stomach. anyone have any advice?

TLDR: my parents are forcing me to detransition or else they will take away everything from me and move me to an all girls' catholic boarding school and i have no idea what to do."	"That ""contract"" won't mean anything, even if you're forced to sign it.
This is severe abuse. You do not deserve this. You should not have to accept it. Stay safe dude.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. I recommend talking with the school counselor about this, as it is a form of abuse. No kid should have to sign anything to be given equal treatment to their sibling and access to resources like money.
police  or social services ASAP    this is domestic abuse
What the actual fuck this totally is abuse and is not okay. As people above have said contact social services asap. If that feels scary maybe there is someone at your school who you feel able to approach about this?
Clearly your parents are more concerned with themselves rather than your happiness. Remember this when they need to go into a home.
I do not know your age, but consider if emancipation and moving out is an option you can consider. If you have friends whose parents might take you in, reach out. Your mental health is more important than following a straight path in life.

CONTRACTS SIGNED BY A MINOR ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING. you do not have to do anything your parents ask of you in this regard, and if you feel you are unsafe around them, reach out to the law or a nonprofit near you
This is abuse. Other comments have given you good advice. Be strong, brother. This too shall pass. We are rooting for you.
Get social services involved and fuck your parents, they are awful humans
This is illegal and child abuse
That's not borderline gaslighting, they are forcing you to gaslight yourself. That is absolutely abuse
I don't have anything to add that others here haven't I'm just wishing you well because your situation sounds absolutely horrible!
You’re being abused call the police.
Your parents' contract they compelled you to sign under threat of duress has ZERO legal authority and only has authority in their heads. They can point to it all they want and say you agreed... It makes no difference.

You can always come back out. But I for one don't think you should have to detransition (it wouldn't really be detransition, you are trans) to be supported by your own family. They are being cruel. They are not being decent it caring parents.

If you stop reading about LGBTQAI+ people we will not stop existing, you will not stop being trans. They can't change your truth. They can only force you not to live it under threat.

It shows that their position has no merit that they have to exercise force to get you to comply to it. This will NOT change who you are. This will only delay the inevitable and they cannot stop your friends at school from treating you as you are even if your parents try. They can send you to an all girls' school and you would be a boy at a girl's school. Trust me that they might *try* to convince you that your own sense of self is wrong, but you know who you are and that who you are is normal and healthy, not wrong.
They are absolutely evil and Child Protective Services is the best option.
You absolutely need to call the police or social services about this ASAFP
Hey, I’m sorry you are in this situation. 

If it helps at all, this “contract” they forced you to sign would not hold up in any court or by any lawyer. You are a minor, you signed it under duress, and they are only offering not to neglect you if you put yourself in unsafe situations. It is absolutely ridiculous and they are using it as a fear tactic to make you obey. 

In my opinion and read of the situation, this feels like a last ditch effort. The catholic school probably costs some money whereas the school doesn’t, so they want you to stay there. 

My advice in the meantime is to make a plan and survive. It sounds like you have a great support system at your school, so you might want to think about what you are willing to do to save that support system. Keep in mind, the catholic school could be alright, but we can make an informed guess that it probably wouldn’t be as good as your current school. 

If you can gain access to a phone, that would be great. If you can’t, find something that can take pictures, like a disposable camera or a Polaroid. I would set up a cloud account that you can upload things to quickly that has good security on it. Take pictures of the contract, if your parents make you sleep on the floor or outside your room- take pictures, try to get as much documented evidence of the abuse as possible to support your case. Record them if possible when talking about it, the more you have the better. 
Also- if you have access to them, take pictures of all of your important documents, like your birth record, it could help you if you have to escape. 

If you are over 16, look at online banking apps to open your own account or another secure money option like PayPal or Venmo. Then you could do some gig work around school to make money- think tutoring, painting peoples phone cases, etc. make sure your parents have no knowledge or access of this account or this money. 

When you go to get outside help, a counselor or support services in your area, present all of this evidence as emotional abuse. 

Finally, if there is a period where you have to “detransition” to survive, keep in mind you still have options. If you have great friends, you can ask them to bring your clothes to school and you can change in the morning and the afternoon to spend as little time as possible in feminine clothing. You can ask teachers and counselors to call you by your deadname and she/her pronouns only when your parents are present, as well as your friends. Some of my friends in similar situations had a lot of luck making a “nickname” that was something just really weird (think like: two, or forks, absolutely not gendered and just weird) and all the friends would call them that in public situations instead of the deadname. 

Remember, the key here is just to survive until you are an age that you can escape safely. This is not forever and will not be forever. I am so sorry you are in this situation, but you will make it through. Having a plan and knowing when it will end will help you overall. If you have thoughts of harming yourself, please contact someone in your support network to help you, you can even get some radios or come up with a signal to say that you need help. You will make it through, and you will always be trans, even if it isn’t safe to express it for a little bit. 

Sorry for the info dump, I just wanted you to have as much advice and support as you could. Good luck and please reach out if theres anything else I can do. I’m also coming from the US, so I don’t know all of the resources available in the UK, but I can research them if it would help you.
Ik everyone has said this already but this is the part where you get the police involved. Literally just plain abuse
Sleep in your bed? My dude where are they making you sleep now?!

Parents need to learn that its never too late to die alone...

> and how im meant to tell my teachers and friends to deadname me

Tell your teacher exactly that, ""my parents told me you have to deadname me or they'll take away my FUCKING BED.""

... You don't have to swear but just let them know that it's deadnaming and you're being forced to tell them to do it under threat of child abuse. The obvious thing to do there is to not go along with your parents insane demands and report them.
literally contact police this is child abuse
People have already said that but yes - your parents are abusing you and you must reach out for any help you can
Though there's next to nothing i can do, i'll offer what little consolation i can: no matter how much they try to stifle your identity, they cannot change who you are. even if you return to ""acting as a woman"" it won't be the same in the sense that you're still trans, you still know you're trans, and (depending on how you go about telling them to use your deadname) your school and friends will still know. even in such a dark place, try to cling to that knowledge, as it can act as a great source of hope, a sign that things can get better, because your parents can only hold their grip on your life for so long, but your identity will stay with you as long as you choose to keep it, even if it remains out of sight.  
P.S. if you ever need someone to talk to, my dms are always open, as are my ears.
That's not borderline gaslighting, they just do not care about you. Get far far away and if possible try to get your brother away from them too.
Any form of contact signed under duress is null and void
This is abuse, Call the police immediately, IMEDIATLEY
This is so heartbreaking to read. I hope you're situation gets better, it's hard not being able to do anything as a minor.
For a 1st, minors are not legally bound by contracts at least here in the US, and I imagine it's the same there.

2, this is definitely abuse. You deserve better. I'd try to get social services (or what you have there) involved so you can get out of there.
Do you get a copy of the contract? Because I you do then you have been given written proof of their abuse of you.
Straight up abuse, in every way here. If I were you I’d immediately start a conversation with an adult you feel safe with and start it off with “Help my parents are abusing me.” 

If you don’t know it, please find the hand sign for domestic abuse (flat hand, thumb to palm, close hand to fist)
You might be scared to do this, but there is no buts about it, your parents are highly abusive and you need to get out of that situation, especially before they threaten conversion therapy as you mentioned being in the uk.

If that doesn’t work, call social services or the police should you feel safe to do so.
This is definitely child abuse. Contact social services ASAP
While I agree with everyone that this is illegal and you should child services, if they can’t get you help quickly enough, or if that help is insufficient, you should absolutely lie to your parents. Have your male uniform in your case at school and change once you get there, go see your school's direction to use your deadname for official communications and anything your parents might see only. Don’t consider yourself bound to that contract, but try not to let them know you aren’t respecting it
This is some russian gulag shit.  Just try to contact social services and just try to hold strong in the mean time.
Dude, you can always be yourself here, be yourself everywhere you can safely, and get to a place where that can be yourself all the time as soon as you can.

I tried to force myself to be a man for 33 years, my true self remained, time cannot erase you, your biological parents cannot erase their son.
This is illegal and a hate crime. This is out right abuse by the hands of your parents.
Everyone else's advice will be and is far better than mine but if the- um- shit what is it- the onethings everyone is telling you to call doesn't work I guess tell your friends and teachers to just continue to call you by your preferred name but when around your parents go by your dead name?  I don't know I'm not good at advice but it is what I've been doing around my parents and dress moderately guy like? Sorry like I said horrible at giving advice-

Edit: SOCAIL SERVICES AND OR COPS YES THOSE ARE THE WORDS-
i’m sorry :( it’s gonna be okay !! one day you’ll be an adult and you can do whatever you want to <3
 Call social services ASAP, this is literally abuse and I am so sorry you have to go through it.
Take a pic of the contract and use it as evidence when suing them or telling child protective services U dont need to stop being U
This is straight up abuse, I would get somebody involved.
ewww my mom tried to do the same thing. typed up a form requiring me to drop the trans stuff until I move out, keep running track, and some other things. my father threatened to send me to military school (i’m mtf) i’m very sorry you have to deal with this ik it’s hard, and if able please don’t be afraid to seek out help if stuff gets to rough. hey maybe even convince them to let you see a therapist to help you with the trans “problem” just so you can have someone there for you (this is what I did at 15)
I don’t know your mental state but please PLEASE, just know there are people who care about you. If you need to talk to people about being trans or anything here are some resources for that. Just know you are valid and an awesome human <3

This is utterly cruel. I don’t understand how this can be legal.
Contact the police.

That is the only advice you should take here this is cold abuse, get out, get to the police tell them what's occurring and refuse under any circumstances to return to your parents care.
As others are saying please get cps involved and if you have a supportive family member or friend that is willing to take you in get in contact with however you can
Edit: also gather as much evidence you can like the contract or written letters from your school about your parents contact
You’re getting great advice already but as the genderqueer spouse of a trans woman and the stepparent of a trans boy, I just want to give you a big hug and say I’m so sorry. Please keep us posted if you can.
if you’re not 18 you legally cannot be held to that kind of thing.  also please, please contact social services.  other people have said this but that is ABSOLUTELY abuse and is absolutely unacceptable.  you deserve to live in a safe and affirming space and completely denying your identity in order to even be able to sleep in your own room should NEVER be a tradeoff.  i am so sorry this is happening but please, please reach out for help.
along with all the other comments about contacting authorities i would consider getting out of that house if you can. if any of your friends' parents are accepting of who you are and willing to take you in temporarily i would consider staying somewhere else for a bit. you have the best read on the situation though so if you feel it would worsen things or subject you to retaliation from your parents then obviously don't. i'm really sorry you have to go through this BS. if i could fight your parents i would lol
My god that's criminal. Are there any relatives you can get to who will help?  Start planning life far away from them for the moment you can escape or legally get out in your own. Ot may be slow, but it's something to stay focused on.
You are who you are. They cannot stop that and you will not forget it. When youre a teenager, each year feels like forever and it is relative to your life but you have many many years ahead of you. A few years of playing a character can get you through. Once youre able to leave them, you can be yourself with impunity.

When I was a teenager, i realized I could never tell my parents anything nor act on it. I started living a double life, one in my head and a fake one in real life. I never forgot who I was and only felt my gender dysphoria more acutely. I knew eventually I would become who I am. I did affirming hobbies and had affirming friends which were benign enough to keep under the radar. I saw life has one very long play that I had to always act in.

You are who you are on the inside and if you can internalize that, dysphoria can be staved off for a while. An extreme alternative would be seeking out trans support groups and abandoning your family but that path is a hard one.

Another alternative, you may be surprised by the catholic school. Most of the LGBTQA people I knew growing up had begun their schooling in catholic school. You may be able to find a new family amongst the other kids. Most parents have a similar thought of sending their child to a catholic boarding school for being any flavor of LGBTQA.

Stay strong. As they say, don't let the bastards get you down.
This isn’t a contract, it’s blackmail. « You won’t get equal treatment until you live by our terms ». Don’t worry too much about it being valid, no adult will take its « effects »  seriously. 

Parents acceptance shouldn’t be dependent on wether you’re a « good kid » or not. They’re suppose to fucking help you become your top self and be by your side *even if* you had shit grades and  smoked pot.  It’s the fucking job they signed up for when they decided to have children. Someone needs to remind them of that. 

I’m so sorry you have  to go through this. You shouldn’t have to. 

As I’ve not seen it mentioned yet, try to save copieS of the contract pictures on safe places. On cloud or Google drive, or email them to yourself on a secret address. Just in case your parent take away your phone for good or ask for your logins or whatever. If you can, you may do this of other forms of proof of abuse, document it. Even if you’re not sure it is abuse, it might be very helpful later. 

Stay strong, brother. Take care of yourself and your mental health.
My parents will literally kill Mr if they knew I'm mtf
It reminds me of my relationship with my religious parents... They literally forced me to wear female clothing and pierced my ears with as they said ""fEmALe EarRingS"" when I was already 19... I can't believe I let them treat me like that, but in my country (Ukraine) I couldn't even tell the police about it, cuz they would just laugh at me and wouldn't help at all.
I don't know much about the UK but I'm sure it's much better than Ukraine in terms of trans-rights, so I hope you'll find people to protect you (maybe some social workers or lgbt organisations). Stay strong ❤️
This is abuse, and their demands are completely unattainable! They'll just keep forcing you to be something you're not, until it kills you.

Hope you're getting some help with this, you don't deserve any of it, and your identity will always be what *you* want it to be, not whay other people are trying to force you to be. Don't let them break you down, you *will* make it out of this.
This makes my blood boil.
Hey man just checking in, hope you are doing okay 💗
Any contract signed by a minor is not legally binding.
Just call the police.
I will message you when I can to help you come up with a safety plan for the future.
Legally I don't even think that contract you signed is valid.

Conact legal support this is abuse. I would make sure you have copies of that so called contract and any other information that shows them mistreating you for trying to find yourself.

With worries of forgetting who you are, trust me if you're trans it'll resurface even if you have to tuck it away for now. The things you fear missing out on now you can always experience later (finding that out myself currently)

If you need a friend or homie to just vent to let me know, I am in a pretty cool community of lgbtq+ people from many walks of life. Also very minor friendly!
This hurts so much to read. I wish you the best! I’ve seen others recommend stuff better than I could. I hope you find safety! 💛
child abuse
I am soo sorry for what you are going through. This sounds like it has to be a form of abuse.
Report them to the police, that is child abuse! Especially Mentally!
Please contact social services, this is child abuse. They are abusing and discriminating against you especially with the ""be treated equally to my brother""
Nobody can ever tell you who you are. Trust your heart and follow your truth!
I hope you can find a way to escape their grasp and become who you want to be
Call the police, social services, or childline (0800 1111)
Maybe try contacting the traver project? (I don't know where you live exactly) or the police?
Seal out safeguarding at your school or contact social services. Please won’t care, but social services and your safeguarding will. 
-
It’s not bad to be trans, they’re the bad ones for not being able to accept that you are their son/child.
Call 911 or find the online number for social services in your area. Right now. Do not wait or things will get worse. They only thing I would wait for is getting your phone and money back. You may need it. There is no way that is a legal document so what you signed is equivalent to a birthday card.  I wouldn't run away but you may want to go somewhere slightly far away from your house and tell the police your location. If they are willing to go this far than they cannot be trusted.
steal your stuff back and run to child services. you are more important than their opinion. don’t ever live your life the way someone else wants you too
Talk to a school counselor about it and they can probably get something moving towards child abuse charges. This is obscene.
All I can do is say I feel so heavily for you. No one should have to go through that. It does get better though. When you hit 18 they can't tell you jack shit.  Continue to do well in school so you can get a scholarship and go somewhere far away where you can live as your authentic self.

BUT I do have an idea: any time they tell you they love you calmly reply ""no, you love who you want me to be"" and refuse to say I love you back. Yes, it is passive aggressive but it may get them to subconsciously do some self reflecting. Just a thought. Best of luck to you.
Everyone has already given you good advice, and they’re entirely right about the abuse. As for the “forgetting who you were” fear, maybe you can cope while this is happening by writing yourself another secret “contract” where you’re like “I am still *real name* and I will not give in to what my parents are forcing me to be”.
These people should be put in a mental ward that is just harmfully psychotic.
My serious advice 
Get out there. Call social services. Your parents are abusing you.
If you want to live as yourself you will need to go to the court to A get the custody for yourself, or B get the state to take custody for you. You will need help for that.

Your parants obviosly hate you, and they abuse you. They dont love you as they claim, they dont want your best.
Get out. Take custody for yourself or give it to the state.
Tell the social service you are hurting yourself and that it is because of you cant beeing yourself at home. Tell them you're at risk of suicide if this thought ever came to you. Tell them that you cant live with your parents.

And if you cant get out. FUCK THEM! Make their live to hell so much that they want you to go. Always tell them it is their fault. They to gaslight you? Gaslight them back, harder. Just break your so called ""Contract"" 
Because YOU WILL WIN. Time is on your side. You will win, and then you can live as you want. Let them know that you will be gone as soon as you can, forever, and that it is their very own fault. They will never be able to change you. It is your right to hate them. Go let them know that.

My not so serious advice, this is something i would do:
Ouh and if they made their threat true, and send you to the christian school. I think if you destroy some inventory and insult some teachers, they would soon kick you out again. Just tell them you won't stop until they kick you. I'm certain they happily will. If they won't kick you, just continue destroying their stuff and insulting their teachers and especionally the rector. This is a fight, they and your parents will lose.
what kinda of parent makes their kid sign a contract!?!?
Talk to your school about this. 

At this point your parents are forcing you to act and behave in a different way just to be treated the same as another child in their care, which is straight up emotional abuse. They're also denying you life-saving medical care, which is neglect. 

Emotional abuse and neglect are two forms of child abuse that are taken very seriously in many jurisdictions. Some places, if they're somewhat backwards, won't see denying transition care to children as neglect, but they *absolutely will* see what's happening as emotional abuse. 

I wish you the best of luck, man. You don't deserve this. You deserve to be loved and cared for, and to be able to be yourself. I hope you make it through this unscathed, and I hope your parents get to sit and think *real* fuckin' long and *real* fuckin' hard about how terrible they are. 🫂
I hate to just echo what everyone else is saying, but this is child abuse. Get help asap, please. You got this, man
Tell them to go fuck themselves and that their completely unenforcable 'contract' aint worth the paper and ink used to draft it. If they send you to the boarding school, the school could quite possible respect your gender, which at worst means you can freely live as yourself within it (which I know will be difficult given the environment) or ideally they wont even allow you to be admitted into the school because it is an all girls school. If they dont do one of those two things, they are literally breaking the law.
Best advice? Get kicked out of that school. Identify as a satanist to people and learn what people in the satanic temple do and do everything you can to be disruptive and distracting to them as possible. Teach them that you matter to you and their feelings do not matter. Take your identity by force.

The most important advice of all is to never once give any room to them. Never obey, and always resist. 

I was never trans but I resisted absolutely everything they tried to keep me in a religious hold and I not only endured the pain but I retaliated by giving everything they sent to me. And action they try to make on you deserves equal reaction from you.
Stay strong and be safe brother
You can't sign a legally binding contracts under the age of 18?? Tf??
I would advise you to be ready to disappear. You can do official emancipation stuff when you're in a safer place. You literally do not have to be present for this abuse. It shouldn't be your first choice per se, but a valid option when the adults in your life fail you with no other options.
Run away if you can. I had to run or die.
Do they have a video of you signing the contract if not you can argue that they forged your signature for The contract. So get a new signature with your new name not your dead name this only applies if you signed with your deadname
What in the actual fuck. Does emancipation exist in the UK? You need to run. Yesterday.
Unreal... I litterally teared up reading this.... your parents sound awful... you sound like a smart guy tho and trust me as someone who started transitioning at 29 you will never forget who you are. It's so awful you have to go through this especially when it seems you are doing great in life... I personally wouldn't be able to stay, i didn't talk to my dad for 4 years when I was 16 for waaaay less. Just remember that you have ALOT of life to live after school and your parents can't control you forever... I rlly hope things change for you 😢 ❤️ 💙 💜 💖
Reach out to a lawyer and seek emancipation from your parents. You are amazingly tough to have survived as long as you have. And UK law considers you an adult at 18, once you turn 18 you don't need to have these people in your life anymore.
Bro your parents are abusive!

Dude I'm so sorry
this is like the worst form of torture. wtf.
Honestly, OP, this is just abuse. I know it's late there in the UK, but I would tell any friends you deeply trust what's going on at home, and get a bug out plan in place. Your support network is your best bet to get through this, and that may include leaving home to live with someone you trust until you can get help. You may feel ashamed about what is happening, and I get that, but your number one priority needs to be your safety.
Since you're worried about forgetting yourself having to do all that shit. Think of it like you're cosplaying a character or playing a character like in a videogame. Also just try telling your friends/teachers/etc to just deadname you and use the wrong pronouns around your parents. Technically they don't HAVE to know unless someone tells on you. Also could keep binder or tape or a baggy shirt and some gym shorts in a locker or in a purse(I have a purse i carry around it looks small but can still fit a whole outfit plus like normal purse shit) or something so you can put it on when you're away from them then take it off before they see you again. Sounds like a lot of work but it is do able
Hey hope you see this, as you're in the UK if you're anywhere near Liverpool you should check out something called comics youth they offer all kinds of support for trans / LGBTQ+ . Reach out if you need anything your parents aren't end all be all of your life, you'll realize this more as you get older but you shouldn't need to suffer until you're able to stand on your own many people can help :)
Fuck up their lives too.
My thoughts on this...

Assess what you're willing to risk/reward and try to find the best balance of what you can get while being as true to yourself as you can, while not making your life an unbearable hell.

This ""contract"" is under duress. As you said, you gain nothing, just have basics returned to you that should already be yours. So, if you lie or otherwise betray your parents on this, I'd say you're morally in the clear. They have failed you and put you in a terrible predicament. Now it is about survival for you.

Best of luck. I hope they come around, but if not, things can be better even without them in time.
Document everything. And when you’re comfortable/old enough, report them. 

I promise, even if you do get sent away, you’ll never forget who you are (/pos). Being trans isn’t something you forget. From one trans guy to another, you’ve got this. Your community will always be here. <3
Can you file for emancipation?

Not an easy route, but you seem like you're going to go no contact ASAP anyway
Do you know anybody who’d be willing to take you in and possibly go to court and get custody of you? I had a friend do that with their aunt before in a similar situation. Her aunt got full custody and she was able to live how she wanted. It’s a hard and long process and you may loose things to get more in the end. It’s always your choice and it depends on how much more hurt you can take. It’s definitely something you should look into. You can also get emancipated as well!
I just wandered in off the front page of reddit, but I feel very moved by your story. 

I think you're very brave, as well as a hard worker, smart, and able to strategize to meet future goals. I think you'll do just fine in life if you rely on those skills. You also know how to ask for support and you express yourself well, likewise very handy skills. 

You won't forget who you are. There will be other people around you who don't forget who you are. You can ask them.

It gets better. You'll be able to choose who you are close to. You'll be free to float, and flounder around in the world like we all do, but without the restrictions.
Contracts are not legally binding if you're a minor.
I deleted my other advice cause i read better advices. 
Cause people are saying it's proof it's abusive which I already knew but I didn't know the law in the UK would consider forcing a teen to detransition an abuse. 
So call for help. 

If needed flee from your home. 

I'm really sorry and sad you have to struggle with this, my dear brother. 

*crossing fingers*
How old are you? It sounds like you can't leave them now, which is bad. I am from the Czech Republic, our country is not supportive to trans ppl at all, so parents here are always the one in power and you can't do anything about it. A lot of trans I know are secret until they hit legal age (here it's 18) so they move out, away from their parents and live as they want to.

If this is not an option and your school is supportive, try something like: in the morning put on a school girl uniform (a little show for your parents) and as soon as you get into school, change it.
I'm also sure you can talk about this with your principal so they might be able to still adress you as he/him with your new name in school And if your parents come around they would switch into the old ones.
I see two solutions here:
- First one is to check with child protective services with the help of your school. And try to get out of your family.
-Second option would be to wait until your 16-18 to move out so you can transition. I think both are pretty hard… 😥😥
Contact whatever child protective service you can using resources at school and gtfo, anywhere is better than there.
There is a lot of good advice here. I'm so sorry you're going through this. The other adults in your life can act on this. Hang in there man. 

I just want to also comment on how ridiculous these demands are.  The way you walk, really? I'm a cis woman and when I was a kid I refused to wear girl's clothes. Somehow they aren't putting together that if they have to force you to change everything about yourself with a contract *maybe this is who you are*!
No minor under 18 can be a signatory to a contract. And no contract signed under duress is binding. One of the worst things something like this can do to you is make you feel like you're a party to your own wounding, and it's an effect abusers often strive after. But you didn't have much of a choice and it's not your fault.
Okay, so from what you've said this is what I've gathered.
Your school is supportive; you're out to teachers and friends.
Your parents are treating you worse than your brother, this is implied in the 'contract' they had you sign
You don't currently have a phone, or a bedroom you can sleep in, even though your parents have the means to provide these things.
Your parents have willingly socially isolated you and want to do so further by moving school. 

What your parents are doing is abuse, I would say emotional and neglect. 
Please speak to someone at school. Is there a teacher who you know is particularly supportive (most schools have that one teacher all the queer kids flock to)? Do you have a friend you can stay with for a short while? Or a more supportive family member? Just until the school is able to sort out something more permanent. SHOW THEM THE CONTRACT. This is a key piece of evidence. They wrote it and it admits to anyone who reads it that they are abusing you.
I am truly sorry my dude. I really hope things get better for you. If you wanna message me to chat through things, feel free.
Call the police on them. I‘m serious. That’s child abuse and child neglect and they can go to jail for that. Do you have any family members you can stay at?
0808 801 0400   call here  its free or email  info@mermaidsuk.org.uk.
Move here in Finland. I take care of you. It hurts me to see you suffer like that. Your parents don’t deserve you.
I intend to write an actual response but until then I just wanted to say that being trans is not a ""downfall""

Now, may have meant that that's how your parents, and possibly others, perceive you and you are just explaining it to us in those terms.

I mention this in the fear that they have convinced you of this though their unempathetic, archaic treatment towards you. You are a victim of their abusive behavior and it does not make them right.

You will not be there forever. Being a teenager itself is a transitionary period in your life that we all go through but it ends and your adult life will begin. I can't promise your adult life won't have hard times, in fact it's likely but you will have a lot of choice in where you are, who you are around and you will be able mitigate, to a large extent, how much shit you have to put up with.

Stay strong and I promise it will ease up some. As they say, ""This too shall pass.""
please report your fucking parents
Accept averything they say but not without reminding them you will never forgive them
Do you have any friends you could stay with?
RUN!
This is illegal op- CALL THE FBI OR FIRE STATION SERVICES AND GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS AND RESPOND SONWE KNOW YOU ARE OKAY

You don't own anything.  Stop acting entitled.  Cell phones and your own room are not mandatory.  Just food water shelter and an education.
Asking people on Reddit is the last thing you need to be doing.
You are so young, and you have so many many years left here. Please try the best you can to have some perspective that your current situation is temporary. It will be OK either way I promise
I know fuck all about your country's laws and I can't give you any advice that haven't been already said but still wanted to share my support to you. Keep focusing on the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how far it may seem, no matter how dark the tunnel is, there's still hope in the end.
Fuuuuuck your parents
I'd fuck my parents up, but that's cause I haven't violent tendencies due to my anger, but try calling your version of the Jungedamt
I'm so sorry. Your parents sound like complete control freaks. Things will get better! Eventually you'll be free of them. It's good that you were exposed to this side of them because let me give a warning that they probably intend to control you and tell you what to do for the rest of your life.
Holy shit dude this is so awful-I agree with everyone who’s telling you to talk to social services, and I’m glad that you’re talking to your safeguarding team at school (your school sounds awesome and I’m so happy you’ve found a safe place there!). 

Good luck, my dude-we’re here if you need us 🏳️‍⚧️ 🫡
Fuck dude, I'm so sorry about everything that's happening to you. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me!
Fuck I am so sorry.  I really hope you get out of there sooner rather than later.  Your parents are huge fucking assholes.
Police or you equivalent of CPS.  
No middle mans, this ist much to important.  
Sadly UK is not in the EU anymore, that would give you some more leverage to overcome some issues I have read in other comments.
SEND. YOUR. PARENTS. TO. JAIL.
That is so fucked up. I'm so sorry your parents are being so horrible, bro. You should talk to your school counselor. My guidance counsellor literally saved my life when I was in high school and in the closet. Hopefully they can help you too. Also don't worry about the contract being legally binding; you're a minor and you were forced to sign it so it isn't. Stay strong, bro
🫂 don't worry. It'll all be okay, talk to the authorities or CPS or anything, they shouldn't control your life, it's horrible that trans people have to go through stuff like this and nobody deserves treatment like this. They can't control you forever, don't give up
I was raised in a Southern Evangelical Baptist home, with my grandfather being our preacher and running a church. I was put through conversion therapy.

What you're going through is abuse, but the issue to me on getting help is where you live. 

I live in a democratic state and desperately regret never reaching out and letting someone know who could help what was happening to me. In my state I would have been removed from my family. (Though from the words of friends and partners who were in foster care, that may or may not have been better. It really just depends on your social worker and the families you are placed with.)

However, if you currently live in a red state, an area that is republican, or a country that is conservative, I cannot recommend you contacting the authorities for your own safety and just to wait it out until you're 18 to move away (personally I moved out within 6 months of turning 18, though it was really hard, but being hungry and more poor than I can explain was better than my blood families home.) From support groups I've been in for survivors of conversion therapy I have really learned that in these areas you can't really ask for help because the law is in fact against you, or the people enforcing the law. 

This isn't to scare you, obviously my word isn't law, but I just have some friends who wished someone would have been honest with them when they were trying to escape their personal hells.

I know for one of my friends when their social worker came (they lived in Alabama) they literally told them to their face, at 14, that they couldn't understand why they (the social worker) was there because the child was ""clearly"" mentally unhinged for being queer.

Idk it's just really difficult and I know it's scary but I promise after 18 they really can't do shit to you.
You don't have to respect their made up contract as they leagaly can't hold you in court to it because I'm asumming you signed it under the age of 18 through forced circumstances. I hope your parents come to realise that no matter how you identify you are still the straight A loving and kind man that you deserve to be and I wish you the best in pushing through this tuff period and flourishing on the other side.
call fucking social services my man
This is actual conversion therapy which is outlawed in many countries (I think including the uk) you should call social services (or the uk equivalent)
this is abuse and i’m so fucking sorry you’re going through this. please call the police and get help. i promise this isn’t forever
This is not okay. I’m sorry you’re going through this. You deserve to live authentically and to be loved unconditionally by your parents.
When I first started transitioning, I didn’t say anything to my parents for months.(I’m MtF, but It should work as well for you.) I used to bring my fem clothes to school and then put them on. Remove them at the end of the day. They’re not here at school. They can’t do much if your school is supportive
This is 100% child abuse wtf. Your parents treat you worse than the USA government treats prisoners In Guantanamo bay
As you are in the UK same as me best advice i can give you is to either:

 A. Go to your local authorities website and contact child protective services on the phone number there 

B. Phone the police (provided that your father or mother is not a high ranking officer outside of the metropolitan police service)

C. Go down to your local police station and report it in person

Even in terms of here some of what they are doing is considered abuse (not all unfortunately thanks to the prat who has never seen a hairbrush) but hopefully they should be able to help you.

And lastly never stop being yourself and........... im not allowed to advocate violence against others on reddit so please dont let them pressure you into violence against yourself, i know it helps at the worst points but its not worth it. 

This older Sis doesnt do hugs often but *hugs you* best of luck Bro
[deleted]
Call the fucking police. Now. This is child abuse.
RemindMe! 7 days
Holy fucking shit your family is insane :(
Make sure you have a copy of that contract. I'm sure social services and the police will enjoy reading it. I hate to tell you this but you may need to turn in your parents for child abuse. Not good. What will you do without them? This is abuse and it needs to stop.
Dude find a friend or a supportive family member and go. your happiness and comfort  is the most important thing
If my parents ever treated me the way your treat you, i would run away so fast. Im already at my breaking point. Im surprised you’ve held on that long to your parents. I dont condone running away, but if you would feel safer away from the, contact the police or social services. The uk has given leagal rights to trans peoples, so you should be ok if you contact law enforcement. Gl with your situation, i hope it gets better 🫶💛☺️
Could you stay with a friends house? Call CFS or CPS. This is how kids end up hurting themselves. They feel trapped and feel there is no way out.
Pretend as long as you can do get as much of your stuff as possible and then run.
I'm sorry you are going through this.
Hugs if you need them.
Stay strong you can survive this.
I'm so Sorry!!  I dk what to say but if I can help lmk
I'm so Sorry!!  I dk what to say but if I can help lmk
Shred the contract, find a couch to surf, jump ship. If they can't live with you then, and I can't stress this enough, __GET. THE. FUCK. OUT.__

They clearly don't want you there anyway, fuck em, they'll survive.
I’m sorry you’re going through this but luckily I had strict parents so I can maybe tell you something’s I did under their roof for a bit with out them knowing I packed what o wanted to wear in my bag and would take it to school and change in the morning in the restroom and after school do the same thing if you have lockers perfect put them in there just in case they check your bag like mine did. Tell friends and staff to deadname you only to your parents they won’t know other wise I can’t think of anymore but if you need help I’m sure I can remember something’s
I really hate to say this especially having been in the system but comparatively at this point you're better off in foster care or a teen residential unit which are lgbt affirming. These 'parents' are going to end up pushing you over the edge and you'll end up 6 ft under I also don't care your dad is a lawyer if you're under 18 you cant sign a legally binding contract period. That 'contract' is as useful to them as the toilet paper on the toilet roll holder. To you however it's evidence of abuse against you. 
Please go no contact as soon as you can.
Would the catholic school even take you? Not that that’s any kind of option. I don’t know how old you are but I would think it might be easier to cut them
Off when you turn 18 at a boarding school. It’s not like it’s a legally binding contract. 

Let me add that I hope you get help to stay safe and free from this abuse. Our local school has been surprisingly positive towards the trans students, though not all the students are. 

Sending positive vibes your way.
>sleep in my bedroom

Are your parents not letting you sleep in your own room? If so, are they allowing you to sleep on an actual bed? Idk what child protection laws we have in the UK (ive never needed them, fortunately), but there must be some laws that should protect you
Don't really have anything to add that others haven't already said so I'll just go ahead and say this: They don't care about your happiness but you will get to live as the man you are so stay strong brother!
I’m so sorry. I’d try to talk to someone cuz this should be considered abuse. Talk to your counselor contact someone who could help. I’d link some resources or give some names but I don’t live in the UK. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you get out of their ASAP. I just what you know something- there is nothing wrong with you. You’re normal. Things will get better, you’re loved and always will be accepted here. Your parents are abnormal fucking pricks. I wish you the best of luck 🖤🖤
I'm the worst person for help about things like this but holy fuck, that is abuse and I really really hope you can get away from the pieces of shit you call your parents, what the ever living fuck is wrong with them

I really hope it gets better and this community will always have support for you <33
That’s horrifying. I hope one day you leave them behind and they wonder why you don’t want to see them again and you pull out the contract and then burn it in front of them.

And then you go live a life as yourself.
Gonna be honest, if this happened to me, I'd run away. Fuck your parents. They have no right to be considered as such.

I really hate advising as such, and it won't be without it's own challenges, but you aren't safe under their roof.

There may be resources you can reach out to that won't have you return to them, but I wouldn't spend another moment in that false home.
Here where I live you are taken away from your parents in an abusive situation such as this. I'd reccomend getting a school counsellor to contact CPS/community services to get you extracted from your home & put in a more supportive environment.

Oh my god that sounds absolutely nightmarish. Your parents are fucked up evil people and they are *absolutely* gaslighting you. They don't get to decide who you are or what's best for you, let alone threaten to isolate you and outright abuse you if you don't comply. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Here's a hug if wanted 🫂🫂🫂
Bro i'm so so sorry.

There are some folks in the comments with practical advice. I don't have much. I guess I just want to validate that involving state agencies (like child services) can involve a ton of uncertainty. It might be a little while before things feel settled. So make sure that you're also activating personal supports at the same time as you're figuring out logistics.

Your health and safety is top priority, and mental health \*is\* health. Think about who is in your corner at school, and make a plan for how you're going to loop them in to the /u/Fulled_ advocacy team on the first day you're back at school next week. (It wouldn't hurt to set up some emergency housing situations too, if you haven't already. Which friends could you stay with? How would you get there? Will their parents understand the gravity of the situation?)

You sound like a really good guy. /r/trans is sending you solidarity and support from afar. No matter how things land next week, a kinder future is awaiting you. That being said, I hope that very very soon your parents don't have the power to mess with you like this.
Your parents did the exact same thing my mom is doing. It’s been 4 years, I’m 16 now, 2 more years ro go. 4 years after they made me sign their contract, which was chillingly identical to yours, I can dress and act the way I want. Mom has made me grow out my hair for the past year, before that I just cut it myself. When I do express myself though my mom makes pissy and perverted comments on how I should show off my tits. 

Contracts signed by a minor are not legally binding. Just try to please your parents when you’re around them, and do what you want otherwise. You can dm me for more advice.
Get authorities involved asap. Good luck dude
Hhjf
Contact social services. Talk to your school. I went through similar and it helped. I hope things improve. This is abuse you really need to get some sort of authority involved
You are who you are, you won’t forget it. Other people on this thread have suggested many methods of seeking support, so I won’t reiterate them. What I will say is that, in the awful situation where nothing works and you’re forced to present as female, in the end, it won’t change who you are. Using your deadname will be uncomfortable, maybe even traumatic and damaging to your mental health, but it won’t and can’t erase who you truly are. You are you. And though times may be hard, and you may face intolerable cruelty and prejudice, know that your are loved brother, and that your allies are out there and you only need to preserve until you’re free to find them. Stay strong and be brave xxx
On top of the obligatory this not okay or legal, I feel you might also benefit from r/momforaminute 

❤️❤️❤️
This is actually how my grandmother would act if i came out to her. 

she is also unsupportive and homophobic. (I Literally heard her say transgender females are men who want to be women. so you're not alone.)
The best part of this is that you get to disown them with zero regrets at 18 and whatever your last words are to them will stick with them for the rest of their lives and they *will* fixate on them. You, however, get to move on and will only become happier the farther you get from now. It'll only get better. You got a while to think up those final words to them, too. You get to make it extra biting.

Best of luck, friend. Stay safe primarily. Personal happiness and emotional revenge later. 👍
also i would run away the night before i had to go
Other people already mentioned to contact social services and try to get out there asap. I don't know how these things are handled in uk, so i don't want to give you bad advice. But if there's a possibility of getting out there, without making your situation worse, please consider it. What your parents are doing is straight up abuse.

Besides that, i don't really know what advice i can give you. I'm not at all familiar with situations like that.

Do you see the possibility to ask your friends (and maybe your teachers, but that seems risky to me) to keep using your name and pronouns, without your parents knowing? Could you maybe find spaces where you can present as you, without your parents knowing?

I wish you only the best and if you feel that it could help you, you're welcome to contact me. I don't know how much help i am, but i can listen and try my best :)
Ok this may seem harsh but I recommend u carry on transitioning as u are and play chicken against them if they take away stuff such as a bed or food or anything like that immediately go to legal services such as police as that is child abuse and if the literal child is going to it then they will have to do something, u said u lived in the UK have u tried childline?
Go to the police and safeguarding team of your school. It’s your parents responsibility to care and look after you. This is abuse and they’re restricting your rights as a person. No matter who you want to identify as you are their child and they should love you no matter what. 

I hope you get the help you need to stop your parents being like this mate. Try to keep your chin up and get your voice heard
that is one of the most horrible things I have ever read
Quote from Wikipedia regarding English contract law (assuming OP is from the United Kingdom and is underage)

**”**Unconscionable agreements can be escaped where a person was under duress or undue influence or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people, and companies whose representatives are acting wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity to make a decision to enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when they have given their informed and true consent to a contract.**”**
This hurts my heart to read this. 😭
as others said this is literally textbook definition of abuse. keep those photos of the contract. speak to professionals on this matter as others suggested and present proof through said images.
Divorcing one's parents so you can leave before you are 16 and still get support is a thing or was 25yrs ago in the UK. I am so sorry this is happening to you and once you can leave never look back or talk to these abusive assholes again. 

You will always be trans they can't take that away from you even if you walk about in your agab clothing with no meds and your deadname - that isn't you. Just the same as I am still nonbinary and haven't changed anything about my presentation (apart from smiling more) since realising. Too bad for them that gender doesn't equal presentation and no one decides your gender but you.

Living on Terf island is bollocks, isn't it :(
Run away, u gonna let ur mom and dad tell you how to live? Take as much money as you can from them, run away, and never talk to them again. If they call the cops act like they abuse the fuck out of u
dude i will fight your parents
They made you sign a contract under duress, and you're too young to be held liable to a contract anyways (unless it's different there) What your parents are doing is abuse. 

I assume Boarding Schools probably had/has a different definition before Colonialists brought the concept to the Americas, but in America and Canada* Boarding Schools were Concentration Camps. *Called Residential Schools in Canada. They abused whoever they could, but they systematically erased or eradicated Native Queers in particular.

Do you have any other family members that you can live with or talk to? Preferably ones more sane and accepting? Anyone in your family that isn't transphobic would probably give your parents an earful, if not a shit kicking. Maybe family leverage can fix or alleviate your issue.
Bro just leave.
Yeah it will be horrific but you’ve got to reach out to social services. I mean- it can’t get worse? My god. I’m not trans but my 19 yo son is, and I cannot imagine ever treating him like this. I’m in the US, I can’t do much but I’m your mom if u need me any goddamn time. Here for you.
This is literally domestic abuse. That contract doesn’t mean anything in the eyes of the law. If I were you I’d call social services on them. The ‘borderline gaslighting’ is literally just gaslighting. They’re discriminating against you and abusing you which last I checked was illegal. You really need to call someone who can take you out of that hell. Please stay safe brother ❤️
Man fuck your parents.  Fuck that makes me so mad.
I'm sorry but fuck that/them. Sorry for how they're treating you.
Are there any counsellors at your school that you can talk to?  
You need a respectful adult to intervene here because this is starting to sound a lot like child abuse.  
I hope things get better for you, man.  
Good luck <3
perhaps try contacting social services or 101/999 police, to get you out of that house and out of your parents control. this is child abuse. i believe i have various helpline numbers i picked up at my local pride which may be of use to you, i will list them in reply
so id say tell your school about the situation you’re in, and ask them what they think you should do. your parents suck, man.
This is family violence. Have you thought about making a report to police or your local child protection service?
You should call the UK version of child protective services. I know it might be scarey, but you are not safe.
If you don’t mind me asking, how old are you? I’m pretty sure the UK is the same as Australia so by the time you’re 16 your parents can’t force you to do anything.
That is absolutely fucking awful. Your parents should be ashamed and absolutely should not be parents. I am very sorry you have to deal with them.
This broke my heart. I wish I could take you out of this situation. This is so inhumane.
If you have dysphoria, ask your parents to see therapists who can treat it. Your clothes, after all, do not define who you are. Even if you have to wear ""girl"" stuff (though there's no such thing), it's gonna be fine if you get help to treat your mind about it. 
You parents may be right in thinking it's to early to make such a big life decision. Your truth is inside, just know who you are. You're not your clothes, accessories, hair, etc.
Dude, just tell ur friends and everyone in your area that is supportive. This is just straight up abuse.
Its not alright. At all. 
Even call the police or something idk if there is an associaton for minor protection somewhere where you live but do search on that as well.

They are not treating you like their child even.
To be honest, I think that at this point, I wouldnt show any sympathy to them in your place.
Those wouldnt be my parents anymore.
Just the two people that gave birth to me.
Same happened with my dad and my dad didnt do as much as yours and I still dont give a shit about him.

Anyways, dawg, this aint alright.
They also are incredibly dumb to think that going to a catholic all girls school will brainwash you lol
Lots of great advice here OP, you DO need to take this seriously and get help. In the meantime, you need to immediately start preparing to remove yourself from this home environment-move in with a friend or supportive family member, save money/move it somewhere your parents don’t have access, etc.

Detransitioning must feel huge and overwhelming. From what you’ve said here, you need to appear to “conform” to protect your safety. If it helps you, perhaps pretend that you are a secret agent on a mission, you’re working undercover and that work requires you to pose as a girl. It’s a role you’re perfectly suited for because only you know best how to put on the facade of being your “deadself”. It’s a short term solution, to be sure, but perhaps it can help you to stay calm and collected while you figure out your plan. Wishing you the best of luck and much support.
I’m being completely serious when I say: foster care
OP this sounds like some cult shit and is actually abuse. Contact child protective services immediately. Rebel against the stupid contract any chance you're not near your parents. Explain everything that's happening to the people you know you can trust. You have to reach out to authorities. If you can get rid or your sick parents, you can get your life back.
Just want to say I hope everything works out for you. You're so strong for getting as far as you have and asking for help. Keep pulling through. I hope you're able to find more supportive guardians.
Contact your current school ASAP and tell them everything. Show them the ""contract"" they're coercing you to sign. This is child abuse.

I'm so sorry this is happening. *Hugs*
check out the Rainbow Railroad. they help remove and relocate persecuted LGBTQIA+ folks!
Contact social services as this is abuse and inform the school you have rights and that contact would not stand in any court! There is help out there
Bruh, you think they send princesses to all girls catholic boarding school? Isn’t that like bad girls away camp? Call their bluff and I bet you’ll have the time of your life at that school if you keep being yourself.
Look my guy, I think that you should tell someone... and if they try to send you there, try staying with one of your friends. Your parents are sick bastards if they force you to be someone that they know will just harm you. I hope you stay safe. I honestly have no words for this... just stay safe, man.
When you're going through hell, keep going! I can't imagine how scared, uncertain, and angry you are right now, but I promise it won't last forever. My dude, eventually you will get to be exactly who you are and love the life you deserve. I'm sorry you're going through this, but just always remember that it is only temporary. Much love my brother.
Fuck your parents, if you need to talk my dms are open, i also have religious transphobic parents so i can relate
Give them an ultimatum. You tell them that they either accept their son or they lose you. If they truly care about you, they’ll try to reason. If not, run, or just power through it. You are the master of your fate, not them. If you want to be a man, you’ll bloody well be one, even if it means breaking your parents’ rules. If you have any family that accepts you, go there. Also, threatening to put them in a shady retirement home rather than taking care of them when the time comes seemed to work for my parents
Call cps. If you can’t, email them, or something. Check their website (whatever the UK equivalent is). Find and reach out to as many hotlines as possible. 
As everyone else here has pointed out, this is basically in breach of human rights at this point. Your best hope is basically to either get as far away as possible from your parents or to get enough protection that they can’t possibly touch you. Change is hard, and this is about as rough as it could get. But I think most people here have read enough transphobe horror stories to know you’ll be safer without them. 

I wish you the best of luck. Stay safe, stay prepared, stay positive in any way you can. 

Above all, remember that you know yourself (and your gender) better than anyone else. Don’t let your parents tell you who you are.
if you want to go scorched earth and lose any relationship with your parents, try finding an LGBTQ+ lawyer (barrister?), see if you can sue to force them to pay to provide your basic needs while you live on your own, at least until youre a legal adult.
I'm not one to tell people to break the rules and sorry for the cussing being said but this is absolute bullshit!! If you are able to, try and keep your male uniform \[if you wear those\] and bind in different ways and just change when you get to school and before you leave school. And also just let them know to deadname and misgender you around your parents. And also call CPS since this is abuse. They can't do shit like that and get away with it. I was changed to Catholic homeschooling after coming out and lost all devices but my computer but, this is terrible! Please find a way to get out of that hell-hole and PLEASE don't sh. I know it will be tempting but you will get though this. You are a strong man and will always be a man.
I am so sorry :/
Be strong dude, you will get through this!
That contract doesn't mean anything legally, and this is probably child abuse too. Are you close to turning 18? If so, maybe you could hold out
Surely you can seek legal advice on this, there would have to be a lawyer that would jump at the opportunity
I’m so sorry you have to put up with that. I wish you the best and I truly hope it gets better. If it helps, just know that I understand what you’re going through and I give you my support 💖 I wish I could provide advice but I’m not one to do that. All I can say is everything is gonna get better, no matter how scary it is now.
How old are you? IDK what the age for this in the UK is, but look into emancipation. Your parents need to lose legal guardianship of you.
I would like to inform you that what is happening here is illegal and your parents are committing a crime. If I were you, I would contact child protective services and possibly the police if anything escalates.
fyi, contracts other than an nda (required to be 13-14 years idr) are not legally binding if signed by a minor. contracts are not above the law and laws broken with in a contract are still subjugated to consequences. just a tidbit of information. what your parents are saying is utter bs, and has no real consequences. This is just a scare tactic from your parents to try to scare you into detransitioning. 

Just keep in mind, KEEP YOURSELF SAFE. CONVERSION THERAPY IN THE UK FOR GENDER IDENTITY HAS STILL NOT BEEN OUTLAWED. If you can, see the signs if they intend to send you to one, and run if necessary. They might forcefully try to get you to attend on of these camps or ""discipline"" you by sending you to military school or those ""training/rehabilitation"" centers.
You are experiencing literal hell. Try to keep as much evidence of your abuse as possible. The 
“contract” they are making you sign is not at all legally binding and cannot be legally or ethically enforced. Try to make and keep as much money as you can so that you can get out of there the moment you turn 18. I’m so sorry you must endure such abuse.
They don't let you sleep in your room? Where do you sleep?
I'm sorry to say that but in this case the only thing possible to do is to have trusted adults (other family members, counselors, teachers, friendly neighbour etc.) and tell them how your parents treat you, what they make you do, how it makes you miserable and suicidal. It might end up being the case that you'll need to inform authorities about the abuse and hope that some trustworthy adult will try to help you and take care of you. I'm so sorry you're being treated like that, I can't imagine how much pain it brings you. I might be wrong, but I really don't thing there's a better option than informing authorities and hope for the best outcome and get supportive adults on your side.
You don’t have to follow this contract. What, they’ll sue you?
Listen, it’s never a “downfall” to be trans. The greatest thing you can possibly be is yourself.
This hurts my heart so much. I can't imagine refusing to love my child regardless of who they were or how they presented. You sound like such a great person who is doing everything ""right."" Smart and kind and good. I can't believe they're taking you for granted. 

If you are worried about living the lie and  losing yourself, just think of people all throughout history like Anne Frank who had to hide their true feelings, religions, or identities. Brave people have always had to do difficult things to survive. Your survival is key here, and it won't be too long before you are an adult and free to be you on your own terms. You shouldn't have to live the lie, and I'm so sorry you are in this situation at all, but if you can stay strong just a little while longer, you can be free and carry on when so many others, like Frank, weren't able to. You can be a silent warrior. You can survive. You can protect others like you wherever you go in these trying times. You can be a hero. You are not alone. Welcome to the resistance.
I am so sorry you have to face this situation at a very young age. We can’t do anything about this situation since you are a minor. Maybe start a gofundme incase you ended up being homeless. I would love to support you a little
Everyone has talked about the legal stuff, the abuse stuff, etc, and I'm sorry you are going through that. But this is what struck me the most:

>i'm scared i'll forget who i am

You won't forget who you are. We all wear masks and change them constantly, pretty much our whole lives. I'm 44 and have never questioned my gender or sexuality, but I still pretend to be someone else a lot of the time. Yours is a bigger burden than most because it is at the core of your identity and you are probably at an age where you are just starting to form your core identity. It is an incredibly rough time even if you aren't dealing with the issues you are. This absolutely fucking sucks, but you can also absolutely get through it. It will get better. There are people out there who will support you.  It is very hard that your family doesn't. It's possibly the worst betrayal. But you can find a new family.
they wouldn't know if you are not wearing girl's attires in school if the teachers and your classmates are willing to help you. you could go to school with another set of clothes and your binder and change into it. The same thing could apply to your name and pronouns. I have never been to a prom as schools here where I live generally don't have that tradition, but i would think prom can work the same way. After you got your phone back, you could try to contact abuse prevention services and get help from your friends. 

rules are only ink on paper. If you don't follow them, they don't exist.
Ok.... so I don't know about the transition thing so I won't speak to that.... but I'd like to offer a bit of advice about your self harm. 

Since you've felt seen and known,  you were able to stop self harming.  That tells me deep in your heart you don't want to hurt yourself.  It also tells me that you have the self control to not do it.  I just want you to know I have confidence that you're strong enough not to go back to it.  

As you get older,  you're going to learn that no matter what,  you are incredibly valuable.  You. Yep, you, right now.  Because of who you are inside.  And you're going to learn that whatever state your body is in,  it's here for your good.  It is an incredibly powerful thing that supports you and who you are. 

All that to say.... treat your body with care. Harming it will mess with your head.  Your body is doing its best to support you.  Help it do that by not harming yourself.  Self harm often brings regret later.  Self care is always the right thing to do.  

I wish you the best and also hope you can come to a mutual understanding with your parents.
Stay true to who you are. Fuck the parents, stay sovereign in your heart space, you are the Christ.
Stars, OP stay safe. Never forget who YOU are during this. Hold onto him tightly. You'll need him when you are happy again.

Keep us updated somehow if you can. I want to know that you're safe...
You should give it some time tbh.
This is heartbreaking and I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this. I don’t know how’s the laws in the uk work, but I do know it is a big world out there. Much bigger than the dungeon in your head your parents are trapping you in. 

Stay strong, brother. One day you will be free to live your life as you please.
i wish you luck, bro
Is there a way to act like you’ve detransitioned at school? Have your teachers use different pronouns around your parents, and hide your clothes/binder in your backpack?

I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. Try to hold on until you can get out of there. Get CPS involved if you feel safe enough to do so. It’ll be ok, brother.
This will probably get lost amongst the other comments: the advice about child protective services is good. Something you may want to consider, though, is telling your parents that they are destroying your relationship with them. You can give in now, but when you move out, they won’t have a child willing to have anything to do with them. 

That might make them want you to leave now, or it might make them reconsider what their goals are in all of this. It’s just another option to consider, especially if CPS mediates a conversation between you and them.
Go to school take the signed ""agreement"" or a photo of it with you. Also show them this post. Ask them to contact child protective services and the police for you.

This is straight up child abuse.
I hope your parents enjoy controlling your gender now because I doubt they'll see you again at 18. Spare yourself and gtfo.
Please contact cps immediately. Tell them what happened, what they demand of you and show them the contract. This is severely abusive and fucked up on so many levels. Op I'm so sorry you're going through this, it's absolutely awful. 
CPS might be able to place you at a protection shelter for LGBTQ+ youth or at the very least become your legal guardian so your parents have no say anymore which school you visit or anything like that
That’s super fucked, I’m sorry, I hope your able to get out asap!
i have a spare bedroom here in brazil in case you need to run away :( your parents do not sound nice, to say the least. much strenght to you, brother. you'll always have us here in transddit supporting you 💙 (love, a mtf girl who had to leave her parents house at 16 y/o and still everything worked out in the end <3 don't lose hope!)
This is child abuse
Please call the police. I’m so sorry man
Please call the police
Babe trans it's not downfall, it's who u are
Just remember, no matter what you will soon be in full command of your life, just a few more years. Not saying don't fight for your rights now, certainly do. But whatever the outcome of that you will ultimately win.
At that point seek help it's that bad
I'm not familiar with uk laws, but not being allowed to sleep in your bedroom?? Is this some harry potter level abuse shit??? Good luck dude, this is terrible...
idk if it's just me being a stupid fucking edgelord but tbh i would fight back, whether it's subtly hiding or outright being violent


not saying you should, if anything you should stay safe and tell another adult
Just FYI, the contract isn’t legal or binding. 

I’m not a lawyer, but this is not possibly a real or enforceable contract. You seem to be worrying about it, but it’s just words on paper, nothing more. I’m not even sure you’re old enough to enter one. And your parents can’t ask these things of you regardless.
Try to ask for counseling/psychotherapy from a professional you can both agree upon. I realize this isn’t exactly accessible to every family.       
       
Self harm is not something that should be easily dismissed, regardless of how you cope with it. The fact is that many people struggle either less, the same, or even more, and don’t self harm.         
       
Worst case scenario you trade expression for practical essentials/comforts and receive professional help to manage your emotions. Im assuming you don’t have to live with or by your parents forever.        
Many children don’t gain opportunities to express themselves cis or trans. That’s actually the norm for being a teenager. You shouldn’t strive to peak in high school but instead your adulthood.
A contract signed under duress is not valid.  
It's literally just your parents saying ""do this, or else"" but on paper.  
It's fucked up, and I'm sorry your parents can't accept you.
my guy that is literal abuse. if they’re abusing you over that, they dont deserve you, not one bit. just reading this made me PISSED, that people have the AUDACITY TO REJECT THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR WHO THEY WANT TO BE. IT JUST BHVJHFJG&DJYFVJYGVKHFDNFDJGFDJGFSJGFCKJGVLJHGKHGDJHFDAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Call the fucking police
1)Phone your local council and speak to the social service department they will look into getting you somewhere safe if need be (2) if things get really bad please phone or email childline 08001111 and they will try and put you in touch with people who can help you
Save up money, go work summer jobs, MAKE SURE YOUR PARENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE ACCOUNT THE MONEY IS IN, look for flats you can move in perhaps with a roommate and tge day you turn 18 pack your things and leave
Could you inform your teachers that your situation at home is abusive, and you want them to call you by your preferred name, but they'll have to use your birth name on all paperwork and when speaking to your parents? 
Do you have friends you can trust to keep referring to you correctly when you're away from your parents?
Is there a place at school like a locker where you can keep a binder or alternative clothes?

This sounds like a truly horrible situation. Are there other family members like grandparents that are supportive who you could stay with? Or a friend whose parents would be willing to take you in?

No matter what, please put your safety first. Try to find yourself a support system whether it be friends at school or groups online (when you do have access). I would advise having minimal contact with your parents (speak to them when spoke to or if you need something from them, but not to go out of your way to interact with them) as much as you can get away with doing that. You don't want to upset them because it will just harm you further. 

You won't forget who you are. You are completely valid, and your parents are wrong. If you feel yourself going through a hard time mentally, there are crisis limes for lgbt people you can call and text (I think they vary by country, and I'm not sure which ones are in the UK). And remember that this is temporary. You will be able to be yourself freely. It will happen, it's just going to be difficult to get there.
Isnt this abuse
Get copies of the ""contract"". Bring a few to school and tell your guidance counselors. This is absolutely abuse, and you absolutely need adult intervention,  because your parents are endangering your safety and well-being.
You might want to talk to a councilor or someone you trust at your current school. Or maybe at a government organisations, maybe a local lgbtqia support group can point you in the right direction, also considering finding someone in the government that isn't biased against you. This is a very scary step but the way you family is treating you is at a point that is clearly abusive.
I don’t think I have anything else that hasn’t already been said by others in the comments, but I’ll leave this here to let you know that you deserve better and are valid 💛
Brother, this is abuse. You are being abused. You are In danger, and I understand that you need to focus on your survival. Document everything, upload what you can to a separate Google cloud. Contact charities based around LGBTQ issues. Find help online, lord knows I can't give it. You are being abused. You did nothing wrong. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Please. Stay safe, don't cut contact with people you trust. If you have pocket money get to Tesco, buy a cheap ass burner phone and a PAYG sim card. And keep it secret. You can get tiny ones. That's your backup. Stay safe. You did nothing wrong.
This is abuse. Ask for help from school.
https://www.childline.org.uk
This is fucking evil and abuse. Obviously getting away from the situation is best bet, many a relative? 

There are good charities that will be able to give you the best advice: Stonewall and The Trevor Project spring to mind, also citizens advice for any legal stuff like emancipation.
I just wanna talk to them


*racks shotgun*


I just wanna talk to them
I can’t do much but you have to knows that there allways gonna be sommone in the community for you and one day you’r gonna be release of that shit just don’t loose fate
Bro, this is illegal here.  Contact the police or social services **now**.  End this asap.  

File for Emancipation.  Details here: https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/in-the-home/moving-out/
or at least threaten to if they keep this shit up.

Are they christian?  If so: **1 Timothy 5:8** *""But those who won’t care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers.""* and this link: https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people

Contracts signed by kids aren't binding and especially not contracts signed under duress.  Don't let them hold this contract over you, you know full well you don't agree with it's wording, your signature means nothing on that worthless piece of paper.
That ""contract"" is not legal. Your parents cannot say ""we'll give you these basic rights which we already need to give to you if you sign this paper"" plus the fact that you are forced to sign it also invalidates it
can i suggest that you tell your friends and teachers about the situation? they will help give advice, especially the teachers, and support better than us strangers on the internet. they could call you by your chosen name and pronouns when you’re at school and your parents aren’t around, but if your parents are around then they can go back to deadnaming and misgendering you? you could give your friends some of your boy clothes and then when you go to their houses/on days out together they could bring the clothes for you to change into, or keep a boys uniform and you can change into it at school. your parents will have no way of knowing (as far as i’m aware they aren’t monitoring you), the contract isn’t legally binding it’s just a form of control, *if they don’t respect you then you don’t have to respect them or their contract*. 

i’m so so sorry you’re going through this, i know it all seems really hard right now but i promise with time it will get better. it sounds like you’ll be 18 in a few years, and at that point they can do nothing, you can move out to uni and unis are excellent at handling trans kids (in my experience). it absolutely does get better, you just have to keep holding on and keep pushing. already you’re asking for help and advice and that’s great! keep the ones who love you close and use them to push through this because you absolutely can.
Just thinking what I might do as a minor being forced to go against themselves to dangerous levels. This is definitely considered child abuse in the UK. I'm sorry I don't know the legislation or whatever but it is all available online. It would be amazing if you have a trusted and supportive adult to help advocate for you. If you could go to them and tell them what your parents are doing, how's it's not legal and you'd like to get yourself access to help. I wonder if it might be worth contacting childline or even better Mermaids as they may be able to signpost you. You could even look for a lawyer who was willing to help you. There are plenty of trans lawyers out there who had unsupportive parents and would love to take such a case. I would start talking to everyone I could think of. Write to your local MP, the mayor, police, church. I would lean on the fact that forcing a child in such a way could cause them take their own life and what will these community pillars do to ensure the safety of minors in their towns. You could also take to local social media and newpapers, but obviously that depends how much you're willing to have others know. But fight this. The way they are treating you is not that of loving parents, despite what they may believe.   


Definitely do a tonne of research, get a support network and don't take this. Sounds like foster care would end up being on the cards. I truly hope you find your community.
Take a copy of the contract to your school and ask for advice or help if your school is supportive Thay may be able to get you help maybe a social worker as I'm sure this is a form of abuse in the UK. And if forced to Singh contract are instantly voide as you are not willingly singing it
As others have pointed out, that's a clear case of abuse.

If you've completed your A levels I'd hazard a guess you're 16/17, so your possible options may change when you become 18.

Contact NSPCC, explain your situation and they'll be able to give you help and advice regarding your safeguarding as a child.

Contact Mind for mental health advice, get an understanding of CBT as a way of mitigating the current and incoming stress.

Contact Shelter they may be able to provide advice about emancipation from your parents and housing. (Citizen advice bureau will be able to advise on the process)

There should be a DSL (dedicated Safeguarding Lead) at your school they should have training / experience in supporting children in similar situations, they should be able to provide advice on what services your council can provide.

If I were in your position, I'd want to make a plan that sets out all the actions that need to happen to get out of that situation and into a significantly less harmful situation. Without knowing more about your situation, living independently seems like best goal for you to plan for.
Talk to a different adult. Whether that is anyone from your school or anywhere else. Someone you are comfortable with. This IS CHILD ABUSE. So many times abuse goes unnoticed or you don't know it is abuse until years later. The other adult has to report this. And then hopefully CPS (or whatever the equivalent is in the UK) can step in. At least here in the US all teachers have yearly mandatory reporter training for abuse.
This is such an awful thing you are experiencing, being punished for being who you are is unconscionable. Hang in there and don’t let them get the best of you. I’ve been surrounded by mostly unsupportive family, but your situation is far more heartbreaking. If you have to weather the storm by playing along it’s understandable and doesn’t take away from who you really are. Don’t give up hope, bright days are ahead, never give up. You’ll find a way. We are here to support you through these dark days. Stay strong dude.💜
I'm so sorry
Do you have a counsellor at the school you could speak to? Or a teacher you trust? You need to get an adult in your corner to help you.
WHAT THE FUCK THAT IS STRAIGHT UP ABUSE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU HOLY SHIT I HOPE YOU GET OUT OF THAT HELLHOLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CUT THEM OFF OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER.
I don't know about the UK law, but there has to be a way to stop this from happening. This cannot be legal
Go to your school & show the contract to a teacher you trust. Work with them to write out everything thst's gone on at home / is going on at home, all of the threats your parents have used to make you act / behave / present the way they want you to, and everything you're scared eill happen going forward now. If possible, also write out some situations which you see as proof of what will happen if you comply / if you don't comply. Then when you have support from your school  (& possibly a parent / guardian of a friend who is supportive of you if that's an option), reach out or have someone reach out to social services. That ""contract"" and the list are proof of abuse, and if your parents say that yes those situations happened or yes XYZ happened or will happen, it's a basic legal ground for them to lose custody of you. Legally, social services have to respect your name & gender when putting you with a foster family / temporary family *(meaning they can't knowingly put you with a family who are transphobic or anti-lgbt, since that counts as knowingly putting you in danger)*



I'm really sorry that this is the only advice I've got for you.
Dude just call cps and say goodbye
Dude. That's abuse. You need to contact child protective services because that is literally abuse. Stay safe man.
(Warning: memtion of self-harm but by no means a invitation to do so)

Show this story and a copy of the ""contract""  to a teacher/ school admin you belief to have your best interest at heart. If your trust is not misplaced then they will hel you protect yourself and get out of there. They should have the means by money, telephone, internet ans social connections to do soo.

At the very least maybe there is a way to socially shame your parents into not acting on their beliefs (like spread the rumor that they plan to send you away to make you kill yourself. So now they can't send you away because they will be know by everyone as the parents that killed their kid the moment you disappear to a catholic school) . Social pressure can do alot some times. Which is ofcourse a temporarely solution before you have the money making means to live on your own and cut them out of your life.
Show the contract to any trusted adults at the school that you can and ask them to help you. By law, they have to escalate it. That’s child abuse. Do you have access to email?
Hey. Just some quick advise because you're going through shit right now and I'll try my absolute best to help you dude. First of all, that is ABUSIVE AS FUCK. Taking away your property rights and not letting you sleep in your bed is abuse. Forcing you to detransition is abuse. Those people don't love you, nor care about you. The love the idea of a daughter just like they want her to be. You are not that, man. Im sorry if this too harsh. PLEASE, tell your friends and your teachers and WHOEVER you can. Call child protective servises. Do you have any supportive family you feel safe with? They would be great help. Just like some other comments said, that contract does not bind you in any legal way, and they do not have the right to make you follow it. Maybe what you could do for a little while is tell your teachers and friends to not call you by your name when your parents are around. You could even year a girls uniform when you leave home and have your own in your bag to change when you get to school. DO NOT let those people stray you from your identity. You are a man, and no matter how hard they try, you will always be one. Please try your best to not harm yourself, even though that must be extremely hard, because it will just make your mental health worse. Try to also hide any money that you get. They will not win. I wish you the best dude, be safe and remember: you are a man. I hope you escape as soon as possible and live your life to the fullest
What’s your name?  
( your name not the one your parents gave to you)
this is child abuse?? bro call the police like holy shit. this is disgusting you can't let this happen to you
Hear me out - I promise I’m not trolling here; 
Take this opportunity to research the catholic school.  Some ( not all ) are support it ive if the LGBTQ community here in the UK.  You could,  anomnysly ahead of time also reach out and explain the situation.  

Do not open yourself to Doxing by releasing you identity,  but you can absolutely piss your parents off in this scenario if it happens to be one of the supporting schools ( which I think by law they need to, too some level here in the UK )
I don’t understand how parents can do this and this is why I say trans people are some of the strongest you can come out and your parents may not support you it is terribly that they are doing this to you but karma comes around contact child protection services if they cant accept you as the man you want to be then they don’t deserve you
How are the laws in your country, UK? I know that in Canada (at least some provinces, idk, I'm not Canadian) not being supportive or at least accepting of your child's transition is considered child abuse and police/Children's Help line/CPS/whatever it's called can get you helped out into the foster kid system or if you're older to live by yourself and have your essentials covered by government funds. That honestly might be better since they are planning on taking away your privacy which often is covered in law as a ""kids between ages 10 to 18 can share a room with children of max 2 years of age difference and of the same sex and must sleep in separate beds"" (not word for word from Finnish law, I just remember hearing that sometime). Look into it, good luck dude.
Incriminate them both for som crime that gets both of them jailed.
Listen to your parents. They are correct.
What the absolute fuck is this?

Child protective services, Lgbt charities, go full British an contact your MP.
RUN OP RUN
This is 100% abuse you should definitely get some authorities involved like childline
Call CPS. Don't put it off. You are not obligated to respect, listen to, or even love your parents.
Your parents just wrote an admission of abuse. They created a paper trail. It is up to you now to bring the contract to a trusted adult.
Report them, what they're doing equates to child abuse.

They don't sound fit to parent.
I would look into organizations that help Trans kids and see if you can get them for abuse. It seems like absolute abuse to do what they are doing. 

Also if you’re old enough you might be able to just move out and live your own life legally. It will be hard and you’ll prolly have to get a job while finishing school, but it’s up to you whether you think that would be a better option. 

Either way, do some research and talk to everyone you can who supports Trans rights and see what can be done to help you. 

I wish you the best of luck and even though I don’t have kids, I’m prolly as old as your parents and they sound like they are absolute pieces of shit who don’t care or love you like parents should. They forced you into this world without any choice and now want to control you because they don’t like what you have become. Well that’s too fucking bad for them and maybe they should have thought about that before having a kid. You are an individual, not their property.
Ahh, yeah thats really rough man. I'd start looking about it any of your friends parents will support you through highschool. Then get you a job and grind until you're secured. Then you can bust into your parents home in a tux and spit on the floor and flip them the bird before you walk out of their lives for however long you want.
I'm in a different country from you so this is hypothetical entirely but if my kid's friend was going through this, I'd do everything I could to bring them to live with me where they could be themselves. I also know a lot of other people who would give you a home until you finished school in a heartbeat. My guess is there is at least someone in your circle of friends and acquaintances who is willing and able to do the same. If you can let as many people as you can know what is going on, you are likely to find out who that is. Although many people here are recommending speaking to the police, they aren't always as helpful or sympathetic to this kind of abuse as they should be. Better would be to start with your guidance councillor, friends' parents, and any LGBTQ organisation your school can help you contact, just telling them everything you've said here.
I haven't seen this advice here yet so, as a 29 year old who hated life under my parents roof, here it is:

Focus your mind on moving out once you're an adult. I recommend going to university as soon as you finish your A levels, and going as far away from your parents as you can. Being far away gives you an easy excuse not to visit them often. Your student loans will keep you going for a good few years. Get a part time job while you're at uni, in a supermarket or something. Meet some good people who you can continue to be housemates with after uni. Introduce yourself as male from day one and be the real you.

Importantly, try your hardest not to rely on your parents' money for anything. If you can be financially independent, they can't use money as a weapon against you. My dad tried that. I chose to live in a damp, rat-and-cockroach-infested student house rather than ask my dad for a penny. And you know what? I was happier for it.

You will one day be free to be yourself without your parents controlling you. Whenever you feel really low, just remember that. You're so close to freedom. Hang in there!
I’m pretty sure this is not legal, they literally can’t force you to detransition
This is 100% abuse and you should contact the police about it, but for a more temporary solution leave a binder at school/in your bag. They don’t know what goes on at school, you can continue to present as a boy, just let people know to refer to you as your deadname if you’re around your parents
If you get on well at school you should speak to a trusted member of staff, it would be their professional and legal obligation to raise it as a major safeguarding issue. The school will mostly likely have a safeguarding portal where this would be raised to the schools designated safeguarding lead. Depending on what level of risk they deem you at (for example, the highest being immediate risk to safety or life), other services potentially will get involved, such as social services or police


Also I'm sure it's been covered but that contract (legally speaking) means fuck all

EDIT: Im not saying things will get this bad, but just to have in mind, akt (formerly Albert Kennedy trust) are a UK homeless charity for LGBT+ youth
You need to tell the school this. You definitely need to. They may be able to help and support you with it or get the needed people involved too.
UK?

try r/legalAdviceUK/ They are very good at pointing out the best resources to contact, and very good at putting stuff in language accessible for young people.

There are options and I have a strong feeling your parents might not be living up to their legal obligations to protect your welfare.

Even in a boarding school the school has the obligation not to discriminate against you on the basis of gender identity, and have basic safeguarding obligations. Which could be very interesting if it's girls school, since, y'know, you're a boy.

There's a lot of bigots in the world, sadly, but there are also a lot of people willing and able to help.
A boy being sent to an all girl's school, if it want to the situation that would be a dream. 

With life you'll never forget who you are. It will only grow stronger with time.
Your in the uk. How old are you you know they cant just do that to you i would get that documentat and go to the police
Rip
Youre a minor so contract isn't legally binding so no need to follow it. Contact the police, CPS, whatever cause this is straight up abuse and illegal as fuck.
Play your parents game to their face, and start planning in secret to get out as fast as possible. Continuing to live with them will only get worse, regardless of which pronouns you use. They don’t respect you, and they’ve made it clear that they only love the idea of who you were, but not you as a human being in front of them suffering 

Look for shelters or nonprofits that provide resources to 🏳️‍🌈 teens. Start calling people at those places, you’ll find more people who want to help you than you may realize, they might have been where you are now 15 yes ago and will know more about your local options

You are who you are, and your parents have shown you that they
What the hell this is incredibly cruel how do people ... how can anyone ever do this to their child it's sick
You should browse less leftist propaganda
People are suggesting reporting to child services. I would also suggest reaching out to any relatives you have who might be supportive or at least less terrible than your parents. Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, older siblings, etc. Also potentially reach out to some of your friends’ parents if you have a close relationship with them. 

1. Having adults on your side can sometimes help in legal situations.

2. If the legal system ends up removing you from your parents care, you will likely need a new legal guardian as a minor. The foster care system is a crapshoot, you could get lucky and get some great foster parents, but there’s also plenty of bad/abusive foster parents. If you have caring adults in your life, that will almost certainly be a better option, and you can advocate to be placed in their care.
RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT
There's nothing you can possibly do to illuminate the truth to a bunch of monsters. The best you can hope to do is outlive the senile motherfuckers.
So what happens when someone’s a tomboy do they treat them like that too
Bring this up with your school. Beg your teachers and and friends to help do something about this. I know the UK is kinda TERF Island but there's bound to be someway for you to fight back and get out from under your family's thumb.

You made the right choice, by doing this you still have access to your safest place, and at least it's you doing this to yourself rather than it being forcefully done to you. It's not much but it's something. You'll make it thru this.
My oldest two are tranz and I could not fathom the pain you are in from being treated like this from your parents. I hope someday they remember how to be parents for you and I hope you find someone near you who can understand and care for you till they do. I send you a big hug and wish you peace , but remember they cannot change who you are inside you!
All I can say is, don't rush to identify yourself as this or that. All self identifications are transitory and our view of ourselves and the world around us are in a constant state of change. Seek to explore inwardly so that you may catch a glimpse of your true self which is beyond such arbitrary and superficial definitions related to gender, body type, beliefs, likes, etc. You are not who you think you are so long as you feel the need to put yourself in a categorical box of identity. If what you claim yourself to be changes day by day (or month by month, or year by year), which is almost guaranteed to be the case, then that is not who you are. Seek to find that which is permanent, beyond all impressions of body and mind. It is there, and if you look in all earnestness you will be sure to find it. And then all of your problems will come to an end.
Everyone's got good advice for you so I'm just here with support

You will not ""forget"" who you are. For the same reason that ""who you are"" didn't feel right to begin with. 

You will have every opportunity, once you are free of your parents, to be the person you resonate with, learn who that person is and learn to love that person

You will live a life full of good music and good food and happiness and laughter and new friends, without your parents, so long as you keep moving forward.

The only thing your parents can affect is how you feel about them, and how you interact with them. Hopefully after this, you will soon have the option of NOT interacting with them.

Keep your head down for now, and keep moving forward. There are people out in the world who love you, and people who will love you.

I believe in you
Your parents made you sign a contract to be treated equally to your sibling and sleep in your own room? They could (and should) go to prison for this, show that contract to someone at your school
Replying late but really do contact child protective services as they are literally threatening you and I’m pretty sure there are laws against this type of discrimination
Talk about indoctrination, like Holy fuck that is all heart breaking to hear.

your parents don't love you, no loving parent put there personal beliefs over their child happiness.

I don't like in the uk so I don't know what you have access to but if there is a teen group home you can go to or a friend you can stay with do it.

get as far away from them as soon possible.
in the meantime find ways to explore and reaffirm you identity when and where you can. find friends who respect your pronouns and wont rat you out, wear the close you want when you aren't near them, or even underneath your other clothing if you can. anything to keep your sanity intact untill you can get them out of your life.

hope that helps in some way. sorry you have to go through this.
I assume sending you to the all-girls school would cost them money, yes?  I say let them send you, but nothing says you have to be cooperative or compliant at the school.  Only respond to your chosen name and pronouns, ignore any and all instructions that do not recognize you for who you are, cut your hair the way you want (or just shave it off completely and go punk), Talk about atheism or non-christian theology at the school, basically just get yourself expelled.  

The other option is to attempt to put it all back into the box, ""do your time"", then get out and never look back.  Both are not easy and either way, you will still be there on the other side.  You just have to survive. \*hugs\*
CPS now
Call fucking child prozective services. This is straight up abuse
Go to your teachers and headteacher and show the contract - they will likely continue calling you by your new name, but maybe not in front of your parents

You may also be able to store trousers at the school and change when you get there. 

The teachers might also contact someone to help you on your behalf. Without you doing anything “wrong” by your parents (they did tell you to explain to your teachers to call you another name - the teachers concern is their responsibility)

How many years do you have left? I moved away to uni at 18 - 10/10 would recommend
I'm sorry to hear this dude.

I hope that you can find some safe adults to help you navigate your legal options. Maybe a safe teacher, other family member, parent of a friend, GP, therapist?

Signing a contract like that as a child is just theatrics/make believe, so don't worry about it. 

Unfortunately the UK is so fucked up for trans kids now, that you can't physically transition until you're an adult. So they can mess with your social life but it won't affect your ability to medically transition as soon as possible.

This situation will pass. I know it can feel like the end of the world right now, but nothing will stop you living your life as an adult. No matter what happens now you will have decades ahead of you living normally as a guy. 

I hope you can safely get out of this situation now. But if you can't, I hope you have school friends who will get that you're a dude no matter what you have to tell your parents. Try to get through school, escape to uni, be your true self and never look back.
Ngl if i was in that position i would either be dead or in jail for murder.
Tbh, a school where a bunch of queer girls get sent might be a more supportive environment than your parents are providing. I’d make a contract for them to sign that just says something like “By invalidating my child’s identity I forfeit a positive future relationship, and fully expect to be left in a home to rot when I need care that is expected of family.”
We love you, be strong 🖤🖤🖤🧛🏻
Is there any other family members you can convince to take you in? When my family was doing stuff like this I honestly just started being the worst person, keeping my grades just barely at passing so I would still graduate, skipping school, running away. 

If they’ve already taken everything that brings you joy then you don’t have anything to lose at that point. Make them hate you, convince another family member to take you in who will allow you to be yourself. Honestly that might be shitty advice but I think you should try to do whatever you can to get yourself out of that environment ASAP because they’re just gonna continue to make you miserable and I know it would be horrible for me to handle as a child
Sweetheart, that contract is nothing but hot air. Your parents are abusive, straight up. Being Trans isn't a choice - If they can't accept you, that's one thing. But for them to force you to do something that makes you suicidal is abuse. 

Are there any adults at your school you can trust? I think, though this is going to be hard and you're going to have to be brave, what's best for you is to leave. Take everything you own and need, and find an adult who you trust at your school who will take you seriously. 

You have to tell them everything, even about your prior suicidal thoughts. They need to understand your parents are abusing you, and that you can't go back. Ask them to call the police or social services if you need to. Do you have any friends who could back you up too? 

I'm in the UK also, and recently at a Pride event I saw a Homeless LGBT Charity - I don't remember their name, but maybe they can help you find some secure housing?

Good luck, I'm so sorry your parents are awful. :(
these people are threatening your safety. that is abuse, period. *even if* we assume the absolute best of them, and that they think they're doing the right thing, if they're willing to *compromise your* ***saftey*** and threaten stripping you of *basic human dignaties* that it's their fucking ***job*** to provide you with in the first place- just to do what they think is best for you... thats still fucking abuse, there's no way to look at it where it isn't straight up abuse, even with the most generous and undeserved benefit of the doubt.

talk to your school about what to do exactly, they sound like they'll actually try to help you. Idk legally exactly what you can do bc I'm not educated and I live in the US, but there *has* to be something you can do, so talk to them about it. I'm sure child protective services would love to see this contract they had you sign. 

*(btw unless uk is super weird which I'm 99.99% sure it's not, you can't just write a contract and have someone sign away just anything. that contract is meaningless legally, if anything it's hard proof that you're being abused.)*

Wishing you the absolute best bro <3333333
Wtf is that even legal what your parents are doing? I wonder if citizen's advice can work for you mate. I'd call what they're doing to you as abuse.

I'd tell your school what you're going through. This is just insane abuse.
First, that contract was under duress, so it's not legally binding. Second do you have any friends or adult allies? I would stay with them instead, if possible. I don't think it is safe for you to continue living and interacting with your parents. Third maybe you can report them for neglect or abuse. Fourth, if you have any LGBTQIA+ Centers in your area that can help, have a friend or teacher take you there, so they can help you. Maybe these centers have resources for LGBTQIA+ youth to live on their own with assistance. And fifth, you need to get a job, depending how old you are and the laws involving that. If these jobs ask for a guardian signature, that have an adult ally or member of the community sign it instead. The quicker you can become independent, the quicker you can move away from your parents and live as your authentic self. The way you talk about this, it sounds you need to get out of dodge real quick or you might do something to yourself that you'll regret or can't take back. Also here is a link to a channel that has helped me and others in the LGBTQIA+ community. This channel is educational and gives great advice. Just keep it muted at home and turn the captions on since your parents are transphobic. https://youtube.com/c/PoweredByRainbows

Also is your brother an Ally? Maybe he has some resources to help you too. I hope all of this helps. And please keep us updated on your journey.
I dont have any productive advice that hasn't been already said so I just want to wish you well and remind you as others have that you will always be a guy, whether your parents like it or not, whether you're presenting it or not. Your life as a trans boy has inherent value, and your inner strength has been proven by the fact that you're still here and you're still trans, even in these dire circumstances. I know you can make it. Good luck.

And PS, if you ever get the opportunity, please update us on this post. I wanna know when you're finally safe. Don't be afraid to post a PayPal or other exchange app link if you need financial support.
This is an insane amount of abuse, if your able to you need to leave
I sincerely hope things work out for you, they sound disgusting and I'm sorry you have gone through it.

My advice is if worse comes to worst, and you need to detransition in school, leave home everyday as if you're following their wishes, and bring a spare change of clothes and a binder to change into at school. 

If you do this, make sure you have a fabric or book to act as a false bottom or some hidden pocket in your bag so if they're ever suspicious and decide to check your bag, it won't be as easy as them just opening it. 

Good luck fr
Bro my heart broke again and again reading that. I’m sorry I don’t have any advice, if you want someone else to rant to or use as an idea sounding board then I’m here for you. Don’t give up and work on getting what you need to live independently from your shitty spawn point and semen donator. I love you, I think your 100% valid, and I am optimistic that you can survive this. You got this Brother.
Deal with it. Its 3 or 4 more years... NOT A LIFE TIME>

Get good Grades and Plan your escape. 

get such good grades that you can get a scholarship and get out, or Join the military straight out of HS...

It sucks, but in some countries you'd be dead already...

keep the faith till then... IT WILL GET BETTER.

&#x200B;

On a lighter note, keep a journal religiously... everything thing.

And when your free, publish it and out your parents...
the school will understand if you explain to them, especially once you explain how awful your parents are. i’m so so sorry
This absolutely horrible and I’m so sorry that you have to deal with these “parents”. The most I can really say here is, try to find as many coping mechanisms as you can to try and help you through this. Whether that’s music, games, art, just something to help. And try to make it through until you can move out. Once you move out and have your own income, they can’t tell you what to do. And if need be, you can cut contact with them, or at least for a bit to help your mental health.
Is there a way you can contact child protective services? Would they be supportive in your area? What about LGBT support groups for teens?
This is the case in the US, and I don’t know if this is true in the UK, but if you’re a minor and sign a contract, it’s not legally binding, so you can freely break your end of the deal.
Report them to the police
If you live in the UK what county??
They are a bunch of jerks. I'd sign it but keeping being yourself as safely as possible. Once you hit 18 nope out of there and transition
Honestly, I might…

A. talk to your school about what is going on - I’m a teacher and occasionally I/other teachers/the schools I’ve worked for have been able to provide a safe space for trans students to be themselves at school and we just use their deadname/pronouns when we communicate with the parents or on official documents. (Not every school I’ve worked for has done this, but it’s worth asking)

B. contact the boarding school they’re threatening to send you to - they may be more supportive than your parents think (I work at a Catholic school right now and we have a gay chaplain and a great GSA club). They may not, but if you find out that they’d be supportive, it may be a better option to just go there. I know people who went to boarding school and loved it.
Honestly fuck yo family if they can't support you for who you are than dip don't get why care for the people are so God damn f****** judgmental when it comes to like trans people it's crazy as hell to think that someone would throw their own child out just because who they are keep your head up and stay blessed
So agree with all the advice and that your family is abusive. I wanted to add as someone who has also been abused: you don’t deserve this. Nothing can justify this, even if you were a “bad” kid and acted out, you still would t deserve this. No one deserves this treatment. And I am so sorry that you are being abused but also that you are being deprived of the unconditional love, support, and connection that you deserve and have a right to. It is absolutely not fair. I promise you though that even if it seems impossible it will get better. There are people who will love you for everything you are. Who will prioritize your needs, comfort, and happiness. You will find them. It will be hard but this is when you gotta white knuckle it and hold on for dear life so you can get there. Im so sorry that this is the situation you are in but it is NOT forever. Keep hoping and dreaming and hold on to the possibilities of the future.
Wtf? This is not borderline gaslighting, it's gaslighting, making you sing a contract to not be yourself so ""you can be happy"" is not love, it's a fear of losing control

Do they actually have a way of monitoring what your friends call you? If not, screw it, tell them you asked you friends to deadname you, but don't chang anything with your friends

If they do have a way to do it, you can try a nickname you like, i hed a similar situation on a much smaller scale, i had my friends call me ""the snail"" for months, cus my dad can't handel me being trans (thay call me my name now, but it kind of stuck)  

Anyway, spend as little time at home as possible for you, stay at friend's houses, after school stuff, find excuses to go out

And my last advise, it's a bit harsh, but gaslight them back. I'm not going to sugar cote it, I think that if they are that controlling and closed minded as to make you sing that contract, you should stop caring what the fuck they want, cus it's clear they don't care what you want, so lie, for your own safety for the time being, until you can get the fuck away from them, how ever long it takes, let your friends know you as how you really are, and lie to the monsters

I really hope you find a way out of this mess ASAP, remember, you are absolutely valid and deserving of love
If you feel it is necessary contact your local child protective agency because these are threats to you mental well being from your parents and their actions are potentially damaging to you.
Hey OP, I've read through all of the comments and I'm glad you've taken the first steps to getting out of there. You're really fucking brave for doing that, I could never. Please keep me updated if you can, your situation really concerns me. And from one transmasc to another, you got this. The best advice I can give you right now is to not give up. You have everything on the line right now. The UK is on your side, go as far as you need to legally. This is severe abuse and the UK will not tolerate it. Please get rid of your 'parents' and don't take shit from anyone. Keep poking and prodding and making calls until someone gets you out of there. That contract cannot legally bind you because of your age and situation, as well as the fact that it is under threat and coercion. Please stay safe and keep fighting ❤
Hi boy I'm a trans girl.
I have no words for your situation.
If i could give some advice I would say that:

1 the world Is unfair, but you are an extremely precious human being
2 unfortunately in this moment of your life you are living with your parents. And willingly or not they are your launch platform for your future.
We are still teenagers, and we are going to live a beautiful and long life. There is no need to rush, especially in your situation. Try to get all the strength and the good this moment of your life Is giving you. As soon as you become indipendent, you will be free to be what you are. 
Play your cards, stay out of troubles and this bad page will fade

Emma❤️
Try explaining to your friends what's going on and tell them only to use your dead name around your parents. If you feel safe to try telling one of your teachers what's going on and see if they can be of any help for your situation.
You're a minor, the contract means nothing and you can completely legally void it.
“My only downfall is I’m trans”

My heart just cracked. I came to this community as a parent of a child who has struggled with identity, and I didn’t know how to navigate that road. I came here to listen and learn. I never comment because I’m learning from everyone else, who is living their own life. This however is where I just can’t. You are amazing and strong and don’t deserve this. You are a child, and you are so worthy of happiness. Your parents are failing you. Your happiness is so much more important than their comfort levels. I have no advice for you, but I’d LOVE to dish some out to the people who are raising you. 

Please be kind to yourself. You are worthy of all the happiness. ALL. OF. IT.
Bring this to a news channel
Wondering how OP is doing now. Any news?

I agree you are experiencing abuse and neglect. While the contract thing sounds illegal, parents make “agreements” with their kids all the time. I don’t think the legality of it is a concern for them, it’s just a way to further coerce you.

Consider whether you trust the police before doing anything. Like, don’t call the cops first. You call the cops if someone broke into your house. They are barely able to do anything that doesn’t involve property crimes, even then they don’t have a great track record.

Telling a teacher you trust is a good step. If you have an extended family member that’s supportive you could maybe stay with them, definitely tell them, or if you have a friend whose parents are trustworthy as well. If you spread the information widely of your abuse and neglect it will no longer be your secret to have to deal with, rather, you’ll be protected by a community that views the behaviour of your parents as cruel. They seem very concerned with what others think.

Sometimes the laws and organizations out there can be protective but sometimes they can make things worse and that’s always the fear. If you don’t have to bring the law into it and can just leave and stay with another adult your parents might stop. At a safe distance you can begin pursuing things like emancipation or choosing other legal actions. The important thing is getting out to a safer environment. The thing is the law is slow and non profits don’t have a lot of money, but they will try to help you. You just need to have a few options and not solely rely on non profits and the law. Realistically, you may need to learn how to get things you need by being a bit scrupulous. If you came out at school already you know you’re strong, these parents are merely annoying inconveniences on your way to growing up.

If you choose to follow the so called contract to survive you won’t forget who you are. I’m not suggesting you do this, but I also understand if you do go that route. I rather like the suggestion one person had of just changing at school, that kind of thing, but I know that’s not for everyone and the goal post of what’s acceptable will constantly change if your parents are already doing that by treating you worse than your brother. Stay safe.
Maybe try and see if there’s any legal avenue through the UK’s equivalent of child protective services? Considering you guys actually have protections for trans people in place where you live your government may take your side.
It’s a scary time to be a parent. I’m trans and a mom so I have both perspectives. They are afraid they aren’t protecting you from irreversible damage and there are only two ways to find out. Maybe give them some science on how rare it is to regret or want to detrans if You don’t have any other comorbid diagnosis . Like autism, delusions, anorexia etc.  This is their worry. That they are supporting the wrong treatment and it might be irreversible. Go with the science and address that worry. Hopefully You find a place where both your needs are met. Lastly, don’t self harm or commit suicide. If You feel any of that coming on get help. One day, this will all pass and Yiu need to be there for that life. Best best love to you. -Tiff
If it’s like america the catholic school will keep you because they getting paid.   Be away be out with friends.  Get away from parents
except i will probably be sent to this school if i disobey it which sounds like absolute hell
And it’s completely invalid as 16 year olds can’t sign anything legally
My man, that is cult behavior. I would love to tell you to leave but I know the reality. I know how hard it can be. This person is right tho. It’s severe abuse. Stay safe, pal. 💕
@whoever gave this the laughing award, fuck u
[removed]
thanks friend
Agreed OP should talk with his school because there is clearly a form of abuse, intimidation and blackmail
Yes, UK schools (all of them) have safeguarding obligations. They should be able to escalate this to the appropriate authorities.
this. absolutely this. that's literally child abuse
Agreed. Contact services to help and definitely show the photo you took to your school counselor.
AGREED  look I'm somewhat able to help you mentally not in court
Unfortunately you signed a contract If they haven't abused you whatsoever then technically they would completely win in court AKA juridistic options need to be avoided(<-- only applies if the contract is legal), (I'm MTF so I've looked into this + my dad is a lawyer that doesn't support LGBTQ+ so I hear cases like this somewhat about 1 a year that's how I K this). Police however is a great option if you specifically file in for Domestic abuse. Also IK you're not aloud to talk or research about LGBTQ+  shit anymore but they didn't say about the law or anything about you're brother. So try asking you're brother to ask you're parents why they think it's ""unacceptable"" for you to be Trans. Also try talking to them first, about how you feel about differences about  you're body and you're personality that arent ""compatible"". If they refuse to let you go trans after that than call the police to file for Domestic abuse. Pls Hang in there, Bro 

YOU GOT THIS!
[removed]
I'm gonna hijack the top comment cuz I need help. I'm the father of a 16 year old girl wanting to transition to male and for now I said let wait till 18 so she can decide as an adult. Now I feel like I'm not being a good dad. I don't know what to do
Is it different than america? It’s really bad when they take you here, sent to a group home where you’ll be viciously abused by the other kids, and maybe the staff if you’re unfortunate. High chance the group home is catholic too.. 

I hope it’s better over there. Here people like op just run away and try to make it on their own. Not that there’s no help per say, but it depends where you are, and it’s unlikely housing will be an option.
I dont know if this is a good idea. Police rarely help situations. What can they do in this situation? They can't force them to treat their son like his brother.

I know this is abuse. I agree. But does the law in their area consider it abusive? Idk. I doubt the police will care and there is no guarantee he will find a social worker that will care, although I believe that's far more likely than a cop. Most cops will treat the OP like he's the crazy one.

Op should consider their situation carefully. Calling the authorities is not guarantee they will take his side and it could make the situation even worse in some ways. I'm not saying they shouldn't seek help, I'm saying I don't know that involving the police or social services is necessarily help.

He has 2 years or less and OP can GTFO. It's an eternity at 16, i know, but two years will come and go and they can get to a better place.

Op if I were you I would look to see if there are any trans support groups in your area. They will have a better idea of how the police and social services in your area will react to you. They might have better advice based on how the community treats trans folks in general. Be very careful here. Once social services and police are involved, anything can happen, including being taken from your home, however unlikely, and ending up in a worse situation.

I really believe you should look for a local trans group or LGBT+ group and get their opinion. Being in a community of others that understand can make a world of difference.

You deserve happiness, love and acceptance. Hang in there and you will find it.
i have spoken to a teacher and they told the safeguarding team who have spoken to my parents and are figuring something out. i haven't had a chance to show them the contract yet so will do when they next speak to me
haha as soon as i get a chance!
This^ I had abusive parents and moved out when I was 15. All I had to do was threaten to file for emancipation and they allowed me to leave. Best choice I ever made!

Best of luck to you <3

Edit: If you happen to be in Idaho, I have resources that can help you!
Also, even if _not_ signed by a minor, contracts signed under duress are not binding either (OP says they were _made_ to sign it).
okay thank you good to know
No illegal contract is legally binding.
far more important than that, like insanely more important than that, its not like you can just write down an agreement and call it a legally binding contract. In the U.S. it can lay the groundwork for a civil suit if someone agrees to do something for an amount, then that thing isn't paid, but in this case, it is an unnotarized piece of paper, with essentially meaningless parameters. It sounds like less of a contract and more of a scare tactic
agreed
thanks :)
i tried taking a picture and they tore it up and then reprinted it. i wasnt allowed a copy but i fished out the pieces they tore up from the trash and spent a few hours taping them up so yes i do have a copy
omg they make me see this therapist who is so blatantly transphobic
It's not legal.  
British citizens can be legally charged for hate crimes under these circumstances as one of my friend's parents got into hot water over it.
oh god that’s terrible man i hope you’re okay now. im half polish and go to poland a lot so i do know how difficult it can be in some places, im really lucky to live in the uk.
Also what does ""Sleep in your Bedroom"" mean?
Where are you sleeping now? Under the stairs like Harry Potter or what? wtf
Tell social services about such abuse.
And if they were forced upon you by threat of  punishment
The fbi? Lmao they have bigger issues.
pc
i genuinely didnt feel like i had a choice, i didnt even have time to think about it because i asked if i could have a few days and they were all ""tHe dEaL is OfF"". not sure if this counts but my dad who is a lawyer wrote the contract :D
Its very likely not a legally binding contract... its just some silly written up contract their parents wrote up and had their kid sign. Like a chore contract kids might sign with their parents, you don't need a lawyer for that lmao... It was also signed under duress meaning it would be void anyway. But seeing as how both not signing it AND breaking it means all the bad things happen anyway there is no way this is a ""legal"" contract much less one that needs lawyers present. Silly comment

lmao thanks for the advice, in the uk i can move out when i turn 16 so just waiting for that lol not too long now
Yea.. call child protective services?

Also, pro tip: leave home in girls clothes, change in the bathroom, do reverse when going home?

I mean.. their so awful.. would it bother you to seek rehoming possibly via adoption through social services into an accepting family?
It doesn’t justify all of those stupid thing just because he’s transgender, which by the way is natural cause we are born this way. So completely full of non sense to give the parents some credits there, you can as some point lost i admit but you can also look forward and think that it’s better to have a child who’s happy to be than death and buried.

Real case I used to know sadly is that my girlfriend who was also transgender, we were trying to work this out and the mom was completely acting like a douche not because of any mistake or what, just to make her and us mad … a parent like that should never have the right to educate his child, and I’m not wrong ont his those are hypocrites. They are the one capable to came to their child funeral and fake crying and leave in a minute but not caring at all for their child happiness.
>except i will probably be sent to this school if i disobey it which sounds like absolute hell

Brother you're going through absolute hell right now. They're just gonna keep upping their demands until they've ""fixed"" you. You've gotta act, NOW. This shit's illegal, nip it in the bud ASAP
Just an FYI to be a bit more clear, you cannot be legally bound by a contract if you're a minor. That ""contract"" has no more significance than any other pieces of paper.

Edit: also take Aphrodite's advice. Keep the contract, or a copy of it.
You could try to get kicked out of the school, but that might not end well.
Why not give the religious school hell back? When they deadname you, say your name. ALWAYS violate the dress code. Go in the mens restroom. Your parents are really trying to take from you your most prized posession, your identity. Don't give it to them.
hey man, while there might very well be transphobes at an all-girls school, at least some of your peers will be cool with you. Plus, you don't have to live with your parents if you're at a boarding school.

My boarding experience was LITERALLY the best experience I could have had in my life, simply because it got me away from abusive parents. Trust me when I say you'll be happier out of the rule of your parents, even in an all-female school. There, you can at least express yourself how you want to.

My thoughts are with you, kid. I'm sorry you're going through shit like this.
Your parents would be pretty stupid to do that. The ""contract"" is not legal and is actually evidence that your parents abused you. It's probably a scare tactic to make you think you are obligated to obey them.
As someone with parents very similar to yours: that contract doesn’t mean shit. They are forcing you to sacrifice your mental health for things you should have in the first place and it won’t stop there.
[removed]
You should talk to a councillor at school. This is abuse. Your parents are abusing you knowingly. This is ground for you to be liberated from them.
CPS is your best friend.
You can tell the school your parents threatened you, and it was signed under duress, which means it's not legally binding.
they’d do that with or without the contract. their power over you comes from them abusing their roles as parents. you’re being given the illusion of choice, nothing more.

I can’t give you any advice about what actions you can take, but, if you can manage it, hold fast to the knowledge that a decision forced upon you is not your decision at all. you never chose to detransition. you never chose to go by your deadname. you never chose to wear that uniform.

you might have to do all those things, and my heart breaks for you, but maybe it can help to realize that you won’t be betraying yourself. you’re just doing what you need to do to survive until you can finally break free.
Girls catholic school isn’t the worst place in the world for a trans guy. A shocking number of people there will be lgbt… no guys to date? They just date each other.

If it’s a boarding school you get to go away from your parents, too.
A contract signed by coercion is automatically invalid!
FYI you can flag awards and if enough people do this it will get rid of it, still angry some fucker actually finds that comment funny
While I agree wholeheartedly, it’s best not to give them that attention. Just let them waste their cash on reddit coins
might have been a free award, not sure how they work. still, not appropriate.
Child abuse js ""physical, sexual, and/or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver."" 

Explain to me, in detail, how it is not psychological abuse to force your child to conform to your ideal version of what they should be, isolate them from their friends and peers, and emotionally neglect them by withholding love and support.

Remember: conversion therapy is literally considered abuse.
If possible, you may be able to move in with a friend. It’s not betrayal, the adults in your life have already failed to be parents. Getting away from them is top priority. Much love
[removed]
i will do when the safeguarding team next speaks to me!
[removed]
He is a minor that was coerced into signing away their rights, to his parents, under threat of continuance and furtherance of abuse. This 'contract' is in no ways legal, or holds any legal weight, any judge that gives a shit about the law would take this as evidence against the parents not the child, as this 'contract' is itself abuse.
The contract's irrelevant.

>(looking at it now, i dont actually get anything in return, i just get to keep the things i should have anyway)

Contracts require consideration, i.e. some benefit for both parties. Since OP's parents are *already* obligated to perform their end of the bargain, the contract is void.
no. that contract is not legally binding whatsoever. you cant sign over your rights, it is with a minor and they were under duress. this is not great advice op. your best bet is child services and there are many trans helplines you can talk to about this stuff
many contracts between adults or companies have illegal clauses that a judge wouldn't enforce. doesn't matter if both parties signed and understood. a minor first often cannot sign a contract at all, second cannot sign away their rights to their parents.
[removed]
It’s not a light thing for most trans people to come out to their parents, there’s a good chance he’s been thinking about it for a while, you should talk to him about it and just try to learn more
the most common misconception is that it is a decision. it is not. if i hadn’t come out, i would have committed. let your child be themselves please, that doesn’t have to involved letting them medically transition, just let them express themselves
Congrats you’re the shitty parent of a 16 year old boy. Go do the bare minimum for him
Let him transition socially, see if he likes it, nothing permanent, no need for hormones, just identity (call him male pronouns, chosen male name, address him as your son) and dress. Let him see a mental health professional for a diagnosis.
Maybe settle for puberty blockers till 18? I dunno, I'm not trans, and I'm not a parent, I'd like to think I wouldn't care and believe them, but I'm antinatalist and in no position to adopt so I'll never have a kid
You are being abusive and exerting coercive control
Considerably different
""the team has talked to my parrents"" but not you? you as the victim should be the 1st person they talk to
good luck, man.
I'm glad you showed them, I'm so very sorry you are going through this. Hold fast to who you are, we know you are valid, your parents are so mistaken and are being abusive. I am the mom of a trans kid and wish I could talk to your parents.
Best wishes! What they're doing is really messed up, I hope things get better soon.

<3333333
Stay strong brother.
Good luck man
literally call up child protective services and tell them you are being abused, you need to be proactive with this or you will be forced to live like this until you are financially independent
Honestly if I were you, move out ASAP and f*ck them off out of your life and never speak to them again.
there's a little less legal precedence there, especially in the uk, because a trans person being told by their parents they'll be enrolled in a different school (something they could do for any reason) if they don't detransition isn't necessary duress, just a parental consequence. to be clear, i 100% disagree with that line of reasoning, but if i were a british judge i would probably follow it
This would be the nonprofit near you, as someone from the UK, I guess.

https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/contact-us/
btw and even if it where binding. A contract has to have an expire date, or a regulation with what time delays it can be canceled.
If nothing is determined and there is no law in place for a certain type of contract there is no time delay to a cancellation. For your ""Contract"" there is certainly no law in place. 

Would be gold if you just write them a cancelation haha.

Dear Mr. and Ms. legal parent, 

with this letter i cancel our contract from DATE, to the DATE. 

Go fuck yourself you FUCKERS

Sincerly your Son


Actually having their abuse signed by them self could really help you. They testify by their sign that they are abusing you.
As a student in the UK, the easiest way to do this is simply talk to your favourite teacher and explain the situation in detail. They have a duty of care and are required to pass it to a safeguarding lead, another teacher at the school, who will assess it and in turn reach out to other services.
Considering that this contract is in no way enforceable and could be used against them as evidence of child abuse, their destruction of the document you signed nullifys the issue of enforcement and so now it's an issue of destruction of evidence. 

And you say your dad is a lawyer? Not a very good one, it sounds like. You should study the law because I think you will have to defeat him to be free. And you could. He is weak and vain, and you're smarter.

Good luck dude. That's going to be rough but you can survive this! Honestly even Catholic school is less abusive than your dad, and Catholic school sucked.
Good thought! Show it to safeguarding. Best of luck man, we're all rooting for you here.
That is conversion therapy. There's a hotline for victims of conversion therapy in the uk, they might be able to help.

https://galop.org.uk/get-help/helplines/
yikes i’m sorry
Good to know. I’m American, so I don’t know the law in the UK.
I really hope you'll be able to start your transition very soon, my friend 😊 I managed to start mine at the age of 20 and I'm absolutely happy with the changes
Also they don't operate outside of the US...
Offf in so sorry doll that’s terrible. No that actually is worse.
Don't worry, signing it doesn't change anything. It doesn't even matter that this ""contract"" was written by a lawer. Forcing your child to sign a ""contract"" that says that to be treated with decency you have to live a certain way is simply not legal.
[removed]
[removed]
This isn’t the place to do that.
also, consider bringing this situation up with any councillors you see in school (or any teacher you trust). getting across the severity of the situation and the consequences you face/the abuse you have suffered, this should stress the importance of confidentiality in this situation between the school and your parents(so as to avoid making things worse by the school telling your parents youre being vocal about this). schools also have communication with local police forces, meaning they are able to effectively notify the police of a safeguarding concern as severe as this.
thanks you’re a wonderful person i’ll work something out
However it is useful as evidence of child abuse. The OP should acquire a copy of that contract and put it away in a safe place.
also contracts signed under threat/duress are null and void
Also being coarser into a signing a contract invalidates it even is op wasn’t a minor
I was thinking he might get kicked out of an all girls catholic school just for being an openly trans guy, honestly. Or maybe transferred to an all boys Catholic school? Like the character Elle on Heartstopper
This.
Best suggestion ever. If OP winds up getting transferred to an all-boys school for doing all that (which may not necessarily happen), then more power to him.
I understand and agree with the point of this comment but I don’t think an all girls catholic school will have a mens restroom
Would this be legally considered abuse?
I would keep a copy of that to give to child protective services as well.
I just saw in the UK, contracts signed by a minor are binding in the case of apprenticeship, employment, education, and services where the minor is the beneficiary, this is not the case at all. So don't worry, you can lie to them without legal damage. Still you should call for help, CPS and such, because you're not safe in your own household
No one cares what you think as you’re objectively incorrect. Your opinion and views are insignificant
Thanks, I flagged them. Didn’t know you could flag awards.
Looks to be one of the freebies.
I don't think ""laughing"" award style is a free one; usually the free ones are just ""Silver"", ""Wholesome"" and ""Helpful"". The awarder might have used free coins on it but most likely it was paid by actual money.
Report the account please. It's all troll.
[removed]
This is not funny, wtf is your problem?
Don’t wait, this is not legal, you need support now. I hope you can get away and be yourself 🤞🏻💚
If you can, take a picture of the ""contract"". It could be important evidence.
Please get help as soon as you can, you don’t deserve that sort of treatment.

Here are some phone numbers that may help you.

Emergency police - 999

Non emergency police - 101

Child line - 0800 1111
Please keep us updated, I wish the very best to you <3
please do this now, bcuz this is outrageous, to an extend where im reloading my imaginary shotgun with a ""religious"" intent.

please try to survive thrue this, as at some point you will come out at the top.

stay safe, youre valid <33
Do not wait. Call someone, call for help.

You are being abused. Whatever the UK equivalent for 911 is(I forgot what it was called), you need to do something.

You're in danger.
Hey, social working in training here, I just finished legislation unit and we not only learnt about laws here in Aus but elsewhere. Don't wait, get help as soon as we can, the longer and more comprehensive your paper trail is, the more likely you are to get somewhere. It's shouldn't be on you to advocate for yourself but you need to make it clear you're being abused which you are and that your parents are harming you. 

Be clear, be concise, e.g. ""My parents, their treatment of me and their disregard of my true identity is causing me both mental and emotional distress. It is making me consider self-harm, if the situation does not change I will be at risk of a mental health crisis."" 

I really hope things pan out for you, please give us updates if you feel you can.
Why are you working your shit out on others? Because YOU lived through hardships? Pathetic.
This ^^^^

Can't speak for if this is illegal or not, but the contract is in no way enforceable or legally binding given the topics it supposedly covers. Even an adult cannot sign a contract that allows an abuser to break the law, because its not up to you what laws apply and where, without it being considered void.

Essentially, all OP has done is sign a bit of their parents fanfiction. It means as much as it did when it was a blank piece of paper.

Tbh the bigger issue here is OP being a minor and therefore still in care of parents, so it's more on if they want to try and endure the care system or not.

Source - worked for a contract law firm (not as a lawyer to be clear) and this kind of issue frequently crops up. Abusers like to think a contract can protect them from anything, but its actually not that easy to write a legally binding contract, and they frequently void their own documents.
I mean it was void the second they had a minor sign it anyways
[removed]
I can confirm it's been a couple. She told me during COVID crises back in 2020. I raised my 3 girls alone. My middle daughter is autistic and I'm in constant fear of her being bullied. My first reaction was fear that now my oldest was going to make herself a target. I'm passed that now, but I just don't know if I'm being a jerk by saying wait till 18? To complicate matters I named her after my favorite grandma so that makes me sad too. Help
Thanks so much that's suppppppeeerrr helpful
This is excellent advise. I guess me reaching out here was the last step for me to accept
I literally just heard about them. I think it's too late cuz she has a very obvious female shape she hides. She spoken of getting her breasts removed too. My mother had breast cancer and had that done I'll never forget those chest scars
Good to here.

We have some really awful social systems here. Mostly designed to punish the poor. 

One of my best friends growing up was a bit of a misfit, his mom couldn’t control him, and she was blacked out on pills all the time. She kept calling the police when he didn’t listen to her delirious ass. After enough calls, they took him, sent him to the group home, where he was held down and beaten for being white every single day until he could escape. The other kids wouldn’t let him eat, kept taking his food, said things like “you’re white, you’ll be alright” they’d throw Mayo at him…. The group home was forcing him into religion, beating him with a paddle for telling on the other kids who abused him…. and this is one of the “good” states systems. One of the best even, it only gets worse. 

We have support groups for runaway trans kids and stuff, but they aren’t all over the place, and they don’t necessarily provide housing. It’s unlikely even and any support you can find is probably backed up and underfunded. 

It’s a fucking disgrace that “the wealthiest country in the world” can’t take care of it’s people who need help the most.
Yeah that's a huge red flag, I'd consider them I lability and find a third party to help.
Never speak to them again… until it’s possible to put them in the worst retirement home available
sure but it wasn't witnessed by a third party and they're a minor so regardless of the content of the contract it wouldn't be legally binding. it's not necessarily illegal that they made the op sign it it's just not legally enforceable in anyway.
I think the part where he was made to sign a contract where he wasn't allowed to sleep in his own bed means it might count as under duress - do they mean literally kicking him out, or taking away his literal bed? Forcing him to sleep in a basement/other room, bedless? All of these point to making him sign to agree to avoid to conditions which could be seen as abusive, and that might help form his case.
I'm not sure how it is in the UK, but the way I was taught in a US legal studies class (so only a very cursory amount of knowledge) is that both parties have to actually gain something from a contract in order for it to be legitimate. The example we were always given was that if you signed a contract where you agreed to work for free for years, it would never be enforceable.

OP signed a contract where they ""get"" things not taken away from him. OP makes a bunch of concessions and in return gets things to remain the ""same.""
so happy for you!
Didn’t even see that op was in the uk maybe they should call mi6 🤣
yeah :/
Parents that aren’t ready to love and support their kid however they turn out shouldn’t have children.

This right here is a perfect example of shitty parents being fucking shitty.

Keep up with the times or get the fuck out of the way.
They are forcefully suppressing their child’s identity, which is going to cause a lot of emotional and mental trauma.  I know because I’ve lived it.

I don’t care how fucking hard it is to “accept”, you either do right by your child and love them how they are or you’re a shitty parent that should have never reproduced.
Except it is?? Tf you on about
Contact child protective services in your area.
Reach out to charity organisations, government social workers are completely useless (not always their fault though).

Here is a good start, Mermaids/AllSorts and many others will point you in right direction and help you:
https://www.google.com/search?q=uk%20trans%20kids%20charity%20&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
Contact a lawyer of you can. Not only is that contact not legally binding due to coersion, half the stuff in there would/should make for a stupid easy court case.

(I am not a lawyer)

Child abuse is fucked and i get legitamately almost violently angry when i see or think about it for personal reasons.

This is absolutely on your parents, and has nothing to do with you. You probably are aware of all this, but they are terrible people. They are abusive as fuck and if you can prove it, great. They deserve what ever shit happens to them. I wish I could help somehow, this shit makes me so angry.

As satisfying as it might be to try and antagonize them, or carry out ""malicious compliance"" it might be satisfying short term, but it will be worse long term. At the very least, you mentioned living in the uk, so you shouldn't have to deal with the stupiddest parts of american stuff. Presumably you have some form of access to health care and such which is huge.

Right now, the best thing you can do is to get out. The sooner the better, but not at the cost of tying yourself to someone else, (**anyone** else, as you'll simply be trading one tyrant for another, even if that person means well) or putting yourself in a significantly worse situation. This is not going to get better, and the people who are **not** your parents, but **are** the people who technically gave birth to you, are not going to stop escallating things. If you happen to fuck up thier lives on your wat out of thiers, good. They more than deserve it. It's not unlikely that you may feel guilt for something like that, but you shouldn't. They are terrible people who are ruining thier own lives. Whatever happens is on thier heads for being such biggoted people. If your brother (assuming he's old enough to understand) doesn't see an issue with things that's a problem in and of itself. I knew the way someone else was being treated, wasn't right, but didn't say anything because i knew my head was next on the metephorical chopping block. It still didn't make the situation ok, and if i could have i would have liked to point out the stupidity and hypocrisy of the situation, but i wasn't brave enough to risk suffering the consequences.

If you feel any regret or compassion for the people actively hurting you, my parents were/are dumb as fuck, despite one being ""rather smart"", but only in certain areas and stupid as hell everywhere else. Some part of me still hates them. Your ""parents"" are actively maliciously hatefully making things worse. And whatever excuses they have aren't enough to justify thier behaviour.

I believe you said you were rather young. There are other people who are like you, and have made it out and are doing ok all things considered. Worst case scenario, you can do whatever you have to do, to survive, and once you get out from under thier thumb, you can starting working to undo all the damage they caused. It's going to suck, and it will be unpleasant. But you can do it. It's not fair, or right. But that's the way things are. It shouldn't be, but it is. People are just awful sometimes, but people can also be really good. I'm sure there is a great community, waiting for you, ready to welcome and accept and support you. You just have to get there.

No matter what happens, they can't take what you are away from you. You can call yourself whatever is necessary to thier face. That does not prevent you from calling yourself, thinking of yourself as whatever you want in your mind. If you have a teacher at school, that you really really trust, consider asking them for help or support or advice. If you have someone who has been supportive of you they might be able to help somehow.

I don't know what it's like to be a member of the lgbt community or to be in the situation you are in because of that, but i do know what it's like to have parents that make your life more unpleasant. I know that it sucks, and they don't deserve to have what they do. They don't deserve to have as wonderful of a person/child as you. Someone like you, is completely wasted in thier hands. And their never going to realize any of it, unless they do when it's far too late.

For all the shit my parents did, as ""great"" of an attempt as they made to teach me anything at all, at the very least, i have an appartment, where i get to make the rules, and i only really have to see my parents if i want to. I had to work my ass off at a factory job, but i suppose things are alright all things considered. Stuff is good enough, and i suppose i'm happy enough, and it's certainly better than it was. I sucked getting to where i am now, and i went to college for a degree i'm not really using (yay). Point is, my parents fucked up a lot of stuff, and i fucked up some stuff, and i and my situation are still mostly ok.

You can make it. You can make things the way you want them to be. I sure things probably suck right now, but that doesn't mean thier going to suck forever.

I hope things turn out as good as they can for you. That doesn't mean things are going to be perfect, but I hope for the best outcome you can have. I hope your parents realize the mistake they made, right after you're free, and it's too late to do anything about it, and they spend the rest of thier lives honestly trying to make up for what they did. And if they don't, fuck 'em. They aren't worth it anyways.

History is full of people who were what they wanted to be, and they rest of the world was too stuborn to admit it, and that didn't stop those people from making the life they wanted to have. If it takes you however long to set things right, either by getting away, or exposing them for what they are, you'll still have plenty of time after, to make the life you want to have. In the grand scheme of things, this all is just a big ugly awful speed/road bump. Once you're past it, you can make things better for yourself. All you've got to do now, is get past it. By whatever means you can.

(I do appologize for this being so long)
Call the cops on your parents for mental abuse
I'm being realistic. Why haven't you done anything, and why does it take a random stranger on the internet to tell you.
Yes. OP needs to do this.
don’t worry, i have a few copies in different places
And give copies to their therapist/counselor/other trusted adults. Spread the copies around so yote parents can't easily destroy the evidence
Yes
Absolutely. They can't take away your phone, not let you sleep in your bedroom, mistreat you, nor force you to detransition. Everything they're doing to you IS illegal and you have to contact someone, like the police, and they WILL help you.
I’m in the U.S and completely unfamiliar with UK law but I’ve been a foster mom and mandated reporter and where I live it would absolutely be considered abuse. I would call your local gender center from a friend or trusted teacher’s phone. See if they can help you find legal representation and guide you on how to fight this.
[removed]
I'm in the UK and my barrister friend says abuse and assault both in play. The contract is proof of their intent so get it or a copy before you bug out.

Social workers can't be relied upon as the framework they work in is very weak so it comes down to the individual case worker and their interpretation. Her suggestion is to get in touch with a trans charity any will help even if it's just passing you to a more suitable group. 

Very Important: This isn't you doing anything wrong, bad, or evil. It is about your parents putting conditions on their love and acceptance of you which is wrong. If you don't act now, and I know it's terrifying, it will get worse until you finally break. That tends to be when you kill yourself.

Have you any friends or relatives who could help you today while you sort out things long term?  Hell if you're within reach of Nottingham I've got a comfy couch and a cat you can fuss, she's a bit of an attention whore TBH.
So My veiw that abusing trans people is insignificant? And i am objectively incorrect?
As far as I’m aware the only free ones are wholesome, silver, helpful, and bear hug
Sure, but I'm also going to leave a comment for the lurkers who might agree

Bruh are you even trying? 😂
Duded created this account to troll. Every comment. Report the account.
i'd like to say you're right, and that it isn't legal, but in the uk, it still is, and the current prime minister shows no signs of changing that, despite pressure from both the opposition and his own party.

Well here’s a chance to give your new son a new name that means just as much to you! But it kind of depends on what you mean when you say “waiting until 18” does that mean waiting until 18 to medically transition, or does that include harmless stuff like allowing him to change his presentation and name and such
Who you named your child after is irrelevant (& kind insulating to your kid), your kid is not them, your kid is not a copy of them. Your kid deserves to be their own person with their own identity.
What country are you in? I’ll find some resources for parents to help you understand better. 
When your child experiences gender dysphoria it can be debilitating to the point they are sometimes suicidal so this is quite serious. Having you support him to become himself would be the most incredible thing a parent could do. It could prevent years if suffering. 
Let me know and I’ll send you legitimate resources that can help you.
Gonna be honest I don’t really care. You didn’t do the smallest amount of research into this when your son came out. You just decided that clearly he would regret it so fuck his happiness.
I had a similar thing but I managed to get out of it. Plus as soon As I turn 18 it’s off to Deutschland for university and hopefully the rest of life the laws they got there protecting people like us are truly amazing
Is any of your extended family supportive
[removed]
I mean they are straight up threatening their child
👆👆👆
[removed]
thank you you sweet sweet human. i am working something out, i’m sure it will be fine
This is rude and we all should be supportive, especially since OP is a minor
There are reasons someone will take some time to react, and need some help or/and support! Do not criticise you are not in their position!
its only going to get worse dude, time to get out now, dont let them waste more of your life.
You might consider a friend holding a copy too or that sort of thing. 

Your parents are evil. This is unbelievably messed up. 

I don’t know what to do legally, even less so given you’re in the UK, but if at worst you have to play along with them until you’re older, you are still valid. You are still who you are, and none of these things change that, even if you have to play along with them for your safety. 

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. Please do not hurt yourself or take this out on yourself. You are valid and you’re doing nothing wrong.
But the OP did mention that he lives in the UK, trans protection is absolute dogshit there.
[removed]
yeah did my whole gcse speaking endorsement on trans conversion therapy its genuinely disgusting that its still legal
 domestic abuse is not legal
[deleted]
Mental conversion therapy for under 18 is now illegal in the UK
Ye not with that contract, there isn’t any situation in witch that can be put under conversion therapy.
It's not legal to force a minor to sign a contract under the threat of unfair treatment and losing basic things. It's also domestic abuse, which certainly isn't legal.
I’m also in the uk, and child abuse is child abuse regardless of context so is therefore illegal, but yeah Bojos stance on CT (which they admit in the consultation documents does not work and is harmful!) is the reason why I’m still not out, I live in a blue county and it’s killing me having to hide who I am still.
Good, you could additionally send them to a person you trust. That way your parents will never get rid of the evidence.
It’s up to OP to decide how much danger they are in, that’s why I provided multiple numbers.

I've always told him (first time using that pronoun) he can present as anything he likes. And I have  his back no matter what permanent changes she wants as an adult. I guess I just fear her changing her mind later in life and asking me why I let him do it.
no that’s the most annoying but both sides of my family are immensely conservative so there isn’t a single person that i’m aware of who supports me
Look at you, literally advocating for suppressing LGBTQ+ identities because… why exactly?
THIS
They wouldn’t. In the uk getting sent to the mental health ward aka being sectioned is an extremely last option thing. Op has no reason to need to be sectioned. Despite what you seem to think, the UK is for the majority accepting. It is required you are for heath care  jobs. To be sectioned, your case must be reviewed by a doctor, the person wanting to admit you, a psychiatrist and if the police are involved, the police. Most likely Op, you will not end up getting sectioned, im here for you :)
No they wouldn't. Even in the US. 

I'm a mandatory reporter. CYS/CPS investigates and if they have concerning findings they contact the police. They also try to find family that can take the kid in or have emergency foster placement.

It is a shit situation. Don't make it worse by spreading false info.
Sometimes being rude gets people moving. To achieve, you need to go outside your comfort zone. Just being supportive isn't good enough, you need to tell some people to get them going.

People will disagree with this opinion, and I understand that. However, at the end of the day, I am thinking with OP in mind and do worry for their wellbeing.
Forcing your kid to conform to your wishful thinking of what they should be is abusive no matter the subject at hands
it's one of the things which is protected enough for it to be illegal

also some of those things are just not legal in general, without even being trans
Actually children in most countries do have property rights.


If you give your child a console or phone, it's theirs.
This is bullshit. The country doesn't give you mental support even if you need it...

They aren't frotning 3 years of mental hospital stay for someone that isn't mentally unwell.
but conversion therapy isn't. and since all of these demands have almost exclusively to do with being trans, it seems like it could easily be spun as legal through the legality of conversion therapy.
domestic abuse is illegal, but conversion therapy isn't (and trans people aren't nearly as ""protected"" as the phrase would imply). considering this, i think that it could easily be spun to be legal, since almost all of the demands made could fall within the bounds of conversion therapy, which is not legally considered abuse and thus is legal, and will likely continue to be legal against trans people.
[removed]
i hate doing this but... source? because as of my knowledge, the UK government hasn't yet made any legislative motion to ban conversion therapy other than simply stating that it will do so, and even so, they're only planning on banning conversion therapy based on sexuality, not gender identity, despite the fact that the opposition, and even quite a few tory MPs, are constantly saying they should ban it completely
That depends. It certainly seems like it shouldn't be, but that certainly doesn't mean it necessarily counts as child abuse in the eyes of the law. In the end, it all comes down to precedent. Or just who has the best lawyer.
yeah, it does suck. then again, blue counties aren't all as horrible as they seem, at least from my experience living out in great yarmouth (tory safe seat, currently held by brandon lewis), but then again, i'm also a shut-in who never leaves her room, and i do often get misgendered (not in an aggressive way but still) by people who only know me as emilia, showing at best a low level of understanding, and at worst a lack of respect, so i can't really say it's the best.
Agree. This is the way. You do not deserve this, and your parents are behaving in a horrific manner. You have to look out for yourself. Stay strong.

Detransition is extremely rare, I’ve heard numbers like less than 1% of the community detransitions voluntarily. And in those situations it normally seems like they’re transitioning for the wrong reasons. In your son’s case, if it’s something he’s expressed interest in for 2 years at this point, it could be a good chance to let him experiment with presentation and identity. Nothing permanent has to be done until you’re both comfortable with it
What about friends and their families, that’s what I ended up doing for a while then my mother finally kinda came to terms
Yeah I see your point but tough love never worked on me. We gotta build their confidence up! Or else they might not even ask for help in the future

Edit: changed 'Have' to 'yeah' and 'in' to 'on.' Lol new phone
that is true, but we are talking legality here. no matter what we think, the state has the final say, especially in these urgent situations.
this is domestic abuse

and you  are  facilitating  it   with you   transphobic  assertions
One of the few things I hate about the UK
[deleted]
I did some searching and what you wrote is all I found. No law on the books yet. Along with what you wrote, they also aren't banning it for anyone over 18 who consents or is coerced into having it.

I have 4 girls funny enough. Never had a son
that is an option but most friends parents are supportive of me but too scared of my parents to do anything to actually support me.. last time a parent used my correct name they received a series of very unfriendly messages from my parents
You are correct. Confidence is an important building block to sustaining the resistance against those who hate you for existing.
Correct me if I'm wrong but to my knowledge is child abuse not legal in the UK. Sure the state has a final say but I'd say op has a pretty solid case
do you think i like this? do you think i enjoy living in this fucking hellhole of country just because i point out how fucked it is? 

Whether you, i, or anyone else likes it, the law doesn't define abuse based on what you feel is abusive, and domestic abuse is very easy to spin as just ""an alternative form of parenting"" especially since conversion therapy's legality means that the law won't necessarily recognise any of this behaviour as abusive, no matter how abhorrent we know it is.
They never said that it WASN'T transphobia. They explained the UK context wherein conversion therapy for trans is allowed authorities may not see it as abuse but an attempt at conversion therapy thereby siding with the parents.

Me explaining that does not excuse it, defend it, or in any way shape or form justify conversion therapy. It is absolutely barbaric. But this is something the OP may need to consider in crafting a plea for help to accentuate the abusive elements vis-à-vis the demands for detransitioning (which is to an extent legal over there with additional complications when involving a minor). 

So you got two forces at play: the abuse of the parents, and the legality of conversion therapy in the UK with the added shittiness of legal guardianship of a minor.
You shouldn't judge someone trying to see the context to understand the problem, this person isn't being transphobic. Stop being inclusive, that's the total opposite idea of what we are talking about here. The goal is to help someone in need, not sending this someone to a worst scenario, jeez...
Yes but in the UK the police allow domestic abuse as long as the abuser calls it conversion therapy.

That's the point.
She's not being transphobic tho??????
[removed]
It’s probably not illegal but it may be illegal to force a person to de transition
Fair enough. It's a foolish, but common, mistake to think the government will actually do what it says its going to do, and I wouldn't blame you for making it.

It sounds like you may have one now! I wish you luck though I know it’s a hard situation. I’d say just try to work with them and do what you’re comfortable with. As scary as the idea is that they’ll do something they regret, there’s also the opposite that they miss out on stuff by not doing it
Thanks for confirming  you endorse domestic violence.
No they do not .

Stop being a transphobic liar and child abuser.

One of the arguments  that is being used against  a conversion  therapy ban is that coercive  control like this is all ready illegal
Absolutely  is  claiming that it's legal because  conversion  therapy isn't a criminal offence. 

This is domestic abuse and coercive control which Absolutely  are criminal matters.
Said with all the confidence of a new account.

I heard anyone who ever loved you was wrong. That was the smartest person who told me that. A great person.  The best. Simply tremendous.
There's no written law in place to say that's the case, so that would come down to precedent, or, if there is no precedent, it would come down to who has the best lawyer.
They're all rich, cis/het white men, they are not ever going to fully understand how we feel.
[removed]
Go spread your hate somewhere else, you are on the attacker side here
Im not saying that's 100% the case, however I'm explaining that the law is not often so cute and dry, and cases like these can be incredibly slippery, especially if you know how to twist the truth and the law in your favour. I'm not saying that it's OK because it's legal, or vice versa. I'm saying that the world is cruel, and the law doesn't always work the way we think it should, so just calling the police and hoping for the best is not always a viable option.
Try reading it again; she's saying that it could be *spun as* conversion therapy to get out of legal repercussions, not that it's in any way morally acceptable.
I’d argue that it is neglecting a child’s access to health care. 
In Australia we work under UK common law and sometimes when they are about to implement a law they stop prosecuting under the current rules even though it’s not fully in writing yet. 
Sadly I’ve read the conversation laws in the uk don’t cover trans people which is disgusting.
I wouldn't necessarily say that about the whole of parliament, in fact most of parliament wants to ban conversion therapy entirely, but the prime minister really doesn't, and most of the tory party are too busy sucking him off (sometimes literally) to give a shit.
[removed]
Really  ? 

I'm not the person telling the OP that  the abuse they are receiving from their parents is acceptable , and that  it's conversion therapy but it's ok because it isn't banned.

Give your head a wobble transphobe...
oh, you do not want to get into the uk's terrible trans healthcare. anyway, this is specifically relating to social transition, as it doesn't seem like OP has started medical transition yet, as may be a different story (though i wouldn't count on it)
I agree, but there's still a critical lack of representation in parliament.
The whole point is that we're saying it's not acceptable, but it is legal and that's what we're disgusted with.... Well and you but still
>I'm not the person telling the OP that the abuse they are receiving from their parents is acceptable

They didn't say this.

>and that it's conversion therapy but it's ok because it isn't banned.

They didn't say this.

In fact they stated this VVVV a whole 9 hours before you posted the above -

>the law won't necessarily recognise any of this behaviour as abusive, *no matter how abhorrent we know it is*.

So its clear they dont think the whole thing is ok, and you are clearly *choosing* to have a bad faith interpretation.

Stating that something isn't a crime ≠ endorsing that action

Waking granny up with an airhorn is probably legal, but we can all agree its a shitty thing to do.

Conversion therapy has been a hot issue in the UK recently, and it is being actively kept legal by the government despite popular opposition. That doesn't mean people think that's ok, but it does mean that *conversion therapy* specifically is not illegal. It isn't considered abusive, regardless of the fact that we all know it is.

Should it be illegal? Yes.

Is stating that it currently isn't, transphobic? No.

Not that any of that matters as the contract is in no way legal in the first place. You're punching in the wrong direction, and it isn't helping anyone here, you, OP and the rest of the community included.
Everyone already explained that isn't what they said and you're still freaking the fuck out. Calm down and think for half a second

And quit throwing around the word transphobe at non transphobic people. It ruins the word asshat
yep, i can definitely agree with that, though it's nothing compared to the uk supreme court (albeit that the way the supreme court are selected means that being old is kinda a given and becoming more diverse would first require the field of law to become more diverse, so it's understandable that diversity in the supreme court is a few decades behind)
They're supposed to represent the general public lmao.
I'm aware. But at least the government is transparent. In the UK, we kinda take for granted that we can just read about or watch almost all of the proceedings of parliament, sometimes live or even in person, and all for free at that. Our government sucks, but at least we have access to all of the info we need to know exactly how they suck

I know transgender identities can be confusing, but this is a first		"1) this feels hilarious and I am not offended particularly but I did list a binary gender on my forms 

2) how do I ask them to stop clarifying my preferred versus legal name? Every person who came into my exam room started the conversation like this: “so you go by [name]?” “Yes” “you don’t use [deadname]?” “No”. I don’t want to hear my deadname. If I have a preferred name on my chart, and a preferred name on my intake forms, and a preferred name on all my other paperwork, why do they have to say my deadname out loud to start the interaction every time?
You were born a kid just because you take hormones doesn’t make you an adult!
""Are you a boy or a girl?"" ""I am an adult."" ""No, like what's in your pants?"" (Leans in close for a whisper) _""Taxes. ""_
Interesting! I'd probably prefer it like this, since I'm non-binary.
AAAB
My brain thought the Y was the weird part, and I just automatically assumed *'oh that's pretty cool, if this person was born XY, then this immediately skips the gender or sex issue and allows medical professionals to understand what base set endocrine organs the person more than likely has so they can take certain medical conditions into consideration for them. That's really cool and progressive actually! I like that!'*

And then, after looking through the comments and being very confused, I saw 'Sex: Adult' and realized the Y meant 'years'. My brain completely ignored the weird part of the paperwork and hyper focused on a single letter and made an entire concept up in my head on what this specific letter could mean. Excuse me while I go have a lie down until my ADHD meds kick in lol
When I see ""sex"" on a form, and there's enough room, I'll put ""no thanks"". It's nobody's business what's under my skirt. I'm seeing more and more forms that have a separate box for gender now.
uh yeah i sure hope it does
Gender? Come on, grow up./s
You’ll never be an adult!!! Once a baby, always a baby!!!
I prefer this honestly
Damn. I wish they put that as my sex on my ID lol
Oh yes, the only sex: adult
Babe, wake up. New gender just dropped
Why didn't you redacted the Medical Record Number?
Whenever it asks my sex..I answer ..YES PLEASE 😅🤣
Shout-out to adults, gotta be one of my favourite genders
Ah yes trans people have sex with adults
My personal favorite gender is [blank space left in drop down selection menu that still works as input]
I unironically want that
Beats being misgendered😓
mine says child
Ah yes the three genders, man, woman, and adult.
I’ve had a pharmacist ask me “So you don’t look like a [deadname] what’s your preferred name?” and my response was “I’m picking these up for my brother.” 

I actually picked it up from a dude I think might have possibly been trans at the same pharmacy. He and I had had a conversation about the trans pin on my purse in line. It’s a lion in trans colors and he said it was super cool and wanted to know where I got it and stuff (of course I gave him the artists name) during his turn, he was talking to the pharmacist and mentioned that his sister was taking x as well and he wanted to make sure the med he was picking up for her didn’t interfere with it. 

When I got back to my car it hit me “Oh my god he was trying to subtly tell me he was trans too!” (Cuz you don’t clock or out someone in public, you know?!) and I was like… omg what if he was picking up his meds under a deadname. You are allowed to pick up other peoples meds, like I do for my husband sometimes, and I realized in that instant that I didn’t have to be deadnamed at the pharmacy if the meds I’m picking up aren’t for me. I have no idea if he was actually trans, I literally just started connecting dots that may not have connected irl but it gave me this amazing idea and I haven’t looked back since.
Me buying the Adult labeled vitamin gummies instead of the Women’s or Men’s

Congratulations. You're an adult now
That’s one sexy adult, legally!
I have all my legal documents and insurance documents changed to Male but the medical systems will still list my sex as adult, its actually a little annoying to me at this point because I went through all the work to get them to change it to Male but they won't change the wristbands.
Sex: yes please

Ah, yes. The third Sex...adult
""You don't use [Deadname]?""



Would you Dig Up Your grandpa and Say he's alive?! Course I don't that's why it's a Deadname Paul!
And the transphobic say in response:     

Stop Trying to be an Adult.  You were not born an Adult.  You're not a real Adult.  You can't just ""choose"" to be an Adult.
Omg I got this on paperwork recently too, which is extra weird since my legal gender has been updated and I'm generally very passing
Well thank god it didn’t say child
The three sexes: male, female, and adult
Thank god it doesn't say ""sex: child""
Offs. We need to replace this M/F/X shit with an endocrine scale or something.

I get so tired of doctors using some there privileges to violate my rights. There is certain hospital group where I live where they will look all records associated with your ssn rather than just the ones pertaining to them then proceed to deadname and pronoun any gender variant person they find and then offer medical in opposition to the person current situation the only reason they haven’t been sued to oblivion is this north Florida and old Ron is an asshat.
that shpuld be the only sex or gender out there, as in: my Sex is adult and my identity and presentation is my choice and therefore none of your damn business!
In the UK after i changed my name aged 24 i had this problem but i went to a Dr's appointment as check up at 25 and he changed it for me, only there was some hilarity at an appointment 4 and a half years later while still pre op, ""so aimee the system is telling me you need a smear test"" i asked what one of those was, ""its cervical cancer check good luck getting one of those from a pre op"" he tinkered around on the file on the computer and ensured that relevant exams would pop up so i will have a prostate exam and breast screening.

ngl it's not inaccurate at all, if you are an adult. a child and an adult do not have the same sex, because the format has not developed sexual maturity yet, you can't really treat the two as the same sex
no let her cook
Oh so *that’s* what the terfs meant by adult human!
I feel that. Despite a legal name change my deadname is in the medicare system until the current card expires. So the only thing with my deadname on it is literally my hormone prescriptions
I was at the dentist last week, and I thought it was really strange how frequently the dentist used my name, like, ""Hi, Cassandra, I'm Dr. Colgate, and I'll be doing your cleaning today, Cassandra. So why don't you just lie down and get comfortable, Cassandra. I'm just going to grab a couple tools, and I'll be right back, Cassandra. Is that alright with you, Cassandra?""

""Yes.""

""Great, be right back, Cassandra.""

Afterwards I saw my form while they were looking at the schedule for the next cleaning, and my info said Deadname ""Cassandra"" Lastname. Like good on them for being diligent with using my name, but like it's my legal name now, so why am I still Deadname in their system? Putting ""Cassandra"" in quotes like that sort of cheapens their efforts imo.
The plebotomists at my local medical office are the WORST with names and a fucking hate it

Almost had one not do my labs because I was insisting that my name was not my dead name

My preferred name is on my chart. I know my MRN by heart because I have to give it up so often. Obviously I know my birthday as well. The gender pathways clinic doctor ordered the labs.

🙄
When they ask, “you don’t use \[deadname\]?” You say, ""Take that name off your charts. That person is dead. My name is \[name\], period.""
Froederts gender clinic kinda sucks. I had issues with them too. I’d just encourage you to trudge through it.
I start the interaction by saying “Hi, my preferred name is blah but my legal name is (first initial or spell it out)” so they don’t have a chance to deadname me and if they do I get weepy and demand they note it on my chart because they should know better! It’s ALL over my charts for good reason
[removed]
The medical professionals in that healthcare system are clueless. I used to go there and they see in my chart I'm on estrogen and I've got boobs and they're just sitting there like ""Hello, Mr.... How can we help you today?"" You're lucky they added preferred name to the forms.
What if I was assigned adult at birth?

Oof
Some medical stuff still has my deadname when I log in. When I go to ""profile"" everything is correct. (My legal name changed years ago.) But Quest still displays my deadname on login, as does a couple of other things. So frustrating. 

The local teaching hospital did fix their software so they use preferred names. Originally their medical records software didn't have an entry for preferred name. When I was transitioning I had some caring providers realize I was trans but got mixed up about MTF vs FTM because the records made it confusing and I had to correct them, so awkward.
usually for insurance purposes, if they file with the wrong name or even the wrong fucking spelling insurance will find any excuse to try to deny coverage
A good phlebotomist IMO is worth their weight in gold but overall the profession is very low status and treated as though it's practically unskilled, so you get these weird, ignorant, truculent phlebotomists who can't learn anything, always think they're right, stick your arm painfully and fuck up paperwork. 

I wish we lived in a society where these basic sorts of jobs were valued and people got rewarded for being conscientious and skilled. All the best phlebs move on to greener pastures. There are no awards for hitting the vein on that person who is impossible to stick, or delivering completely painless vaccines.

It may be updated on your digital card! Everybody has one available on the social security website so it’s worth checking c: i haven’t used my physical in years!
Wow, I'm glad I don't have to deal with that.

I have BCBS. I was warned about changing the gender on my forms. Well, I did it, and nothing happened. All of my claims were approved. (I had to have an endoscopy. I have Barrett's esophagus. It sucks.) So at least in my state they didn't throw a tantrum about inconsistent gender markers. 

They did refuse to cover HRT for a while, per my employer's rules, but we got that changed, so now I have to pay a copay but they cover about half. It's not very expensive.

Don’t forget that’s it’s also possible to make someone so scared of how they’ll be treated by trying to be themselves/happy that they instead do things that progressively make them uncomfortable and depressed because the alternative is some redneck seeing them, raging, then murdering them then proceeding to walk free
And worse you can make people hate themselves for years out of fear they might be what you indoctrinated them to hate.  


Edit: My parents were so close when I was a kid they tried. I was told they would love me no matter what, even if I was gay. Regularly asked me if I was gay because I was different. I would have never confided my truth to them though... How could I tell them I was supposed to be a girl when I saw the way they laughed at those movies with those insulting trans representations. I had no words then, but even if I did I would have choked them down.

I wish I had not learned to hate myself so much it took me decades to find myself again.
I can't understand because I don't know English, it's a shame, I love to understand English, can someone help me
Actually it's important to know that it can happen. It's just not what we're doing
Little kids love lgbt+ people. You have to be taught hate; most people are drawn towards love and live-and-let-live. Its funny how they claim we’re groomers when their church and conservative talking heads groom them to hate from youth via brainwashing related to hell.
Idk man I believe there are triggers of realisation and I really don’t like the stuff being pushed towards childern
Why argue against transphobes if you’re preaching to the choir anyway
You can indoctrinate beliefs but you can't indoctrinate attractions and interests. Sooner or later a persons real interests will show. A cis child can't be made gay because you can't force that attraction forever.
You can indoctrinate them into hating themselves and believing themselves to be worthless, however.
No, but they can try, and I believed it for 30 years
All some people have to live on is hate. That's what gets them out of bed, that's what gets them through their day, and that's what gets them through the night. All they know is hate, and they teach that hatred to their children so *they* get through the day. When a person who lives on hate finds someone who doesn't live on hate, they can't process the alternative life and interpret that as a threat, because it is; it's a threat to the one thing keeping them alive.
Or you test the waters and hear them go “im so happy youre not lgbt+ that is the worst.” As was shown by club q shooter’s father, these people would prefer having a murderer for a kid over an lgbt+ kid. Effing sad.
Off topic, but how did you get that flag under your name?
So true and so sad....
It is actually 2 flags. The trans/ace and the trans/pan. It is in the personal flair options iirc.  It has been awhile.
I can't figure out how to custom do mine because I can't find the polysexual flag.
I just did a quick search through the flairs and pol was not on the list. So it may be that.  
Edit: if it makes you feel beter I have been meaning to change it to oriented aroace for months. While looking for this I noticed that aro isn't available.

UPDATE: My partner IS trans! Thank you for helping me support her!	"POSSIBLE TRIGGERS: difficulty accepting their own identity 

I’m definitely not crying with joy, lol! /s

Things happened a lot quicker than I expected! She is still questioning her gender, but trust has already been established and I’m glad to say she feels good about coming out!

Well, after reading your helpful comments, I decided it was time to shower my partner with love and acceptance, and I had a plan to make her feel safe. I cosplay for fun sometimes, so I invited her to help me with one of my cosplays. I was going for Emily from Stardew Valley (a perfect QUEEN, just saying), so I had a blue wig already with me. She LOVES blue hair.

After she arrived, I said I could do her makeup after I did mine if she wanted. She hesitated, but she very timidly asked “can I try your wig instead?” and, of course, I said yes and helped her put on the wig. Not gonna lie, blue hair fits her perfectly! I have the prettiest girlfriend in the world! She looked at the mirror and smiled… her smile is so cute (yeah, I’m cheesy as hell, sorry not sorry)!

We spent the rest of the afternoon/early evening watching a cooking show we love and cuddling. She was still wearing makeup and the wig. Then, I showed her [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/comments/ntogxm/eggirl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) meme I found while browsing the r/egg_irl sub. She laughed hysterically and just said the softest “yeah”, and covered her face, because she was getting pretty red. Then, I said what almost all of you told me she would love for me to say.

“You know I’ll still love you if you’re trans, right?”

Tears started to show on her eyes, but she shook her head and said “‘nah, I’m cis, I wish I was born a girl, but I’m a guy, there’s nothing I can do about it”. I hugged her and said that her gender assigned at birth doesn’t matter at all to me, and she shouldn’t be ashamed of being who she is. Then, in a very low voice, she said:

“I think I might be a girl then… maybe… I don’t know”

I reassured her again that I would be with her no matter what, and that I would be by her side on her journey of self-discovery. She said she wants to try using she/her pronouns, but just when the two of us are alone. I’m happy she’s finally letting her find herself. 

Thank you so much for all the help! I’m sure, when she’s ready, she will feel loved in this amazing community. 
Makeup tips would be appreciated, lol!"	"My heart can’t handle all this sweetness 😭 You are legit partner goals.
This is so sweet.  Some of us need a bit of a push at times because we have internalized a lot of self-hate and shame.  Not that I know from experience or anything………
I am literally crying 😭 she is so lucky to have a partner like you!
That's so wholesome, I was going to bed and I said to myself ""let'a check one or two posts before bed"" and now i'll go sleeping with a big smile because you're so cute, I wish to your girlfriend a transition without majors problems ❤❤❤
I'm smiling so much from reading this.  This so is precious.  I keep rereading all the cute lines because of how amazing they are.  You're amazing OP!  I love how much you're there to support her.  I'm so glad she feels safe and is discovering herself.  I feel so happy for her!


Also makeup tips: I'm no expert.  There are some really good tutorials on YouTube. Samantha Lux has some good tutorials.

The biggest thing is trying to enhance your cheekbones imo.  Shadow (contouring) around places can make areas look smaller so can be nice on the side of the nose and face as well as under the jawline.  Some on the underside of the cheekbones with highlights on top. 

Eyeliner is also huge.  Just changing eyes can be huge.

If facial hair shadow is a thing like for me.  Laser will help, but until it kicks in some concealer and a color corrector can help.  A bit of orange can help.

A lot will depend on face shape.  A lot of amab have a longer distance between bottom of nose and upper lip.  At least I do.  You can try to add a bit extra lipstick on top or go for a more neutral or nude color to draw less attention to the lips.

Wigs help a ton.  They add so much to face shape.  You may not think you look great, and then bam throw on a wig and your makeup WAS fine. 


I think the last thing is just tell her to be patient.  Makeup takes time to get good at.  I still struggle with eyeliner.  The important thing is to have fun doing it.


I wish you two the best.  You're amazing OP!
Omg omg omg I want a partner like you. This is so wholesome
I wish my ex partner was like you when I came out 🙂
I'm not crying, my eyes are just leaking.

It was so amazing of you to treat her so kindly and make sure she knows that you love and respect her. It makes me so happy to know people like you exist.

You handled that even better than a lot of trans people, including myself, would. She's really lucky to have someone as sweet as you by her side, and I really hope for the best for you two. :)
This is such a wonderful update!! You are the sweetest partner and remind me of my partner.


Fwiw, after checking out your profile and seeing another of your posts, I can say that past me related very much to your gf with not wanting intercourse for ""reasons."" Fast forward through time and therapy and learning more and the real root of the reason wasn't insecurity about size but rather that being the penetrative partner didn't feel natural or right to me, so my subconscious came up with different reasons for not wanting to engage in that role. Of course she might be totally different from me, but I wanted to share some perspective that may help down the line!
Awwwwww. gosh. I am so happy for you both congratsss!!!!!!!!!!!!!  


You're the best!!! :)  
I'm tearing up over here :"")
omg im crying this is so sweet!!
This is such a great thing to read! I wish you both the best in this journey!
Huggles for being your awesome self and celebrating this moment in both your lives!
Your so sweet!! I loved reading this!
Wholesome.......OVERLOAD!
>Makeup tips would be appreciated, lol!

...you called? 

I'd be genuinely happy to help! Reach out to me anytime (or ask questions here if you'd rather) and I'll help as best I can!
Was not expecting to cry when I casually opened up Reddit tonight but here we are. I'm so happy for both of you! \^\_\^,
aww i love this so much!! i’m not crying either no definitely not 🥲
Wow, the emotions this makes me feel! Just wow!
Awwwwwwww

This is so incredibly heart-meltingly sweet. I'm so happy for you both!
This is such a beautiful story! Thank you for sharing this!

You’re an amazing partner, and she is so lucky to have you in her life!
I'm crying because of how sweet this is and how amazing you are. To care that much to watch her emotions and put her first is just so heartwarming. I love it! I wish the best for both of you as you go through what is just the beginning of a journey.
Fyi for future posts, there is actually a ""possible trigger"" flair iydk
It took me weeks to just say I wanted to be a woman due to the internalized transphobia and shame. Which is odd because i've never had the slightest issue with other trans people, but it really was one of those kneejerk ""everyone is valid except for me"" sort of feelings. Hell for a while I could only say that i wanted to transition from being a guy to ""the other one"" because admitting I was a woman was sooo difficult.

It sounds like your support is helping your girlfriend make progress at a phenomenal rate, and you really deserve a pat on the back for your support.
My heart! One of the biggest factors of being able to finally come out and embrace my gender is because my partner has provided safety, honesty and support during this journey. I’m so glad you can do that for your partner too!!!
Your partner is very lucky to have such a supportive and loving person in her life.
This is SO WONDERFUL! You are an amazing partner <3
Love Love Love it
This is the most wholesome shit ever 😭
This is so cute and wholesome!

Your gf is really lucky to have your as their partner!
Crying on a Thursday morning, I'm so glad you're there for her and that the blue wig was a success.
The world needs more lovely people like you 😘
Awwwww, my goodness, it's so dusty in here all of a sudden.
you are amazing, you both are, this is soo  sweet <3
IT'S TOO CUTE SEND HELP
She's very lucky to have a partner who accepts her and went to look for understanding like you did.  It's nice to see the dream scenario 😌.
I'm gonna melt, this is so cute and wholesome! Wish I had gotten that type of response from my STBX (would have made things much less lonely), but that relationship ending was for the best for both of us on many levels.

Glad to hear things went so well, and best wishes to both of you!
I have had a migraine for the last three days. My mood was crap, I'm tired and cranky.

And now I'm crying happy tears because this shit is so beautiful and I love it so much, like damn.

You two are an amazing couple and I hope you stay in love and happy together for a long, long time <3
I want a partner like you your awesome
OP, you're an amazing partner! I'm glad you helped give your partners egg a little tap to show you love her. As a trans girl myself, I can say for certain, awesome partners like you make a huge difference in our lives. Keep being supportive and I'm super glad you helped her out! :)
You are a great partner and very kind
This is so wholesome… who’s cutting onions? 🥺😭
This is one of the best things I've seen all day
My...heart...

I'm so happy for you guys!!! I hope you both have a wonderful time together with this new discovery. ^^
This is such a beautiful story. My partner is having trouble figuring out how to support me being trans. I wish they would reach out like this and support me like you are for your partner. I couldn't love your post more
ahhh! so cute!
This is the most beautiful thing I've read in a while 💜 😭
This is cute
You’re based AF! That’s some partner goals right there!
Nawwwwww. All the 💜
This made me cry at the train station, thank you ❤️
Well I reading this was like a big hug in the morning she's lucky to have somebody like you
This is so incredibly sweet, I'm just sitting here, crying from reading this. She can be very happy to have you in her life, I think you handled it very very well and it sounds like she trusts you a lot considering she generally has trouble talking about emotions and stuff like that. Congratulations on her starting the way of discovering and accepting her true self and on you for having an incredibly cute sounding girlfriend! I wish you guys all the best on this journey 💖
Now I'm getting choked up.. this is so beautiful to read. Nothing in the world makes me happier then to see someone discover their true gender identity. I'm so happy for your girlfriend and you!!!
My fucking heart. Omg this is so sweet and loving its perfect.

I know your gonna hear this a lot but you are an amazing love filled person and this post gives me the most hope I've ever had 💕

All the best to the two of you
I'll read this again and cry later when I'm not in the middle of the office. I'm so happy for both of you!
I am NOT crying ok?
Right out of a movie 🥲☺️
That sounds so sweet and cute! I'm happy for both of you \^\^ 

I wish my girlfriend was that supportive for my being mtf instead of just accepting, I've felt quite jealous \^\^' 

Congratulations and good luck girls!
This is the best and most wholesome thing I’ve ever read bar none ❤️🙏🎊
This is amazing!
Please excuse me, I believe someone is cutting onions in here.
Honest to god you are so teethrottingly sweet I can almost hear my dentist cry.
I admire you greatly and I wish we all had someone like you there for us.
Love and support from the Netherlands!
I'm tearing up at work reading this. You are the partner everybody needs. You are a beautiful, wonderful person. I hope life takes you two to incredible places <3 congrats to you and your partner! :)
This both warms and breaks my heart...I'm happy for the both of you! You are awesome! The world needs more of you! 🥰❤️
OMG, All the feels right here!
This is the most beautiful thing I've read in a looooong time. 🖤🖤🖤
“Feels targeted. Shot fired. Target has been hit right in the feels.”
Yayyy congrats! Stardew Valley is so perfect, and so are you two. Hope your love will continue to grow 💖🥺😍❤️💖
Omg I would have cried if I didn't have this annoying testosterone in my body. So heartwarming! (｡♡‿♡｡)

""I might be a girl then... Maybe... I don't know""
I feel this so hard xD, but I think I'd rather go in that direction than stay how I am.

I hope you and your girlfriend have a wonderful time together and she's very happy to have such a wonderful, caring and loving person like you <3.
OMG, this is so sweet and touching... You and your girlfriend seem to be totally cute and wholesome! Great you could talk even though it took some time for her to really open up. (I mean, that's absolutely understandable! I've also looked at your other post from before, and regarding her backstory, it's no wonder she supressed those feelings and thoughts for such a long time...)

I wish you two the best but I'm sure it will all get better now with all your loving and support. <3 (Sorry if anything sounded strange, I'm German, haha.)
I was already having a teary day, and now I'm ugly crying after reading to the end. Congratulations to both of you, and especially her! Thank you for being so patient and letting her get to her feelings while making her feel safe enough with you to do so. You are a good human 💙
i think you're single-handedly causing the entire sub to cry tears of joy....i'm in bio class rn and im tearing up and i **rarely** cry
Awesomeness!!! ❤️
OMG!! I'm not crying! So sweet!
I really envy her such a supportive partner
You are amazing! Every person should strive to be as supportive and loving as you are. I wish you two a long life of happiness and many years together. I hope one day I can find someone who'll accept and love me no matter what I choose with my body
This literally made my day! I saw your initial post and I'm sooo happy for you both. The world needs more of your kind heartedness, love, and acceptance. 

DM me, seriously, for makeup help. I have watched enough YouTube about it and specifically things for trans women that I feel like I should have an honorary cosmetology license. 

Love and happiness to you both 💜
This is so heart meltingly sweet, you're doing a fantastic job for her. For you both. This is a scary time for her but so exciting too. If you ever need more specific info down the line we're happy to give it.
That is so adorable! I’m glad that while she hasn’t exactly answered her question of who she is that she has someone as supportive as you are to help het in her journey though! It’s a long road, and a difficult one at times with lots of ups and downs.
I literally crying right now!! You and your partner sound so sweet!! Your partner is so lucky, I'm so happy for you both 🥺😭
I'm not crying you're crying
As far as makeup tips, if she has to deal with covering beard shadow you're going to want orange color corrector. I used to use one that came in a pen that worked pretty well but I went through them very quickly since I was using like a hundred times would a cis woman would use lol. Until I had laser hair removal and didn't need to cover beard shadow, I'd put down a layer of the orange color corrector, put that under a layer of concealer, and then put foundation over the top of it all
You're such a great person ❤️
This makes my heart so happy. Sending you both so much love.
I or g my gosh, I’ve spent DECADES on literally “I wish I was born a girl, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”
I'm sure you know this already, but you are amazing. Your partner is one lucky, lucky gal.
Woo 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Give her all of the hugs from us!!!
💝
Good. Good. Yeah my coffee didn’t have enjoy tears in it. Ty OP. Ty

AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
IM NOT BAWLING YOURE BAWLING 🥺🥺🖤
Beautiful story from a beautiful person <3

Wish you all the best in supporting your girlfriend
Thank you for the love! <3
Virtual hugs for you! I know I’m just a random stranger online (and we’re probably geographically far away), but please know that I care about you and your feelings are valid! And yes, she still has a lot of self-hate, not only because of her gender, but I know she will be able to heal… and so will you :)!
I’m sorry that you’ve had to internalize this. The world is cruel to trans people, and we deserve so much better.

You’re a beautiful example of humanity - all of us who are trans are. Being trans is simply a part of the human experience, no matter how many people want to deny or destroy that.

We will not be erased, and we are beautiful.
First of all, I was assigned female at birth, identify as a woman and I too struggle with eyeliner! Lol

Second, thank you so much for these tips! I’ll check Samantha Lux out! I’ll probably learn a lot for myself as well, so me and my girl can practice together! Sounds like a fun activity!
I’m so sorry they weren’t supportive! Virtual hugs! I hope you find/found someone that truly supports you, because they exist, okay?
I could only do it so carefully because of this amazing community! People gave me some really great advices! Thank you for the love! <3
My boyfriend is trans-masc and while I also don't generally like using that thing with him taking control on top, taking good care of erogenous zones I didn't even know I had, and the way he moved I was able to imagine he was the one inside me and not be all icky feeling. I still wasn't really getting much from the thing itself but I really enjoyed the experience as a whole.

So just, something to take into consideration if you want to try something like it. I'm sure my description was garbage though...
Yep, that makes a lot of sense now that I think about it! I’ll talk to her about it when I have the opportunity!
Thank you so much! It is quite late where I live now, but tomorrow I will reach out!
Thank you for that!
What? I just want her to be happy! If she’s trans or not, I’ll be there for her! I’m bi, so really, her identifying as a man, woman or neither is just a detail to me! I love her for who she is! I’m just joyful that she trusts me enough to share her thoughts and feelings and that she’s letting her find herself!
Thank you, I appreciate it!  I’m actually married to a wonderful woman that has helped me quite a lot.  She told me that in ten years she wants to renew our vows and I can either be a man again or we can both be women.  She knows which one I wanted of course.  We have already decided that the picture (in ten years) will go in a space next to our wedding picture!  

It turned out, she was afraid I’d leave her if I transitioned and I was afraid she’d leave me!  Neither of us are going anywhere and I had so many long conversations with her after coming out to both her and myself at the same time.  I really recommend you ask your girlfriend about her experiences.  When she first thought about wanting to be a girl, If she ever tried on women’s clothes when she was younger, etc.  if she’s anything like me, the dam will break and everything will come out.
Yassss makeup together sounds so fun.
Thanks honey, the journey is tough but it gets better every day. X hugs back at you 🤗
No you're totally right! That's exactly what my partner and I do, and it feels almost like she has the penis and I've had my GCS. It's the only way we can be intimate: me on top, straddling her, her on bottom legs out straight. It's super close and intimate.
Fair enough. Sorry if I sounded like a dick. It’s just you’re saying her her her she she she, and they’ve said “I don’t know”.. sounds like you’ve decided for them. 

I have just seen first hand how people can be misguided by the love and affection they receive when coming out. Like.. they never received that as cis, and now they do as trans, no wonder it feels like the answer. 

And, understandably, I don’t think the trans community is very good at supporting people who are unsure. It’s always a push to transition and not a push for self-discovery. Not talking about you, just in general. 

When people are their own gender, they get nothing but as soon as they post themselves as the opposite gender, they are showered with love and affection, it must be really confusing for people already confused. It was for people I know.
That’s so wholesome! And yes, that’s a great idea! I’ll ask her about her experiences!
Confusing or not, no amount of positive or negative external feedback is going to change whether someone is trans or not. Same for being gay or in other ways queer. And I've seen loads of people advocating for self-discovery rather than pushing for a false positive, particularly on mypartneristrans.
Thank you, i know you dont know me but thank you.

I see a lot of myself and my ex (it didn’t work for other reasons) in the two of you and that fills me with indescribable joy. People like you are sometimes the only thing that makes this world survivable and i wish you both the very best.

I dont know if you’ve seen this around but i like giving this link out because it literally changed my life.
https://turnmeintoagirl.com/
Did you ask her about it and did it go well?  Some things are hard to get out initially.
Okay, that’s the cutest website ever, I’m sending it to my girlfriend right now!
Hi! I was finally able to talk to her in person about it! It was very emotional and quite hard for her, but it was a great conversation!
That’s really great!  I was able to do it a little easier with my wife because we have been married for well over a decade at this point.  Being younger and still (most likely) ashamed and scared of who you are inside makes it a lot harder to talk about.  I’m so glad it worked out.  I bet you’re closer than ever now!"	qmazf7	trans	2479	0.96	2021-11-04 02:43:02
trans rage	"i don't think we talk about this enough, if at all. it's almost like trans people aren't allowed to be angry, yet a significant part of my experience has been characterized by anger. facing transphobia has almost never made me ""sad"" in the way society likes to portray queer people to be - i am not going to cry if you misgender me, i will rip you to shreds, or at least wish i could. 

i have developed a pretty thick skin after being out for years in a still very transphobic country, honestly, but having to face the same shit over and over and over again, nearly every single day, i honestly don't have the words to describe how infuriating it is.

and at the end of the day? i'm still expected to be the one educating people and ""being patient and understanding"" if they don't get it. fuck that, and fuck you. i should not have to explain my identity to every single person that interacts with me. i should not have to put up with being misgendered and outed because ""you just can't understand the concept"". living in a cis society is so. fucking. exhausting."	"I feel the same. I don’t want people to use my anger to think that trans men are violent, as those who stand against us think our “evil testosterone” makes us bad people or something.
I definitely feel like if I get angry, people are going to tell me, “how very like a MAN of you!”
Fuck being sad, we should be full of rage.
Yes. rage has characterized my experience far more than sadness post-transition. I got sir'd by a huge group, ignored them, then they all kept shouting sir at me, trying to get my attention. My tits are so obvious, def presenting femme, and there they are just sirring their hearts out. I cursed their entire family line. Sorry / not sorry.
Feel the same way with my parents my parents are openly transphobic and I bought a dress and they both yelled at me called me spiteful and disrespectful and they took my phone luckily I was able to get it back to see this lol
I've got anger issues so its even worse when people make me feel like the stereotypical trans woman
I get pissed off but I never let em know that. I just give em the “are we really doing this right now?” Look cuz that’s all the space in my mind I’ll give em
Doesn't help that I'm autistic and have meltdowns. Thankfully I've never been around a non-accepting person when they happened
This is it my queers the post i have been searching for years. I'm an anarchist queer trans woman and i have always said i dont need to pass for no mother fucking body nor do i need to fit the status quo of what you think us trans women should be. I pass as myself and i will be respected or your ass cussed the fuck out. i have called people whiny bitches who don't like the fact i am defiantly me and will remain the woman i know i am. I don't put up with misgendering or being fetished or only like cause cis men see me as an experiment no honey bunny dummy i am a whole as experience and a beautiful one. the woman i am you can never find because you can't search for this monument.

Bless you for this real post we have needed. I love you for being you i know you are exhausted but please rest and don't let the bastards get you down. much love and shalom always.
We won't be ""allowed"" to be angry until we're considered equals. As of current, the underlying idea is still that cishets *allow* us to exist in public and *grant us* respect/basic human decency, but have the power to retract that at any point.

It's the same as with gay people, with black people, with women, and will be the same with disabled people once trans people have some basic rights established and that'll be the ""new"" big social topic - not in the sense of ""we move from one thing to the next"", but as in ""the next thing white cishet progressives decide to grant a voice"".

The idea that we're lesser is what allows them to do the tone policing - if we were the ""higher""/more socially accepted party, we'd be the one able to tone police transphobes while them not being anything but kind to us in public would lead to public outcry.

That being said, not to incite anything, but it's not like the marginalised groups i mentioned above got their rights by being peaceful and not getting in their oppressors' way, so...
I am incredibly angry all the time about this exact same shit.
You know there is a statistical tendency where ppl with lower income tend to be more social

And ppl with more money just tend to go the opposite way

Bc they have the option to not deal with ppl when they dont want to

We seem to generally avoid ppl when we have the option

Like ppl are building guarded societies and stuff to keep all those idiots out and not having to deal with them

Like we have the social value of


Everyone matters and is valuable


But it seems a lot of ppl seem to be not as striking to ppl when they have the option, and they still do fine without them


Like thats a statistical generalisation, still

I remember some rapper beeing like

""i really want to support the ppl in my old shit neighbourhood, but they just keep stealing my shit""


Same as area for me as

""Democracy assumes a informed population ""


Like we are not gonna say anything explisit

But like ppl seem st be sht
That's a pretty good observation. I can't say what the FtM experience of that would be, but as an MtF person, I definitely feel what you're saying.

It's like on the one hand women are socially conditioned not to show anger. And growing up as a closeted trans person, nevertheless I subconsciously absorbed and tried to follow a *lot* of female-coded social conditioning.

But on the other hand, testosterone. And anybody who says T doesn't shorten your fuse and put your anger on a touchier trigger, well, they don't know what the F they're talking about.

And on the third hand, the constant paradoxes that being trans subjects you to are genuinely infuriating, so there's a lot of anger to be had. As much as you want, and none of which you feel you're allowed to express. Even if you wanted to, which you probably don't, but it's there anyway.

And it's going to come out one way or the other. You can't keep it all bottled up forever. 

In this bind of having rage that I was not permitted to show, I had to let it out in private. I punched a lot of walls when nobody was around. And, here's your PSA for the day, I don't recommend it. I went through years in college where my right hand pretty much always hurt. I'm certain that I fractured and hairline cracked several bones in that hand, which never really got the chance to heal before the next wall-punch came along.

Don't be like me. Don't punch walls. I'm way older now, and I can tell you, you don't want to get to my age regretting the arthritis and chronic pain you're going to have to endure for the rest of your life in your punching hand, even though you kicked the wall-punching habit years and years ago, knowing that it's your own damn fault for doing that damage in the first place.

But if you're here reading this, you're already ahead of that game. The rage didn't start to go away until I figured out I'm trans and could start processing these feelings in an accurate context for once. If you're here then you know you're trans, so you can go down a better path than I did.
YES. The one that super gets me is that sometimes the CIS will come and comment or post in a queer space like this and if anyone says ANYTHING other than ""ooohhh poor baby! Let me teach you you perfect star child, thank you for just being here!"" Then it's the queer folk who get dogpiled for not coddling. I'm all for education and for not being cruel, but holy shit sometimes people need to be told that they just need to do better and that anger doesn't seem to be allowed.

Here’s an essay about Trans rage I think y’all might communicate with, if meant a lot to me
I like this energy of yours, which I share myself. Being a femme trans girl, is not going to stop me from cursing the sh\*t out of myself, if I come across a degenerate bigot.
I get what you mean. Then we are told ""just go somewhere more accepting"". Like do they realize that they are defending bigotry? I hate society
I just get cold and calculating anymore.  I don't get sad or mad, I think ""what's the quickest way to get me away from this person that would cause the least drama?""  They don't deserve my anger or sadness.  I just want them to leave me alone.
I have spent so much time being angry (or in fight or flight) since coming out. I discovered my family members, who said they would support me no matter what are actually incredibly transphobic/homophobic, and I’m afraid of being a hate crime stat. anytime I am out in public when I dress or present how I feel most comfortable and my authentic self. I am tired of it. I hear you, and I’m so sorry. I am of the mindset that rage is part of the “experience”. It helps me remember there’s something we’re fighting for, and that the world is changing. It gets exhausting not yelling at or swinging at transphobic people, though.
This is true words. I haven't been trans long but the entire time its been nothing but anger.
I completely agree. Dealing with ignorance and bigoted people on a daily basis is so tiring and it makes me so annoying, angry and disappointed. I hate it so much, but I can’t do anything because no one likes to take trans people (and queer people in general) seriously.
My least favourite thing of all is when you express the anger/frustration and Cis friends say something along the lines of “nobody’s going to listen if you’re angry” - if your being an ally has conditions, then you’re not an ally. I am not about to reject the identity that society assigned me against my will only to “fit” into THEIR comfortable narrative of what a “good trans” is. 

This is MY life, MY existence, MY experience, and I’m not about to abandon my identity that I worked so hard to be able to have in order to appeal for a superficial “ally” if you’re an ally you’re an ally, no strings attached, no conditions, no expectations for us to adhere someone else’s narrative.
I think our brutal and unrelenting rage needs to be shown. I mean I've literally used Commander Erwin's charge speech when expressing my rage and talking with other trans folk.
while education is important, NO ONE should be *expected* to educate people and feel like they need to justify their existance to people, and that they need to be patient and understand. fuck that. 

personally, sometimes I feel like I'm in a good enough place to try and help people understand, and sometimes its too much for me to even try when I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking at the seams and I want to just be myself. My experience has been largely sadness but a good ammount of anger too. dunno what else to say but yeah.
There need to be safe and understanding places to just VENT OUT ALL THE FRUSTRATION WITH EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

Be patient and understanding, everyone's patience has its limits, nobody has infinite patience and you are expecting too much from trans people. Nobody's a f\*\*\*\*\*\* saint. And when trans people get tired and overwhelmed (like normal humans) people make it a much bigger deal.

This honestly also goes for sexual minorities, racial minorities, disabled people, any type of minority. There should be spaces where you're just allowed to scream and vent without being judged for it.

Or how people don't understand the difference between venting and actual hate. Sometimes you just want to scream how cis people are unbearable, but you do it after an awful interaction and you need to get it out of your system. That's not hate, that's actually necessary for a healthy mind. Vomiting the anger out of you is healthier than keeping it inside.

Mental health is stigmatized and misunderstood. Add transphobia on top of that and it's a mess. I'm really glad the trans subreddit has a ""vent"" tag because that is so very needed in this environment.
It’s unfortunately the price we have to pay for doing nothing other than be our authentic selves
I mean, those are the kind of emotions that start protests, and protests get us rights, so no complaints here.
I feel the same way makes me want to commit arson on their st**id ass
I’ve gotten pretty vengeful towards the right wingers since coming out as MTF. I never realized how hard they try to actually stop us from existing
I feel the same way. I live in the states; Texas specifically. I am misgendered every day by my own mother and some of my own friends. I infuriates me and yet I have to be patient. I am lucky enough to be in a very tolerant high school with a lot of fellow trans/queer teens. But I'm still in the southern U.S we're I can be discriminated against just be cause I want to be a girl, or because I like guys and girls. I still have to be patient, I still have to be educating, and I still have to keep a lid on my temper. Because I know that is even one trans kid blows up at a transphobic cis person than the entire trans community could be cracked down on, and it could give the GOP the ammunition they need to start hunting us down like animals.
I agree, if someone doesn't understand than whatever, how hard is it to understand I'm a person with a gender. Treat me like a person, if it confuses you that's because you're overthinking it or looking at it wrong. I don't need a whole interaction explaining why I exist.
100% agree I can’t stand it either
I completely agree, I'm non-binary and pan, I live in the Netherlands and it's not that transphobic or homophobic around me but still having to even explain that there's more then 2 genders is indeed exhausting. One of my previously friends couldn't understand aroace boyfriend - boyfriend relationships and it's so aggravating that some people don't even try to understand like it's a puzzle they can't solve but disrespecting all of us affected, we're not the ones that should educate us, people assigned to should so frig those extra math exercises and teach people about us.
I feel this so much my community is so toxic about anything around gender identity and sexualities to the point that me coming out has cause me to be unable to get a job where I live and has made life a living hell, I’m only 18 and recently decided to tell everyone who picks on my for my large breasts that I identify as male and they can leave me alone or face the consequences but now because I stood up for myself I can’t make money to fucking survive!!
I totally feel this way. Take my upvote
“have a thicker skin!” 
*does that*
“you should feel more like a normal person!”
:/
i have like almost no emotions anymore because ive learned to accept like everything to the point the only emotion i really feel is happiness and stress
Hugs!!
Exactly, and I’m not allowed to be angry or they call me a man or something of that nature. Hell, I have it so beat into my brain that if I get angry and dare show it, I feel bad because I feel like I’m not giving off feminine vibes or something. I completely agree, I’m so sick of living amongst so many cis people who expect so much out of me and us as a group of people
i am thankful that my BPD rage and trans rage haven't decided to hold hands. i fear what i would do if they did.
A great essay at least tangentially connected to this is Susan Stryker’s “My Words to Victor Frankenstein above the Village of Chamounix: Performing Transgender Rage”
When I came out to my parents as a trans man, my mom tried to blame it on period hormones. It should be socially acceptable to beat the shit out of transphobes.
One thing that really makes my blood boil is how cis people justify their tranphobia and shitty behaviour with “I don’t understand these things” AS IF it were a valid excuse, as if they couldn’t just respect someone regardless of their understanding. And then when you give them attitude, suddenly you’re the one who’s not cooperating, they go “I’m trying SO hard how dare you be so mean to me” fuck that. Parents misgendering and deadnaming their trans children because “it will take some time to get used to it” fuck that, it’s a fucking pronoun you dumbass bitch, get over it.
We always have to be the ones to have patience, understanding, stay calm, give people time to “settle” while they treat us like fucking garbage, fuck that, I’m so over it
I remember when I was still entertaining the idea of having my highly religious cishet grandparents in my life, I'd told them in 2019 and progress was incredibly incredibly slow and could be taken away in an instance; the final nail in the coffin for me was them telling me I ""can't wear a dress or be called Rae or she/her/they/themed"" at my great grandmothers funeral, apparently it was because ""there will be people who don't understand there and we don't you to be upset"" because apparently being furious at how both she and my grandfather tried to manipulate the family into ""getting along"" when one side was abusers and the other victims and being angry at being misgendered by them both constantly was me being ""sensitive""; despite all this I went in a dress like top and leggings, but found out I could've wore a dress because my Gran straight up said ""I really don't care"" about the whole situation she'd invented up for me and then tried her best to ignore for a solid two weeks. I tried one more time after that to get them on the same page, but was told (as I always seemed to be by them) that ""We're not from your generation and God said there is only men and women"" and that I should ""understand"" and ""respect"" their position in all this despite only one of us having actual mental harm from the treatment of the other.  


Anyway the long winded moral of this story is cishet people can thrive up their own arse all day and the instant we even show a slight grimace at their treatment they can jump out of their arses to bellow about how we're being rude for not ""respecting"" them; hopefully one day none of us will have to deal with their shit.
I’m reminded of Shovda, a trans Mario streamers. They are *extremely angry* when a level is pissing them off.

“I’m not good at maker anymore, but I will be good for five minutes to spite your ass. That’s what’s you’re getting (Carl), spite-fuelled fuckin’ trans rage.”
I had to stop E because of financial problems and when all the T came back, I did and still do get angry about stuff. My family are “supportive” but think I need to see a “real” doctor about my emotions.
""If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."" — Satoshi Nakamoto
These transphobes are a bunch of whiny bitches who cry at the notion that someone has pronouns. It's time to grow the fuck up and stop digging your nose into how someone else lives their life. They need to live as they preach and stop getting offended over my existence, you don't see me obsessing over what the fuck is in your pants.
Wait, who says we can't be mad. Im mad all the time. Anger is one of the only feeling i have left!
Whoa, this is SUPER topical! Just this morning I heard a [story on NPR](https://www.wesa.fm/arts-sports-culture/2022-05-09/scholar-says-many-trans-people-are-discouraged-from-publicly-expressing-a-full-range-of-emotions) about a Sal Malatino's new book *Side Affects: On Being Trans and Feeling Bad*. From the story:

>But like anyone else, trans people experience a range of emotions, including negative feelings from fatigue and anger to envy and burnout. It’s just that, as Malatino argues in a new book, most are discouraged from expressing them publicly.
I'm usually okay with questions but have 'Im not a tutorial' days
I just want to be happy I want to get gender affirming surgeries yet I have to go through a shit ton of things to be happy it's seriously not fair
Exactly. Every time I get misgendered the people who know it look at me like ""oh nooo, Im so sorry for u"" 
No. Fuck that. I'm not about to cry, I'm about to make them cry.

The only simple thing people need to understand about trans people is that we are human beings. What do human beings need? To take your rights/genders/kids away? No. We just fucking want respect. If someone doesn't respect me, Im gonna get angry. I hate people that say shit like ""if you want me to respect you you have to earn it"" like fuck no. Respect is a human right you absolute fuck. Admiration is earned. 
I am angry, I am mad, and I am very, very upset.
FtM (23) and still not on hormones yet. This was a year ago when I finally started learning how to be assertive and advocate for myself. I don't remember what exactly I said, but I stood my ground against my mom and her reaction was to ask me if I had started taking testosterone without telling her. Like for starters, it's none of her f*cking business. And no, as it turns out I'm perfecting capable of metaphorically growing a pair without the help of hormones. 
But yeah, not even anger or agression. Just an ounce of assertiveness and people want to start demonizing trans people and hrt.
cis ally here to tell you that you're just as human as everyone else, and I don't expect you to hide your emotions. i hope i didn't say anything offensive.
Can the revolution start already?
Here's what one African-American writer said about the burden of ""explaining"" racism to white people.  By no means am I equating racism and transphobia; nevertheless, I think the sentiment applies to trans people, too.

>Day after day, year after year, one swallows the   
taste of bile over seemingly minor incidents that cannot be discussed   
lest one be regarded as rude. Then suddenly there is a need to talk, to   
know how one feels and have things explained? No can do.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/08/black-friends-educate-racism/
this really hits home bc like fr? and there aren’t any gsa at my school or anything so i gotta stay quietly angry while being misgendered and having intense dysphoria
Wanna create a country called The Kingdom of Trans? Cause same
Black Dresses, if you want some banger trans rage
I had an experience with someone I was going to work with that wanted to make sure I wouldn’t get super angry and defensive if being misgendered. Like what?  You cannot police my emotions! And do cis people not understand that the anger comes from PAIN!? Pain from dysphoria, a strict gender roled society, transphobia, etc. so of course I’ll emote! I was so shocked.
Me too, I'm stealth in my every day life but I'm so outspokenly trans online and angry. I feel like my strength all these years come from hatred and anger. I hate most cis people I interact with because they have no clue what it's like, and if they guess that I'm trans or knew that I am they're always ignorant and inconsiderate. My ex that I was with for three years would constantly bring up sex even though he knew it made me uncomfortable. Tried to justify it because he's horny 🥴 and he hasn't had sex blah blah blah, I'm poly for a reason I don't want to do anything until I'm fully transitioned and in debt. It's so aggravating to simply exist sometimes.
I read somewhere once, when I started to recognize my anger, that being angry was a good thing because it meant that I expected better. It's so much easier to wrap my head around being angry at a specific person, making amends or finding closure with one person seems relatively attainable. Being angry at transphobia on the whole is so much harder.

I don't want to ""pass"", I've never felt joy in ""passing"". But 2 years into my transition, I recognize that it makes it a little more bearable to live in tiny ways. I hate that it gives me the privilege of invisibility.

A lot of the things I want to see for trans people everywhere may not come in my lifetime. I don't know what to do with my rage on the days when I've already done all that I can to explain or argue or fight.
It's the ""expected to be patient and understanding"" bit that pisses me off the most. 

It makes me so angry because I could literally show the TINIEST SHRED of very mild annoyance about, say, a parent continually misgendering me and suddenly every person under the fucking sun has to tell me to show them grace and kindness and support. Like I FUCKING AM YOU DICKHEAD. God forbid I complain just a TINY BIT outside of ear shot from my parents anyway!!! 

You get so much shit for expecting the basic human respect all cis people get handed automically. It's ridiculous. I don't even show outward anger but I sure as fuck feel it a lot of the time. I hate it because I DO show UNBELIEVABLE patience and understanding to people who 100% do not deserve it but the second I step a tiny bit out of line it's ""why are you so angry!! They're TRYING!!!"" fuck off. Seriously, fuck off. I'm so sick of it.
""Have you ever thought about how YOUR transition would make US feel?""

First of all, mum, do you really think I haven't thought about it? Do you really see me as such a selfish person that I wouldn't even CONSIDER your point of view? I have kept in mind the consequences of my identity for way longer than you could ever imagine. The fact that I decided to take action and actually do something should make you proud of how BRAVE I am, not make you think that I do it to piss you off.

And, secondly, I shouldn't. I shouldn't have to think of your pain about this because you shouldn't EVEN feel it. You shouldn't see me as ""your lost daughter"", or as the source of your suffering, because I am not causing it to you. I haven't done a single thing to hurt you, I have just been myself and I am so, SO TIRED of having to justify it.
Cis people: misgenders, berates, in some cases, physically engages us, pass laws to keep us down, and generally are dicks to us

Us: hey you're kind of an asshole

Cis people: Woah there, calm down, don't attack me you violent [slur]. It's obviously all that testosterone in your system
I called out my friend, pissed but not sad, when he said some really inappropriate transphobic things as a joke (I don't fault him, he genuinely didn't understand the significance of what he was saying and I've since helped him to understand) and instead of acknowledging that what he did was wrong or that my feelings were valid he just kinda awkwardly was like ""it's okay if you don't wanna be friends anymore"". Which idk how to explain it but that was him avoiding the topic, not acknowledging it
This anger has only been building since I came out to myself and a few friends. And now I’m like, fuck this I’m going to start E even if only out of spite alone.

And then I go introvert mode and can’t assert myself for shit. Just ahhhhhh.
UGH I feel this. With stuff like having to be Google for people, I try to approach it all with grace and be like ""well, public education fails to teach this stuff, I'll give this person benefit of the doubt and appreciate their asking"" but it definitely uses mental energy especially since I know that if I did blow up, all of a sudden this person's singular interaction with a trans person is a negative one.

For me the worst holding back is getting misgendered and wanting to correct people. That ""it's maam"" video always pops up in my brain and stops me from speaking up, even if the person isn't trying to be mean.

It's hard to explain the feeling of being misgendered, because --at least for me-- it's not quite sad or angry or anything. Mostly it's exhaustion. ""what more do I have to do??""
One book that did this really well was Dreadnought by April Daniels. The main character, Danielle, is an angry person. Not in that she's constantly violent, or wrathful, but in that there's this constant, pervasive feeling of anger that just seems to simmer under her skin. She's sick and tired of everyone else's bullshit, and when the opportunity to be herself comes along, she takes it for all it's worth and basically dares everyone else to come and take it from her.
Yeah, we are treated like second class citizens but have no outlets to express the rage. The result is just going around feeling terrible all the time. I honestly don't know what to do about this. Sending strongly worded tweets feels inadequate, and we don't really have a militant organization. We only have underfunded non-profits that don't take a hard line against transphobia.
There's a huge stigma towards many groups of marginalized people, that they aren't allowed to be outspoken, aren't allowed to be angry, etc. and if they are, they're heavily looked down upon

It's the condescension of the majority
i think of myself as a trans person who's full of roiling rage. Im full of vicious, searing anger and fury for myself and for my trans siblings. Calling out transphobes aint enough i want them dead. I want them to suffer. I want transphobes to feel the pain they cause us ten times over. I want them to beg and plead for their miserable lives at the feet of every murdered trans person. I see stories of trans women being murdered and i want the killers to suffer the most agonizing of deaths and to experience what they give out. I want to tear down transphobic and hateful laws and all the other bullshit that society enforces to try and eradicate us. I want transphobes to see me and feel fear, i want them to know if they dare try and do anything to me that i will fucking break their bones for their choice of being transphobic. I want conservative/hateful right wing people to be intimidated by me. I want to protect and defend all trans people with the righteous fury of the gods. I wanna be that obviously queer guy at pride whose presence comforts the marginalized, and scares the bigots off from trying anything hateful. And i wanna have the physical strength and weaponry to defend anyone who needs it. I want to utterly destroy the colonizer transphobic society that would gladly see us all dead. I want to raze it to shreds and eradicate it and make a better world for everyone.
Don't forget the ""it's MA'AM!!"" jokes you fucking hear every single time you stand up for yourself.

Fucking disgusting.
Fuck yes. Fight.
You can't be patient and understanding with everyone you encounter who doesn't believe that you are who you are. That who you are isn't real, that it is made up. 

I am not trans, I can only know how frustrating it is having your existence minimised from my experience with autism, through the less common people thinking I am not because I can hold a conversation, or through the minimisation of sensory issues. 

I can also very much understand the difference in the levels between these things. If I was trans I would not be able to deal with people. I already struggle with the comparatively pervasive in our society, but much less of a danger to my being, and much less of an affront to who I am. Having my sensory issues not considered ruins my day, fighting back against transphobia can run a great risk, being autistic doesn't put me at an increased risk for violence or sexual assault. 

People who say openly bigotted things, and then ask you to act with decorum, as if politely saying that you should be arrested for using the bathroom in accordance to the fact you identify as a woman, or saying that teaching kids of trans people's existence is predetory, or actively misgendering someone don't waive the expected decorum of a conversation the moment that the statements come out of their mouths.

They breach the social contract in almost every way but because they fulfilled one clause, acting polite despite their vitreol, they think that you as a trans person should be forced to act polite as well, and to uphold everything they disregarded.
As a kid I always internalized this one anime villain's thing about him not showing anger and just being cold so I don't think I've ever got this problem, people just act intimidated by me lol

But it really is odd how online people misgender me on purpose and act like I'm going to have a meltdown while in reality I care more about the speck of dirt outside
my thoughts go something like this.

""it's not my fault you're stupid, and if you've got questions that don't concern you, then it's not my problem.

If you want to be an ally just change the pronouns, don't judge for being a klutz, and just stay out of the way unless you're going to actually help.""

Usually I just keep my mouth shut, but I just wish others could do the same...
100% feel the same and yeah, a lot of us are just...very mad. And why wouldn't we be? This is totally reasonable. It's exhausting to live in a cissexist, traumatizing society where cis ppl can't even google. When I came out as transmasc, then the questions started. And they basically never stopped. Slap on the transphobia and seeing my peers in pain, scared, it's just a lot?

Of course a lot of us are angry.
I feel this today. Yesterday I came out as a trans man to my parents.
They both refuse to use the right pronouns and my dad told me to ""Never talk to me about this shit again. Do whatever you want with your life, but don't bring me into that stuff.""

Ok dad, one day you and my mom won't be in my life at all.
My two brothers who accepted me and my sister in law will because they aren't transphobic assholes.

I left for work in the morning and when I corrected my mom she said ""Don't say that"" and ""You'll always be my daughter""

I'm so glad I came out because I know that their fucking priorities aren't to love me. There is no unconditional love. I'm so mad and I'm so angry right now.

I honestly feel like crying too though even though part of me knew they wouldn't love the real me.
C’est la vie what can you do
Not having the space to feel frustrated or angry without people blaming hormones or some other important aspect of the trans journey has made me feel like the most crazy individual. Never been gaslighted so hard. 

Before T, if I argued with my mum I was seen as too sensitive and easily shut down. Now (after T) she throws words out like hostile, mansplainer, mental, and has threatened to call the cops because T makes me out of control. (What am I the fucking Hulk?) 

The amount of times I’ve picked up on how wording pre-T and now has changed whenever I show any ounce of frustration is insane. I’m one of the most emotional hate conflict people I know and testosterone hasn’t changed that.
absolutely, it does make me sad, but much much more it makes me want to break every object in sight
FUCK YEAH, LET'S START A *FIRE*

(in a legally allocated place, around which we civilly discuss our frustrations, perhaps raising our voices and using expletives to enhance the mood :3 )
Imagine living in a genderless world?
You'll be treated like if you weren't female or male. Just nothing and everyone is like that... except you.

I'm not trying to shoot you, maybe this day I'm not so patient and have NO FILTERS, because in a sense, I feel like you. I hate to explain even to other trans folks what the F am I.

Many assume I'm like them (i.e., drags, transvestites) l and I'm mistreated by those who claim all the time to be the only ones to be prosecuted marginalized and pissed off.

I'm effing tired of them also. You see, not only you is pissed off today.

Just fuck this world and everyone assuming being trans is a *sexual thing*.

PS: edited fucking typos.
[removed]
i find it alienating even in trans communities. like peopoe get upset when i get angery about them using the q word like in this post while it has no spoiler. it makes me hurt and people still use it
I do get that - and to be honest, it’s entirely understandable. However, anger is practically never the best solution to anything; all it tends to do is spread more anger than actually help.
I 100% agree
I use ti be angry all the time until I started HRT now I'm sad all the time lol
I feel the same.
Yes!
It's just a way to stereotype and invalidate you. Same as the 'gay rage'. No norval person would use it.
I’m not even fully out yet and I feel like a bomb
Like it or not, we are emissaries of our minority status. It is both a blessing (opportunity) and a curse (albatross).

It’s not fair. It’s never fair. But we can use it as an opportunity to be ambassadors for change.
it makes me so angry that i’m not allowed to be angry lmao
hm. i suppose thats reasonable. personally i could never transfer nor. cut my hair much or anything (ftm, family has always refused to let me cut my hair. also too broke to even think of transitioning oet alone a simple haircut unless i do it myself lol) 
so i can't say i understand this much besides the phobia as a general. it always seemed a bit nonsensical to me. 
like confusion is one thing but i mean were all human . yknow - i never even understood the 'testosterone evil raa' . seems a bit cruel to group people like that  . everyone has at least some testosterone . thats just life . i hope it gets better for yall though
Yes... 👏
Trans lives matter. I hope society can do better for y’all. The abortion issue language is also anti-trans. How hard is it to say “people who can get pregnant “ instead of “women.” The bulk of the legislation early this year (in the US) has been anti trans/trans erasure. It’s all going the wrong direction…
I feel you, I live with rage, It's been with me since I was an angry teenager and felt that something was wrong but couldn't figure what yet. The only advice I can give you is to find something to channel it in a positive way, for me it was music, music literally saved my life. For you could be something different, some activity, a sport, art, videogames, whatever that let's you channel all that bad energy in a safe way.
I saw a comment on another post talking about a time where someone was talking shit about trans people in front of them, and they didn’t want to say anything or else be seen as “that one angry trans person” 

Like, BE mad! Is that not a natural response to being shit talked? Let them know you’re not taking any shit. Don’t allow them to think that they can just say whatever.
same
If your testosterone makes you evil, then half of the world's people are evil. Damn, even everyone since cis women have testosterone too (although not that much)
I know this is supposed to be a serious thread, but how do i get the bi and trans flag on my profile? 

Im on mobile
And if I get angry I'm an ""emotional woman."" There's no winning.
I actually got very mad at a karen in my apartment and she said that exact thing i honestly wanted to tear her appart
I always read something about trans women letting their man self out whenever they're angry. Fuck that
Just the other day Joanne had a tweet calling out someone that put a sticker over a TERF flier that had colored knives that said ""TERFS weaponize the patriarchy against transfemmes by telling them what women should be.""

Her tweet was ""you can always tell a real woman by the pretty rainbow way she draws knives."" 

It's just so gross.
And if you're a trans man you get accused of roid raging. And some people really think testosterone and steroids are the same thing. My dad is supportive but even he believed that for almost two years of my transition because of all the deliberate misinformation spread especially during the Olympics.
Is that what it is? I never put two and two together that my breakdowns might be related to my being on the spectrum. I know you didn't intend to help but this actually helps quite a bit. Thank you
Its often said that you should try to be civil, to try and help people to learn about you and your existence, to understand it. To try and aid the ignorant in learning and to dissuade the bigotted through niceties and through setting a good example.

But not everyone can do that. And not everyone should. 

If people are unwilling to learn about how and why a significant group of people exist on their own time, that is their problem. You shouldn't have to walk someone through why you should be allowed to just exist and why your existence isnt a problem.

And frankly, the bigotted will find ammo regardless of whether or not you shout them down or enact violence. If you act nice, they often just think you are one of the good ones, and think that your quality as a person is in spite of who you are. If you act dismissive, they will just make stuff up about you. 

Bigottry is not a smart pattern of though, and it is often reinforced by equally stupid things. At least if someone is publically shamed or smacked, then the stupid thought process of ""if I say this stuff this might happen again"" will kick in and their bigotted asses will be careful next time.

To add, you do not have to pass, and should not have to pass in order to be trans. Its not relevant to what I have to say, but I want to say it so here it is.
thank you, will definitely check this out myself
yes! i was just going to comment the same thing lol
100% agreed. when all else fails, queer rage will force change to occur. no assimilation!

That's the second time this week someone has recommended this piece, so I HAD to look it up:)

I call them I'm not Google days.
amazing idea
i love their music!!!!
queer has been a word used by this community for years, i beg you to educate yourself on the history before deciding it's a dirty word.
You joke, but a large number of people unironically believe this
Like for real i cant be angry as a trans women or shithead transphobes will tell me i act too manly...
A lot of people drank the gender essentialist koolaid from TERFs and unironically spout those views that demonize trans masculinity. For trans men, us taking T is basically like ultra-doping that makes us angry, violent rage machines and unworthy of support/basic kindness.
I used to identify as a cis woman (AFAB nonbinary person here, she/her) and my behaviors make me think I've got more testosterone than cis women usually do.
I go to a trans support group.  I much prefer being around other trans people.  I kind of wish there was a neighborhood in my metro area where lots of trans people lived so I could move there.
Yeah I definitely feel like I’m not allowed to get angry.
She’s obsessed.  It’s like half of her tweets.
Well as MtF I’ve been on testosterone and this has caused anxiety and anger and I was very easy to start rage. So it’s maybe better working in male brain, but for my female brain it was just terrible experience, I cannot go back on T ever.
Aspergerexperts.com have a great webinar called Deep into Defense Mode - it explains that people on the spectrum freeze first, then when they thaw out they go into fight or flight, either acting out or running away.  They also teach that people on the spectrum *need* safe people and safe places, to be *able* to calm down again, far more than neuro typical people.
it’s hurtful and makes me want to cry. i don’t use >!transexual!< because it hurts others and wish this was respected the same
Oh... I don't want to believe that but I'm sure your right, considering how some people are...
Yeah, a lot of TERF's and 2nd-wave feminist types demonize men and masculinity. When that hurts trans people, it's transphobia.

One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender. If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too. Good feelings for everyone.
my dad said ""not very ladylike"" when i got angry about something

those words felt like a thousand thorns (less now, because he's a transphobe, but y'know)
That's so sad. People generally don't seem to take women seriously which is also another issue

We all have the right to feel emotions but transphobic people will always use anything to invalidate both trans men and women :(
trans exclusionary ""feminists"" explaining how women aren't allowed to speak out of turn because that's rude
There's always the gayborhood in Philly if you're eillimh to relocate. I mean, for all I know you already live in Philly, so maybe it's not really relocating. Either way, at least visit. It's so relieving.
Seriously, if this exists I’m moving there today.
Yeah... That sounds like a ghetto :(
I say fuck that, I will call out anyone who disrespect me
My childhood friend came out as ftm, but refuses to transition because men should all die and testosterone evil
>One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender.

It seems a bit dramatic, a bit too *gushy* to say, but this is why I'm here.  It isn't that I'm here to help anyone - I'm rarely equipped for it - or to be helped directly - I'm at least as lousy at that.  Its that people come here and scream into the void only to find *someone* on the other end willing to offer some small bit of human decency.  That inspires me to help on those rare occasions that I think I can, but more importantly, it has helped me be okay with, well, *me*.
> If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too.

Switching up the positive descriptor when it comes to NB people is trans culture /lh
No I don’t live in Philly.
Let's all move there and just take over the entire neighborhood lmao. A community made entirely of trans people, that'd be nice
Wow that's sad
super sad... trans men are not the ones who should be held accountable for the domestic abuse rates and r@pes made by CIS men (mostly. ofc trans men can do them but lets be honest it's a minority of crimes committed by men overall)
Shoot. Well, if you ever have a chance to take a trip. It's nice and refreshing to see pride flags on every lightpole and queer people on every sidewalk!
Yeeesssss😩
yeah...
please dont try to brush off the issue with this discourse by pushing the blame onto cis men. that doesnt help anyone and is still a bigoted line of thinking
That would be nice.  Where I live is fine.  My neighborhood is quite liberal but I’ve only seen one pride flag out beside my trans flag.
That emoji is not on the reddit list of approved emojis.I wish I was that brave
I suppose it'll be hard to convincz them. I would say that not all men are bad and they can be proof of that
Anddddd yes lol I’m going to make it my mission in life to start making that 🫡
Yeah but he was the kind of guy that would tell me a lot of gaslighting stuff, so not really a good guy.... I stopped talking to him like a year ago because he was saying that America is the worst country in the world to my immigrant family
That really sucks
I mostly just feel sorry for him lol"	ulvfef	trans	2398	0.96	2022-05-09 16:41:48
(FTM) Before my mom hung up our call she said tearfully that she wants to say “I miss my baby girl.”	It hurts that not only does she not accept my trans identity but that she makes me feel guilty for transitioning, like I have killed the past version of me. I love my mom. I hate watching her go through this. Transitioning is the only thing keeping me alive. Isn’t it better to have a living son than a dead daughter? My emotions feel so invalidated in this family	"She never had a daughter tbh. Stay strong, bro :)
Man, that sucks. I’m so sorry. My mom did the exact same thing talking about how she was mourning her “son.” If it is any consolation, my mom did end up coming around and is now far better with everything. What really helped her is seeing how much happier I was with myself, so maybe try to show her that? I hope she comes around for you and ends up being the supportive parent you need.
This is the oldest comment in the transphobe’s book, and so manipulative too. You’re not responsible for how she reacts to your true self. I’m so sorry she’s like this. I hope you can get out of that place and be your true manly self.
There's a great book I would recommend you gift to her: Far From the Tree by Andrew Solomon.  It may help her and would most likely expand to improving things between you if she's open
I (mtf) am dealing with a very similar mindset from my family. I have 2 sisters, and I’m “taking their only son from them!” “How could I be so selfish to do this to them!?” Never mind iv tried explaining my suicidal period, I feel the statement you made about transition keeping you alive.
Something that parents of trans kids need to understand is that they don’t deserve to mourn. They don’t deserve that. If we give them that time then it’s whatever and it should be considered a gift. But the idea that they lost a child when their child is still alive is incredibly dehumanizing
This shit is the worst. My mother kept telling me “I miss him” and I get it, she is grieving for the loss… but the problem is that it is IMAGINED loss. You are still here. Yes, you look different, but you are still you. Did she have to grieved for the loss of the teenager when you became and adult? Did she grieve for the loss of the child when you became a teenager? Did she grieve the loss of the baby when you became a child? No, not at all. Not is any way. You are on a path of growing and changing. This is just one more step. You are still you. This ‘thing’ that our community has to endure… the ‘death’ of who you were before your transition… is one of the cruelest things imaginable. Yes, I understand, some people have to just to survive, but I long for when we can all live in a world where we get to live on a continuum just like everyone else instead of having to erase who we are to rebuild. 

You deserve better than this. I am so sorry that you have had to experience it. This is, in my opinion, the actual worst thing about the trans experience. Stay strong honey, you are not alone. Xxx
And I miss my mom who cared for me unapologetically :) God that's cruel...
Bro, absolute solidarity. When I came out I said “why are you so mad it’s not like I killed someone” to which she tearfully replied “when you said that it felt like something died inside me” 🙄 then this weekend my mom said “it’s so hard for me to [stop using your deadname] because I’m in denial and trying to hold onto the child that I wanted.” Ouch. Stay strong my man, we got this, even if it hurts.
Well 2 can play that game.

Start crying too and say you hope she won't abandon her son whom got left behind while she griefs her daughter she never had.
""i miss my baby girl."" X mom never had a baby girl
My mom does the same, making me feel guilty all the time...

I'm cutting ties as soon as possible.
you could also consider saying “i’m still here, I never went anywhere, it’s just that i’m not a girl”
This is such a difficult process. My wife, for example, married a husband. Whether it seems right or not, the other party will go through a grieving process. It happens. After all, we call the previous name a dead name, and the person she assumed she knew has died along with it. She’ll go through the process and all will be well. And keep in mind the alternative to her grief would be her never accepting you as you are now. This pain you and her are both feeling is temporary because she knows you are not the same as the daughter she believed she had. This is good. It is progress. Hope that helps, and I wish you well.
My dad makes me feel the same way. I took away his firstborn son. He can’t accept that I never was his son to begin with and that he actually gets to know me now.
> Isn’t it better to have a living son than a dead daughter?

damn bro, that hit hard!!

it's very sad to see your mother berating you into being a girl instead of seeing the beauty you being truly happy because you embraced your true masculinity. i really hope all goes well for you, lad. stay strong!!
Don't get bothered by her.
Note: well, I wish I could start transitioning too
That just sounds manipulative, guilt tripping and Gaslightning to me...

She's not losing you since you're still alive, you just realised that you are s boy and not a girl.
You are still you!

I apologize but I think that your mother(based on this behavior) is an assholle.
She makes this 10x worse than it acutally is!

I mean what's worse? 

Having a son or a dead child?

You are transitioning for you only and not anyone else!


You are you

You are valid

You are loved

❤️
She needs to realize that she never HAD a daughter.
It's horrible but it's normal too, and for many parents it's part of the process. People mourn over all sorts of changes in life not just death and this is a big change. True it's a bigger change for you and she'll hopefully see that in time among with what she's gained.

My mum went through that, along with blaming herself, but now is she more sad for years missed out with the daughter she didn't know she had.
Get some distance from her if you can, because she is toxic for your well being. Your transition is a space for your joy, not her grief. The latter is her responsibiliy, and you do not deserve to be caught in the middle of it.
Yeah I'm worried about that with my family too. I haven't told them yet. I'm going to try really hard to reframe it as a new adventure and that my soul is still the same.

Hang in there, dude! Sometimes people just need to mourn before they can accept. 7 stages of grief and all that.
I am so happy for you that you transitioned despite her. You are so strong and your feelings are so valid. You felt guilt because you care, not because you don’t. You have every right to be upset, which you already know, and you’re right.
Going through the same shit with my mom right now. I talked to my dad about it and as much as I didn't want to accept it, he was right when he said, ""no matter how hard you try, she's never going to change her mind."" And honestly? I don't need her support. I don't need her to accept me for who I am. Once I can move out, I'm blocking her on everything and if she ever wants my help again she's gonna have to accept me. Period.
Dude, she doesn't deserve you if she's going to act like that to her son.im very sorry that happened, it never feels good.
It's not about her and it's selfish of her to make it about her.
I don’t remember where I heard it but whatever I heard “ is it a better having a living son then a dead daughter” that means so much.
My mom pulled similar shit on me. Remember that you know yourself and your own body better than anyone else ever could, her included. She’s projecting an image of what she believed you to be for years onto you against your will, and it’s absolutely her problem, not yours. You’re doing yourself a favor by listening to your body and going forward with your transition, your mom will either have to get used to it or get used to you being emotionally distant from her as a result of her actions.
Also why does this have so little upvotes?
People are mixed up and complex.  I think it's likely she does support your transition in the larger sense, it was just really unexpected for her and she's having trouble adjusting to the change.  She shouldn't put that guilt on you but people are flawed and don't like to get sucked out of their comfort zone and react badly to it a lot of the time.  You and she are both your own persons.  You aren't responsible for her happiness and comfort and she isn't responsible for yours.  Don't let her make you feel guilty for making her confused and uncomfortable.  You've got to do what you've got to do.
I'm sorry, man. That really sucks. Sounds like she's struggling with who \*she\* wanted you to be, not who you really \*are\*. Parents are confused sometimes. Hang in there.
What an asshole move
tell her the truth, she never had a daughter
Hey man, I'm sorry about this. If you need to talk or something?
Bro hug? Sucks ass, you've got better people here
Ugh I’m sorry man. You deserve much much better.

This “daughter” she claims to miss never existed, and was only ever a mask hiding her son. She’s prioritising her imaginary conception of someone who doesn’t exist over her real, existing son, and that’s shitty as fuck.

Her making it all about her mistaken conception rather than embracing you for who you are is gross. You deserve better.

I’m a trans stepmum to a trans son, and the best thing I’m able to do for him is ensure he never has to face the same trauma growing up that I did. I wish the same for all trans people.
Cis mom to a (trans) son here- I'm sorry. I just had to explain this to my sister when she asked me if I mourned my daughter. I told her that I never had a daughter and anyway it's gross to mourn genitalia or a future that was never mine to decide, not really. I did have a couple of embarrassing things I said when I went through this and I'm so grateful that my son was patient and graceful with me. 

That said, she's trying to cope and she's being candid with you. It's not fair that she has just given you a load of emotional labor and you absolutely should tell her how that makes you feel- gently and honestly. If there's anything I've learned through this journey with my son it's that grace is an amazing gift to give to those who may not appear to deserve it. Protect yourself, but leave room for her to grow.

Edit- a word
I've had similar experiences, not from the perspective of transitioning, but being guilty by my mother and father for things they knew would mean I was happy, so from one reddit brother to another, im here for you man, my PMs are always open
My parents do the same thing, and I haven’t had the audacity to transition cause of there guilt. Proud of you man.🥺💖💖
Im not out yet but my mom might do this and I really hope she doesn't
Hey dude, you got this. Hopefully this is a phase and she will grow to love the son she always had every bit as much as the daughter is thought she had. My (almost) wife and are happy to be your gay moms if you need us.  💜
Man, you're spot on. It's better to live as someone new, then die as your old self.
Your mom needs to find some other shoulder the cry on.  

Sure, transition is big and she can mourn, but she needs to do that with her support network, not you, she's supposed to be *your* support network. 

I'm sorry you have to go through this.
Throughout the last two or so years, my relationship with my grandparents has become pretty hostile at times. It started with me being a leftist, it got worse when I came out as non-binary, and continues to get more stressed as I begin to present differently. 

It's become incredibly apparent that the reason I'm so tired socially is because I'm masking A LOT around my family. This doesn't make it any easier.

All that, taken together, made me realize that my grandparents are basically in a relationship that's positive with the past, static image of me, and that's negative with the actual, living, breathing me. 

All of this to say that these people think ""unconditional love"" means ""obligatory love"", and so regardless of their obvious invalidation and vitriol, that since they love you ""unconditionally"", that excuses everything, including their zero attempt at understanding the trans identity or shutting the fuck up about it. Its hard to cut family off, but I believe sometimes its considerable.
Both things can be true at the same time.  Your feelings are valid AND their feelings are valid.  As long as they’re making an effort, there’s hope.
They all do that, they’ve gotta deal with it, because if they keep wanting your old self back, then they don’t get any child at all
hey pal im sorry you're having this experience. this is a common manipulative tactic from parents. all i can say is it's not your fault and you didnt kill your parent's child. they're the one holding onto a delusional idea of who you are/used to be and it's on them to work through that.
I'm sorry when I read stuff like this I get angry and offensive so you can just ignore this:

Next time she says something like this say ""I miss my mom, you don't seem to be her"" if she gets upset just say that's how you always feel because of what she says.


Had a lot of problems with my mom (and still don't feel comfortable around her) so yes this might be a little mean...
I'm an egg so the problems were all trans unrelated stuff.
Its hard on our parents. We have to be patient and educate them. I transitioned at 30 and it was difficult with my siblings and. parents. We are now ,again a unified  clise family.  Give yourself grace, Give them grace.
I have a rocky relationship with my remaining family. I came out over email far after I moved out and was completely financially independent. My mom was originally extremely unhelpful, not even for her relegious reasons. Once I was able to demonstrate this was how I wanted to live and gave her lots of space to work it out. She came around. It took about 5 years no contact, and one strictly over email. Sometimes, people need a long time to fit in our shoes. But also, if they dont wanna, you dont have to hold their hand. Im so sorry shes treating you like this.
I wouldn't love my mom if she said that to me. Tbf I wouldn't if she didn't accept me like that. That kind of stuff is a deal breaker for any relationship and parents shouldn't be exempt to this because they brought you into this world

Manipulation is harmful and gaslighting leaves scars.

Furthermore imo someone calling an adult ""My baby X"" is infantilizing. Lots of parents do this and it's normalized way too much. It might seem like no big deal but in practice it undercuts your confidence and sense of agency which are both really important to advocating for yourself as a trans person
At the beginning of my transition my mother would say stuff like that too and my therapist(someone who specialize in transsexualism and transgenderism) told me that I should try to ignore her and to learn that she’s having difficulty with that and sadly it comes out hurtful, she shouldn’t say this kind of stuff even if she is in pain.


One thing she made me realize is that it is a grief because for them they lost their son(in my case) even if for me I always was their daughter they didn’t know, they always saw me as their son.


The one that suffers the most physically and socially and mentally from a transition is the person that transition themselves but it’s important to realize that it affect others too, I think it’s important to be considerate that it affect others and that like any major life change we should expect that for the people that loves us so much and don’t quite understand it takes time to understand that they didn’t just lost a son(in my case) but also to realize they gained a daughter and when they’ll realize that their grief will be way easier.


I speak for me but I’m really glad I was patient and let them the time they needed to grief because now they adore me even more then before because they finally see me for the woman I am and they realised that I am way more happy in my life and healthy now. It takes time, believe me I know you already have so much on your shoulders and someone dear to you saying that feels like a knife in the heart but tell her that if she feels this way she should keep it to herself because it hurt you and also remind her that she didn’t only lose a daughter but she  gain a son ❤️❤️❤️.


Believe me, be patient and they will end up understanding if they ever loved you and they will see how much more happy you are when you aren’t hiding yourself.


I hope this help 🤞🏻
As a trans parent that comes from an incredibly conservative family, I want to offer my devil's advocacy for a moment.

First off, I'm sorry you're going through this, man. It sucks, I know. Been there.

My personal belief is that I 100% side with you my trans bro. I just want to offer a look from the other side. Eventually, my mom came around and I really wanted to have a heart to heart with her to get her thoughts and feelings, and she explained it to me kinda like this.

Most parents of people old enough to transition these days are from a MUCH different time and A MUCH different generation where different things were important. My mom is 60 now, but this also applies to parents as young as maybe 40s or so. This world has socially evolved at an exponential rate thanks to social media, which didn't exist back then, and really still isn't an option for the most rural areas of the country or some parts of the world.

Back then, not that it's right or good, but everyone was taught all that matters is fitting in and being ""normal."" Because being not ""normal"" was not conducive to the unified society that war torn America was trying to build. Men had to be tough and provide. Women had to be subservient and make dinner and babies. And jocks were supposed to beat the shit out of nerds at school. And most importantly, if you didn't believe in Jesus Christ or segregation, then you were the enemy.

It wasn't until the 60s and 70s that things got a kick in the ass with all the peace and anti war and anti racism movements. And changes were slowly made in the biggest population centers, but it was slow until like 2010s when things really ramped up.

So, that's the setup. Now the mindset.

They didn't know what they were going was wrong. The vast majority agreed and held to the same standards. As they watched the world change around them, the thought was ""this worked for me and everyone I know for so long, it should work for you too.""

As for the ""mourning"" thing. As a parent myself, I can KINDA see too a degree, but what she said boils down to basically the image thing or the other thing is like some men want a son specifically so they can be like them. Some women want a daughter for different reasons, but kinda the same thing.

I mean, this doesn't go for everyone of course, but I it kinda boils down do lack of understanding and a generation that's lived so long one way that ""worked"" and refusing to leave that safety. These people were indoctrinated that change is bad and difference is death. And on top of that, religion, nearly every one, reinforces that through and through. Smite thine enemies and whatnot.

Does all this make it okay? Nah. But hopefully it gives some people some insight that may help to build bridges.
(Response to some Mom who removed their comment but posting this anyway in case other parents of trans people decide to comment) I understand the grieving process but I wish my parents wouldn’t vent to me about it as it seems inconsiderate when I’m fully aware of the difficulties of accepting someone who you thought you knew is different. As though coming out to them wasn’t hard enough. Would it kill them to be verbally supportive of the person I am one fucking time? They didn’t accept me as a lesbian either. I have given them time and I have educated them on what they didn’t understand. At the end of the day, the responsibility for understanding my identity is not on me. I put in the effort to educate myself to know who I am. Asking them to do the same if they claim to love and support me is honestly the bare minimum that they could do to meet me halfway.

I need love and support and they only transfer their fears and insecurities to me. I’ve had to do the mature thing time and time again. I’m tired. I’m not their parent. I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck and their petulant cries are about me forgetting a household chore three weeks ago. I feel like the only sound they will listen to at this point is a flatline. They don’t want to be Jo’s parents, they want to be [deadname redacted]’ parents
I understand where you're coming from, but she needs the chance to mourn the death of her daughter. After she has, perhaps she'll embrace her new found son in a way you've never expected.
Her feelings are just as valid as yours
I would encourage your mother to talk to a therapist to help her resolve her feelings and learn how to stop being an asshole to you.
Not to take away from your story, because I fully empathize, love, but to kinda see it from your mom's perspective is important. We often get so caught up in wanting people to love and accept us as we make this change, that we don't stop to think that there's a level of grief for some that comes with a major decision like this. Transition is no small thing  especially for parents. While it isn't literally and you may feel like you never were a girl,  she HAS lost a daughter and she misses her. That's okay for her to share.

Over time, I'm sure she'll come around but she needs to process. I get it, it's one of those ""if you love me, you'll accept me"" type of situations. But that doesn't come easily for everyone.

It took my mom 3 years and seeing my full transition to come around, now we're the best of friends. So I feel for you and for her.
I'm gonna fight your mom
She loves that idea of you, but needs to realize that version was never the real you to begin with. Happened to me too with my mom. Eventually, she came around.
If she keeps acting like this, she'll end up losing her son too. Hang in there.
my mom does this same thing, i’m so sorry op :( just know you aren’t guilty or at fault for anything at all and she’s the one with the problem
Ah jeez- sending all the love your way, man. Dealing with similar stuff, so I feel ya dude. Wishing you the best 💖💖💖
Tell her exactly what you said here. The only thing keeping her from going to your actual funeral is transitioning. 

If she doesn't want you to actually die she needs to realize the severity of the situation. 

Stay strong.
My mother did the same thing, she claimed me transitioning was harder for her than her own mothers death. You'll find better people for your life and she doesn't deserve you.
I mean, sometimes that stuffs hard, most people don’t know or only recently know what being transgender is, change in confusing and hard if she loved you know you were a girl she can live when you are a man, it just takes time,

Or that’s what I like to hope anyway, ether way stay safe emkay?
It’s the hardest part of transitioning that sometimes we have to put in a balance the relationship we have with our families/friends and transitioning.
It’s hard to live with this no matter what.
Be strong and good luck!
Shit,  I'm not Trans and I have spoken to my mom once in 12 years. Mines a drunk and a methhead,  so different situation,  but the end result can be the same. It hurt,  at first,  but life is so much more enjoyable without  people that just want to lie and take advantage.
You need to be who you are, not what others want you to be
Try and suggest she seek therapy for it. Grieving for the percieved loss of a child is something that happens, but the issue usually rises that the parent burdens the child with their hurt and not a therapist who can help them deal with it healthily.
I get the same thing from my mom,she literally doesn't have any recent pictures of me,calls me my deadname, calls me she and baby girl and other feminine things that I have told her I hated since I was a child,and nearly disowned me when I came out. So in other words,I gotchu bro,if you want to vent or anything you can message me
When parents make their children partners, it’s called covert incest. Parents who say stuff like this to their trans kids are blurring those boundaries in a really shitty way—as if disrespecting their kids’ identities isn’t the fuck enough!!!!
I'm not even out to my family yet and still get the ""I miss the sweet daughter you used to be"" so.  Felt that.  If you need to vent my dms are open man.
im so so sorry for this and the situation u are in i hope it works out maybe   talking will help or teaching her because for my mom at least it was ignorance and uncertainty that made her miss the previous version of ""me"" and that helped i hope you get better bro u are strong
I completely understand, my wife constantly reminds me that she misses her husband. It hurts because, I'm like I'm still the same person I was then, I'm just being more honest about who I am and how I present. I still did all of those things that she fell in love with. Hang in there bro, it will get better.

Hugs
Tell her that you are the same person she always knew, she just knows you a little better now
It's babyboy bitch!
The good thing about this is, at least from my perspective, it seems like she will be willing to come around. My girlfriend had an initial reaction that was similar when I came out, almost as though I was dying in a sense. We talked about it, and it was almost over until she thought about it in a different way.

Transgender identity is hard for people to process, especially when they have internalized transphobia, but it seems like she has the potential to find peace with it. 

HOWEVER, none of this invalidates your feelings. You are 100% valid for feeling unheard, and the journey to acceptance your mother needs to make is her journey to make. You can try to help her, but its not your job. You are valid my guy, and until you are validated by your mother, you'll be validated by us. Stay strong king 👑
I genuinely feel bad for the both of you. Of course it may seem like she’s being manipulative and not accepting but you’re both going through stuff right now. Maybe she is being a guilt tripping and insensitive asshole but we can’t know for sure, we’re not her. You truly never were her daughter but she doesn’t see it that way because she isn’t you and doesn’t understand you, it’s tough. Communication is so important but that doesn’t mean you need to talk to her about it, if she cares enough then she’ll open up about her feelings. You’re just being the person you truly are and she hasn’t met that part of you yet, the girl she thinks she “lost” wasn’t you and I really hope she can get to know and accept you as the son of hers that you really are. Gender shouldn’t determine how much a parent loves their child, she should take the time and effort to warm up to her amazing son as she’s the parent here. You’re incredible and will get through this with or without her. People change and split apart, cut off toxic relationships if they’re hurting you. Be the best you that you can be <3
This is such a hard thing, but please keep in mind it's not your fault your mother is mourning someone who does not exist. You haven't killed anyone, and you're still the person she always cared for. You're just becoming a more authentic version of yourself. I wish you the best on your journey
you are still primordial being, nothing can stop your power, especially not guilt-tripping parents 

also damn. saying ""i wish i could say '(thing they can't/should say)'""........ im sorry BUT YOU SAID IT ANYWAYS?????
Tell her that you are the same person inside
I relate to this. It's horrible to feel guilty for something she'll never be a part of. 
Don't worry dude 
Keep in mind 
This is for your own good. 
She simply can't handle that you make a decision for your life 
And you killed nobody
The past you is probably so proud of you and stays inside their waiting area to run through it and become the boy they ever wanted to be.


Hard to swallow but your mother dies one day 
Way ahead of you 

And then you are on your own 
So better show your mother what man you are 
And prove to her you don't need her approval to be a successful man of your own life 

We believe in you my boy. 
We believe in you <3
Wow, maybe she should just cope.

Fr tho she never had a daughter. if she's sad that you're finally happy and being true to yourself that's something she needs to work through herself with a therapist not put onto you. You shouldn't feel guilty, nobody has died. you've just become a happier, more true you.
She will figure it out soon enough, just give her some time, stay strong king
She will either get over this or she wont, My dad said many times to me that ""emotions are a woman's way to get you to agree with them but men use logic and it is far superior to emotions"", I cried all the time when I was young, but this is about you, my mother said she missed her little boy, my mother also said of my second sister that she missed her baby girl but my sister is cis, from your mothers point of view it's a b\*\*\*\* not only having you grow up  but transition, it'll take some time it just does. My mom has passed away my sister always said "" you're my brother not my sister"" it took 3 years but she calls me ""Sis."" No one likes change except those that cause it, it's a fact of life. And she can still talk to you as opposed to placing flowers on your grave ,how's that for logic, I don't mean this flippantly but mention this sometimes it will in time make the changes, have hope, hugs.
Meaby ask her what does your gender change for her anyway?  You're only a happier version of yourself that's it
Have you said that to her? Cause what turned my father to the light side was saying ""you either get three daughters or two daughters, but there's no scenario where you get to have a son.""
Give her a little time.  It's fair for her to do some grieving over this.  

From her perspective she had a daughter that she had expectations about in both of your lives.  She probably had age appropriate advice she wanted to share in the future, or experiences to talk about and relate to you about, such as being a new wife or new mother, and now that is all changed.  

The death of those expectations is still a minor loss.  It's probably less than what you may have felt about the fact that you didn't get a chance to go through adolescence or young adulthood as a man, but it's still something real.  

As long as she isn't toxic about it, or completely inappropriate, just give her time.  This is part of her coming to terms that she doesn't have a daughter anymore, even if she does have a son.
I feel your pain. The first time I came out my mom, she asked, ""but what will your friends think about you?"" When I told her if they're actually my friends then they'll be tolerant if not supportive. So then she asked, ""but what will your dad's friends and family think about him?"" As I was already super stressed, had way too much hero worship, and knew how absurdly conservative they are, I put off transitioning for a few years because of that. OT, but one just died of COVID and he was an unvaccinated anti-masker if that gives you an idea.

As if that weren't bad enough, when I basically gave them an ultimatum, accept me or I will cease all contact in such a way you won't ever be able to contact me again (change my number and move to the Pacific NW) they tried making me feel guilty. ""How could you do this to us without ever giving us notice or time to come to terms?"" Despite the fact that I had come out to each of them once before.

Not saying you should do what I did, but that conversation went just barely good enough for me to not cut them out entirely. We didn't speak for 9mos (used to speak every couple days), didn't see them for around 18mos, and weren't on actual speaking terms (conversations that lasted more than 5mins) for nearly as long. And now, instead of calling me son they call me sonny 🤦‍♀️ Not once have they ever used my name and I'll be legally changing it here in the next few months.

Parents suck, somehow they take your issues and make it entirely about themselves. It is easier to find good support from a bed made of rocks than them on the things that actually matter. Hope they come around for you, but at a minimum there is the old saying ""Friends are the family we choose.""
I’m so sorry this happened, my parents haven’t done that but they have done very similar invalidating stuff to the point where I had enough of that and other things that I left like two days ago to live with someone else. I know it’s hard right now and it may seem like you can’t get through this but keep strong, find a support group even if its just one person, stand tall and strong and one day you will look back and be proud because you have been through what most may never understand and you survived. You are a man always have been always will be and you are a strong one at that  💙💗🤍💗💙
Easier said than done. So excited to talk to my parents about finances//s//
I get your point, but from the mom’s perspective she did have a daughter. I’ve found people to be more accepting of transition when you acknowledge to some degree their feelings, at least when they’re not violently, hopelessly transphobic. Like, hey I know this may take time to get used to and I understand it’s uncomfortable for you, but I’m still here and alive and your child. Ik I’m going to get downvoted for this though.
I know my parents will come around but the reason I moved out is because I don’t need to hold their hand while they process my transition. I have my own journey to acceptance that I need to go through
Fortunately I moved in with my girlfriend and she’s much more supportive considering she’s trans herself. I knew I had to move out because I don’t need to be in that environment while my parents figure it out
[removed]
I don't think it's fair to say it's manipulative.  She probably really does miss who she thought was her little girl.
I’m suicidal and they think it’s a good idea to spout such negative bs to me. I don’t have compassion for them because frankly I am the one with a life on the line, not them
i'm in a very similar situation, but as someone who's ftm with two brothers. i hope your folks come around, you deserve to feel welcomed and supported
Not even that but they completely disregard the emotional burden of being closeted and forced to conform to a gender that made their child uncomfortable for decades. I’m mourning all the time I lost trying to satisfy a society that told me I was being a woman incorrectly, that I was improper, meanwhile I have always been a man. And now I’m struggling to be a man amidst my past lesbian anger at toxic masculinity.
Exactly. I'm still mourning over the childhood I'll never get to have. But if that gets brought up...

""You're saying I'm a bad parent??!!""
This. Entirely this. I am honestly revolted by the idea that anyone who knows a trans person needs to “mourn.” If anyone ever said that to me they’d be strictly and summarily cut out of my life, because that is a transphobe and transphobes are no good.
I whole heartedly disagree with this. When you are born your parents have all these ideas for you. They need to shift that idea and they deserve the time and space to shift that. The fact that you automatically expect your parents to say oh my child is still alive is ridiculous and horrendous. Just as trans people needed to come to terms before coming out doesn't mean other people don't get to also adjust. It's not just a light switch and the fact that you all think this is destroying relationship. There is a huge difference between purposefully being transphobic and going through an adjustment period. I get you are there and want to transition and nothing should stop you however a little empathy is required BOTH WAYS. Go ahead and downvote me all the way but this is toxic thinking.
This means so much 🥺thank you so much
Felt every word of this
Mine refuses to acknowledge and then when he yells that I never open up I just sit there like 

I tried desperately to and got spiked back into the closet so hard it isn't a joke
My mom has no idea how many times I’ve been a cm away from suicide and she’s the one who was responsible for my two baker acts/mental health ward stays.
My therapist says that I am already trans and I’m already transitioning and it’s true that socially I’m there but lol I want medical transitioning. I can’t decide if I want HRT or top surgery more...I hate my chest more than I can say
I can see this, but I'm dubious of it... that's also a classic manipulative line. it's hard to know without knowing her.
I believe they infantilize me either to create dependency or out of misunderstandings regarding my Autism. They didn’t diagnose me as a child even when I had difficulties learning and my autistic traits make me seem more dependent or gullible and in need of protection. Well, I’m living on my own with my girlfriend, I’ve had multiple jobs, I have an education, I have a car and all of it was obtained more or less on my own. I can be Autistic and struggle while also being accomplished. Too bad they don’t seem to value adulthood
If your mother had difficulty living with a pain due to some life changing decision and would say stuff without realizing how much it hurt you you wouldn’t love her? 

Seriously, she still gave you birth and she is still your mother and I’m sure she was there for you when you were in pain and were saying mean stuff cause you didn’t realized how it affected her.

Your mother is still human just like you but it’s not because she say that that she doesn’t love OP it’s because she’s trying to get through that pain she have because she doesn’t understand what dysphoria and what OP is living with. 

Someone who say they wouldn’t love their mother for saying something that hurt them don’t deserve to have a loving mother.
I appreciate your comment novella, hopefully I can offer a sufficient response. I acknowledge my parents’ pain but I need their support since I am the one hurting more (arguably). They have struggled to accept my identity as a lesbian too so, to me, I have given them enough time. Its been 10 years since I started identifying as lgbt and 5 years that I have been publicly out. I’m the one in therapy but that doesn’t mean I’m a qualified therapist for them to air their grievances too. Maybe this is a reaction as an Autistic tbh. Also I’m tired of the constant infantilization. They don’t call my brother their baby boy and they don’t call either of my sisters baby girl nearly as much. Is it because I’m younger than them? Maybe. Is it because my autism disables me from total independence at times? Absolutely
That was really interesting and well said!
Why does she get a chance to mourn when she’s never given me the opportunity to process the shit I’ve been through for the past three years? She doesn’t get to mourn because frankly there is nothing to mourn. I’m not a child anymore and I haven’t been a child for eight years. She got her perfect daughter and now she has an awesome son. If she needs therapy to realize this, that’s her prerogative and not my responsibility. She has no right to vent such harmful sentiments to me when she KNOWS I’ve been suicidal for years. It’s funny how she offers so much support but none of it is genuine because she has never accepted my identity. My parents have made relationships borderline impossible and incited my hospital stays, the former which was beneficial but made to seem destructive and the latter the vice versa. I can’t forgive them for the religious brainwashing they attempted on me by making me watch homophobic videos to share their perspectives on my identity. They don’t get to choose who I am anymore and they don’t get to lose the person I never was.
What no, her daughter didn’t die. It’s just her perception of him that did. To compare transitioning to losing a child is incredibly selfish. 

While yes she needs time to adjust to the changes transitioning can bring, there is no mourning because no one died. 

Being trans isn’t like losing a child and it’s incredibly rude and ignorant of you to compare it to that.
Nah. Being trans isn’t even remotely on the same level as losing a child. No one’s died and to compare it to that is both transphobic and insensitive to people who have lost children.
Idk why I thought that said fiancée's 😅
>ot only does she not accept my trans identity but that she makes me feel guilty for transitioning, like I have killed the past version of me. I love my mom. I hate watching her go through this. Transitioning is the only thing keeping me alive. Isn’t it better to have a living son than a dead daughter? My emotions feel so invalidated in this family

my mom did the same /still does all the dead naming and stuff she say sche needs taime but at the same time trys to guilt me in not proseding with my transition best thing is to just keep going at some point they gota axept that this is you and the thing they thought they knew was never you but a character you had to play
I definitely see where you're coming from.
<nods>  
No you're absolutely right Halup.

We do have to remember that sometimes people DO accept and love us.  But they will still have moments where they will painfully miss the past person we used to be.  And it can be painful for us to hear this.  But we should expect the people who genuinely care about us to feel some level of both pain of our past self leaving, but also excitement at our new future self growing.

My family had similar emotions, but at the end of the day they still love, accept me, and are excited for my future even if they miss parts of my past
But the fact that her imagination is more important than her actual child is not okay.
That definitely makes some sense, but only to the same degree as missing who your kid was when they were six, or missing a friend who changed into someone toxic or things similar to that. OP's mom is acting as though her child is dead and was replaced with this guy who happened to know all the same things. There's totally space for nostalgic memories of childhood past, but if that at all interferes with how OP gets treated today, then it's not okay. OP is still alive, he still has the same memories, is able to recall the same jokes, gossip about family members, whatever. Whatever his mom is doing, whether it's purposeful sabotage or thoughtless acts, it's not okay.
I see where you're coming from, but I don't think that should be the resposibility of the trans person coming out. They should deal with that with their own theraphist or so, and not put that burden on their child.
You’re right, though. You never said trans people SHOULD have to do this (and we shouldn’t) but it’s what makes the most sense and will help family members to understand.
That’s very fair. I already didn’t live at home when I came out to my parents, so thankfully I could control when I saw them and for how long at a time. I wish you all the luck with your journey!
same, it didn't take me very long to move out. i'm perfectly understanding that they're older and that this ***is*** a difficult change for everyone (mostly me, obv.) but at a point I have to take care of my own mental health before working on theirs.

they're honestly incredibly understanding, just... older lol.
Good call. Wishing you all the best brother!

Also your username is adorbs
He still is the kid that she had, it's her that can't see it like that. What she's missing is the incredibly shallow idea of having a *daughter* specifically, rather than having a child, whether son or daughter or neither of the two.

It might not be overtly transphobic (it could be), but it certainly shows that she doesn't understand her son.
He’s the same child. Just a trans guy. She never had a different kid (unless he has other siblings but even if he did she’s not talking about them). She misses the fact that he was a ‘girl’ which he clearly isn’t making it transphobic.
It does. Because she's missing someone who was never there and blaming it on her *actual* child. It's pure, 100% projection.
""I miss the miserable person you had to pretend to be rather than the real you who has the potential to live an actual happy life why can't you bring them back""

*Totally* not transphobic
It does when you say it to the kid's face. That's manipulation by any therapy standard. Fuck's sake.
This is true, but you can express that in ways that don't make your child feel like shit. Also, mourning someone who is still alive is incredibly strange for the person that is still obviously alive.
I agree. Jesus.

It's hard for people. It's not *only* hard for us. I know that's hard to concede, and it's absolutely not *about* them, but I think we need to be patient when good faith efforts are being made.
Wow that was a bad take… yikes 😬
Having a thought is never invalid, but as OP’s parent, she has a responsibility to keep that thought to herself. OP is not responsible for how his mom reacts and thinks, that’s something she has to deal with separate from OP.

I’m sure my parents have gone through the “death of [deadname]” thought process with me, but they would NEVER say that to my face. Instead, they’ve started attending a group that meets once every two weeks to learn about the struggles of queer people and how to support us. THAT’S what good parenting and support looks like.
Maybe not the best time to be trying to play devils advocate here bud
Yes I felt the same while I was dealing with my family about this more after first coming out. Eventually just have to back off and try giving them time away from you. My situations not all better now. But my mom has cut the hate she has been spewing at me in half or so. Might get to the point of acceptance eventually. Just do what you need to do for yourself and hope they come to their senses, it’s all you can do

Yo, THISSSS
We mourn for the lives we didn’t experience. We mourn for the friends and family members we’ll inevitably loose because of who we are. We mourn for so much and yet they think they lost a child. They are convinced that they get a chance to mourn when there is no reason to mourn.
If this is the reaction, the answer is ""yes.""
Ok and? They still don’t get to mourn as if they lost their kid. No one died. I understand that people need time to adjust sometimes, but like… the whole thing is they don’t get to mourn as if they died. They don’t have a right to say things like “I miss my daughter/son” when that child is still alive.

Edit:

Also, my parents wanted me to be an orthodontist and join the military. Neither of those things will ever happen. Just because I’m a girl doesn’t mean that their ideas of who I’d be would ever happen.
Babes. 

You are loved. 

You are loved not for the person you are trying to be. But for the person you are. You are magnificent. You are glorious. We look down on the caterpillar from being a formless lump and praise the butterfly for its beauty… but that is not you… you have been majestic and wonderful this whole time. 

I really am sorry that your mother cannot see that. If you want to be adopted by a towering middle-aged trans-woman who is strong enough to pick up unworthy and puny men and throw them far away from you then I will gladly be your new mother. Stay strong honey… and note… I say STAY strong, cause you have been strong this entire time and probably not realised it. X
Me too bro. But the thing that I can't transition socially hurts so much. Well, hope for the best for ya
This kind of discussion isn't healthy for me to engage in
Yep there it is, the perfect excuse to enable your family to abuse you bc they are still ✨Family✨
I’m sorry to hear they are making it so hard for you ❤️

The only thing I can suggest at that point is get further from them. When I moved out the tensions finally really dropped cause I don’t have to talk with her everyday at least.

Things are not easy but stay strong and remember that their difficulty dealing with you has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.

In the end it is up to you to measure if their love is worth dealing with those stab every now and then. Personally I couldn’t drop the fight, I couldn’t give up for the sake that she was always there for me and so I want to be there for her even if she was braking my heart so frequently. But I’m sure you love her and it’s probably why it’s even more painful and frustrating because if it was someone that you didn’t care about it wouldn’t hurt as much.

Take good care, hopefully they come around some time soon 🤞🏻and things get easier.

Xoxo
Sorry, I was basing my assessment on what you had originally posted. You hadn't mentioned religion in it.

I don't have contact with my birth family. Besides, I'm not Christlike enough for them. I've also stopped trying to convince myself that I still love them. My mother didn't mourn losing her son, she never really liked him much anyway. My mother mourns losing the image she thought she had in a church of backstabbing hypocrites.

My wife, however, mourns her husband, the ""man"" she had married. But she celebrates her love for me. I wish I'd had that from my mother. 

I didn't mean to offend, I simply assumed I had all of the pertinent information.
Being trans is a decision.
Sorry, but I have to disagree. When someone transitions, it's because they were never happy with themselves. Despite what some dingbats wrongly like to think, transitioning ins't a trend. Someone who is happy with themselves isn't going to suddenly stay thinking that maybe they've had themselves wrong the whole time. This attitude of trying to be understanding of the other person's feelings means we have to put aside our own. No, I will not be understanding of that. I WAS NOT HAPPY PRE-TRANSITION. The image you have in your head concerning who I USED to be is seen through a muddy window.
It wasn't imagination, as that implies there's no basis in reality. Physically OP was born a female from external appearances. Kinda hard to ask a newborn if they feel in sync between mind and body.

For the parent it's definitely jarring no matter what, as the child you raised is transforming in front of you.

I don't say this to invalidate OP nor endorse the mother for (even if not intentional) disregarding OP's gender.

Like anything else, transitioning isn't black and white. It's murky as hell and even if you're right it can make others feel pain (goes both ways here especially).
another bad take
I absolutely love this statement, it's so true!
I'm sorry but someone that is going through a rough time in their life and sadly say words that are hurtful and I am not talking about continuously repeating the same thing (like bullying) or saying something in the purpose of hurting someone else's feeling but just saying something without realizing how it can hurt the person isn't abuse.   


If that's you're go to when in this kind of situation I'm guessing you call abuse really frequently.   


Don't you have any sense of empathy towards others living different situations... try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who don't understand why their child is going through something that you don't understand at all and you are scared it will do more bad then good, even if it's the opposite.   


How can you ever get friends or in a love relationship or hold any kind of family if as soon as someone say something that hurt your feelings you call abuse. Sounds like you have a very lonely life.   


Living in a society means learning that others don't live the same experiences as you and also mean that people sometime react on their feelings and will say stuff or do stuff they regret or will not understand how they might have hurt someone else by doing so, depending on what it is it is dealt differently but in this specific case you shouldn't stop loving someone that you love because of a little something someone said that was painful...   


Have you never said anything to people you love (like your parents or partner or friends) that you regretted when understanding how it made them feel or that you regretted instantly after??? We are only humans and everyone makes mistakes, not every mistakes can be forgiven but this kind clearly should be especially when you start imagining how hard it is for the person that raised you to see you go through that whole process and not understand what's going on.  


I sympathize lots with OP because I lived basically the same situation and even worst then this but she isn't hitting anyone and she isn't constantly bullying OP, she's trying to let her feelings heard without realizing how it affect OP.  


Learn to see both side of the medal before passing a judgement, everyone live different things and it's important to be considerate of others feeling too.
What no?! what even makes you think that?
Did you reply to the right post?  I'm actually really confused as your context doesn't make sense to anything anyone said in this branch of the thread >.>  

ARE YOU A ROBOT /panics
society is the issue. we shouldn't be presuming gender at birth. raise kids as gender neutral, use gender neutral pronouns. also make gender as socially insignificant as hair colour. then it wont matter if you have a ""son"" or ""daughter"" any more than it matters if you have brown or yellow or red hair.
For me it was very black and white. I completely disagree with you and nothing you say will change how I feel about that. My parents wanted to ""morn the loss of their child"" as well, so I gave them something to morn and cut them off. It really is that simple. The end.
Being patient with people we care about in our lives as we undergo huge changes is a bad take?

C'mon. I'm not saying to put up with malicious, intentional abuse.

My aunt accidentally deadnamed me in phone conversations for almost a *year* after I came out. It wasn't intentional, and she definitely said ""Sorry, I've known you as [deadname] for 34 years so it's hard to get used to"", but she eventually did. I didn't go off or call her ""transphobic"" because she's not. She's a human being doing her best to process something very new.

In the same vein, I haven't spoken to my cousins - *actual* transphobes - in many years.
Yeah, but this is not the time or place to be arguing this.
No, I just mean the idea of maybe having to be understanding of them feeling pain for my ""past self leaving"". I don't think we should. I obviously don't speak for every trans person, but when I came to realize that I'm trans, it was only then that I also understood how unhappy I was growing up. I was VERY unhappy. So the idea of folks saying that they'll miss ""the old me"" would be laughable if I thought it was funny. I say ""bon voyage"" to that part of my life. I don't have fond memories to look back on. It just seems very selfish of someone to be sad at the idea that someone they say they love comes to understand themselves at a significantly deeper level and are actively trying to make themselves happier, because they think that they're suddenly going to change into a completely different person. No, I'm not changing into someone else; I'm changing into a BETTER version of myself.
If that is correct then why is trans such a low percentage of human population?
idk who down voted this but they shouldn’t have because this is so true. 

at 15 i had fully excepted the fact that i had no family. i came out when i was 13 bc i knew. i knew for a fact. i spent my childhood years wishing to be “like my brother”. as a child that really meant when i grow up i hope to have a flat chest and penis. obviously once i turned 13 i had learned that would be possible one day and i wanted to tell my family. 

my mothers and fathers reaction was horrible. so for the next 4 years i had accepted i would never have a real family and i would have to fend for myself at 18. planned on moving out and everything. 

my parents pack up the whole family and move us 8 hours away into a much more expensive city, and it happened. 

slowly my mom started coming around to it. to the point where eventually she’d bring home free places for me to get hrt and financial aid for surgeries. 

five/six months ago she changed my name in her phone and fully started calling me he and by my name. she’s pushing my dad to do the same. he’s getting there but it’s hard for him and the first time he’s ever sit down and talked to me since i was probably 14 years old. 

to OP she may come around, or it may be best to cut them off. for your health. you should always put yourself first and your happiness first.

All I can say is that my mom told me this same thing, and I def did not need somebody reminding me that parents have a hard time with it too. OP needs support rn, and not to be told to that they need to think about how this is affecting his mom.
Well that's an easy way out.   
I said what I had to say anyway.  
Sorry for the brick lmao I tend to talk too much ':) , take care.
I've generally found most good relationships are when both people take some time to understand each other.  I know many people who are transgender want their past self to be gone forever.  And in many ways it is.  But memories aren't.  Other people can't just erase their memory of who we were.  But they can adapt change and learn to like who we are now as our better selves.  

It absolutely is selfish for someone to say they miss the old you.  But its also selfish of us to blow them off in anger.  You're far more likely to find a friend and relationship when you can look back at that person, and say ""you know they miss parts of the old you, but the new you is a happier person with a future, and you really were always like this just crumpled up in the wrong package""

But there is no magical one way to react or interact with others, what's right for one person might not be right for someone else.  So huggles I understand what you mean!
I mean you’re welcome to that approach, and you clearly have really good reasons for feeling that way, but in my experience invalidating someone’s  experience outright, no matter how misguided they’re actually being, doesn’t lead to healing relationships. Not all relationships deserve to be healed, but the ones that do require understanding on both sides, as exhausting as that is sometimes.
Why? Because ""society is the issue."" The answer is literally right there.

There is no doubt that the percentage of trans/non-binary humans would increase if society would just stop presuming gender.
/u/BuddyA has answered better than I could.
Yep. Terrible. Surrounding myself with people who love and support me and cutting the others out. The worst lol
I was merely responding to the thread calling his mother ""transphobic"" - was it a shitty and transphobic thing to *say*? Definitely. Does it make her a transphobic person? Well, that's your opinion.

I think having an honest, patient conversation about *everyone's* feelings on the matter would do *everyone* a world of good. Preferably guided by a professional family therapist or counselor trained for this kind of thing.

But hey, what do I know? My parents were both dead by the time I was out, so my opinion probably doesn't matter.
You're family is lowkey saying we all were happier when you were not. And now that you are happy we miss the times you we're not happy.
Well, I appreciate you saying so, but no. It's not selfish that I want the people closest to me to see me for the real me and not the past me that was never really me, when others who don't know who I am and have no business in my life make it THEIR  business to try to litigate us out of existence, if not just straight up killing us. Their feelings on the matter and my own feelings about myself are not equal. They just simply aren't. But, thanks for your candor.
Yes, and sometimes lines need to drawn in the sand.   
If someone hurts you because of something they say or do. Sometimes, if you want to try to repair the relationship, you need to explain why its so hurtful. If they don't listen, fuck em off, if they do, continue having conversations about each others feelings, if you want to do that.

My step mother had the same ""i'm mourning a person."" response, i tried to explain that i am still the same person. She then said ""I am not comfortable calling you by your true name yet."" I simply said, ok, then don't talk to me until you are. We didn't talk for months, eventually she came around.

Relationships are complicated. Just because someone says something hurtful, doesn't mean they are doing it deliberately. Sometimes its out of ignorance and misguidedness. And it is possible to condemn a persons actions while forgiving a person, if they choose to accept their wrongdoing and change for the better.  
Its up to you if you think the relationship is worth the work, cos it is hard.   
The crux of it is, just because someone says something transphobic, doesn't mean they are malicious, sometimes they just need education.
Hyperthetical results are what you are suggesting.

Why has no society embraced this since the beginning of time?
And there are vast differences across the globe of all types of countries- from religious or royalty led or communist or democratic and dictatorship but none has ever adopted the idea of a genderless society.
That is rather rude of you to say and assume from the brief description of their feelings I shared  It's also not even close to accurate.  I've been very fortunate in almost all of my family being not only supportive but actually excited about seeing my transition and getting to have fun with me as I turn into a vibrant bouncy woman in the world.  But it makes sense. My family is like a poster for diversity.  My half brother is half black, his brother is a trans man, I'm a trans woman, one of my sister in-laws is Indian, the other is Cuban, and our closest cousin is gay.

They are all having fun with my transition seeing my broken shell fall away and me thrive.  I've been exchanging video calls with them which we never used to.  I can't understate their support.

But early in my transition some of them lightly worried if I would be a successful women in society.  If I could change and be happy.  If I would have problems in the workspace.  And they all have had to emotionally close the door on their oldest brother leaving.  And a new oldest sister entering the picture.  It's ignorant to assume people can instantly adjust when we announce we're transitioning.  We need time to accept ourselves and adjust to our new gender.  So why would we expect our family to instantly emotionally adjust?  Give them some time to adjust and love the new you!
*Hyper-ethical* results are what I'm looking for; that's how I originally interpreted your misspelling;)

I never advocated for a ""genderless society"", but rather one where gender was not forced upon people. I think that as society becomes more accepting, you'll see these numbers creep up. What some see as a trend/fad, others (rightly) see as people expressing and honoring their true selves in the absence of danger and oppression.

Although it's a fairly small study, 9.2% of high school aged kids in Pittsburgh identify as gender diverse: [https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/nearly-1-10-teens-identify-gender-diverse-pittsburgh-study-rcna993](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/nearly-1-10-teens-identify-gender-diverse-pittsburgh-study-rcna993)
I whole heartedly agree, it's a big change, for you and everyone around you, and there is going to be emotions from everyone. And yea a lot of people for whatever reason feel like the person you were is dead, when in reality that person is still alive just in a different body. Honestly I like to explain it as sorta like Doctor Who. Its the same person, but they look different. And I think it can be especially hard for Moms, because when you change your name, it can feel like you are rejecting them. Because when you were born they may have spent months deciding the name for their new child. I know that that was the hardest part for my mom, because she felt like I was rejecting her and everything she did for me as a mom. And if I hadn't talked to her about why she was having such a hard time I never would have known what was wrong, and why. And I'd say our relationship is better because of it."	tmhyjv	trans	2297	0.93	2022-03-24 15:40:37
Transphobic Principal	"I am a trans school social worker supporting a non-binary student. When the student started at my school, I sent an email to staff letting them know the student's preferred name and pronouns and that the parents were not supportive. This is allowed in my state and supporting trans students even when parents don't agree is required by law.

My principal took disciplinary action against me. I fought it. I won.

Lots of students have been coming to me with questions about the new student and themselves. So I taught a lesson today on gender identity. Real basic, real tame. 

The principal walked through while I was teaching. Next thing I know, someone from the Central Office is in my office asking about an inappropriate lesson I taught. Then I get an email from the superintendent that I am on administrative leave until further notice. Finally, the principal sent an email to the ENTIRE staff (including cooks and custodians) publicly shaming me for teaching a lesson on (get this) sex ed without prior approval.

I have never been so outraged and humiliated and words I don't even have. I am facing possible job loss for teaching students about people like myself in a state where that is allowed.

I just want to crawl in a hole. She has only been principal for 2 years but they have been hard years. She has treated me like garbage from day one. Quiet harassment by not including me and blocking me from important information regarding my students. I am exhausted and emotionally spent.

I had already planned on quitting after this year. Now I might sue for gender discrimination. She should have just waited four weeks."	"Sue the ever loving shit out of her and the district.
Wow. I'm not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt but I wonder not only about suing but also about going to the press.
Please sue, please don’t quit. I wish I had someone like you in my school growing up
REPORT LGBTQ/HIV DISCRIMINATION

https://action.aclu.org/legal-intake/report-lgbtqhiv-discrimination

Contact the ACLU and tell your story. They may be able to help directly or they may refer you to another organization but even if they have to leave you to find your own lawyer(s), they can probably point you to some of the best in the field.
Find legal help and absoultely *ruin* her
Sue. Please on behalf of those students. Sounds like a massive jackass.
Don't know where you are, but if you have a teacher's union, call your rep. immediately.
I’d say it’s time to contact the ACLU, HRC, the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, and any other national transgender legal advocacy organisation as well as your state’s Attorney General’s Office.  I would bring the fires of hell down upon her head simply for violating the law as well as for blatant discrimination.
I haven't been in education in a while, but I served 8 years in Dallas. ;)
Remember to document everything.
Keep hard copies of emails. I.T. has been weaponized illegally more than once (deleting the server copy of incriminating emails and purging the archives).
Do not start any litigation by going to the press first, it makes you look like an attention seeker and there is no way to control what happens after.
If you have close allies on staff, have them document any private conversations the principal has with them about you.
If you don't have your lesson written out in standard lesson plan format (whatever is common/accepted at your campus), do it. This will become evidence later that you didn't viokate any standards.
Also keep a chain of events that led to the necessity of the lesson, and whichever teachers or other staff participated in giving you class time.
Don't respond to any phone calls, emails, etc. without advice from your union rep first.

On a more personal note, I'm so sorry this happened.  Now you get to be strong for yourself and your students in a way that will have serious policy impact in your district at the least. You are under no moral imperative to fight this; but if you've got the fight in your spirit, fight to win!

Hugs and battle cries. :D
If you're considering suing, you might want to delete this post once you're done with it-- Lawyers won't be happy about discussion on the topic in a public forum or social media.  I had to file suit a few years ago and my lawyer banned me from talking about it anywhere until everything was resolved.

That said, sue her up one side and down the other, for real @@
Same experience, but as a teacher. Fucking bullshit.
Im sorry u r going thru this. That really sucks. get your union working for you. contact the aclu, hrc, and maybe the transgender law center But find a better school in a better state.
Basically, read what everyone else has said, but here’s what I came here to say: Woop, good teacher! Thank you!
If I had someone like you at school I wouldn’t have let my mental health get the way it is, you’re inspirational
so stupid. trans-status is nothing to do with ""sex-ed"".
Time to get rich. Sue the shit outta her. Start documenting every incident, time, date, witnesses, location. Talk to your union rep. Get a tiny recorder or use your phone and start recording all conversations with this person. It's time to send her packing.
Take some time and make detailed notes about exactly what you taught. If there is a proper investigation done. That will be part of your side of the story.
You're lucky that it's legal in your area. Take her to court and have her done for discrimination. Good luck! <3
Sounds like a Title VII claim if I’ve ever heard one but the fuck do I know? 💁🏻‍♀️ unfortunately I can’t give legal advice legally so…
Sue her ass into the ground!
sue. ruin her life
""The trans are opressing us!11!""

_Proceeds to basically fire someone who tries to educate people._
OP SUE THE DISTRICT, YOU HAVE A CASE, YOU CAN WIN AND MAKE A POINT OF IT
Op sue them, go to the press and report them to the highest legal authority.
Sue. Go for it. Big stink lots of noise. Your face on the nightly news, magazine articles both supporting and eviscerating. Strangers judging you and all your decisions. 
I don’t have the mug for it but you might. Just please consider all your options before you open a Nonanonymous shit can. I support you whatever you decide.
Honestly, just to be petty at this point, I’d reply all to that email and explain how the principal is factually incorrect about the sex ed thing and being publicly discriminatory in a district where this is totally legal.
In addition to discrimination, you also may be able to press charges for retaliation if you recent fought and won against previous disciplinary actions. Retaliation cases are often super easy to win with
If there is a lgbt or trans association in your area, contact them. Some are well equiped to mail the principal with some scary and true legal arguments saying that they are not respecting the rights of people, etc.
id try to find a new school. even if in that district a new school should be better
Sorry for your troubles.  Some times admistrators are POS, not Parent over shoulder.
Are you in Florida by any chance?

Edit: also thanks. Really. Hateful people suck, and also you helped just by taking the kid seriously, even if the principal doesn’t. That stuff makes a real difference, especially when it’s harder to find.
seriously, you should sue.
Please sue that bitxh.

I'm sorry you've been put through this ♥️
Sounds like a shitty principal. Gather with board of trustees vote the
I am a trans teacher and that infuriates me. Metaphorically claim her head by suing the shit out of her, the district and anyone else you can make this their problem. Scorch the earth.
DO THIS OP

what they did is majorly discriminatory and they can get in trouble for this
Unfortunately, this is the way.
That would be fabulous. She loves news stories about how wonderful she is. Calls the newspaper herself every time she thinks she's done something great. I will keep that as a possibility.
This is so important. Someone is calling, you should answer. Don't let them chase you off, you chase them off. Let her know this kind of behavior will not be allowed anywhere. Protect yourself but more importantly, protect your students. They need you. Do it for them. This is your calling.
Yeah this. Definitely do what you need to for your own mental health here, but if you can do it this is a fight worth having.
Obliterate her
Sounds like the principal overstepped the scope of their responsibilities and will now cost the district money in settling an unfair dismissal lawsuit.
You weren't teaching sex ed you were answering questions about gender dysphoria.
If students are educated why you're trans when they are younger they are less likely to be discriminatory as adults.
One of the first things I did when I received the administrative leave emails. My rep is amazing and was so helpful with the first issue.
This us great advice IMHO. 

Also came here to say ""hugs and battlecries"" is the absolute perfect motto for these times.


Pure genius.
[deleted]
I will share that with my union rep. Because I feel that it is retaliation (as well as discrimination).
Not in Florida or Texas or Alabama 

It is legal in my state to teach gender affirming lessons and to use preferred names/pronouns at school even without parent consent.

I will always advocate and openly support my trans, gay, and neurodiverse students.
This is the only education bullies understand
unfortunately indeed. Most people never learn until there are dire consequences imposed
Now it got a lot sweeter, the media loves drama and the that fact she contacts them so much only increases the chances the media will make this a big deal, greatly shaming her.
Calling the newspaper about yourself as a teacher shouldn’t be allowed. It only makes her look like she’s teaching for all the wrong reasons
Ohhh, she’s a malignant narcissist. That explains everything. You have the power to rock her world and give her the proverbial punch to the face she never got.
The fact that there was a first issue at all means that you should absolutely sue. You're one of the few in a position to stand up against this kind of abuse; please do so.
No doubt, anyplace worth its salt has procedures in place (besides the admin event log) to prevent shenanigans. I know that Mimecast requires two full admins to confirm a delete, and it still logs the event.

I would think the real risk is a middling-size district with a struggling IT department still maintaining an Exchange server, with more admins than they keep track of and a principal proactive enough to make the request before any word of legal hold wafts through.

Without becoming slanderous, my district had some pretty glaring issues with corruption/internal matters at the time, like switches going missing from campuses to be auctioned on ebay or IT employees getting fired the day before payday and never getting their last check.

I agree it's a small chance, but it's not nonzero and the stakes are quite high. I guess the other angle here is to assume that email access may be revoked at any time, and therefore not rely on a digital copy as evidence.
It's truly necessary that we make an example of them to spread the message that transphobia cannot be tolerated. I hope OP does this, because the schools, and everyone, need to learn that gender identity and sexual identity are far from the same thing. The most common misconceptions are that your biological sex and your gender are associated at all, or that discussing your gender is related to who you are attracted to. It's an ignorance that must be turned into an education or we will remain in the dark ages of oppression forever.  
  
  So until the communities that surround all of the schools understand that gender itself is not a sexual topic, just because they've been miseducated about ""perversions"", we must continue to stand our ground.  
  
  OP, to act legally is not only for your own protection or benefit, but it is for the protection and benefit of all the trans people, and most importantly the students, who are surrounding this district.
Well that's good then, because the principal is indeed teaching for all the wrong reasons."	ueck0q	trans	2173	0.95	2022-04-29 03:13:54
Look at this bullshit		"i don't understand, what is this?
They can make you register, but they can't stop you from dodging a draft.

Edit: Do as you wish. I'm not taking any chances with the military. I'm leaving if there's a draft.
If the US ever actually started drafting people, trans people would be the least of their worries, they would not know or care if you dodged the draft
I would just say that I’m severely suicidal. Why draft someone who can’t be trusted around a gun?


Also, old enough to get shot. Not old enough to make decisions about your body. Fuck this country.
Wait what is this in the USA? Why am I forced to sign up for the draft if this country won’t let me live the way I want. I have no interest in the military or a draft.
fine I’ll just girlboss my way through the military
I fucking hate the phrase “identifies as a gender”. Like,  yeah of course I identify as that gender, cause that’s what I fucking am. It’s always used to basically imply that we chose this later in life.
The whole selective service is a vestigial load of crap. It doesn't serve any practical purpose, the government already knows who all the fighting-age ""males"" are, this is just a jingoist social ritual designed to remind you of your obligation to the state. Registering doesn't make you suddenly subject to some hypothetical draft, because there is no draft and if they ever do have one again they WON'T use Selective Service rolls to fill it. The last time we had a draft, it was the source of only 10% of draftees, and would be even less today.

That said, this nonsense justifying the claim that the executive cannot simply choose to change the definition of who they will require to register is misleading. The whole reason we are even still required to register is because in 1980, JIMMY CARTER brought it back with Presidential Proclamation 4771 and set the very terms cited on this page, including the language of ""male citizens...born on or after January 1, 1960..."" This language is NOT in the 1917 law (obviously). This page is lying.

There is probably a good reason that the executive shouldn't change the definitions, mainly that the next admin could just change them back. But UNLESS congress acts, this discretion rests squarely with the president.

And if you ask me, we should either require everyone to register, or abolish the system.
Not them invalidating trans women by saying trans men aren't required. Hell invalidates both sides smh. I'm so done with all this
Does an amendment to a birth certificate not mean 'hey the old one is wrong, ignore it and read this one'? There is absolutely no reason to go off of a no longer legally valid document for the sole purpose of drafts
jokes on them, I’m too mentally unstable to be drafted
Considering the amount of SA and violence that goes on in the military, I think I'll pass. Fleeing the country sounds more pleasant.
They can draft me all they want, I refuse to kill or assist in killing for the United States
Selective service is dumb anyways.
Ladies chill, having served already I can guarantee the military does not want us in their ranks with all of the additional surgeries, medications and needs specific to us.

Worse that can happen is you go, and get disqualified early in the process. If you make it to boot camp it would be a miracle at all.
What the hell is this?! I hope someone here gets that reference lol. But seriously, WHAT?! If gender is really what matters here then you’re just practically saying women don’t matter on any plane of reality what so ever!
Tbh I don’t think selective service is enforced. I did it because I was afraid I’d be arrested at the time if I didn’t but I know plenty of people who had no idea they had to do it/ just didn’t do it.
Dont worry, they don't pick us
Just a reminder that the draft is literal slavery and needs to be abolished.
I remember after I finished everything, I called to have myself removed from the draft. They told me they couldn't and when I pressed, they said the government doesn't recognize transgender people and until they do, mtf are stuck on the draft and can be drafted.
i'll never risk my life to fight for a damn oil company. they'd have to throw me in jail cause i'd never go
I always thought that was ridiculous. But euphoria moment, I found out I was automatically registered for the selective service when I legally changed my gender to male! I'm not worried though, I'd be able to use HRT and my mental health diagnoses to disqualify me if I somehow do get drafted. Also for context, in my state (Illinois) if you're listed as a male between the ages of 18 and either 25 or 30 (I can't remember lol) you're automatically registered when you go to get a drivers license or state ID, so it's got me wondering if a trans woman would be taken off the registry if she changes her gender on her ID, since I was registered when I changed mine.
I would never die for the people running this shit show country. They need to be thrown out there on the front lines and fight it out themselves if they wanna fight.
Is this recent? I changed my name/gender marker 1.5 yrs ago and received my selective service card shortly after
The idea of an only male draft is already archaic, you can tell in the Q&A they don't love it either
I had to do this a bit ago. ITS THE FUCKING WORST. Not only do I have to register in the first place, the entire website genders you male, and when you finish registering it outright says CONGRATULATIONS MR. <LASTNAME>. Fuck the selective service.
Y'all, this legal requirement is very, very old. The Selective Service Act was passed in *1917*, long before transness was even remotely on the public radar.

The reason it hasn't been changed is because this is not just a trans issue; it is also a cisgender issue. The law basically defines men as those AMAB and says that we are all eligible for conscription. AFABs are exempt because sexism was still no big back then.
Yeah, that's fucky.  Draft sucks period and definitely sucks for men but it feels invalidating as a trans woman to not be seen as a woman by the US military in such an instance.  Fuck 'em.
as a trans man i will never ever compare my experiences to trans woman because they have it so much worse than us and this is just more proof
How do you know if you did or didn't register for SD I don't want to so I want to make sure I haven't
good thing im mentally ill
I’ll spend time in jail before I fight a war for this hellscape.
Never understood why ciswomen didn't have to register for the draft.  Women are plenty capable of service.
I’m so glad to live in Canada right now, it may not be the best, but holy shit it’s much better than the us
i would literally prefer to just be banned
Yeah, discovered this bullshit with my (ftm) girlfriend (mtf). We were so frustrated about it. But I guess it makes sense cuz the draft is bullshit anyways even when it comes to cis people (I do not like the military). I mean if she ever gets drafted I’ll just pull a mulan and go in her place
Indeed it's afucking bulshit🤦🤦
Honestly why do we even have a mandatoryish registration? Our military is powerful enough as is, and a lot of people do NOT want to server.
drafts are stupid, patriotism is stupid, being expected to serve for your country is stupid, especially a shit hole like the us
Fuck the SS
Might be required to register, but would most likely be ineligible for service if hrt dependent; intersex conditions are already disqualifying for service. Of course if the fascists have control during a draft, common sense might go out the window…
I'm brazilian and we are also required to register. However, I cannot be drafted because the military goes against my personal beliefs. On top of that, trans people have the choice of going or not during a draft.
So...I'm confused.  Do they want us to fight their wars, or be tortured in conversion camps?  Both?  I can't work out if our bodies hold any value to them.
I had to sign up for it. I talked to a recruiter in HS out of curiosity and the moment I told them I had severe allergies and asthma they couldn’t show me the door fast enough. Not sure if that’s changed in 20 years, but if you aren’t young or in peak shape, they don’t want you.
theyre gonna have to spend all that time proving how i was born just for me to tell them i have asthma
i got my draft card in the mail 2 days ago and threw it away immediately. before my birthday they sent me a letter telling me i was gonna be in the draft and i threw it away as well. the us military is a joke and shouldnt be funded as much as it is
Jokes on them, I'm physically incapable of doing literally any job in the military >:3
What's funny is that Trump [tried to undo Obama allowing Trans soldiers](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/26/16034366/trump-transgender-military-ban) until Biden [straight up reversed it](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/) back.  I'm morally opposed to a draft myself and can only see it happening in some *dire* circumstance, but damn... these comments man...
America! Fuck no!
I’m dodging anyways lmfao
Seriously how tf can trans women like us have to register but not trans men… they are against us for who we are what the actual fuck!!
And to think of all the lost souls lost in combat who never got a chance to be openly trans. Terrible.
Wait I’m confused. Are they saying they would draft trans women and not trans men
I'm just gonna bring up that the Government can force me to go and fight and die for a war I don't necessarily agree with but I can't legally drink.

The draft is complete bullshit.
lol i signed up for the selective service under “sexistbootlickers@gmail.com”
With this info, what’s bizarre to me is I was automatically registered for selective service upon changing my DL (in certain states it’s automatic to register males once you get it). Why are MtF women not removed automatically in such states? :/
My brain shut down halfway through reading that.
I would rather die than sign up for the US draft
Who wants to join me and break a federal law as an act of civil disobedience. Any other almost 18 year old Americans here?
The US military just fought a two front conflict without using the draft. I think you'll be okay, and not registering isn't worth the risk. Which is low, but higher than the risk of being drafted. If a AMAB applies for a state college they are automatically registered. 

As far as pushing to change the law to say trans females shouldn't have to register, I think it would just be changed to say EVERYONE has to register. 

If it came down to a draft things would be so fucked up, our cis women would be busy on nine month project making the next generation of soldiers.
The selective service System is a bunch of trash anyway.
They're trying so hard to justify their transphobia
You'd think that they'd not want trans women to serve. They don't have the advantage of testosterone, it's the same as the sports debate. HRT/Orchie stop testosterone and the physical advantages it gives (muscle and the like, not trying to say that women are weaker per se but technically...). Wouldn't they rather have trans men who in a lot of cases actively gym it up so they can look more masculine. I'm not sexist or anything more looking at it through the eyes of the us army (who probably is).
Ngl I thought trans people couldn’t be in the military due to the medication and stuff, similar to me not being allowed because asthma
""Born"" lol
I'm to young to die I'm 19 🥺
I still find it werid that the US has a draft... What is this 1952? McCarthy Era ""Reds under the bed""?


Dumb question, America never got over the McCarthy Era ""socialism is bad, down with Communists!""
sigh... apparently double standards will always find a was in somehow
I don't mind going to the military but I think it should apply to everyone or be equal in some way. I know everyone would feel differently but i grew up with military people in my life.
I could piss off a bunch of people but why not just open it up and make it mandatory for all genders? Equal rights right? I mean women want to be treated equally except when it comes to the possibility they could get “drafted” into military service? Okie dokie then.. and if you were born male, as per the statement it says males born so it would be applicable given you can’t possibly get any gender reassignment before being born.. yet anyway.. and my guess is that would open up a whole new can or worms if it were possible and/or allowed.
This particular exclusion of trans women isn't transphobic actually. The reason why cis women have not been drafted into the military in almost all societies in history isn't their identity or society's perception of what a woman is. It's their uterus, plain and simple. If people who can get impregnated all get drafted in a war, the society can't recover from heavy military losses. Few birth givers can't sustain a society, no matter how many sperm givers there are. Few sperm givers however can with enough birth givers. It sounds disgusting and it is, but that's always been the reasoning behind not drafting cis women, for thousands of years. Cis women and trans women simply aren't the same category regarding their breedability. However, since most trans men are either infertile because of T or would most likely refuse to get impregnated anyway, their exclusion from drafts definitely seems transphobic.
If it makes you feel better OP I’m 25 and never signed up fuck the fed 😘
Why is ""born"" in quotes bro. That's so stupid and unnecessary. (second bullet)
Well, since most states seem to want to qualify being trans as ""a mental disorder"" then you're too unwell to be drafted.
There are grandparents alive today who were born after the last time the USA invoked the military draft. If there’s ever a war again where the USA needs to draft soldiers, it will either be because China Red-Dawned us, or because we’re evac’ing people from fallout zones, or because there was a rapid and debilitating worldwide pandemic, or because zombies. Or … if Congress gets completely gerrymandered into warhawk Republican control and they decide to [redacted] the entire USA.

Military conscription is an artifact of the era of human history when boots on ground taking territory was a viable technique. World War I, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam occupations proved to USA military brass that those aren’t real world military tactics any longer. 

Now the USA bases their military superiority on a model of something like 8-to-1 logistics-to-field MOSes, and every one of those is highly specialized and trained. 

The era of putting conscript grunts through boot and dropping them in forward ops is gone. The chances of selective service ever being invoked again is single digits.
Humans are such a fucked up civilization
Yeah it is bullshit that those that assigned female at birth still don't have to register for Selective Service, Congress should hurry up and fix that.
we need to go get our own county. a country just for us where this shit doesn't happen
Yep I got so mad at it I joined the army (no seriously I got super pissed at this and my solution to avoid a draft was to already be in. Also 2019 so it kinda was a trans ban in military, suck it trump im joining anyway)
The constitution of the United States requires 6 years of service from every man as service to our country.

A person's motivation for volunteering is unique to each individual.   You can choose the branch or you chose peace corps.

The United States is not unique in this requirement; nor is the USA unique in requiring said service of the AMAB individuals only.

Not to be confused with the DRAFT which was enacted by congress long after the original constitution was enacted.  Congress controls the  Draft, much the same as they control just who can be drafted.  They chose to allow those AFAB to serve in combat positions.  

The ""terms of service"" are established by individual branches dependant on their needs, hence my original enlistment obligated me to 4 years of active duty and 2 years of so-called inactive duty.  Earning me coverage under the original ""GI"" bill to pay for college or trade school; it also earned me a seat in Hospitalmen Corps school.

At that time there where all sorts of combinations to satisfy the required "" 6 years""  and avoiding the draft which could have put me in any branch of the service dependant on the needs of the government - except the U S Coast Guard which at that time was not under the CNO nor considered for draftees assignment.

By law you are still required to register with the draft board, so as to ensure they have a ready pool of candidates should congress determine there is a need to reactivate the system to ensure this country can properly defend itself from all powers foreign or domestic.
What's bullshit about it?
Actually I don't think this is necessarily bad. I think it's in an effort to prevent people from changing their gender to avoid military service. Which ultimately protects the trans community (by excluding those that are only trans on paper i.e. no dysphoria, questioning, fear etc, the people that would go that's ok if we didn't exist anymore) and protects the system by saying you can transition however it's not going to be used as an excuse.
You may not like it, but I am so glad to being a US Vet and getting my HRT and gender-affirming care for free

Does it suck? Sure, not denying that

\*\*EDIT\*\* Lookit these people getting upset that either A-I had a good experience with my time in the military, or B-I'm getting free HRT courtesy of my prior military service. Sorry that I managed to get some college and gender-affirming care for something I did right out of high school in the 90s because I had nothing else to do and knew I would not have been alive if not for said military service
I've been registered for the Draft for 40 years now, and I've never been called up nor has anyone else in that time. The US  has been in a constant state of war, military intervention, police action (call it what you like) throughout my entire life.

The letter above spells out the reasoning and what needs to happen to change it.  Sticking with policy is how the military works.

If you want change, VOTE!
lol I got the letter 5 years ago and didn't register, they can fuck themselves. If there's a draft and I get drafted I'm dodging, or telling them I'm suicidal/homicidal/have a chronic condition if I somehow wind up in the physical.

edit: forgot the easiest way to get out. Just tell them you'd frag your commanding officer then yourself the moment they hand you a live rifle. They won't be able to get you out fast enough.
What's the problem?
That’s false. I’m an FTM army veteran. After I got out of the military, I transitioned and then started college. In order to receive any financial aid, I had to register for the draft. Even though I am prior service and was born female.
Yes, that's bullshit. Selective services does violate a certain rule, after all.
I had to get a letter from the government saying I'm not qualified for the draft before I could get a student loan. It was odd, but I will say the process went much smoother than I thought it would.
What if we just list all the chromosomes so gender doesn't matter.

But it would also display that you have a genetic disability if you got extra or missing some chromosomes. Hmm.

What if we just do not list up gender and anything related to that then.
I kept reading “OPM” as one punch man
Wait, what the fuck am I supposed to do to get the letter of exemption if I already changed my birth certificate, though? It says male now, but it didn't when I was born, and I'm too old to actually register for the draft now either iirc.
Would this still apply if you get your birth certificate changed.
Military drafts make no sense. Surely anyone who gets drafted would have much more reason to fight against the military they were just forcibly drafted into than they would to fight against basically anyone else.
Yeah I got registered for the selective service a few months ago, the fact that it’s so heavily advertised towards men was a very dysphoria inducing experience for me

And it doesn’t help that the way they treat trans people is basically saying “actually the military doesn’t recognize you as your gender even if you change all your papers”
This is just gross and of course it’s the U.S be safe out there ladies
Haha the government is stupid if they think I'll fight for this country
You may also register as a conscientious objector citing philosophical opposition to serving in the military. Historically those objectors were assigned non-lethal roles like desk jobs or logistics. No guarantees though. Objectors have also been forced into human experiments and other dangerous work. If there's a draft, I'm moving.
What country is this?
The thing was like “Protect your country” I’m like “what if I want to watch the American upper class burn for their crimes against humanity they’ve committed under the American Empire.
Oh, yeah, I had to do that recently…..sadly-
Instructions unclear, got my dick stuck in a rifle
Tbh I registered for the draft at 22 after legally changing everything to male and mostly did it as a fuck you to my home state of Arkansas and a feel masculine dude boost since all my friends had to do it at 18. I know that if they called me up I’d A refuse to serve and B they’d see I’m trans male and immediately be like lol get out of here. I’d still show up though just to make them go through the whole thing. *ultimate trick they accept you anyways welcome to the military fucker ;)
Wow.
Absolute bullshit, males and females should be in the draft. Not just males
[Draft Dodger Rag by Phil Ochs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T9MHFldX1E)
Are you still required to be on it even after you’ve legally changed your name and gender marker on all your docs including birth certificates and SS?
Be me: dodge the draft
In my home country it's the other way around: can't get drafted if you're mtf but will get drafted if you'd ftm (but you can tell them you are ftm and they'll leave you alone - but if you want to do your required 6 months of service you still can).

But my question here is: how would they know you're trans? They just ask you to register if you're mtf, there's no way they can know, right?
The only thing that you can do is call your congressional representative. But I don’t see this changing anytime soon. Republicans, both congressional and senatorial, aren’t going to pass some thing that affirms people’s gender identity. 

Also, I don’t want to minimize how you’re feeling, but I don’t think it’s the most pressing thing for Congress to handle regarding trans people. There are so many other issues impacting trans Americans that Congress should probably be handling first. As of right now, we don’t have a draft, and so this issue probably isn’t even on the mind of most of Congress. If and when the MSSA gets revised it will hopefully be to repeal it, but more than likely it will be to revise it so that all Americans, regardless of gender, register.

Again, your frustration is valid and I don’t want to minimize it. If you feel strongly enough, please call your representative and/or senator.
if u go on feminizing HRT don’t some of the side effects make you ineligible for service and stuff
Great in the event that we get attacked and I’m forced to fight they’ll get the overweight, non-athletic, musician, never fired a gun, doesn’t want to kill people, soldier they deserve
I know a cis woman who got a letter about signing up for the draft just cause she had a more masculine name.
at least my autism makes me unfit for military service
Australian here just wanting to know how hard it would be to adopt my bestie if things get worse for her in the US!
You mean more bullshit than having a draft in the US anyway?

Realistically they are unlikely to draft trans people and probably include it so as to not provide a relatively easy way out for people attempting to dodge a draft.

In the rare case that the US has a draft and someone realises they are trans near to or after they are drafted this might be meaningful but as it is its kind of water under the bridge.
I’m honestly more annnoyes at the fact that women still don’t have to register I acctully think this is sexual percicution it’s litterally systematic sexism. Oh and wtf America you fascist ****.(I don’t blame all of America just most of the curry or congresss and the shitty sout

Edit: this may be unpopular and I can see the counter argument so feel free to tell me if I’m wrong I shall keep an open mine
Imagine in the future conflict when the battalion of transfemmes shows up on the battlefield. Boot camp will just be a bunch of Mulan references, and due to DoD transition-care policies, they'll just have field packs of estrogen ""in case you get separated from the squad in the field and are awaiting evac.""
That's targeting how is that legal
papa johns checkout tab
What’s that
If you are like me and have certain mental illnesses, you are good to go. Major Depression is a really common one and an immediate d-qual.
what the fuck
Looks like this is something that got overlooked when updating laws and US Code. The government has their hands tied with the ""born"" and ""male"" language in the original law. They are most likely unable to waive the policy because they won't do anything that won't stand in court. Even if this came to pass and a trans person was called to serve, the military would probably give you a pass when you showed up, as they can make the actual yes or no decision.

EDIT: Also, I can't imagine the military attempting a draft again. The war in Iraq was so deeply unpopular, across all party lines. That, combined with the lessons of the Vietnam debacle were enough for them to put that one on the shelf for a long time to come IMO. They'll just keep bribing economically disadvantaged high school seniors into joining voluntarily...
I have never heard of something like this, where did this become mandatory? Im 18 and never heard anything about a draft
But gender and sex are different. I don’t see how this is factually incorrect.
i can understand the reasoning because someone could in principle legally change their gender without actually changing what they identify as and use that to get out of the draft
but at the same time that doesn’t justify the trans people hurt by this
imo nobody should be drafted anyways and the solution to this and plenty of other problems is to abolish the sss entirely
SEXISM
This is the [Selective Service System](https://www.usa.gov/selective-service). The government agency that replaced the military draft in the 1970's after the Vietnam conflict and compels all AMAB persons - citizens and residents - in the US to register for potential military service in the event of total mobilisation in time of war once said person reaches the age of 18 and expires at the age of 25. It is compulsory and a US citizen CAN be punished for failing to register. 

I am not sure if getting the gender marker changed can nullify that requirement, but I don't think it matters to the US military. If they decide they need warm bodies to fill the ranks, they will get warm bodies to fill the ranks.

It used to be that claiming you are gay was enough to disqualify from the service, but that avenue was closed after the passage of DADA (Don't Ask Don't Tell) 

I had to register, but this was before I came out as trans at 30.
[deleted]
It's the US draft - you have to sign up for it as an AMAB citizen of the US so you can get a draft number (even though we are a volunteer army now)

They don't require AFAB (see for reference the idiocy around the failure to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in the 80s), and the DoD bars intersex people from being in the military at all.

Remember, the US may seem progressive, but that's because we regularly ignore the rules and settle it in court. /half-joking
Facts
I hear New Zealand is nice this time of year.
I'm just glad I don't qualify. A recruiter talked to me a few years ago for some reason and told me I wasn't eligible because I have ptsd and suicidal depression. So I think thats a good thing?
If the USA keeps getting transphobic I plans to flee to Germany
Or I show up and they refuse me bc of mental health issues, the fact that I need meds for various things, and migraines. Other than that they want me to join the military for other reasons(I’m “smart” on paper, strong, again on paper, but what paper doesn’t show is that im not super coordinated)
Anti-depressants seem like a free enough way to dodge, haha.
They cant stop you from saying things that would result in you being dismissed.
They can't really make you register tho. At least, I haven't seen it enforced. Regardless, I'd never fight a war for this shitass country lmao
Draft dodging is a virtue.
I’m leaving cus I don’t want to fight for a fucking curry or government. Though personally women should have to register for the draft as well I feel like. To me it feels like systemic percicution I know that might be an unpopular opinion and I can understand the couneeargument but still.

Also feel free to tell me I’m wrong I will keep an open mind
If there was a war there’s no way I would not dodge I’m in Canada so it could be different but the only options in being in a war are death or PTSD for the rest of your life
I'm applying to schools in Canada after the end of spring quarter at community college.

I don't know how I'll pay for housing (I have a dog and dorms scare me) or food but I don't want to be here after January 2025. I don't want to be here when the Nazis enact the Final Solution.
If you go to the psych ward, are you exempt? I'm just curious, cause I'm AFAB
Chuch
technically they can’t make you do either
Yeah but they still know if you registered or not and it’s a crime to not register. I’m not worried about being drafted though because they’d probably change the rules if they needed to use the draft because trans people would probably just call the military’s bluff.
A lot of people would be unfit for service for a variety of reasons. Mental health being one of them. 

Right there with ya on the hypocrisy and reduction of agency though.
Yeah this is in the states
I don't know if this is still the case, but I had to sign up in order to receive financial aid in college.

It's *not* at all likely it will occur, but it's something to consider.

Honestly, this country would probably be experiencing a lot of awful stuff on the inside and out before a draft.

My plan has always been to leave if there were a draft, but I'm strongly considering moving that up depending on what policies come down the pipeline in the next 5-10 years.
There is no active draft in the United States. You don't have to worry about being drafted and you will likely never have to worry about it. It's an old legislation from 1917 that was just never removed. The US is a volunteer only military and unless the very existence of the country is under threat, you will never see a draft.  


While I empathize with people over this, it's such a non-problem to care about.
Yass Queen your way into Moscow oorah
I have thought exactly this every time ""identifies"" is used for us, or even by many of us. It's a word that needs to go the same way as ""tolerance""; a necessary stepping stone, but nearly archaic and wrong at this point. I don't identify, I am.
Yep. Well done.
Funnily enough, they don't even follow the rules posted. They auto registered me as a trans man a few months after I had my gender marker legally changed. 

Even though every ""get your loans forgiven!!!"" recruiter I've responded to with ""I'm a trans guy, that gonna be a problem?"" has immediately unsubscribed me without another word.
I changed my gender marker to male and they registered me for the draft automatically a few months later.

They don't even follow their own rules lmao.
Also jokes on them, if u have meds u need to take every so often afaik u literally cant be drafted for boots on the ground across the world.
Have you ever heard the song Alice’s Restaurant?? Classic how to get out of the draft ;-)
no but I can check it out.
It was a good song and Publishing date checks out.
agreed
it’s more that they’re saying afab people, no matter what, are weak
Pretty much how they feel.
I'm going to be honest, the US plans to legalize all people having to register soon enough.
Not to be rude to men either! This also sucks for them, sorry if I upset anyone, everyone here is awesome!!! and doesn’t deserve to get hurt by this.
Its saying that males are better soldiers than females. Which has always been the case. 

The policy in the post is in place in order to prevent people from trying to claim that they're trans to avoid a draft. If the US ever implements a draft then there will absolutely be people who try to dodge it by lying about being trans. That's not a statement on the validity of trans people, it's a statement about human nature.
Yup, the draft in and of itself is the problem. If they can’t find enough people willing to fight their war then they shouldn’t be fucking in a war.
Mhmmm made me hate the government more and more
And really, since trans people are like 1ish% of people anyway, they'd probably pull your number - take one good look and say ""nah, nevermind"" and send you on your way.
Mhm, it’s mandatory for trans women but not trans men
That's what I'm getting out of it.
I need explanation
PS, if you are a government official reading this for some reason, bring it! Let's retry Schenk v United States.
This except I think selective service should go away and NOBODY should have to register. But I won't get that wish, so EVERYONE should have to register.
That’s what it was during trumps presidency
Old enough to fight in wars for rich people murdering minorities not old enough to get hormones in the states soon
America doesn't have a draft, it's a volunteer military. It just requires that you sign up for the selective service, so if there is ever legislation to enact a draft they have a list of people they can start picking.   


It's still fucked, but it's a bit incorrect to represent it as an active draft that they're using.
The draft is modern day slavery. 

Any AMAB can be ripped from their families, lives, and friends, to go fight and die in a country half way around the world that they want no part in.
The problem is it never will in places where it is mandatory that everyone serve. The rich and powerful either get a cakewalk and a lot of status or find a way out of it. Look at the royal family and those of them that basically were required to serve and look at what dangers there careers truly entailed it is the same for the rich and powerful in the states and pretty much anywhere. Universal service would just create another way for the rich and powerful to abuse us and say they had to do it when they definitely didn’t.
Because they're quoting the language used in the law
they should get rid of the fucking draft altogether.
There's lots of crap they should hurry and fix.. but it's congress.. so we know that's not gonna happen.
Trans women have to register for the draft but trans men don’t in the United states
In normal countries, you can get hrt and surgeries for free without having to be a vet.
Had a friend once flash her tits at a bunch of bigoty churchy types at a festival, she liked letting them know their taxes paid for her homegrown knockers.
Just wait until potus is from the other party again.. 😒
One of the things Biden ran on was trans equality yet he was the one that implemented this , the system is broken, we need a new one
We are literally a minority. We have been told “oh ahhh vote blue” and look where it’s getting us in Red states. No where. I assure you the VAST majority of red states have trans populations trying to vote for their rights but it’s not working. Voting never works for actual change. Americans didn’t vote out Britain, Iraqis couldn’t vote out the Americans. Russian citizens didn’t vote for a war in Ukraine. Ukrainians can’t vote Russia out of their country. It’s just takes a history book to know that voting is simply an illusion of choice for anyone who strays from the norm or is less powerful.
That’s literally from the sss website , I face imprisonment and large fines if I don’t register , for u the worst u prob would face is not getting financial aid
No exemptions unfortunately I called them and that’s what they said
Yes unfortunately
Those that are too combative towards military authority can end up in military prison before they get out of basic training. Those that are in the military have the fact that even failing to report a conspiracy to usurp or override lawful military authority can be punished by death or life in prison if serving a nation has abolished the death penalty hanging over their heads so it is too risky to even talk about doing anything to that effect unless it gets too bad so most draftees have the sense to just keep their heads down and hope they survive to the end of their service.
USA
Also did it bc at the time it wasn’t clear if our state was going to use that against us. It was advised by my queer group activist adults to not give my state any reason to come after me. Register so they’ll forget about you was the idea. Because heaven forbid they come back in 15 yrs and say your a trans “man” he/she draft dodger and revoke whatever legal identity the state had given you. 2015 Arkansas at its best. Doubt it’s better now but I’ve been in Oregon since 2018
Unfortunately not
In the United States draft has been mandatory for men since the 50s I think, and now they’re forcing trans women to sign up too
Changing gender marker has no affect on SSS registration. It’s still compulsory unfortunately.
It's done so that men don't claim that they're women to get out of serving which seems like bullshit. I mean men have served for thousands of years, if we're supposed to be an equal society then perhaps we should have both men and women serving regardless of whether you're born male or female.
What country is this?

Edit: Nvm, I just saw this is the US
Why do the USA still have a draft? It's like \*the\* country that should not have one. Its position is very defendable, its military is bigger than the next few countries combined, they have enough nuclear capability to glass the Earth and probably some other celestial body, too, and even when they want to fight wars abroad, they know for a fact that drafted soldiers are close to worthless in modern warfare.
thats crazy... then again the military has always been one of the least safe spaces for minorities.
also i never registered but they registered me anyway
You mean trans meant aren’t required I assume is what you meant. Also fuck that. I’m a trans man. Doesn’t matter either way. I’m registered for the draft too. Shouldn’t matter a man is a man and a woman is a women. Everyone should have to sign up. End of story. That would be equality. How it’s handled now is not.
[deleted]
ouchie. My bones.
They can't*force* you to sign up ...they just make life a bit more annoying if you don't.
Is New Zealand a better option than Australia? Or are they about the same because I've thought about moving to Australia if things get too bad
I heard they don't allow autistic people to move there, so no, it does not seem like a nice place to be. If they don't like my kind then I won't go there.
It's about as corrupt as America too!
Feel like this would disqualify like 90% of the people *in* the military.
>suicidal depression

wait, that makes you not qulified?
When there's a war they drop a lot of the restrictions and use formerly unqualified people as cannon fodder.

They would suspend Don't Ask Don't Tell when recruitment numbers were low, then root out any gay people they didn't like when things got better.
If you move here, I'll make cookies.
This isn't an instance of transphobia. It's an instance of gender discrimination that predates much of the developments in trans discourse. This is a very old feature of our legal system. The system requires that everyone AMAB must register for the draft. When it was instituted it was not controversial. But that was quite some time ago.
It would be good to go to Canada, very friendly there
Dont its not much better here 💀
""getting transphobic""? The time to pack your bags was months ago. I'm from a rather conservative rural part of Germany and this is a fucking utopia compared to the shitshow going on in the US. The US is looking more and more like Nazi Germany with every day that goes by
Consider Cuba. Much more friendly.
I've been working toward that goal since about the 2nd week of the pandemic. 

It isn't a trivial thing to do, but if you can line up a job first it makes it a lot easier.
A warm body.
They can't force you to register, but it is a requirement if you plan on becoming a citizen, they will ask for proof that you register when you try doing that.
While they can't ""force"" you [Texas](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&app=9&p_dir=P&p_rloc=197458&p_tloc=&p_ploc=1&pg=4&p_tac=&ti=37&pt=1&ch=15&rl=49) has found a clever way to coerce people into registering.
What do you mean by curry?
I already have complex ptsd, but I'd imagine dodging a draft to be rather traumatic as well.

Not nearly as bad as seeing people die, but certainly something that would stick with you regardless of the reason you'd leave.
As a conscientious objector, I'd call that bluff for sure.  Lemme push paperwork and peel potatoes for 4 years.  The federal government can pay me for it, and then pay for my surgeries.
___
Edit, as there are non-american eyes in this thread, the [SSS's text](https://www.sss.gov/conscientious-objectors/#:~:text=The%20person%20who%20is%20opposed,duties%20that%20include%20using%20weapons.) is included below.

**Service as a Conscientious Objector**  
Two types of service are available to conscientious objectors, and the type assigned is determined by the individual’s specific beliefs. The person who is opposed to any form of military service will be assigned to alternative service – described below. The person whose beliefs allow him to serve in the military but in a noncombatant capacity will serve in the Armed Forces but will not be assigned training or duties that include using weapons.

**Alternative Service**  
Conscientious objectors opposed to serving in the military will be placed in the Selective Service Alternative Service Program. This program attempts to match COs with local employers. Many types of jobs are available, however the job must be deemed to make a meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health, safety, and interest. Examples of alternative service are jobs in:

conservation  
caring for the very young or very old  
education  
health care  

Length of service in the program will equal the amount of time a man would have served in the military, usually 24 months.""
Already existing is a crime, fuck em. Im 25 and never signed up.
If the draft was ever activated again, we would have to be in very bad shape miltiarily (us miltary is virtually unstoppable). If we were in bad shape, unfortunately, the US would quickly drop those standards. This is just a sad reality of war. If you want a reminder of how the US treats undesirables they draft, look no further than how African Americans were treated during Vietnam. (Spoiler alert, they were treated like cannon fauder)

It's pretty fucked. If you've ever watched fury. It really drives home how much ""meat"" was thrown into the grinder of war.
Bro no way fuck that bs
Yeah, I’m going to imagine that if there ever was an active draft again you’d probably have bigger problems to worry about.
Was the ‘very existence’ of the country threatened during Vietnam
Don't count your chickens just yet! uncle Sam's gotta protect those micro processors....
Yup and to further this, the only way a draft would happen now is if WW3 started. Even then we’re so overwhelmingly powerful compared to everyone else that it may not be necessary. That is, of course, depending on how hard China would fight
Still!! Like, it doesn’t matter what the true definition is, this is just so shitty
I mean i guess this is technically less discriminatory, but it's still practically worse for everyone. Like, it's not discriminatory if you're oppressing everbody equally!
I agree with that, the world is already broken and messed up in some ways
What about world war 2 or the civil war? Both were battles against tyranny. Should the US have done nothing in those situations?
Weeeeeiiiird
Tbf I’m more ok with that than being forced to. I’m not an American so it doesn’t bother me I was just interested
If I had to do that I wouldn't
Got it, soo you ""volunteer"" for this ""not draft"" incase we reinstate the draft.... When was that again.... Oh yeah 2002
Selective Service is unlikely to be abolished especially during heightened tensions with Russian and China, and if they did abolish Selective Service in the event of a major war that would have pushed the USA into reinstating the draft they would just reintroduce the Selective Service act so we might as well push for the Selective Service to made more equal.
That is definitely true.

Yeah duh if they didn’t do it that way you would just have everyone saying they’re female to get out of the draft. Not sure why everyone here is so mad about this it’s not like you’re ever getting drafted anyways. And if you really wanted to Dodge it there’s better ways to do so
I mean, you're not wrong
I won't lie and say I don't take pride in knowing that these Red Hats are paying for this experience
did you even read the website you linked? it litterally says:

> Changes to the MSSA involving Selective Service registration requires Congressional action. It cannot be changed through Presidential Proclamation or Executive Order. As such, the registration requirement remains based on the assigned gender at birth.

given this, how do you suggest Biden change it? Bonus points if you reference who controls house of representatives.
I stand by what I said.
Well if they're going to force you into military service only to imprison you or have you killed, then surely its just a waste of resources.
Holy shit!? I thought this was going to be some eastern Europe or SE Asian dictatorship 😬
I wonder why i have no memory of any of this. What happens if you just, dont?
Doing more research on this and checking my own emails and stuff. Ive literally done none of these “required” things nor has anyone in school or home ever talked about it. We sure this is worth worrying about?
drat and double drat.

Oh well. I'm old farts so I'm long past the age of getting drafted...but my younger trans femme siblings...I worry for you all...💗💗
We haven’t used it since the Vietnam war (1964 - ‘74). The military is an “all volunteer” force. The draft is for just in case.
My understanding is that Congress just never bothered removing it. Actually calling for a draft is political suicide regardless of party and they haven’t even enforced the registration requirement for decades so it would be a logistical nightmare
Because there’s no harm in having a backup plan. Especially since, historically speaking, all nations fall eventually
While everyone's experience can obviously differ, and I do recognize that the US military has been historically bigoted towards LGBT+, my experience as a trans woman in then navy has been one of the more accepting and safest spaces. Granted this is from a commissioned experience, not an enlisted.  


I will however phrase that the Marines and Army are not safe spaces for any minorities though. Infantry focused branches tend to attract extreme toxic masculinity.
If your a resident of the US, you kind of have to…

You can go to jail for five years and be fined <$250,000 USD if you don’t.

Also you need to register to be eligible for FASFA grants for higher education.

You are already registered in some states if you possess a drivers license. 

Also take into consideration there has not been a draft since Vietnam (‘64 - ‘73)
Got flashbacks to that Russian who got his friend to jump on his shin from the top of the stares
About the same, although I would say New Zealand gets the edge as far as trans issues go. I’m an Australian and I can say that while we do get lots of assholes, the general attitude amongst the populace to trans people is more indifferent than seething.

That said you’d probably have an easier time immigrating to New Zealand, Australian residency isn’t that easy to get unfortunately,
NZ is super friendly to trans, hrt is covered by national medicine as are some gender affirming surgeries like bottom/top surgery.
Welcome to Australia...
Everything here can kill you in varying degrees of slow and painful. Please remember to always check your shoes, your bed, your toilet, your barbecue, your kitchen cupboards and pretty much anywhere else you have that's semi dark and a good place for critters to hide
I've lived in both places for a good chunk of my life and I can tell you this. Trans acception is far better in NZ than it is in Australia speaking from personal experiences, although it's slightly harder to go on hormones in NZ. Also no one is really forced to do anything in NZ but be a good citizen. Plus no animal in NZ can kill you, there's no snakes, only one poisonous spider and either way it doesn't have enough venom to kill, and no natural predators other than humans. And over in Australia pretty much everything can kill or harm you. I'd probably consider immigrating to NZ rather than Australia as it will be easier with NZ laws. Either way you will be fine 😄.
Huh... that's surprising...*goes to google*

Oh...I see. That sucks. It looks like it is almost an entirely financial decision but that does not make it any less shitty.
theres a bit more nuance to it than that and youre likely to run into the same hurdle immigrating nearly anywhere else, if your autism affects your life to an extent that would have a heavy cost on the countrys economy to accommodate theyre less likely to accept citizenship, its still super fucky theres no denying that but financially i understand it
Just going based off of what I was told. It mightve been bad info
Recruiter said technically because it, ""makes me a danger to others""
so it’s an instance of transphobia
Canadian government has been looking like US government 12 years behind so maybe not as good as you'd think
Celeste
How likely are the fascists to take over there? Honestly asking because I hope things look better elsewhere. Because desantis might be the end.
How so? For me it wasn't too bad, but I am just starting out, like I'm waiting for some test results to get some E right now
If DeSantis makes it into the whitehouse it's gonna get significantly worse, significantly faster.
Hm?
Currupt
Having served with objectors it's not nearly this rosey for them 😬
In most states, having a driver’s license automatically signs you up. In every other state, you need to check a box which signs you up in order to file your FAFSA
This was a thing when I was in high school and yeah I was like what in the world. I would show up and you would immediately not want me given I am trans and have a boat load of health issues besides. The point of this if they ever institute a draft they can say you agreed to serve so now your breaking the law. Fun fact though for a while the penalty for not signing up for selective service was not getting to vote so my progenitor does not vote to this as he refused to sign up on grounds of seeing what Vietnam did to his brother. I don’t blame either my uncle his brother found dead under mysterious circumstances supposedly suicide but it was obviously murder. So again he saw the system  failing him so he redoubled his refusal. All that said look into the penalty for not registering I am pretty it is something along those lines. Though in my opinion having a penalty for not registering is coercion and invalidates the whole we gave you a choice thing.
There’s plenty of countries with mandatory service. The US simply has you sign up for the draft, which will almost certainly not be used any time soon. After Vietnam it’s likely the draft won’t be enacted unless we were in imminent danger, to the point that a lot of people would probably already willingly serve.
During Vietnam the draft had never been removed prior to begin with. That's not a relevant example.

Vietnam being fought is literally what created the political scenario for the draft to be banned and the US to switch to a volunteer only force. You can **not be drafted by the United States military**. It is literally illegal for them to do so. Congress has to pass legislation in order for a draft to take place, which will never happen.
The Vietnam war is why the US returned to a volunteer-only military, it was so deeply unpopular with people of a draftable age that Congress did not expand the draft law and it is unlikely to  reintroducte the draft unless the existence of the USA was under threat while the Vietnam war (And possibly the Iraq war) is still within living memory.
Taiwan is more important than micro processors. But no there wouldn't be a draft for that either. It would just be a naval war for starters, so draft wouldn't help. And you would need Congress to actually agree on a draft, which wouldn't happen.
oh for sure, it’s super shitty! i was just adding that you pointed out only how this affects the women in this sub without acknowledging how it affects the men here
I mean, most people eligible to be conscripted in those wars volunteered.
The point still stands. If the country cannot motivate its citizens to volunteer to fight and die for this war they shouldn’t fight it.
That’s disingenuous. The US should make do with the volunteers they have. That’s not nothing.
Gotcha , wish I wasn’t American , I grew up in Austria but was adoptive by an American couple
I registered before coming out again so I didnt even think about it at the time. Still stupid af that in America they are trying to ban our care and tell us to serve them
The last draft was in 73. You’re probably thinking of the reservists which were called up.
The last draft was in 1973, 2002 was when they called on the reserve forces, otherwise known as volunteers.

There's no semantics to be played here. There is no draft in the United States. There is the selective service act which creates a list of people to call on in the event legislation is passed that enacts a draft.

You will never be drafted by the United States military, it is legally a volunteer only force. They are physically not fucking allowed to draft you unless congress specifically passes legislation to enact one.
The last draft was in 1973 during the Vietnam War. the closest thing to the draft since than was National Guard members being called up for active duty during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
They have the largest military in the world and Russia and the US clearly aren’t deserving of militaries at all.
Bruh wtf is wrong with u
I would be surprised if a bill changing that hasnt come across his deck and he other ignored or trashed that
Draftees are more likely to be willing to stick out the unknown risks of serving in the military than the certain risk of being put to death or sent to a military prison, so in the eyes of the military the wastage would be within acceptable limits, likely being outnumbered by wastage by other non-combat sources such as disease (Occupational and viral), accidents, and stress reaction.
I’m theory they can send u prison and fine u, I got a notice in the mail saying I had to or else they would
Yeah but, even in a ""just in case"" way, what case?? Mainland invasion? How on Earth? Can't happen, if that happens someone has sunk the entire US fleet and is powerful enough as to not fear nuclear retaliation, it's fantasy.
All volunteer as in groomed and financially troubled kids or young teens who have no direction in life that are taken advantage of by the military
> The military is an all volunteer force

that's an extremely generous way of putting it; i was under the impression that many of the people there were pressured into it by their financial situation
I don't know anyone who would fight for this country anymore, pretty sure most of us would just let it burn at this point... They can draft all they want they already made enemies out of most of us...
there are significant penalties if you are caught and don't register. registration is required to qualify for some federal programs and benefits.

""If required to register with Selective Service, failure to register is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 and/or 5 years imprisonment. Also, a person who knowingly counsels, aids, or abets another to fail to comply with the registration requirement is subject to the same penalties.""

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/02/failing-register-draft-women-court-consequences-men/3205425002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/02/failing-register-draft-women-court-consequences-men/3205425002/) 

""... fail to register for the draft by then can no longer do so – forever closing the door to government benefits like student aid, a government job or even U.S. citizenship...

...Forty states and the District of Columbia link Selective Service to a driver's license. But some of those allow men to opt out of registration, and about a quarter of Americans in their early 20s don't have a driver's license.  
Thirty-one states have legislation mirroring federal laws on student aid and employment, applying those bans to state-funded student aid programs and state employment.

Some states go even further:   
  
► In eight states, men are not allowed men to register at a state college or university – even without financial aid – if they aren't registered for Selective Service. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and Tennessee.   
  
► In Ohio, men who live in the state but don't register for Selective Service must pay out-of-state tuition rates.  
  
► In Alaska, men who fail to register for the draft can't receive an annual dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which gave Alaska residents $1,600 from state oil revenue in 2018.""
My heart sings to hear things have changed that much. I served as a naval flight officer during the early nineties.  I cannot conceive of a more toxic male environment, outside of Marine infantry.  I remember our squadron skipper standing there at quarters to announce don’t ask don’t tell’s inauguration and telling us that it was clear that the service was better off without “those people”

Don’t even get me started on the hostility to women in general— this was just before the integration of women into tactical squadrons.  “Split tails” “cracks in the airframe”.  I heard it all. Also Tailhook. 

I guess I wasn’t as closeted as I thought— my squadron mates would do lovely things like shove gay porn under my door.  I did appreciate the big book of sports they gave me at my hail and farewell so I could “learn to hang out with guys”. That was actually kinda funny, I admit. 

Drove me out of the Navy but not aviation. I fly for a major US carrier these days, but stay stealth. Just another woman pilot.  They didn’t take the sky from me.
Isn't there an age limit to sign up anyways?
No stop no no ew yuck. Whyd you have to remind me of that???
NO!! WHY THE FUCK?!
Yep i remember that one. Poor fuckers
Sounds good, I'll definitely consider it
From what I read if you have at least 4 years of military service you can apply for a position in the Australian military to be able to move there (but you'd of course have to be okay with being in the military) i have thought about it a good deal myself

Edit: 
It seems it's at least 5 years and you can only have been out for a maximum of 3
Also the flora and fauna in NZ aren't trying to actively kill you.
Sounds great I'll definitely consider it if things go to sh*t
I hear the waiting lists for surgeries are years long tho
and dont go to sydney
Oh it's not *that* bad, spiders aren't an issue, sure it'll hurt but antivenom means that as long as you're more than 3 hours from a hospital, and you're bitten by a red back, then you're in trouble. But if you're living in general suburbia it's fine.

Plus, at least in Melbourne, like, I'd say it held the most livable city title for years for a reason.
More like an instance of complete ignorance of the existence of transness. But I'm not going to die on this hill. People are acting like this is some new, scary thing, not the one hundred year old law it is. That's my point.
It’s more of a way station than a final destination
Seriously?
Pretty unlikely cuz this country is so slow and that goes for the right and left wing
Our equivalent to the Republican party (AfD) has like 10% of votes, meaning they are in parliament... But none of the other parties want to work with them, so they're not exactly in a position of power. Best they can currently do is try to delay.

In addition to just the general pack of popularity, we've also changed how our government works after WW2, specifically to prevent people like Hitler from gaining power in the future. For now, the AfD is being monitored for potentially being unconstitutional. So if, say, the leader of the AfD were to encite a mob to storm the parliament and hurt MPs, the party would be banned.
Doctor 1: doesnt believe me
Doctor 2: asked me if i want antidepressents so i stop thinking about it lmao
Doc 3: its against his religion 

..... need i say more?
I don't trust the military. Never have, and never will. I'm leaving if a draft ever happened. I don't think the US would be a good place to live by that point anyway.

You do you.

❤️✌️
Very true, but in this scenario my choices are pretty much 'dodge the draft' or 'don't dodge the draft'.

I mean, I wrote that post but I'd bet a literal finger that we won't have another draft.
Prior Air Force maintenance here. We had someone who decided they just didn’t want to work anymore so stated they then objected. They ended up being a chaplain’s assistant assistant (double assistant intended) for a few months before being kicked out.
Shit. I’m in AZ, have a DL and am literally doing my FAFSA rn. The draft really is to get the poor huh
""you would immediately not want me given I am trans and have a boat load of health issues""

I hate to be that girl but that is WHY they would want you. In their mind you are the meat shield for their ""more valuable soldier."" It's disgusting. And apparently dishonorable discharge is so much worse than a felony. You literally lose a bunch of civilian rights like right to bear arms.

Oh my goodness! No no no! That was not my intention I’m so sorry! My communication skills are awful! 😂😣
The civil war was wildly unpopular in the north, they genuinely needed the draft to support the war effort. And if we hadn’t who knows where america would be now.
I made the same point to the other commenter, the civil war was a wildly unpopular war not just for the north but the south as well. Most common people didn’t see it as their war. So the draft was put in place to make up for that. Now I ask, what would’ve been the outcome if the north hadn’t succeeded or as much as they did in the conflict? We are actively dealing with tons of issues in America that can be directly connected to how the north handled the post civil war south. I think it’s just be safe to say that america would’ve been worse without it in place.
10 million drafted soldiers for ww2, 2/3s of those that fought in ww2, it would be disingenuous to say that the draft serves no purpose. Sure more would’ve enlisted on their own given enough time to make the decision, but would enough have made the decision for us to wage the war on 2 fronts as effectively as we did? Would the war have taken longer without that manpower? Would the Allie’s have won without the manpower?
I know it's stupid I wish we were all happy this community is like a family to me and I don't want to lose it now
I mean I remember when an American citizen litterally crossed into Canada to avoid going to Iraq... It was such a big deal here a band even a song about it. IIRC he got a less than honourable discharge
It does not matter if Russia and China are a legitimate threat or not, the Warhawks in Congres would use the heightened tensions to kill support for any bill to abolish Selective Service and as I stated before if such a war did back they would very likely reintroduce the Selective Service act if it was abolished.

It is China that has the largest military though two of its branches are currently lacking in capability when compared to the USA, China also has a much larger conscription base than the USA. The U.S. Military has gotten smaller than it was before the war in Iraq and so have the militaries of many of their allies.

I don't think any of the parties directly mentioned are really deserving of their militaries yet I also think that sexism is unacceptable.
that person is just a troll. report, ignore, and move on.
Cool, cuz i wanna die for the country that wants me dead anyways 🙄
WW3, I guess.
That’s the military complex for you :/
Ya, like end of the world shit. They would lower the enlistment standards and up their bonuses, activate all their reservists and national guardsmen, recall anyone who recently got out, throw money at anyone who is about to get out, and hardcore recruit new people before they even touched the draft. The draft is a “oh shit we are fighting the end of the world and need all hands on deck RIGHT NOW” option anymore.
Just in case the government decides to wage a war that is both going very poorly and is very unpopular i.e. they decide to invade China or some shit. Like, if the war comes to the homeland people are going to willingly sign up. The draft is only for ""Oops, we fucked up good.""
That's not necessarily true. I am in the military as a trans person, and I love it. Feel free to ama.
They’re also just plain manipulated into it by recruiters. I’d recommend Second Thoughts video on YouTube about this if you want to learn more.
You are completely correct, didn’t think about that. It’s early
This. I feel like there’s a bit of a bubble in some spaces where people 1. Think a draft will never happen and 2. Think you don’t really need to register
40
We all suffer together 🥰
Honestly, probably a better option than going to the Ukrainian meat grinder
Aren't they already?
Just be warned, its VERY hard to get a visa to NZ. They have very low limits.
the wait list for affirming surgery is like half a decade or more and while the populace is generally indifferent, the trans health system is spotty. where its good its great, where its bad its terrible. HRT being covered is great tho, what i want, sublingual pills, is not covered fully so while i dont know yet how much it will be, it will be probably costly. super hard to actually get to live here permanently tho so start the process early cause when shit hits fan we will probably close up.
I mean, because it's a tourist hotbed and over rated and full of pick pockets or some other reason.... I live far away From hot Britain so.... Please enlighten me, not like I'd ever go to Hot Britain.... My complexion it'd be a death sentence for me. (Pale and Ginger)
Three words friend, Funnel Web Spider
it’s absolutely dystopian here. Ontario has been slowly losing universal healthcare
I mean, they recently had the whole “Do you have a mental health issue? Try Assisted Suicide!” thing going on
Yeah, it took me over a decade to get HRT, even in Canada. Lots of ""lost"" paperwork. Finally got it when I found a doctor who was themselves non-binary. I was on the edge of suicide before they prescribed it, like, literally had a plan for the following weekend if they had said no or jerked me around too. Now I'm the happiest I've ever been.
Well I certainly am sorry that you had such a bad experience but in all honesty it was the exact opposite for me so it is kinda hard for me to see the bad parts, like I certainly know that the healthcare system is not very pro trans but as I said I have yet to make a negative experience with any medical professionals considering the trans topic, but I can definitely understand your viewpoint. I also hope I didn't offend you in any way.
I grew up in rural Bavaria and actually moved out to Frankfurt because I probably would've had a similar experience as you if I'd tried transitioning in Bavaria. 
If you're anywhere close to Frankfurt, I got some recommendations, just hmu :)
Oh, I’d leave too lol, I’d seek asylum in canada or something
Yes it is

it’s nbd :)
According to a quick google search only 2% of the unions military was draftees
Who knows my dude? I didn’t say it serves no purpose, just that the purpose doesn’t justify taking away someone’s autonomy. I would fight to keep that autonomy, but not for a cause I don’t believe in.
We ain’t losing when u play a board game and someone gets mad they are losing they will try to cheat and try to flip the board we are strong and our strength is what helps me know I’m not going anywhere, we are stronger then others hate, always have been always will be.
Yeaah; draft isn't for self-defense; it's to round up any political groups that are against a big war, then send them poorly trained and underequipped to soak up bullets for the ""true believers"" that follow in the second wave.

America knows both firsthand and from observation what kind of soldiers draftees are, more often than not. And they wouldn't let them near anything worth using, they'd be fodder. Because for every draftee that wants to be a hero for their country, there's 10 more weighing the consequences of fragging their CO for ordering a suicidal maneuver.
It is almost never prosecuted. I think a lot of people don't register out of absence of mind or lack of knowledge of it tbh.

I used to work for a federally funded disability program. This has real consequences for people with disabilities or needing services later. That is the stuff that really hurts folks down the road, and it is not like you can register after you age out. you aren't able to at that time. I've also been asked for that document specifically multiple times when trying to just get a driver's license or some other randomly mundane thing, and only because I'm AMAB.

The constitutionality is up to date as the only reason SCOTUS let it stand was because women were not able to be in combat roles. That has since changed.
Was talking more about Donald but sure
Ah, it was for draft dodging. Now I get it, but still, brutal.
Facts
Yes but not in my area
Wdym by ""limits?""
the rest of the country isnt much better but thats where some of the most dangerous species are, such as a spider that can kill you in a matter of minutes and is exclusive to the region
Just don't live in NSW /j
But okay that's an understandable worry, but even there, there hasn't been a death from one in several years I think.
Thats nice to hear and im sorry for the shit and thoughts u had to go through
How would u offend me with any of that ?
I moved from bavaria aswell 👀 but nowhere near frankfurt

With an additional 6% being paid in by those who were drafted.
Yeah
Yeah the trans community is stronger than ever
Yeah it wasn't pretty lol
Start planning now. You can just up and leave one day. It typically takes years of paperwork and planning. 

It also takes a lot of money in most circumstances, if you are able, start saving, and I'd be ready to move it offshore quickly if things look bad. 

Of course, I'm unemployed and broke.  Unless I find a job soon, I'm SOL. (Junior Software Dev or Technical Support Engineer if I must, plz hire me)
Since its a relatively small country and they have a fuck ton of people who want to move there, they don't give out as many visas as most countries. So getting one is tough, they won't just let anyone who wants to come over.
Got it
Fair enough.... I have massive fear of Spiders so
I have no idea actually, I'm just really scared of any kind of confrontation so I'm usually really careful.
If you haven't yet, try to find queer/trans groups in your area; people there should be able to recommend accepting therapists/doctors near you. Alternatively, I bet queer organizations like Transmann e.V. can also help you out if you reach out to them!
[removed]
Being non-binary, I can dodge it
Hehe, samee, I've lived here my whole life and I hate spiders. Daddy Long Legs are fine, but all others are kill-on-sight for me. I've had a few spiders try to get me while in bed, and all that. Really gave me a fear of them too, but it's not enough to merit not living here, I love this place.

(It might help that I'm not too far of a drive from one of the hospitals around, too, means even in a worst case scenario, I'm not gonna die from a spider)
I shouldnt be allowed on the internet if i would get offendet by u saying that u didnt have the same problems as me 💀

Naw, I mean seriously the larger higher-risk issue with Australians is actually skin cancer, just because of how the sun is and how strong the UV is here (and it's okay, I kinda figured, I'm very used to the jokes about how dangerous it is here). Plus, we're not as bad as the US but I think there's still a slightly higher than normal heart disease risk? But we've still got a good average life expectancy too. And I know skin cancer is easy if it just gets treated/cut out asap, but yeah.

I recently competed as the first transwoman boxer in the 2022 USIBA National tournament :) no hiding my identity, no being in the closet. I was open and PROUD about who I am 🏳️‍⚧️😤🥊💨		"FYI I actually competed in the men’s division because that’s what I was comfortable with and wanted to do 🤷🏽‍♀️
Congratulations!!! I'm so happy for you 🥰
Fuck yeah!
As a trans Muay Thai fighter this makes me feel amazing and gives me so much hope 🖤✨ You're doing AMAZING and whatever the outcome of the tournament you're a winner and a badass 😤✨
Did you get any comments? I feel like the people that care about this shit are the vocal minority.
Congratulations! You look so happy :D
Congrats! I love your hair btw!
Congratulations. 😍
You’re amazingggg!!!❤️❤️❤️
💗
Fucking awsome!!!!
You’re so awesome girl congrats 😆🥰
Cool. Congratulations!
that's amazing! i'm so happy for you! btw you look like a total badass
Congratulations
I’m pretty sure I’m a trans woman but I’m pre-everything; as a martial artist one of the biggest things keeping me from starting my transition is my fear that it would complicate things when it comes to competing in tournaments so this was hella inspiring ty
You look awesome!! Also, I love your hair sm, and good job girl!! 💙
You're stunning btw 😍
Badass!
Congratulations! I also just wanted to comment how beautiful you hair is omg I’m wanna dye my hair this color now.
WOOO! 👏👏👏👏
That's amazing!!! You also look great!!
Congrats 👏🏽
Oh heck yea. Hope you had fun! Boxing has to be a pretty neat sport.
Also love the hair.
This is off topic but I love your hair so much, that's super awesome though I hope you had fun !
Glad to see Trans representation in more professional sports, while I don't follow boxing nonetheless I'm happy for you OP
Do what I'm hearing is that you made history?
Congrats! 🎉🎉🎉
Do it!
Congrats! You are an absolute legend!

Awesome, i hope you kicked some ass! Or i guess punched since its boxing.
I want to compete in some sport in women's division I know I'll never win but wanna try.
I prefer to think of it as the Open Division.
I too compete in men's division because I look like ""man...""  waaaaaaaa... 😭
But I think it's awesome and I wish I could see the looks on everyone's faces seeing a cute trans women in there throwing it down with the men.  Nong Rose style!   If you don't know who she is, you should look her up!  :)
That’s awesome, keep it up!

Thank you hehe 🥰
Fuck yeah 😤😤
Oh my god I’m so happy that I can give you some hope ❤️🖤🤍  that’s so cool that you’re a Muay Thai fighter! I started off practicing Muay Thai :) thank you for all the love! Really, it means a lot especially with how hateful people can get 🥺🧡🤍🧡 I hope you keep fighting girl and kick some ass too :3
I did get some vicious stares forsure but I just tried to do my own thing 🤷🏽‍♀️ it was in the south LOL
Thank you, idk if I’m happy but I’m proud of myself :)
Thank you :)
Awww thank youuuuu!!!!! 💜🧡🖤
💜🤍🧡
It was pretty cool!!
Thank you so much hehe 🥰🧡
Thank you!
Thank you!! 🥰🥰 I don’t think I’m too badass but I do have a bad ass ;)
Thank you!
That warms my heart so much to know that I inspired another transwoman martial artist like me ☺️💜✨ I was honestly the same way and I rejected my true gender for so long because of the same reasons, which caused me to transition later than I should’ve. Eventually I realized life is more than martial arts and being who you are is more important that doing what you love. But I’m a bit stubborn so while my transition takes precedence, I’m still trying to find a way to keep martial arts in my life somehow :) and I’m 100% sure that if you want it enough, you can do the same luv 💚🤍💙
Thank you!! I did my hair myself hehe 💙💚
Do it!!! I did it myself and it’s such a vibe!! All you gotta do is dye your hair green, wait a week or two for the tips to lighten up, then add blue!! It’ll look lovely on you 🥰💚💙
Cry about it

You seem really disturbed, you should try Estrogen it chilled me out a lot.

You don’t know until you try! But be safe, as trans athletes we gotta be careful 💜 just do you and do what you want to do. People will always hate no matter what
Oh LMAOOOO TRUEEEE 😂😂
Why are you here man
She’s a woman
I hope we can fight one day because  I'm in to boxing  too
Competed in the men’s division and still got vicious stares? Trans athletes can never win huh…
Ooh I definitely feel that l bit about the south. I'm a competitive rock climber and I compete in the women's division and whenever I'm at a regional comp my scores always get appealed by people trying to disqualify me it never happens in national comps tho
💟🐱‍👓💟💖💕🐱‍👓
No problem 😊
Holy crap! That’s impressive! Great job :D
Thanks for the tip! I was wondering how you got that gradient to look so good. I am considering it, and Maybe I will dye it this color one day who knows.

A Transgender Response	"  

We are denied mental health services, then derided as “Crazy”,

We are denied employment, then reproached for “Lack of Experience”,

We are denied housing, then denounced as “Squatters”,

We are denied healthcare, then they wonder why our health is so poor,

They declaim us “sinful”, though few of us follow *their* strictures,

We are denied our Voice, then they wonder why we are “Angry”,

We are denied our very Identities, and they marvel at our suicide rates,

Well, I shall no longer be silent. I shall not ask for my place in the sun. I will demand it. I will fight for it with sharp elbows and sharper words. I will make my voice heard and my presence felt."	"I could've owned a house two years ago, but the credit bureaus literally do not think I exist. The think I am my dead first name and my current last name (I had them legally changed everywhere else 5 years ago). So I can't get a home loan. Or any loan. Or any credit cards. Even though I've never been late on rent or utilities. 

I have to work at a garbage retail place an hour and a half bus ride one way because I can't get hired for my profession that I am more than qualified for in the city where I live. I can't get hired at all in the city where I live actually. 

My partner and I are on food stamps because it is so impossible to exist as trans at any fucking workplace here.
Every right we have in the US was fought for. We’re not done yet.
True! Fuck pride, we need passionate rage against the brain dead ,conservative, degenerates.
Agreed. And when you interact with them do as Erikson did with Oscarsborg Fortress when his home was threatened- no warning, no hesitation, these are enemies
BLOOD!
I have had, as far as transitions go a fairly easy one. Probably because I am older and live in Southern California. In a reddish suburb but I think people here are just more used to people being different. So Cal is a melting pot.

However I am angry and scared that people like us have less rights depending on where in the US we reside. That a sizeable minority of voters have no problem removing our rights and criminalizing trans children, their families, and medical professionals. On top of that a sizeable group of voters don't know and don't care if we lose rights as it doesn't affect them.

So now we have a Supreme Court that could if they decide to essentially outlaw changing your gender legally and maybe even medically.

LGBT rights were rolled back in Hungary and it's no coincidence that CPAC a right wing group that has access to power in D.C. held it's annual convention not in Washington DC but in Hungary.

I am active in my local Democratic club and we have had success with basic get out the vote campaigns. Seats have been flipped.

I got active when Tr*mp won. Sometimes dark times test us and make us act.
Count me in
That's called gaslighting.
I think there’s something far more poignant to be said about being “sinful”: despite us being called such, many of us are far more familiar with compassion than those who claim it as doctrine.
Preach! No more politely asking for our place! 

""We're here we're queer, get used to it!""
This is unfortunately true to nearly everyone. But trans people get it extra bad.
That's why I want to set up a Queer Mutual Aid Network. And why every queer person should be armed.
So violence and trial time? Are we finally not just looking at the surface level for the second amendment and actually fighting the government and forming a well made militia/people's court to give us the rights we were promised? If so I'm in.
I'm SO sorry.

You don't know me. But as some random person, I wanted to let you know my heart is with you on this.

Things should be better for you. I honestly hope they WILL.

Please .. stay safe and keep any hope you can. There will be a day. ❤

> They declaim us as ""sinful"", though few of us follow their scriptures.

While I agree with all the other ones, uhhh......

The fact that you don't follow their scriptures is probably *why* you're declaimed as sinful.
We should do another stone wall type thing, thatd be cool
I mean, nobody said that there COULDNT be a successful crusade
I feel like this is something people don’t talk about much. I didn’t figure out about this issue until after I changed my name and went to buy a house. The amount of time I had to devote to yelling at equifax was beyond what anyone should have to rationally do. It took a tremendously stressful period of time and multiplied it by 100. I was literally throwing up from stress towards the end of it.

Luckily I was able to resolve it (at least for this specific loan), but I was very very lucky. From other anecdotes I read they never are able to resolve it.

The fact that companies own our data like that is terrifying to me.
Why are they denyed housing? What career did you have?

As someone who is just now understanding how what it means to be trans I want to know more about you guys.

Im still learning. I feel so awful I couldn’t grasp what it meant to be trans as a cis women and you have my full support now.

Im so very sorry you are suffering because of other people’s ignorance. I wish you the best and stay safe out there!
I somehow managed to get a home loan 2 months after i changed my name. Maybe it was because I still had mixed documents?
the struggle for rights and democracy is never over. We must remain ever vigilant.
I've only been accidentally in one Madi Gras parade (was a really nice experience btw) I don't find it much of a celebration, just ppl waving flags and gyrating in pink hot pants.......companies changing a logo.

I live my life as a Heavy Diesel Mechanic in countries I could easily legally be killed and do a good job at it. Existence, despite is rebellion. If you do a good job at it, my hope is that it will be better for the next person.

Before I came out I had $$$,$$$ in the bank, a house, cars , machinery. From that to homeless, $$$,$$$ owed to tax while being headstomped, asked to bite the curb. Police were worse. The only difference was visibility.

bruh what
who is gaslighting whom...?
Yeah.
I personally never advocate violence...but I also never *not* advocate violence, either...

I suspect if we follow in the footsteps of the [Black Panther Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party), angry, reactionary white nationalists will swiftly advocate for sweeping gun control reforms real fast...
Thats a horrible idea and would not go down well at all, it would only hurt our cause. Unless ofcourse you forgot to type /s or something.
There are many laws in the US that restrict gender-affirming care, especially for those under 18 years old. There are also some pharmacies that allow staff to refuse to give HRT and other gender-affirming medications (or contraception, etc.) to patients because it goes against the staff member's religious beliefs.

As someone who has worked in healthcare my entire adult life, this infuriates me and is something we have to fight against and work to improve every day here.
I think others have answered this question but wanted to add that for trans masculine people who want hormone therapy, testosterone is counted as a controlled substance in the US so I have to go through all sorts of extra bullshit with doctors and pharmacies to get it. I can never get extra just in case, it's always just enough so situations like I'm currently in, where my primary care doctor just up and quit so my appointment was moved means I have to go without for 3 weeks. It's a bit like suddenly stopping depression medication (never do this!) and very debilitating to my mental health right now, I can barely get out of bed.
  Also I have heard of other people being harassed by police for having their medicine in the car with them which of course in the US the cops basically do whatever they want it doesn't matter the law if you're someone who was disowned by family and living on the fringes for example.
Telling a pagan they are going to Hell is like telling a Christian they are going to Mordor. 

Actually, the ""correct"" text is **strictures**, not **scriptures** \- ie, we don't follow their strict codes of moral conduct. Imagine it like telling someone ""You can't eat that doughnut because I'm diabetic"" and you might get the idea.

Besides, ""sin"" is a concept designed to make slaves of adherents. And it's a horrible corruption of the original Latin sin/e - to be without (ie, to have none/noting)
I expect that will happen again in the near future at the rate rights are being rolled back...
When I updated my name with SSA, my state, and the various bank/insurance accounts everything seemingly transferred over. I’ve since opened a new credit card account in my current name and the credit pull was done with my current name and was accurate. I think they only checked transunion though. There was a three month or so period where my credit score wasn’t updating if I looked at it through my credit Union, but it seems fine now. 

I’m genuinely curious what kind of problems you faced? Did you have to actually call the credit bureaus to update things with them? Cause my wife and I are looking to buy a place this year and it would be good to be prepared for any weird things that might arise.
In several states in the US, it is still legal to deny housing to trans persons
No one is obligated to do all of it, but we are all obligated to do some.

The transphobes.
""Our cause"" what does that even mean?
Oh damn, thank you for your answer.

I knew that medical stuff can refuse certain procedures if it's against their religion but it's illegal for pharmacist to refuse to give medication in my country.

Is psychological care restricted by those laws as well?
Oh that's crazy, I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing this!
So transunion and experian both updated without any issue for me. The issue was solely with Equifax (and I have heard the same from others).

Equifax had me first listed under my deadname, then they told me that they were updating it but It would take 30+ days to process (which is not an option in this type of housing market), when I was able to escalate after numerous calls my name was fixed but my credit was wiped out, which led to me having to go to the beginning of the process. My loan officer ended up also having to contact them which escalated it further. In the end, I got it fixed for the loan (though equifax still has inconsistent info and has my old middle name), but if I had to get another loan it may end up still raising flags.

All of this is to say… check your credit with the three major companies BEFORE putting an offer down for a house. This may seem obvious, but it’s a complicated process and things can easily fall through the cracks.

Edit: I simplified this whole story because I don’t like thinking about it, but every action required regoing through their telephone queue. When I submitted the documents I had to wait for weeks to be told it would take a month to process and update. Every phone call was coupled with a requirement of waiting in a 30 minute queue and needing to retell my story again and again starting from the beginning (also having to out myself each time). To make it worse I get severe anxiety with making phone calls :/
I’m just so tired of fighting to barely even exist
Yeah dude was bad ass
I will accept your explanation :)
ohh alright, ty for the explanation
""pahz...a fair answer""

gawd that game camr out over ten years ago and I still enjoy playing it :P
us having rights - they would say that it’s proof we’re violent and then use that as a reason to deny us further rights
You are very welcome!

To my knowledge, no. Mental healthcare is not specifically banned but I am in no way an authority on the subject. I also do not live in those states so while I do keep all LGBTQ/Human rights legislation in mind, I focus more on stuff that affects my local community first.

I will elaborate though, for emergent situations all life-saving treatment is protected by Federal Law, regardless of the provider's beliefs. For non-emergent situations or non-life-threatening ones, then they can choose to withhold care (at least in general).

Personally, as someone who works in the field, a provider's personal beliefs (religious or otherwise) should have absolutely no bearing on the care you provide to a patient. We swear to do no harm and are in the field to help and care for others. If you can not set your beliefs aside and advocate for your patient then that provider needs to find another career.
I've been trying to update Equifax for months

Their stupid website has a dispute section for names even and whenever I try to upload my files it gives me a message telling me it can't complete my dispute because I need to upload my files....which I'm doing but it's all fucked up and won't acknowledge they were uploaded or something

I mailed them a letter requesting a change and haven't heard anything from them
Thank you for elaborating, I really really appreciate the insight. This is all really helpful for me and will hopefully save me from a similar headache. Sorry you had to go through all that :(
That's why we all fight, so others may step in and take our place on the front lines when we grow weary.
Bad take
I absolutely agree with you, everyone should be able to access healthcare and provider's beliefs shouldn't affect it. I hope it will change to better.
agreed. A healthcare provider is in the business of helping ALL patients, not just the ones deemed worthy by whatever standard

I hate how cis women always have to make trans-inclusive language about *them*	"I don't have the energy to elaborate much, but basically- my existance as a trans man does not ""erase"" the ""female experience"" or whatever the fuck

Acknowledging that I have a uterus, am capable of becoming pregnant, that I still need to access """"female"""" healthcare (cervical cancer screenings and the like) does not ""invalidate"" your identity as a mother or as woman, because *women are also people*, and *being a woman is not defined by your ability to bear or raise children. This is basic feminism for the love of GOD*

I don't *care* if you call yourself a mother. I don't care if you make groups for mothers. I don't care if you casually refer to pregnancy as something that happens to women. I care if the acknowledgement that uterus-haver != woman is treated as stupid, or worse, ***oppressive***, *somehow*, to the point where a legally transitioned trans man can't even access the right type of healthcare because of it. It's not *about* you, for fucks sake

Seriously, there's so much *actual* shit that women have to face for being women and being pregnant. ""Pregnant people"" as a phrase is not one of them"	"So. True. And then some will have the audacity to be like ""why can't we just keep it as 'women' in these legislative papers, it's not like it's hurting anybody!"" As if trans men and nonbinary people with that anatomy aren't literally being turned away from healthcare that can prevent diseases and save lives because they don't fit in that definition. Of course insurance won't cover it if you don't match what's on paper exactly -_-
What winds me up even more about the cis women who complain about this is that often the official guidelines on these alternatives is only to provide the neutral terms so that *if* they happen to treat a trans man or non-binary person then they have those terms already.

Like the whole chest-feeding thing, people ran with it and said that they're ""banning"" the use of ""breastfeeding"" when actually they never did that, they just said ""hey, if your patient isn't a woman, here's the alternative term to use""
oh while we’re at it I hate the fact I’ve have multiple cis women ask when i’m getting “the surgery” like It’s 20k, risky, and i’m only 3 and 1/2 months on hormones I couldn’t even If I wanted to. idk it annoys the f out of me when I get asked this
I am reminded of a joke (bear with me, I'm not making light of your complaints, I'm treating them very seriously):

It's the middle of the night. A guy is standing under a street lamp, looking around with a worried expression on his face.

Another dude walks up to him.

""Hey, is something wrong?""  
""Uh, yeah, actually. I think I lost my watch.""  
""Aw man, that's too bad. Maybe I can help you look for it. Where'd you drop it?""

""Oh, over there,"" the guy points to the distance, ""in the forest.""

""Why would you look for your watch here, then?""

""It's brighter over here.""

\----------  
In terms of oppression and systemic or societal problems and looking for solutions, many people - and that very much includes transphobic people - tend to take a ""it's brighter over here"" approach. Will trans women in bathrooms somehow lead to more sexual assault? No - if anything, the opposite. Is referring to a person as an uterus-haver or a pregnant person going to make healthcare related to pregnancy worse? Again - no, probably the opposite in the long run.

Why say awful things about trans people, then, when it helps no-one in a tangible way and doesn't even make much sense? Why make up oppression where none seems to exist? Well, it's brighter over here. Cis people don't have to wander to that dark forest to look for things that would \*actually\* benefit them.

This is not exclusive to trans people, I'm pretty sure this misplaced hostility happens to any oppressed, marginalised or disenfranchised group. But it sure as heck is prominent in the context of trans people, recently.
Just want to say you're right, and your voice deserves to be heard.
It's really unacceptable too, the number of people who think this is all somehow designed to spare trans women's feelings when there are trans men literally suffering and even dying because of the lack of appropriate medical care.
My aunt was talking to my mom about this. Ugh it made me so mad, it was a conversation about periods and how trans masculine or nonbinary people that have periods or something are erasing her experience as a cis woman. I don’t know her exact words or what it was all about, but it was something along the lines of that.

I’m done with that crap, I don’t know how trans people having other terms for things effects her at all. That was like the first time I’ve ever experienced a bit of transphobia from someone close to me.
Just sexism boiled down
Big huge hugs, this is one of those things my wife struggles with.  One of the harder reasons is woman in their 50+ were still fighting hard for ""Womens rights"" like the right to own a credit card in their name separate from their husbands.   And Women (or people) are still fighting for the right for choice over their body and pregnancy.  And that's a HUGE deal in many parts of the world still.  It shouldn't be but it absolutely is.

So unfortunately some woman are afraid of angry patriarchal men taking away these rights (and others).  And they fear any change in the wording of ""Women's XYZ"" is a potential slip against the male patriarchy.  

I don't know how you solve this problem in the short term.  Trans people deserve to have the right to be people in all aspects of their lives.  But unfortunately hateful patriarchal men (and women willing to stand behind them) have created an absolute shit show for all of us.  We're all fighting for our rights, but getting written and embraced in law together has become an exercise in fear for any step back on either sides problems vs the patriarchy.

I really hate it, but all we can do is say and fight for what's right for all people.
fr tho. go to r/TrueOffMyChest and there are soo many posts from cis women complaining about trans-inclusive language like wtf.
I really just gave up on them a long time ago.
Just more reason to keep it to yourself whenever possible.
I feel like I might know what triggered this. That post was a bunch of TERFs and closet TERFs finding another excuse to complain about trans people. Because somehow the existence of us, whether masc or femme, is DEstRoyInG BIoLoGIcaL fEmAlEs.
Agreed - as a trans woman, I find it ridiculous that my health insurance keeps spamming me with reminders to get my pap-smear 🤦‍♀️ The healthcare system really needs to wake up and provide better integration and support for groups other than cis white men and cis white women.

I’m so sorry you’ve had this experience 🫂🫂🫂
I wonder how much of it is a subconscious reaction to patriarchy. Like, we trans men always existed of course, but the social expectation until very, very recently (and let's be honest, still is), was that only women can get pregnant and be mothers. I wonder if to a subconscious level it feels like men are trying to intrude in a space that traditionally is one of the few fields where women can shine and get attention and recognition.
I have the opposite problem, as a trans women, people exclude me from conversations about male reproduction and female ones too lol. I will probably be having my kids with my better half with my own tools since I have little desire to medically transition but regardless, i often have to remind people that i deserve an opinion in such things too
[deleted]
I once took part in a ""Diversity in Public Health"" conversation where this came up. The person running the event said they decided to default to ""pregnant women"" because ""In our focus groups, we found that women resisted gendered language like 'pregnant people.'""

And then there's me sitting there dumbfounded, trying to figure out why they called ""people"" gendered language, but not ""women.""
The trans experience is basically just a footnote to cis people problems. People insist on misgendering me, it happens most places I go. But the poor cis people can't use 2 word think of the children!!

Sorry had to get that of my chest 😂😂
JK Rowling is shaking.

No but you are a 3000% correct, honestly it’s just straight up stupid. They get defensive before being attacked. IN SPITE of being attacked, rather.
I feel this as someone who uses “pregnant person” and “birthing person” and gets accused all the time for erasing women, like no I’m literally just trying to be inclusive of my and other trans mascs birth experience but go off
THANK YOU!
So true, unfortunately. I'm a cis woman who is still a virgin and I feel you. I will be more careful about this.
Well said.
Jesus christ I am so tired of this! I am soooo fucking tired of this. I absolutely 10000% agree.
Some people make everything about themselves. You can only shake your head and move on. Not to excuse it, but people often feel these ways because they themselves are closeted trans people. It sounds a lot to me like ""I'm not totally satisfied with my gender, but some aspects are comforting to me. If this person wasn't satisfied and they transitioned, it erases my struggle because I'm not transmasc""
yeah, i remember a post on r/trueoffmychest that was about language surrounding people who have the ability to bear children. it sucks and I hate the fact that subreddit has a negative post about trans people almost everyday, and the comments are always burning dumpster fire. at this point they have to be karma farming troll posts; i'm sure these people don't actually wanna have genuine and understanding conversations about trans people. 

I thought that argument was stupid and all people who can have kids should be comfortable during the pregnancy and birth, according to their health needs and their gender. I feel like women feel like something is being ""taken away"", but thats a foolish thought because trans masculine people and trans men having babies doesn't change the fact that most babies are made by cis women. We deserve to have inclusive language, comfortable terminology and a happy experience if we choose to have children as people with uteruses, and it is unfair we do not get that chance.
since it seems most other people have responded better answers than i could come up with.

&#x200B;

isnt it != not =! ? (also isnt it funny most people who have transitioned or transitioning are programmers :P)
This reminded me how TERFS boycotted a cancer charity for saying people instead of women 💀

Apparently to them women aren't people lol
As a cis woman...I have to admit that I find this ultra stupid because those people care only about one certain version of womanhood. 

Women =|= baby-machine 
Not everyone who can have a baby must be what they perceive as a woman. 
Not everyone who corresponds to their definition of a woman needs to be able to or want to have babies. 

A person with cancer is a cancer-patient. We don't call prostate cancer-patients ""men"" as a whole either, do we? 
A person with a bun in the oven is a pregnant person. Easy. It's a fact. 

To me, all of this sounds like fake-outrage from some people. Detailed and specific language is for the better...we don't call any non-white person ""a savage"" anymore either. 
🙄🙄🙄
This is what latín American TERFs have been screeching about recently, I saw one of them missgendering a trans dude when he explained her why those terms exist.
Literally. I just HATE when they say ,,female healthcare"" ,,women experience"" or ,,female struggles"". Why they always refuse to include trans people. We share the same struggles, yet they act like it's just theirs. That's just unfair.
this is so hard to follow im a bit confused what the real issue is here that is being expressed
Bunch of self centered scared manipulated people running around on this planet right now 🤦‍♀️
Fuck transphobes and TERFs. They are not feminists, by definition. Just transphobes pretending to speak from feminism, the bunch of covert narcissists who always want to be perceived as the victims, while their only binding goal is perpetuating gender-based *abuse*. Transphobes calling themselves feminists is a serious insult and at this point, injury, to feminism.

And obviously to us. But their false pretense of feminism is too much. They are exactly like ""pro lifers"" who say their goal is protecting babies, when it's really harming women. Terfs say their goal is protecting women, when it's really harming trans people.

They wear costumes of decency to commit acts of harm. 

The costume is there not just to inflate their influence, but to assist their control tactic of keeping the 'good person/innocent/victim' role squarely on themselves in the public eye. It's a version of DARVO (Deny wrongdoing, and Accuse the person who called them out of being the ""real"" wrongdoer, Reversing Victim and Offender.)

Accusing real victims of being the real abusers is abhorrent, which is exactly what they are doing to us, then DARVOing onto us, in order to claim that such abhorrent things are *only really* being done to THEM by the Bad Trans.

They are textbook **covert narcissists**, as in clinical **narcissistic personality disorder**, displaying common behavioral results of narcissistic thinking patterns. I think it would benefit anybody's social defenses to look up info sources that dig deep into those bolded terms (there are many!) to learn to spot each part of their universally similar sets of manipulation tactics, in order to learn to understand them for what they are when you encounter them!  Studying this topic, and joining various ""dealing with narcissists"" subreddits (...there are too many to list), has helped me more than I can briefly say.)

TL;DRish: Don't believe TERF's good-guy costumes, words, or self-applied labels, especially the 'feminist' one, and anything to do with having scientific or medical expertise, nor with having the support of feminism or of other women in general. It's all just triangulation manipulation. 

Believe their actions, and the intended real-world consequences of these actions. That makes their true goals clear, despite all the bullshit. And applying this to TERFs shows just what they are: a single-issue hate group who wishes to cause harm to trans individuals.

Under all the smoke and mirrors, TERFs deserve no more legitimacy in debate than the KKK, who differ mainly in who they target for harm. They are no less full of shit than a klansman trying to explain why they are good and people of [race] are inherently bad, trying to give their bigotry false merit via triangulation of pretending to be backed by studies and research from prestigious institutions (which actually destroy their arguments, had they fully read or understood them).
I understand your point. 
But in my point of view it also has a sense: Law-Stuff. When it is needed to refer to the (ex)pregnant-people. Then the term 'Mother' terrifies me.
It fucking IS hurting people that’s why! But my favorite argument is: ”should be change it just for a few people?” Uhhhh so you WANT minorities to be treated like shit, huh? Is that it? You just fucking HATE minorities and having to accomodate ANYTHING for them to feel even a LITTLE bit more included. Maybe we should just go back to calling everyone a man then? And not give a crap about women again? Fuck. You. It drives me insane. Stop being so triggered that there are other minorities that ALSO have issues. Jesus.
Not to mention that they're also implying I'm not a real woman because I *don't* have a uterus.
[deleted]
God IKR

They're acting like they're oppressed because SOME people use neutral language

litcherally 1984 /s
And while we're still at it I've seen some of them (talking about MtFs in this case) saying TERFy shit and going ""less than half of them ever get tHe SuRgErY and that should tell you all you need to know"". Yeah, that it's expensive, inaccessible, and highly uncertain, and that for some people social transition is good enough?
Did you get the surgery yet?
Put another way, trans people are much easier targets than the actual oppressors.
As a cis ally, I will take this to heart. I, too, am a marginalized person (I was given a bogus medical diagnosis at the age of 2).
Thank you
Yes, TERFs especially seem to think this all the time. I think it's because they have a much easier time hating on trans women (who they see as predatory men) while pretending they pity trans men (who they see as naive, misled girls). All their talking points boil down to ""the sort of sexism feminists were fighting in the 70s"".
I had to explain to a room full of cis health professionals at a talk that pregnancy is not a personal concern for me as a trans woman. A large number legitimately didn't even know that I couldn't get pregnant because they didn't know what ""trans woman"" meant; that's the level of ignorance in the room.
I will say it: burn the patriarchy!
There was one trending a few days ago, that's what this is partially in response to
TBF I haven't actually had any *direct* experiences with cis women saying this to me, I've just seen a lot of cis women online repeat the same BS (like that post on trueoffmychest that was trending a while back)
But I thought trans men were supposed to be poor confused little autistic girls, not scary male invaders! /s

Oh, right. Their portrayal of us shifts to whichever makes us a more convenient target. Not to mention the number of people who think this is for trans women's sake, somehow

(Not saying I disagree with you, your point is valid and it's an understandable (?) gut reaction for a cis woman to have. key word being ""gut reaction"")
it's interesting that you say you're excluded from both discussions, while trans men are often lumped into women's spaces. Reminds me of [this essay](https://nothorses.tumblr.com/post/665231771105902592/embed)

Dunno if the link works, but it's about how manhood is viewed as a competition, whereas womanhood is viewed as an obligation, which is why trans people (""failed"" men/women) are treated differently
Absolutely! Enby afab, although my ability to safely carry a pregnancy is negated by my uterus and tubes throwing a tantrum (yay endometriosis 🙄). I'm not a walking baby factory and this terf shite needs to find its way into a black hole, taking JK with it.

the mental gymnastics you have to do to think ""woman"" is less gendered than ""person""...
Occasionally when someone says that I am this 🤏 close to snapping and being like ""oh you think the word people is erasing women? So you don't think women are people? Thats kind of sexist."" It's not very nice and a deliberate misinterpretation of what i know they're trying to say, but I'm tempted sometimes.
Yeah that’s…weird of them. They’re *literally* included in “pregnant person” and “birthing person”.
👊 You’re a real one ❤️‍🩹
Oh, it probably is lmao, I'm not a programmer I just use it because I don't have a symbol for the crossed-out equals sign
A lot of cis women wrongly believe saying ""pregnant people"" erases and oppresses women. They insist on language that excludes AFAB people who aren't women. That's a major problem because it increases the risk that a trans man with M as his gender record might be denied important services by ignorant doctors and insurance companies.
Yeah, sorry if it's hard to read. I wrote this as a rant, I didn't expect it to get as much attention as it did
you have some good points, but I feel like straight-up armchair diagnosing them with NPD is shitty. Most abusers are neurotypical
Wdym? I'm not sure I get your point
Many people don't really think through their political beliefs, they just go by whatever they have a strong emotional reaction to. Whether or not its contradictory or leads to bad outcomes doesn't matter.
You're so right, and that makes it even worse. They're really sprinkling a little bit of ""let's just invalidate and hurt everybody in the trans community"" in, huh?
Because governments have demonstrated good judgment, the ability to take in new information and react and be accountable to those they represent.     

What has government done to earn such trust and devotion?
I just dont like surgery at all. The idea of being out and under a knife for like half a day and then the recovery process scares the shit out of me. I would never consider it tbh.

(I've also put off getting my wisdom teeth removed for this same reason, I just hate surgery and anesthetic)
In simple words, yes.  


It's easier to punch down and make oneself feel a little better for a while, and even feel like one is Making a Difference For the Better.  


It's a lie, and an insidious one, but it's clear where it sometimes comes from.
agreed
> health professionals

Geez, that's concerning
[deleted]
They didn't push their ideals on anyone. They said we shouldn't reduce *all women* to their potential or actual pregnancy. Nobody said ""No woman should want to be a mother or stay home.""
you wanting to be a mother (good on you!) does not equal your worth being directly connected to your potential babymaking. you're fighting the wrong people here honey
Wtf you really got that internal misogynist vibes 💀💀💀
I mean what other implications are there to them thinking the word “person” excludes women? I think it’s just the natural progression of their hypocritical bs lol you would be NTA for pointing that out to them
A real what? I don't understand.
ok thanks yea that is not a good thing to happen. I always wondered about the whole gender neutral terminology in reference to health care typically used for women like as in who it applied too. I never thought about it being for trans men who still might do those things or need that type of care and the word women doesn't apply to them. I always love to learn new things.
Lol u good i am dyslexic so lol 😂
FARTs really do make everything worse.
When I was a kid I was so terrified of surgery I used to say that if I had a life threatening condition requiring surgery, I would just let it take me. I also put off my wisdom teeth surgery for years (got it in my early 30s) because I was so scared I’d never wake up. I hadn’t been under general at that point but I sucked it up and let me tell you, it was awesome! I had the most beautiful dream/hallucinations that when I woke up I told the nurse that she and I had been walking up a mountain in the sun set and everything was pink and purple and beautiful and we were in the clouds… and then I burst out crying because I would never see purple mountain again. I cried and hugged all the staff when I was leaving and in the Uber on the way home I asked my partner why we can’t take general anaesthetic every night before bed because it’s AWESOME! 

However, they only gave me a few days worth of pain killers and I was in massive pain for two weeks. I had to go back for more *and* use some spares I had. This was for an “easy” surgery that removed all four teeth in less than 30 minutes (but left a large shard of tooth in my gums that was fighting its way out). Everyone reacts to surgery differently but I hate pain and it was such a crap recovery, especially as I was told I’d be fine by day 5 and I was still calling in sick by day 10. (I have fibromyalgia though so everything hurts more.) Currently I don’t have health insurance but I was recently told I have a deviated septum, nose polyps and the only way I’ll be able to breathe normally is surgery. I don’t have any prospects for that now and it’s still terrifying even though it might solve a bunch of health issues for me, so I guess until then I’ll just struggle to breathe.

So yeah, in our society of nip/tucking and excessive surgery people think it’s no big deal but it’s a big decision to go under the knife, especially if something isn’t life threatening (though I know for many people not getting top/bottom surgery *is* life threatening). It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, plus on top of that I understand that many surgeons require hormone therapy cessation temporarily (for 6 weeks?) before surgery, which can be scary. And if anyone makes a judgement about not having surgery, I mean are they going to fucking pay for it? Again, people act like it’s no big deal to have 20K lying around or like taking out credit or a loan for that much is easy. 

Surgery is scary. People who opt for it are very brave, have the means, often have/need good support systems for afterwards, have job security or prospects that they can look forward to afterwards etc. Not everyone is in that position. You do you and screw what anyone else says. I know that’s easier said than done, but people need to mind their own goddamn business.

Oh God please no don't let this types of people have children 💀
Whew, harder to explain than tell but I’ll do what I can. A real…quality person, ally, friend, bro, sister in spirit.
This is a space for these ideals. You do not share them. I don’t know why you’d want to stay here.

Does anyone else feel gender euphoria from designing their characters in video games to match their identity?		"Yes, all the time. It's honestly one of the things that clued me in to being trans.
[deleted]
Then you name them your preferred name and play the game in all your free time cause that is life now 😅
Yes! Actually one of the things I’m most excited for in Cyberpunk 2077
Hell ya! just wish that game was less toxic online. More of a sim than teem death match with rocket bikes lol.
My parents are homophobic and transphobic so this is truly the only ways i can feel gender euphoria
Totally. I know how happy I was just playing Animal Crossing NH and FFXIV as a girl character. I didn't even have to do something meaningful. Just being in that world as a girl was enough to make me euphoric.
Not really, and depending on the game, I don’t even make it a female character. Fallout 4 is a good example of that. But a lot of games I do prefer female characters and really look forward to spending 5 hours designing one in Cyberpunk 2077.
Honestly this is so true
Im trying to do that in real life
Lol my character has the same pants
Yeah, and what’s even better is when NPC’s refer to me as “she” and “her”!
Omg same
yes!!! took me 15 whole years of playing video games to notice a pattern haha. all the characters that i designed were typically male/androgynous and very rarely female. or, when i could only pick the gender i’d always go for the guys.
OHHHH GTA ON PC I MAKE THE BEST CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE I WANNA DO 😭😭
I love the username! I spend soooooo long making my game characters its kind of concerning, although it does lead to my characters having a far better fashion sense than i could ever dream of
I do too, but I feel bad when people make fun of my voice while I roleplay as a girl
I feel called out, also mood.
What game is that?
I've all but stopped playing games that force you to play as a male protagonist because of exactly this. Fallout 4, GTA Online, saints row, and soon to be cyberpunk 2077 are some of my favorite non-building games because of the degrees to which they let you customize your character. 

Also, Grand Trans Auto gang unite!!! Lemme know if you're on PC as well!! :D
Every time!! Cant wait for the character creator in Cyberpunk!
What game is that? She’s looks so awesome
It's honestly what helped me subconsciously cope with my dysphoria, but at the same time I was subconsciously using video games to escape from reality and it caused damage in the long run. If I didn't have video games when I was a teenager, my teen years would have been a living hell, but my life right now would have been better because I would have been forced to confront my own identity and realize/accept it sooner.
Did they make it so you can change gender of your gta online character? A few months back I had to make a meme to vent how it's not possible and I'll have to start over if I want to have a female character
Yes as a  kid i always would make girl characters
Nah not really, sometimes, now im.out and on hrt byt even before I really played characters of any gender. I even think that through games I find peace with my masc presenting past and whatever masculinity there is still in me. Also Ive played with planty of cis girls whom play with male chatacters often.
i can honestly say that the last video game i played was like maybe 5 yrs ago when i last ate magic mushrooms. i felt dysphoric all over that not
This is why Taki Itora is a thing
Literally why I bought THPS1+2
god yes!! custom character euphoria hits different 😌😌 i feel kinda silly for being as excited as i am about being able to play as a funky cowgirl in red dead but im happy nonetheless
on an unrelated note: i hate this game so much
Oh all the time, I literally get dysphoria from playing a male character 😂
I think I played gta online mainly to shop for clothes and try different styles
Sometimes I do
YEP
It is one of the reasons why I tend to love character creators or even just the option of a female protagonist.
yes I play gta a lot to so i’ve got a a lot of outfits

here’s one that i posted on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAoutfits/comments/j6bsgc/ive_tried_messing_around_with_the_flower_jeans/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
What's your social club? I play plenty of GTAO too maybe we can play some time
 💯💯

It was so funny after realizing that I'm trans, I looked back at my characters in my games and most of them where females
Yep
i have a love hate relationship with that.

&#x200B;

i tend to make them versions of what i'd like to look like.  Then i look in the mirror and see this mid egg ""thing"" and go yuch =/
All the time..
I bought the Sims just for this lol
Made my first female character in mabinogi and it stuck forever  I'd  get bored of games that had male only leads took forever to get wrapped up in witcher 3 cuz i just wasn't feeling geralt eventually worked past that and enjoyed the story. Now i play eso and i have a variety of female character's and a very crossdressed male bosmer. Now last week i came out to my wife as trans mtf and she's made all the appointments to get me started on transitioning
All the time tbh
So I'm not the only one aha XD
Yes! That's actually how I discovered I was trans! I made a girl character, which I never do, in GTAV, and I got so absorbed into making her all pretty and dressing her up. Still took me a while to realize, but ever since then, if I'm given a choice, I play a female character.
No, male options are rarely good :( Mostly just boring. I usually pick female characters and masc them up if I can, and suffer through being misgendered if the game does that. It sucks.
Yes, absolutely! I don't remember which was the first game I played that had character customization, but I've been doing it for as long as it's been possible. Been gaming since late 80s, so I've played a few games, lol.
YASS even from a young age id alway want to chosse a masculine character. My parents always found this strange because id name them after my friends who were male. They thought it was because i had a crush on them but really i just wanted to be one of them. 🤣 gee were they wrong.
Yep. All the time
GTA is so cool yeah
Very much so. I am discovering now that I am not as cis as I thought I was my whole 30 years of life. Though it wasn't this that made me start questioning my identity, looking back it shoulda been a huge sign. 


I thought I just liked to play opposite gender characters because I was edgy and cool. But now I'm looking back and thinking ""Oh. Duh. How did it take me this long to notice that?""
Not really Now that I know I’m trans I feel like I make male characters more(I’m Very MtF btw)
Hell yes!
One day in middle school i was like “hey lets be a girl in kotor for no particular reason!”

Playing the role was illuminating to my gender identity. It was one of my first steps to realization.
I make one male and one female. Just to mix it up. I play a lot of gta. Xbox or PlayStation or pc?
100%
I do it with my bitmoji on snap all the time
Haha yes sometimes I won’t buy a game if a can’t choose to be a girl
Oh I do that all the time
yes yes yes yes YES
This is why I love RPGs that have a character creator. It's rare that I get into a game that doesn't have one. At least I can live vicariously this way.
Yes! I keep certain games only because of how the characters look and make me feel better. I'm so glad someone else feels this way too!
Started doing this in Animal Crossing, then realized that the game actually had clothes I liked, they just weren’t male clothes...
Yes, custom game characters are transition goals.
In my current play through of fallout 4 I made a nearly perfect character design of my dream body, its so nice to have that if only in a video game.
Yup
Yes, I love crossdressing my animal crossing character!
Duh, all the Time!
My friends always asked me why my characters were always female. Always said I don’t know. Starting to realize why now😂
First type of gender euphoria i ever felt.
Yes I know the feeling
I love it even in low resolution games
YES even when I was little I would make my video game character fit my gender identity and it made me feel 1000 times better about myself.
Absolutely
Yes
Yes all the time, I put so much time and energy into making my characters, they're some if the biggest reasons I found out I was trans. Thank you Skyrim for helping me along my journey.
Yes, it's why I like sims so much!! NB people are actually physically possible to make!!
Yea normally when i cant choose the gender i identify as i just delete the game cuz i cant deal with the stress
What game is this?
Hell yea i do

Its part of the reason i love games with character creators
I always thought that was so weird, why would I want my characters to look like me when I could be anything else?

Then I realised I was trans and realised they were me, they've always been me.
Oh absolutely! Having said that, it took me a while to actually try doing it, but once I did there was no going back. I almost always play as a girl whenever I have the option to.
Raise your hand if you genuinely paused and had a moment of reflection when you played Pokemon and were asked if you were a boy or a girl for the first time. 

""Don't be silly, of course I'm a bo-.................wait.""
OMG. It's so stupid and simple, but my character in Animal Crossing is a cute little female and it feels so good!
Yes, I do this with D&D characters though instead xDDD
Yeeeeessss
Greedfall is such a euphoria inducing game for me. Like, you’re telling me I get to be a beautiful badass diplomat woman AND I can have a wholesome lesbian relationship at the same time? Are there even any downsides to that?
What system do you play on?
Yeah 😞
Yeh I love making my character on games like GTA as a woman like
ME
Hell yeah i thought i was the only one
Me too! Playing dragon age and mass effect as a bad ass strong kind female lead I would try to make them look like me and I would imagine that they are me...it served as a form of escapism
Me too! Took 20 years to catch on as to why. Had kind of a....""Omg now I get it!"" moment a year and a half ago, hrt for 11 months now :)
Same. At first I was just really confused why I was so happy to wear a skirt in Animal Crossing.
Escapism be good like that sometimes
I've been known for doing this my whole life, very relatable
Spending 3+ hours on each new character haha. Also in games where you can glamour, reskin, etc your gear to look like something else, I spend hours and hours in game making cute outfits. Kind of like my way of dressing up Barbie dolls... just in MMOs. haha.
Absolutely nailed it
I'm the same. I don't really enjoy the sims gameplay, but I could spend hours just making outfits in the character creator.
Oh my gosh incredibly relatable lol
Yeah I try to live my life on here as peacefully as possible but some lobbies are so frustrating 😭 just gotta join a new session and move on
I’ve been saying for a long time that there shouldn’t be any player markers on the map, it would curb a lot of that crap.
Same
Growing up I always presented as a female when online in MMOs. I thought I was a catfishing pervert or something... nope was just trans the whole time.
Grand theft auto online.
I am on PC! Can I pm you my social club? I don't do voice chat but we could do some missions or something if we ever end up in the same lobby.
Thank you!
GTA V Online
No, I literally started over from 108 because I wanted to be female that bad lol. I'm on the grind to do it even better this time around, though!
Do you play PC?
Pc! I do have it on ps4 as well though
All of the mood. It gets even more escapism when you start doing it in games like Dnd lol.
Female shepard is just awesome!
Even my “male” friends agree her voice actor is just better.
Me too! Like too much so, wish I could of just realized and accepted who I was and moved on with life though. Had this weird sense of knowing I was trans, but just couldn't come to the conclusion I was. 

Still my purple eyed lesbian was a badass no matter what role she was.

Also really enjoyed the dragon age armor in ME2.
Me
Honestly yes
Same lol..
Ya i just private lobby with my lan but it limits what you can do so we would change our server(if you are on PS4, you can also do the following while in your public lobby. Go Settings --> Network --> Choose Network --> Custom. Chang the number) but i just waned cool flying tasks for my QM-9little bird""buzzard"". But OP jetbikes with OP homing missiles just wrecked it for me. So much potential tho.
at this point i became a night owl, sleeping in the afternoon so i dont see them
Absolutely!! I don't do voice chat either haha. Also, if we're friends on social club, we'll probably be put in the same lobby anyways :)
Welp guess I'll start over
Yeah
I pm'd you!
Honestly it also provided a good opportunity to do things right this time. I'm level 50 now making mountains for money than I was at 100 because I actually have the right businesses, and I've learned a lot through tutorials."	jih0se	trans	1591	1.0	2020-10-26 15:51:45
Having a hard time fully accepting that I’m trans	"I’ve heard this from others as well, I guess I just wanna type it out to really see how irrational it looks from an outside perspective, haha

I logically know I’m a trans girl. I feel dysphoria when I feel too masculine and euphoria when I feel feminine. I would do a whole lot to get the body of a cis female and to live the life of one

And yet there’s always part of me that tells me that I can’t be trans because I don’t feel enough dysphoria, that I’m probably just lying to myself 

Maybe the human brain is just very bad at gender identity, who knows"	"If you’re not too sure you can go as non-binary/genderfluid and kinda ease your way across the spectrum to find where you fit the best. Gives you a feeling of stability in your gender identity.
This is normal trans shiz...
Here's an interesting link. I have NO physical dysphoria so it's really confusing for me. (Not the article, i meant my gender experience)


https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5


I don't ""feel"" like a woman sometimes but I KNOW I AM a Trans woman.
There is not a single trans person that doesn't go through this at some point or to some level, if society was more accepting maybe we wouldn't have to deal with the self doubt, but honestly talking to an accepting therapist would help.
I think its hard for everyone to accept it at first. No one wishes to be trans, but once you accept it and start hrt like theres no turning back, i couldnt never see myself go back to where i was before
What you experience is called imposter syndrome, and it's an indicator that you are in fact trans. 😊
“I don’t hate being a guy but I REALLY wish I was a girl instead… it’s not crippling Dysphoria so I must be faking it or something”

-Me to myself on a daily basis
I am a trans guy and I have the exact same issues. It doesn’t help that some trans people like to gatekeep and say only certain levels of dysphoria and self hatred “actually qualify as trans.” Many of us choose to be nb before coming out, figuring ourselves out etc. and every step of your journey is valid. I just try to be extra nice with my inner voice because it doesn’t ever help to be mean to yourself - you don’t need to hate yourself to be trans. In fact it’s a lot easier if you don’t, and if you can meet yourself where you’re at (in my experience anyway.) You got this babe keep your chin up ❤️ WE GOT THIS!
Have you tried talking to a therapist about it? I’ve been seeing one for about half a year now and done a lot of personal work towards just self acceptance. 

I think some of the questions she would ask that may help you would be, 
How do you feel as your female  vs your male identity ? 
What do you think makes it hard for you to accept being trans/non binary?
What experiences have you had that make you possibly feel that way?
Being trans is not an easy thing, this is always understandable. Our brains instinctually know who we are identity-wise, but I think it's our conscience minds that need time to fully process and accept it. Just know that there's no such thing as ""not having enough dysphoria"". If you know you're a girl, you're a girl. But may I just say that I'm sure the majority of people go through something similar. For a few solid years, I identified as being fully agender to not have to accept that I wanted to transition. I hope this message got across what I wanted to say, and hopefully it helped a tiny bit. ☺️
In my head i know im transmasc, i get chest and body dysphoria, i hate when people use feminine pronouns and I'd give anything to be a cis guy. But for some reason i can't seem to accept it properly
That's a normal trans thought you're a trans girl. I'm a trans guy welcome to the trans club
I've heard it said that while dysphoria is common, its the euphoria that is a better sign. I had doubts too, but the joy i get is unmistakable
A lot of us definitely feel this way sometimes. I haven't started HRT yet and I haven't shaved my beard off yet, so I definitely have these moments. 

One of the things I try to remember is that I've been living as a man for 32 years. Even if I know that I'm a woman, being male is something that's familiar, comfortable, and safe— relatively speaking. I'm going to have a natural inclination to question myself because transitioning is stepping out of my comfort zone in a big way. 

We don't have to hit some bar or fit some checklist of things to prove definitively that we're trans. And you are perfectly where you need to be for this moment.
I feel you, tbh I feel the same way cuz I’ve always had this mild, background uncomfortable feeling about being/looking/acting like a guy, and I stopped feeling it for a while once I started embracing what I thought was just my “feminine side” (painting nails, wearing lite makeup, dressing I’m tighter clothes stuff like that) a few years ago while still identifying as male but then like a year ago I realized that uncomfortable feeling is still there whenever I try to like, think of myself as male, or say out loud that I am, or when someone specifically refers to me as a guy, or when I fill out a form of some kind I always feel weird about circling “male” and I’m realizing that whatever I am, I’m not a guy, cuz I’m obviously more comfortable in my own skin the more feminine I look and feel. But like, I’ve had a super hard time accepting that I’m trans for the same reasons you’re talking about-cuz it never felt like dysphoria in the same way a lot of my trans friends or trans folks online have described it, it always seemed mild in comparison as just like this, background uneasiness about my identity and expression that dressing and looking more feminine assuages. So yea I feel you, and from what I gather, it’s not at all an uncommon feeling. And I don’t think it’s that the human brain itself is bad at gender identity, I think society is, and because our brains were all pretty thoroughly indoctrinated with rigid gender roles that exist only as a static, invariable binary, our brains can have a hard time grasping the fact that we don’t fit into that view of gender.
After a decade, it still is difficult to accept.
It's so nice to know that others feel this way to. It's really annoying that this is normal trans stuff but I'm just hoping that it'll get better with time. I hope you are able to live your best life free from doubt!
Hi! I’m so happy you’ve found out who you are! Have you considered hormone treatment or if surgery is right for you? There’s also a sub called femboys which may interest you. What do you mean not enough dysphoria?
That's pretty textbook [imposter syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) with some [no true Scottsmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) fallacious thinking thrown in for giggles and grins.

I'm fairly active in the autistic community, and it's super prevalent there too. [Cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) are exceptionally common, and especially so for that revolving around identity. It's an irrationality due to a lack of self esteem/self respect/confidence in one's ability to know. While it's expressed differently between the two communities, it's the same phenomena.

You are essentially gatekeeping yourself.

To touch on your dysphoria/euphoria, I'd like to state that neither are a requirement for being trans. At all. Nada. Zero. None. Zilch. And to be perfectly clear, I am not saying that one can be absent as long as you have the other. One can have no dysphoria and have no euphoria and still be trans.

While it's valid to feel that you don't have enough of either, it is also irrational to to gatekeep yourself because of it.
My brain tried to say the same thing. It hit me hard and I cried when I realized this, if I wasn't a woman, I wouldn't feel heartbroken at the idea that 'I couldn't be a woman'. If the worry that you aren't the identity you yearn for hurts you, worries you, doesn't that itself show dysphoria? Find any girl and tell her she isn't feminine enough, pretty enough, womanly enough to be a real girl. If she's hurt, heartbroken, or has her hopes ruined.... That's normal. You tell a cismale he's too manly to ever be a woman, he laughs from the heart and thanks you for the compliment. You tell yourself that you could never be pretty enough, feminine enough, girly enough- and it crushes you? Why wouldn't it hurt you like it hurts any other girl to hear that? Heck, the more I've become more aware of my own feelings since cracking recently the more I realize I had become numb to my own pain. I noticed in my anatomy lab today that I was being chatty and extra.....naturally. I was being a chatty, prissy stereotypical 'basic white girl' and it was flowing out of me naturally. It has been for years. Instead of forcing myself to tap down on it out of self-loathing, I paused, smiled and realized I should chill out a hair as it wasn't super situationally appropriate while we were cutting open brains. To be honest out of a group of 25 students, more than half women, I am at least in class, the most 'basic white bitch' of all of them. Sure that's a gender stereotype, but it's a behavior naturally flowing out of me. It's not a thing I put on out of fear or repression. It's a heady feeling seeing your natural behavior you've naturally had for years as 'female' and you either repressed it or didn't even realize it.
A lot of us have A LOT of social conditioning to break before being truly accepting of ourselves and what we know. There's no need to compare or say you don't have enough dysphpria. Each trans persons journey is unique to their own experience. Honestly what's helped me a lot is not focusing so much on the labels and simply looking at what makes me feel good about myself each day. Slowly add on to the routine and just keep taking it day by day. ❤💙
As so many have told me it's not a very CIS thing to worry about your disphoria levels.
You sound like me from about 3 months ago. Turns out me was definitely a trans girl.
I'm a trans boy and i understand what you are saying completely.....:)💜
well don't accept you're trans... accept you're not cisgender first.. then accept you're a girl
If your questioning if your trans, chances are that you’re actually trans. The more doubts, the more chance what your feeling is true. Bc well,, cis people don’t question it that much.
Lying is a conscious choice. Therefore you would know if you were faking. If you question if your faking, your not. 

(If that’s any comfort to you!!)
You don’t need dysphoria to be trans, this is something that other trans people go through, and it can be hard dealing with it but once you get through it an understand/accept yourself it’s better from there on out.

I didn't experience gender dysphoria until I was 23. I spent years and years wondering what was wrong with me and actively wishing to feel dysphoria just so that I could know that something was wrong. Feeling euphoria is what makes you trans, not the dysphoria.
Yeah
Girl, I feel the exact same thing everyday. I'm afraid to say I'm trans alot of the time because I sometimes feel unsure. I feel like people can sense that unassuredness and that they will think I'm faking. In the end tho, I have yet to have anyone question my transness.
Start from a perspective that 50/50 you could be cis or you could be trans, then add all the evidence, then choose based on the new odds.  IDK if it's possible to be 100% certain before you transition, at some point you have to trust yourself.
> Maybe the human brain is just very bad at gender identity, who knows

Psycho-social conditioning is a helluva drug

<hugs> ❤️
bleh same lmao im on a 5 month waiting list to see a gender clinic to start HRT but im still like ""what if im not dysphoric enough. what if im faking it"" LMAO its just irrational brain stuff i guess. it is emotionally taxing though
I get that I’m the exact same way from how I was raised I just think I’m the back of my head that it’s not except-able for me to be trans, I have a hard time biting the bullet
Same I always use my deadname and wrong pronouns in my head
Lol I feel the same way in fact going through it right as I typed this out 🥴
Might be helpful to hear a little bit about a similar journey to yours. When I first started to figure out my identity, I started out as purely non-binary because I was like ""Well, being trans is such a big deal, I don't want to take a label that isn't mine."" And then a friend of mine referred to me as trans and I was like ""oh haha but I'm not trans, right?"" And her response was, basically: ""?????"" She pointed out that non-binary folks are also trans unless they don't want to be. And I very much *did* want to be trans. From there it's just getting past that built-in societal filter, the one that tells us we're wrong for not conforming to the gender roles. 

If you're happier with one gender presentation over another, then that's the one you should use. The labels are there to help us quickly communicate parts of our identity to others, not to put us into boxes, so don't worry *too* much about picking or accepting a label.
Maybe take a good hard look at yourself and make a call on what makes you happy and go with that. You can sit in two camps and you will waste your life with indecision and what if’s. If you have a hard time accepting you are trans then maybe you are not. But if f you are just get on with it and transition you don’t have to slice everything off and have implants.  and if you don’t like the uninvited opinions of others the discrimination the ridicule and ostracising from the generally community as a   transperson you can a always change your mind and go back as you said you are not fully accepting you are trans.
>And yet there’s always part of me that tells me that I can’t be trans because I don’t feel enough dysphoria, that I’m probably just lying to myself.

Little known secret, it's not really about the dysphoria, it's about the euphoria. The dysphoria tells you what you *don't* want to be. The focus of transitioning should be seen more as a way to maximize your gender euphoria. Cause what's the point of not-disliking yourself if you're not going to enjoy yourself?

People who transition don't stop being trans when they stop feeling (as much) dysphoria, it's when they experience the most euphoria.
This has been a constant struggle for me as well. It was only the realization that I'd been stuck on this question for years that allowed me to realize it wasn't just a passing phase and to move forward.

Even given that, given all the ways my experience tells me I'm trans, the lengths I'm going to become the person I want to be... The doubt and fear still creep in here and there.

I guess what I'm getting at is that those feelings are normal and the impostor syndrome may never totally go away... But I think you know deep down what you want, it's okay to get what you want and you feel better about things over time even if you never reach 100%
ah yes, imposter syndrome. just eject the little shit out ! it’s the easiest way to get cured ever ‘cause it makes so much sense
The human brain is also very good at throwing random thoughts on top of those that you feel uncomfortable about. My point being: what you describe sounds a lot like dysphoria, if that's what you're worried about
I for years didn't include me in the lgbt even when I was thinking in my head. I was out to ppl. It took me time, therapy for other stuff, entering uni and a quarantine to help me come out come out and choose a name to my close friends. You will get there. You need to understand that there are no masculine or feminine things. Basically you need to deconstruct what gender is in order to accept. Or to be exact, this helped ME a lot. Basically when I deconstructed gender enough and I felt safe I manage to overcome a lot of problems.
i feel this. sending hugs <3
I didn’t accept I was trans until a friend squared off to me and said that suffering was not necessary to be trans. So let me tell you directly, trans identity does not require any suffering. You are allowed to exist without justification. Your identity isn’t validated by how bad you hurt. 

If you know deep down you are trans, let yourself be trans. I was content before I acknowledged my truth, but, now a year and some into being out, and 9 months on HRT, I am free and flying (except on bad dysphoria days lol).
From my experience, if you ignore these feelings, they start going to the gym every day, start a training montage, go through a few character development story arcs, and then come back with a vengeance to beat you up until you listen to them a few years later. 

The second time it works 😊
Yup same shit here, kind of dealt with a bit. As much as it sucks the only way I figured was time and conscious acceptance.
Oh my god, I thought I was the only one like this, every time I look at this sub, I see people with extreme dysphoria and I felt like I am tricking myself thinking I am trans
I loved the article but I just want to say something else to all of those younger people that are reading this don't wait don't wait until your life has passed you by before you are willing to at least try to take the steps to find yourself life got in my way and here I am at a late stage of life asking myself questions that I wish I could have been asking when I was a teenager and wishing the world was a different place when I was younger because all of this information and support didn't exist
if you’re unsure thats okay!! labels aren’t always necessarily, good luck in finding yourself friend
I'm the same
r/51%
You're valid!!! Dysphoria is not a requirement of being trans hun! I didn't feel too much dysphoria either, someone once told me that being feminine gave me gender euphoria and that's totally valid! Best of luck, feel free to message me or anyone else here for any advice or just to rant!
The medical establishment has tricked you into feeling this way. Just do what feels right to you. If you feel better feminizing yourself in various ways including hormones then do that. You don’t have to classify who you are, it’s not a requirement to be you. If you prefer she/her for pronouns or not it makes no difference on your gender presentation. To be trans is simply to be on the spectrum and not totally in line with your assigned gender at birth. If you’ve ever felt dysphoria at all, you are trans.
Disclaimer: this is reflective of my experience only (31 AMAB MtF).  Don't take it as gospel -

You have to jump tf in.  Nothing changes until you sit down, look yourself in the mirror and accept that you may have to sacrifice everything to be happy.  I went from being petrified of anyone thinking I'm not totally masc to going outside in yoga pants and a white manicure to straight up sitting in Planned Parenthood in a chick outfit (I looked dope btw in case you were wondering) waiting for my hormones.  In the span of a week.  Granted I have been trans my entire life and this is like the pinnacle, but what I mean to say is that you will AMAZE yourself with what you are able to marshal internally.

It gets easier.  Your armor builds up.  The woman that I am is way stronger than the guy I was born as ever was.

Don't give up.  Don't let your haters push you backwards.  You have to be the person you feel like you are.  Don't get discouraged about looking or feeling too masc.  Electrolysis, HRT, FFS, AM, there are tons and tons of ways to push the ball down the field.
I think a lot of people have that doubt, that they're not trans enough, not gay enough, not whatever enough. You have dysphoria about masculinity and euphoria about femininity. That's more than enough to count as a trans girl. You are enough! Things don't have to be any worse or any more extreme for you to claim that identity!
Dysphoria comes and goes.  

The human brain has never been a logical machine. Some days you may well know who you are. You know what feels right and wrong, and who you're meant to be. Sometimes it's not so clear. Instead of looking back at times when you knew for sure, the brain forgets. Maybe it was just a dream after all, maybe it'll just go away.  

But it comes back the same way every time.

The human brain has never been a logical machine. Part of what held me back was trying to fully understand myself, and all this constant analysis and logical deduction and all that, it kept me from just living as myself.  

I realised that I didn't need to understand, I just needed to *be*. And labels, as beautiful and wonderful as it is to know where you belong in a world as terrifying as the one we find ourselves in, would come secondary to my continued existence, not for anything, just *because*.  

The human brain has never been a logical machine. But if it was, it wouldn't know pain, or happiness, or beauty.  

So maybe we should stop treating it like one. <3
This is completely normal. I hate to say it but there is nothing anyone can say to you to make that feeling go away. The doubt will linger no matter what anyone tells you or how much you accept it mentally. accepting it emotionally is the only way to free yourself of this doubt. How to do that is something only you can figure out
Don’t dent your nature. Embrace it.
Start with , let go of this or that binary. You are a delicious mix of who you are! Let you be you. No need to trade the boy box for the girl box. About changing stuff? It's not a race, but maybe a little here, a little there? But really, is it a race? Stay true to you, is all you can do and enjoy life the way you want.
i’ve felt the same thing for a while, you just have to except who you are, it’s hard sometimes and it might take a while but i believe in u!
I spent a long time in that same headspace.
It’s hard to provide a definitive answer —which I imagine is what you are looking for— but I can promise that irrational part of you will go away over time. I remember I wrote something like this once, and found myself irrationally annoyed at the suggestion that maybe I was genderfluid or something else instead of a trans girl. As it turns out it’s a bit of both because gender is weird, but the point I’m trying to make is that that logical part of your brain is the part to listen to, and the rest will follow.

It’ll take longer than you want —it always does— but eventually you’ll have that part of you in sync. In the meantime, try to remind yourself that a lot of people here felt the same way at first, that we are lying to ourselves, and that a cis person wouldn’t feel that they need or want to experience (more) dysphoria because generally, cis people don’t have anything to prove to themselves. But, hun, you’ll get there — I can promise you that. There’ll come a time you won’t have to doubt yourself anymore.
The brain is hardwired male and female no matter what it’s always wired that way you can’t change it if you really want to become trans do it I’m not stopping you no one stopping you but it’s your brain telling you to be yourself

Ps I saw this on a friends phone and thought I’d just put my 2 cents out there
[removed]
People have said this before, and I'll say it again. The validation of a trans person doesn't come from the amount of dysphoria someone has. It comes from the euphoria one gets from being perceived as their true self. 

At least this is my take on it, as a trans person myself. Hope this helps!
It's okay! The way you feel is normal. You are a woman, and your dysphoria is just a reminder that you are in no way a man. Your thoughts, perceptions, hopes and dreams are that of a woman, because you can only be who you are.

Everyone, whether cis or trans, has masculine and feminine qualities. With the way society is, it's normal for women to desire to have more or only feminine rather than masculine qualities — and vice versa for men. These qualities never define whether someone is male or female or nonbinary. What defines you is you. If you feel comfortable being feminine, you are feminine. A feminine woman; and a woman can be as feminine or as masculine as she wants. There isn't a right or wrong way. What makes you euphoric is just you being you, so continue to be you and do what makes you feel comfortable and happy. It's important to always embrace your womanhood. No one can ever take it away from you. Every woman has a desire to be seen and respected as a female, and that's all it takes to be a woman.
something something impostor syndrome
Tends to happen... we all got doubts...
if you feel like you’re not feeling enough dysphoria, just remember that cis people feel NO dysphoria. 

being trans isn’t an easy or fun journey but it’s one you will find yourself through and be much happier than if you stayed as something you’re not
What makes you trans isn't the dysphoria it's the euphoria
So personally this sounds like you’re underplaying your feelings. It sounds very similar to impostor syndrome and I think you should maybe look into that but also and more importantly, go see a therapist and they can help you work on that self doubt
I’ll be honest with you. For most of my life I didn’t even know I was trans until about like 4 years ago or so and suddenly a lot of things made sense. However, some things didn’t like how I didn’t show these “signs” when I was younger or at least not when I was super super young that my family was able to tell that I was different. My family had no idea because of the fact I never said I had a girl brain or liked to dress up with “feminine” clothing so that’s something that comes back to me every now and then and makes me doubt things. However I am so much happier now than ever and I take so many pictures of myself now and I still like to dress up “masculine” but also super “feminine”. Idk where I’m going with this. But my point is, you have to take time to learn more about yourself and your journey and don’t downplay it just because others have a different experience than you. There are trans people who don’t wanna take hormones or get surgery. Hell there are even trans people who don’t feel dysphoria. So yeah just take time to get to know yourself more but don’t compare the way you feel to other trans people because we all have different experiences and history behind our transition. That is all. Thanks for hearing my Ted talk lol
When I first figured I was trans, I felt almost no dysphoria at all. It took a good chunk of year until I started to experience it. Meaning to say, dysphoria isn't what makes you trans. Its simply a possible side effect
That is also how I got to my current identity, I just still sometimes have to deal with my annoying brain, thank you for the advice though :>
Yes I can confirm that this works perfectly because at first I thought I was genderfluid!
Yeah, if only it was all a bit easier
Yes I cry everyday because of this
It was indeed quite interesting. I feel the same way as the author, just with some added dysphoria that my brain won’t acknowledge

Thank you for sharing it :>

And you are indeed valid <3
This article has a really interesting perspective that very much sounds like my own, with the only difference that I don’t believe I ever really desired to be a woman, and instead just never felt fully comfortable as a boy, even though I accepted I was one for 26 out of the 27 years I’ve been alive (hence my username which bugs me a little and I’m probably gonna make a new account soon lol) but yea I always thought I was just a boy even though there have always been things about me that always set me just apart enough from the rest of the guys that I never felt like I belonged as one of them, which I always just chalked up to me being weird and having had a unique upbringing. I’ve also always been more comfortable talking to, being around, and opening up to women and I never knew why until recently, which is cuz I’m either a woman or non-binary with a general preference for femininity in my gender expression. But yea the way I’ve heard dysphoria described never seemed like what I was feeling but that article kinda put things into perspective for me a bit and helped me come a little closer to accepting my own experience thus far so thank you 😊
This describes me own experience better than anything I've ever read.
Whoa that that was like reading my own biography
huh I.... just huh....... I seriously remember laying awake as a kid of like 12 thinking wouldn't it be cool if I woke up as a girl. Then like growing out of that phase. Now here I am at 28 like OHHHH THAT WAS IT. I was the author with less of the fantasy in between my awakening and my original musings.
Underrated comment!

Read this comment I only want to bring attention if possible
WTF I have been battling what OP is battling and OMG this literally has me in 😭😭
Please anyone who is questioning read this!!
I can not possibly tell you how powerful this 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for this article
That's the most relatable article I've read. Thanks for sharing it.
This fits me. Thanks
Wow that was pretty interesting to read because it was like I was reading my life story up until the point you were talking with a therapist and started to transition in some ways I think it's worse when you don't have dysphoria because it's like you don't have proof that anyone else can see but your whole view on desire hits home with me very hard I'm glad there's somebody else out there like me I'm not sure I'll be able to get to my endpoint but it makes me feel a little bit better about the way I feel on my quest to figure out who I really am
thanks so much for sharing this, it really helped me!
The posting in the link is very insightful, and describes my feelings right now.   Thank you GolemNardah for sharing.
Thats really interesting. I know I and some other trans people have a hard time understanding what it’s like to be trans but have no physical dysphoria. Thank you so much for sharing this
Do you still get euphoria?
Thank you so much for sharing this! I hadn't seen it before and I needed it today
Thank you so much for sharing this article. 💜
Wow, that’s fits me so well. Thank you for sharing this!
Thank you for sharing this, I wish I had read this years ago
Excellent article!
Thank you so much for posting this, it is so similar to my experience and it is so wonderful to hear I'm not the only one.
Holy crap that article is so ridiculous accurate to how I've felt my whole life. It put into words what I've experienced as a trans woman who didn't really have much dysphoria growing up and definitely didn't always ""know"" Thank you for sharing it.
Yeah, I agree, hopefully I can talk to one sooner rather than later
Yeah, that’s true, I can’t wait for that
Well, that’s really nice to know, and it made me euphoric for some reason
Those are basically the exact words running through my head. I recently realized I’m most likely trans but it’s been such an emotional rollercoaster of self doubt. 

Hell some days, I even wonder if it’s all just a fetish, which makes me feel awful and disgusting because I feel like I’m making slight of something very serious.
…yeah okay I can see now that I’m very clearly trans hahaha

And also, you’re valid, girl!
Thank youu, I’ll try my best not to be too mean to myself, it probably isn’t too healthy for me

And you’re a valid guy no matter what anyone says <3
Yeah, that would probably be the healthiest thing to do. It won’t be long before I turn 18, so I’ll have a look at my options at that time, but thank you very much for the input
Ah, I also identified as agender for a while for the same reason, in my case it was only a couple of months though

And it helped a lot! I couldn’t help but smile at being called a woman
I’m also in that exact situation, except with flipped genders, just remember that you’re a valid guy :>
Thank youu, I’m happy to be part of it :>
Hmm, you’ve got a good point, I also get a lot of euphoria sometimes
So much in the same boat right now! Even the beard…
I should engrave this onto my forehead, because I keep forgetting that this is the real path. No labels, just following what makes me joy.
Well, that’s actually a quite good point and helped me a bunch, thank you :>
She should accept herself, don’t be transphobic.
Well, it really can be

*hugs*
I am afraid I will be a weak woman. Both physically and mentally. I am not feeling content as a man now, but at least I am independent and outwardly strong…
Sorry for the essay. I am write many words.
Sadly I'm also in ur shoes and need to reset and forgive myself constantly for nagging thoughts. Most are pre-discovery feelings that I don't know how to communicate now that I've discovered. Ya know?
Yeah, it's pretty exhausting emotionally.
I’ve run across that article before, and I’m ad she posted it. I’m getting at least as much out of it the second time is the first time.

“And that was exactly how it felt — like a wish — a childish fantasy as absurd and wonderful as being able to fly.”

Toooootally fits exactly how I’ve been fit a looooong time. 

“My gender identity began as gender desire. Being a woman began as a desire to have a feminine body and to be seen and treated as a woman.”

So much. 

I relate to your Op too 

Oh my gosh, I stumbled across that detrans group earlier, and they are soooooo gross. One thing to question who you are and discover you are your agab, quite another to think and say the grotesque things those people say.
I think we're in the same boat generally speaking! That article helped me a lot feel comfortable with the label ""woman"" ❤
Ty for this comment. It mirrors my experience pretty closely.
Ditto, but going in the other direction. 😳
I felt the same when I read it ❤
My life literally changes SO QUICK after reading this article, I understand it may not do the same for everyone, but after 25 years of fighting myself one way or another I FINALLY found PEACE with myself and the world. It is TRULY amazing the feelings I am having now and the COMPLETE change in perception, everything I did before was honestly done in part by hate and disgust, disguising itself as good feelings, and now I feel like all I want to do is put LOVE into this world ❤ Every person in the world should feel what I felt last night, I was crying for an hour and a half straight, then couldn't stop myself from smiling for almost 4 hours. I really really wish that the MESSAGE can be heard by ALL and if you are reading this (or not) I love you and LOVE truly makes the world go around!!! It is one of the things that is ALWAYS present, like your nose, but you fail to see it until it's POINTED OUT. Words cannot describe these emotions, it cannot POSSIBLY capture the beauty of feeling inner peace. 😍 I want everyone to know regardless of how you feel towards anyone or anything, you are loved and once you feel that LOVE, your life too will change!!!
You're welcome, love! ❤ I hope it helps.
You're welcome 😊
I don't have proof that there is an end goal for us (I'm a baby trans) but I full intend to go full woman because I have a lot of SOCIAL dysphoria.
Yupp! Socially mostly but I plan to start exploring physical expression soon.
Same haha
When i doubted if transition was the right choice and maybe i would regret it, ive told myself well if you dont even try it youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life anyway
Mission accomplished. 😊
ABSOLUTELY!!! If I’m not casually pulling myself out of it with those initial thoughts my mind immediately goes to “I’m just a sick pervert with an intense fetish that is destroying my mental health”
Oh don’t worry, I’m even further back in the denial phase than you are lol. I can’t even take my own advice! But if I can help others then that’s a silver lining :) thank you
Hey thank you!
Oh wow you’re so young. There is resources I think for minors that need gender therapy too depending where you live. 

Remember that self discovery is a process, it doesn’t have to move quickly so don’t feel pressured that you have to figure it out or make any changes you’re not comfortable doing yet. I’m 34 and still figuring things out :)
I'll swap bodies with you promise😩
While the label means a lot for some people, so many focus too much on that and miss out on a lot of potential happiness. 

Enjoy your journey and remember you deserve all the love and happiness this universe has to offer ❤💙
But correct me if I'm wrong; doesn't it feel like paper maché anyway? 

In my case I felt like I had to put up this strong front all the time, I was absolutely never happy though. Now I feel like embracing my femininity takes WAAAAAYYYYY more guts. You will start to feel strong because you are doing something for yourself. People don't like it? Fork them. They can remove their bigoted forking behinds from your life and you will be better off. 

Be inwardly strong, you deserve it. And I promise you can do it. Give yourself a chance
Doesn’t have to be ❤️
That’s amazing and I’m super happy for you 🥰 it always makes me happy when someone who’s been struggling with this stuff comes to find acceptance of themself and their experiences and until I accepted that I was trans I always wondered why it made me so genuinely happy to see trans people go from confusion and struggling with their identity to finding themselves and accepting it and being happy and comfortable in their own skin, until finally I was like “well duh ofc it makes you happy cuz *that’s what you want you dumbass egg* lol
Ofc! I’m honestly happy I’m finding a bunch of others who have a very similar experience to mine.
What I meant by proof is that if you feel dysphoria that's strong enough I'm pretty sure others can tell there's something going on where as if you don't feel dysphoria at least not strongly it would probably go unnoticed and it's much easier to push aside as did the person writing that article it sounds to me like you very much do have an end goal in sight and I hope you get there and find your happy place
You’ve got a good point, I can’t spend all my life in constant dysphoria. I still wanna be fully sure first though
Still pre everything but this reasoning is basically my top motivation for transitioning when I'm doubtful
It’s like you’re reading my mind and voicing my thoughts word for word. I have never had as much doubt about who I was as I did (and still do) after telling myself “I’m pretty sure I’m a woman”.
No problem!
Yeah, I’m guessing it’s getting a bit easier for young people to discover now, thanks to the internet :>

I’ll take my time with self discovery, I don’t wanna do anything I’ll end up regretting, and best of luck to you!
Yesss, that would be amazing
You are totally right! I was never brave, where I have already been much braver since I came out to some people.
You are totally right! I was never brave, where I have already been much braver since I came out to some people.
You are totally right! I was never brave, where I have already been much braver since I came out to some people.
I would definitely like to know how. My emotions are crazy dealing with this.
Usually if u only go on hrt for a month you would know if its for you or not  and only a month would not really cause irreversible physical change
Right! The first time I ever got a chance to fully transform my appearance with shaving, clothes, wig, and makeup I almost cried because I was so happy… that’s gotta mean something right!?
Message me and we can talk about it. Last year this time I was in such a horrible depression I nearly didn’t make it out and now I’m happy and thriving. I’d love to share my experience and possibly help you
Oh right, I didn’t really consider that, haha

Thanks a lot, I have a clearer plan of action now :>
6 weeks into HRT and all my doubts are fading away bit by bit. It just feels right. I am still uncertain about some things, but I've accepted that I will probably never be 100% certain, as Non-Binary.
It sure does! I know our biggest enemy is our mind but I hope we both can one day overcome it and focus on the good feelings, rather than the negative ones.
Yeah I’m having a hard time right now as well. I definitely feel like I am not dysphoric enough to be trans, and I had a demiboy friend who told me that me using the word “dysphoria” to describe my feelings was insensitive and wrong since I wasn’t depressed enough (this really hurt me and ironically gave me more dysphoria). Im gender fluid and have had a really hard time accepting it and sometimes just opt for ignoring the fact that I’m male sometimes. I end up feeling as if it’s not possible for people to love me because my gender fluxes.
Yea in the begining when everything starts to feel right and i still had doubt i was like, i might not be sure what am i yet but i now know 100% im not a boy 😆 i was like am i enby or a girl? But im pretty confident now being a women is the right way to live my life
Virtual hugs!! We’re gonna be alright. 

We. Are. Valid.  regardless of where life takes us. And we’re not freaks. Just need to remind ourselves of that every once in a while
I’m so sorry that you feel that way :( I should have mentioned that I’m trans and transitioned socially back in June and that’s the reason for me being happy and thriving"	r7bsws	trans	1430	0.97	2021-12-02 16:56:57
My mom made my 15yo daughter (mtf) girlish underwear that fits her unique body ànd identity ❤️		"Let them know about Rubies underwear, its really nice to have underwear that gives you the confidence to wear tighter fitting girls clothes.  

[https://rubyshines.com/](https://rubyshines.com/)

I have no relation, other than I wear them, and love em.  Its run by a dad of a trans girl in toronto, and if you cant afford it you can get a free pair.
That’s awesome
your mom cool asf 
 
as are you, im jealous that your daughter has such a cool family
That’s amazing!!
Make these and sell them. They’ll sell.
This is so wholesome!
This is so wonderful and supportive!
I wish I had parents like you
Aww! That’s so sweet. I’m glad your mom is so supportive 💜
That's so sweet!
This is beautiful, I want to cry
Wow, and what a great looking job. If she's making more, point her towards something like LeoLines. They sew a thin layer of padding in the front to smooth everything out. It makes everything look a lot smoother when wearing feminine cut pants and close fitting dresses. Might be a thing to try out if she's making another pair.
i Adore this!!! is there any chance you could share the sewing patterns? i would LOVE to have this in my library!!
That's awesome!  Way to go mom!  ♥️🧡💜❤️💚💙💛🖤
Thats so sweet and adorable
I would love to have a grandmother like her! I’m glad that she’s so supportive.
Nice mom you have 😏(this is a joke please don’t take me seriously)
Can I be fitted? I would like to make an appointment.
Now if only there was something like this for trans men. Especially the swimwear.
Thats so sweet🥺
Hey ik ben van belgie en ben 16 zou ik jou dochter een berichtje mogen sturen via instagram ofzo?
That’s awesome, thanks for letting me know!
I would be able to afford it if I specifically saved for it so I don’t really wanna get the free one.. would you say it’s worth the money? They seem kinda expensive (I’d also have to presumably pay quite a bit on shipping). Thanks :)
glad to know about this and im so hppy it existits and this is super nobel of him but holy crap the 70s wants their website back
Oh god this is so amazing. Reading the reviews on their products is so wholesome 💖
I have a bikini and a pair of undies from them. 10/10 seriously can’t recommend them enough. Not just for kids either- I’m a grown ass adult and I easily found my size.
My daughter was so unhappy wearing boy’s boxers that didn’t match her bra. But women’s undies have a terrible fit. Then my mother had a brilliant idea: she bought white boxers and bras, and dyed them so they look like a matching set. 

I am also trying to convince manufacturers to design this, so matching underwear for a ‘different fit’ can be in stores as it should be. For the time being, this will make her happy I hope!
Will definitely check that out, thanks so much!
Thank you!

It’s actually pre-made underwear, but then dyed to it looks like (or is!) a matching set. We wanted to sew it from scratch at first, but I only have a regular sewing machine at the moment so this was easier (and a better fit). 

I am trying to find a company that is willing to produce this. My goal is that this is completely ordinary to find in stores in 10 years 🙂
Hallo. Mijn dochter is niet actief op social media.
The site wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be by your comment. Lol

But maybe they can partner with someone in the trans community that does website design?
That’s an awesome idea
omg i love that! easy accessibility to specialized clothing is a thing that we actually really need, and i do say that dye job is great. the way the elastic and ribbon is coloured really accentuates the colour of the main fabric!
Jammer
yea really not tat bad, UI is great, just bright colors. dosen need much work tbh
Thanks, I’ll pass the compliment to my mother 😊"	rwqyi6	trans	1391	0.99	2022-01-05 16:36:44
Visited a psychologist to tell my problem of gender dysphoria with really high expectations	"Went to a psychologist today (he was a franciscan friar) and opened up my issues to him(I'm a closeted trans girl). He told 'keeping myself busy' can help like seriously? I'm having problem with my gender identity from my childhood and he thinks that can help? Is he insane or what?

Edit: Thanks for all the supporting comments🥰 (idk if it's the right word English isn't my first language lmao)

Edit 2: Thanks for 1k upvotes💖 Sorry if I missed any comments"	"Oh yeah totally, closeted ftm transgender here and I “distract” myself by crying in the shower almost every night 😐

Get a real therapist! They have no idea what they’re talking about!
Didn't you know? Wordle cures dysphoria.
that is not a good psychologist someone who tells you to just sit and let your problem stir... that doesnt help that doesnt fix anything

I would recommend finding someone else
*facepalm*  get to a real therapist!  One who specializes in trans issues and identities
Keeping yourself busy actually can help, but if it's the only thing you're doing then that's a problem. You can only transition so fast, and in the meantime you can still be struggling, so that would be a good time to occupy yourself.


When I was waiting for my HRT appointment I felt horrible, and distracting myself did in fact help while I waited.
In language arts I did vocab last week. Time to put it to use. This person's brain is *void* of any brain cells.
That is is really hard! I am sorry! <3 I would say if you are under 18, try to talk to a school counselor (make sure to ask them if the information you discuss with them will stay confidential. Some states, districts, countries have some rules about disclosure that are different for lgbt folks, unfortunately.) otherwise I would google “LGBT therapy near me.” There might be some resources that are on a sliding scale depending on where you live. I live in the US, so that kind of effects my knowledge of resources. Most importantly Stay Strong Sister!
Keep yourself busy by finding a new therapist. Therapy is challenging, but it’s never dismissive.
The crazy thing is that even at the most Christian of social work schools (Baylor) their program is absolutely trans affirming. That doesn’t mean everyone graduates from there learning to be trans affirming, just that there’s no excuse to not be. 

I don’t know if they still do this, but police used to send kids into gas stations to buy cigarettes and then they’d fine the store if they actually sold them. They need to do that with medicine. Send in actors posing as patients and fine the practitioner for giving non-evidence-based advice. Like I know my 71-yr-old father is trans affirming with his patients, it is possible for everyone, no matter how old, to stay on top of recent scientific findings in healthcare. These people are just letting their bigotry get in the way of their knowledge acquisition.
He's mostly wrong, but we spend a lot of time waiting so keeping yourself busy can help when the solution to your problem is still months/years away. That can't be all you do though, you still need to work towards your transition just not all the time.
Religious based background told me from a million miles away the dude was gonna be about as helpful as a strainer on a sinking boat.
> he was a Franciscan friar

Found your problem
I tried ""keeping myself busy"" for like 24 years, It. Does. NOT. Work. 

Cis people really shouldn't be allowed to dish out advice on dysphoria, gender identity and transitioning, idk why so many think they're an authority in the subject.
Ah, yes distract yourself with idle tasks in order to help run from your problems.

Sounds like another cis therapist who doesn't ""get it"" you can't run from being trans, it will either catch you or leave you depressed.
He is way off in left field.  Find someone better to open up to and ignore the friar.
I had a therapist who said and i quote 

""Some men like it to wear female clothing, its a common fetish and nothing to be afraid of""

Yeah let that sink in. Btw he was 2 years before  Retirement
I really hate “trained psychologists” who have all these qualifications and yet they have no clue and the passion in helping and understanding their patients, that its essentially sideswiping their problems.

Find a transgender community counselor where you are from. You will find a better time, advice, resources, and price overall. 

I wish you luck girl🍀🙂🏳️‍⚧️❤️
I have had 3 psychologists speak to me like this! I live in Central Georgia and am waaay beyond frustrated! I can truly sympathize with you but do not have a solution…….. sadly enough………sigh😭
Maybe he’s onto something. Transitioning has kept me pretty busy.
It distracts you from your dypshoria quite a lot. I got into airplane and rocket design and its done wonders for me lol
Unfortunately a lot of mental health providers are extremely ignorant on Trans needs.
Bruh you talked to a member of a cult that is always doing homophobic/transphobic shit about being trans, of course they're going to say transphobic shit about it.
As a psychologist, I'm sorry this happened to you. We are people too, and we are all ignorant and lacking knowledge in various areas to some degree. It's important to find someone who is both knowledgeable about what you want to discuss and has a compatible personality. I'd recommend looking for a therapist who specializes at least in LGBT clients if not specifically trans clients. Then you'd only have to weed them out based on personality. Wishing you the best of luck.
It’s actually working to some extent. I’ve kept myself busy all the years to forget who I really am. I was kind of workoholic. The downside is it’s not solution forever. Once the pandemic hit and The activities have been reduced I was hit by dyshoria big way for two weeks in a row. That time I’ve decided I have to start HRT. But in general yes keeping busy, running etc. actually helps to reduce dysphoria to some extent, but it’s not solution and it might not work for everyone.
I knew a Franciscan, they are not accepting in private. In public maybe, but they’re Catholic. Preach “hate the sin, love the sinner” essentially. They try to pretend as much as possible and then speak up when they feel things have “gone too far.”

I’m pretty sure the one I knew suspected I was lgbt and he knew I was a struggling student because I’m neurodivergent. he worked at my school) and I often felt like he thought of me as less intelligent or able because of those things. Whether he’d admit that or not is really the problem here, so I’ll never know…
When I needed an evaluation on my identity I went to a psychologist who was trained on gender issues, I believe that not all the psychologist have the right training to deal with this topic.... May try to find one who's specialized.... Good luck❤️
Hello 👋😊 Which expectations did u have? Like I can imagine to find a person in medical field who is able to understand and comfort u in ur problems right? First of all, I am so proud of u, that u did open up to a person with medical profession and even u don't see it, but just by open up yourself to this person u did make a change and a step forward especially in the medical field to be more open about being trans! Thank you! 

I believe that you are not alone in your city environment! The chance is that there a lot more people who are closed! But as I said u did a step to open up, you learn from it, you get reinsurance here and from yourself. See it as a kind of practice to live openly ☺️✨ you get through it, i promise 🤗
I see a lot of people commenting to get a “real” therapist and just wanted to add, in addition to criteria like specializing in LGBTQ+ issues, make sure    
the therapist is still licensed to practice psychology. A 
PhD or doctoral level psychologist will have “LP” at the end of their name, for example, “John Smith, PhD, (or PsyD)LP.” A masters level psychology will have an LLP, “John Smith, MA (or MS), LLP. 

It’s one thing to have the degree, but being licensed means that there is additional experience the individual has had. I’m hold a Masters degree in Clinical Psychology, so I have 500 hours of clinical experience, but I’m not licensed to practice, (for other personal reasons which I won’t get into) which in my state requires an additional 2,000 hours plus taking and passing the licensing exam. 

Just information to spread for anyone seeking therapy!
Replace the therapist.
That's basically what I did for a solid decade of my life to repress shit, just focused on school/work every waking second. What a miserable waste of my teens and in the end you backslide into depression and end up friendless without the motivation to get out of bed.

So, all in all, fuck that advice.
Sounds like it's related to the stereotype that being trans is for young people with too much time on their hands, like it's because you're doing too much introspection when you should be working. I might be wrong, but that's what came to mind when I read it. I hope you can find someone more professional.
Definitely not a psychologist to stay with... keeping yourself busy can distract you, sure, but it's not gonna fix the deeper issue. It's like a bad marriage that gets temporarily patched over by having a kid (not a fix, but happened to one set of my grandparents so it's a familiar comparison at least). Sure, you can put your issues aside and focus on a kid for some 18-years, but once that kid moves out you're stuck facing the issue again...

I'm sorry it didn't work out, though. There are unfortunately good and bad psychologists, but please keep going for yourself if you're able two. I'm on my third and he's the first one I've felt truly comfortable with as well as the most helpful. Gender incongruence shouldn't be pushed off as just an impulsive thought that can be waved off
I'm not blaming you for your experience because it's on him, but I don't know why you expected anything else from a Christian therapist, and a Franciscan at that.
-.- 

Time to replace that therapist.
""keeping yourself busy"" basically just means ignoring the issue or pushing it back. Basically, that psychologist is a fucking prick.
Tried that one in high school and college, didn't work...
I tried keeping myself busy as a coping mechanism for gender dysphoria. It got me professional success, burnout and depression, and guess what ... I am still trans.
You need someone who specialises in gender. They have quite a few where I live as it's a requirement to see a specialist before HRT or surgery
He doesn't sound trans-allied at all. He is denying your experience. Find someone unaffiliated with religion, lgbtq friendly if you can, but also look for younger therapists, that may help. Check for interns at schools where there are programs to teach therapists, they are often current with  better information.
thats only reasonable advice if you literally cant do anything else to alleviate dysphoria
If it’s rooted in catholicism, (which franciscan friars definitely are) you can bank on it being transphobic. (And rooted in white supremacy, which is also transphobic) It often comes from projection, because if they have to challenge/change their perception of gender/sexuality as constructs to help other people feel comfortable, it requires them to explore or even think about themselves and that scares the shit out of christians. I’m sorry this person was transphobic to you, and took advantage of you confiding in them, that is absolutely disgusting. I hope you’re able to find a resource for psych help that isn’t like that.
I mean, he's not *completely* wrong. One of the reasons I didn't come out sooner was because school took up so much of my time and effort that considering my gender fell by the wayside. It's not a solution, however, since it didn't address the issues but simply postponed dealing with them.
Idk if it’s different around the world, but that is a reason why you pick psychotherapist, not psychologist
This psychologist is so fucking stupid it sounds like a sitcom where the dumbass of the group has to fill in while the real psychologist is away. ""Have you tried not thinking about it?"" good lord it's somehow worse than telling depressed people to try being happy, what a fucking clown show of a career
That is a crock of shhh...bad stuff. I know you've said you live in a conservative area but so many councils do online now as well. I am proud of you for knowing who you are, don't let those that hate try to change you. Xx
Your first mistake was going to a church affiliate not associated with LGBTQ+ people. Go to an actual therapist- no amount of awkwardness is worth living with dysphoria. Try searching on lgbt subreddits for specific location therapists or your city lgbt resources.
He's not insane, but he IS a Franciscan friar, and he IS a Catholic and he IS not a trained gender therapist. 

He may indeed be a fine dude, and a licensed psychologist, but as an advisor snd confident for ***you*** as his patient/client, he's as dangerous as a spoonful of cyanide.

He almost certainly has NO idea what you're going through. He may not have even met a transgender person before, let alone tried to counsel one.

He means you no ill will nor harm. But he is NOT qualified. to help you. As a Catholic, he likely believes you are morally disordered, and that you somehow chose to be a trans person!

How do I know?  I'm a Catholic, and I've heard those exact words used in multiple masses.

Hate the sin, love the sinner they say. 

Right. Oh, and thanks SOOO much, by the way.

Thank him for his advice, and then find a qualified gender therapist. It's important that this person be a ***trained*** gender therapist. 

As a transperson who's been in therapy for years, I just don't believe you can get the quality service you need from someone who is ***not*** a gender specialist.

You just won't......
Tried that for 40+ Years. It didn't work. I transitioned. Within weeks I was happy.

Coincidence?
This is to be expected. Find someone recommended by the trans community.

And have a read of this

https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index#wiki_gatekeeping
I mean, being a friar and a psychologist at the same time sounds professionally dubious to say the least. Considering that religion and gender issues are like oil and water I don't think there'd be anybody worse suited to helping you
Oh I for sure kept myself busy. It only delayed my coming out
A Franciscan is probably not who you need to be  seeing. While I’m certain they are good for any number of non sexual issues, when it comes to sexual matters an order of monks will not have the knowledge to help you. Do you have friends who can introduce you to a psychologist? However, you may find the questions raised and asked could be very painful and make you question why you have dysmorphia. Sadly for some it’s peer/media pressure that is the catalyst and so they will really need you to be honest with them
Just don't go again to that person. My psychologist who isn't a gender one she wants me to act upon it.
Keep yourself  busy is actually not bad advice, really... You could stay busy with transitioning, finding a doctor to manage medical transition such as hormone therapy, start doing laser hair removal, filing all the name and gender change paperwork, shop for your new wardrobe, watching YouTube makeup tutorials, and finding a real gender therapist...do those things to keep busy and you will probably feel much better...
They are so limited, babe, because it’s outside their experience. And they think being you is a ‘sin’ so double whammy. 

I gave up on religion-based Counseling decades ago. They just don’t deal well with a kinky, exhibitionist, bisexual, parent of a trans teen who has pain and punishment issues.
So his solution was literally ""just run from your problems and pretend they don't exist""... Very ""professional psychologist"" of him ...
I don't believe super religious people should do any mental health anything. I had a therapist tell me to pray when that isn't a tool for abusive parents. You deserve to feel secure. Being busy isn't gonna give you that. Sure people can be religious but that isn't useful to to other people. I hope you feel better.
He is not wrong in the sense that keeping yourself busy can help distract yourself from the symptoms.... But that's all.


It's more important to deal with your issues than to just ignore them.


Hope you find proper help. Good luck.
How does someone have depression just do chores or smth
Keeping one self can be busy for general things like depression and anxiety, but really that's fairly ""Armchair Psychology"" right there.

Personally I find doing my nails, as someone who is potentially mtf, helps with giving me euphoria, but since I don't suffer from dysphoria I don't feel like I can give any great help there, sadly.

I'm self-conscious of appearance so I've worn things that can be hidden like knee-high socks and arguably more gender neutral stuff like painting my nails black and wearing arm warmers. I'm sure others here have much better advice.
That's my go to , to tell to anyone with anxiety depression. Because it helps me so much with mine. I don't see that helping you a bit tho...unless u have high anxiety.... what an idiot. I'm sorry. <3
It seems weird.. but I've heard this before too from others who live in pain.
Maybe he thinks everyone lives in pain. Maybe he does and thinks it's normal. Maybe he distracts himself..
Unfortunately trans people are still not validated even through all therapist - even LGB friendly. When looking for a therapist, make sure they are gender affirming and trans friendly. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Honey, it could be that he doesn't know and possibly doesn't understand what you're going through. In times of stress yes keeping your mind off of it could help but finding your gender identity isn't stress, it's stressful to some but getting help from therapists or maybe talking to someone about it could help.
Are you a psychologist?
Distracting  yourself is what alcoholics with depression are doing oftentimes, its not a cure its just a coping mechanism

&#x200B;

Find a better psycologist
Bullshit answer from therepist, they should have refered you to a gender therepist. Uou can have multiple therepists! Look for a Gender therepist or atleast someone who specializes in gender therepy and/or lgbtq+ issues. I have my first meeting with one next week, but I looked for one that specifically listed those things in their bio. They are a councelor technically but their speciality is gender and trans stuff. I will stay with my regular therepist but will be focusing on things like life goals and relationships with them. And gender/sexuality with the specialist.
I feel like this is common shitty advice because I was told to go to a psychologist for severe ibs and she was like ""just listen to music and distract yourself""

So yeah probably find someone else
I utilized my time going to the gym to work on developing my feminine figure. I got a corset to help shape my torso area and worked on my legs, hips, and butt. I eventually did go on HRT, and now I have a pretty passable body. So maybe try to set a goal for yourself to get a head start on your transition, and work towards that goal. That way you can distract yourself and start changing your body to better reflect your identity
Ikr he's super insane like i literally opened up all about myself to him and now I'm feeling awkward
I have never heard someone be so relatable here. Crying in the shower every night...
Never heard of that lol is that a video game? That's what google told me xD
Dysphoria doesn't exist in wordle world - too many letters 😂
I will try to find someone related to counselling about gender issues maybe
Yeaaaah...as soon as I saw ""Franciscan Friar""... 😬
But ignoring my thoughts to cure my dysphoria won't work. It is like denying myself for who I'm
Lmaoo trueee
True my dad told to go there cause he got phD in psychology. Atleast he should have tried to help me instead of bringing his conservative ideology there.
True lol many cis people (not all) thinks being trans is a disorder
So Truee like does he even know that being trans can't be cured
Yeah true it's jusr a fetish and not part of what your gender identity is

/S
Thanks I will🥰
Also idk but when you called me girl i feel so euphoric 😆
Yeah. Overworking and exertion does distract me a lot, though I do suffer do to it physically and mentally. It does work but it’s not a good idea
Thanks I'll try to find someone who is specialist in LGBT people
I'll come out too one day and i don't think denying myself and keeping busy won't work😕
Thanks a lot🥰🥰🥰you are really sweet🥰
He had a pHD in psychology so that's why i thought of visiting him. I thought he knew more.
Yes he's insane lol
Ikr. Some people think being trans is a disorder which needs to be cured
So sorry to hear, try finding an lgtbq therapist, anyone that’s near you
Im saddened to hear that I’m not the only one.
It's a phone game. There's a word you have to guess at every day. It's pretty simple and essentially a basic distraction.
it’s originally a new york times “game” they have a daily word and you have to guess it just google new york times wordle and you’ll see it. While it’s originally a new york times “game” like i said earlier there are downloadable games of wordle.
I have a gender therapist it's just a therapist who also has a specialty in gender studies. 

it's not like they have any less capabilities than other therapists but the one you just had doesn't sound like they had many capabilities
I tried distracting myself with conversations with myself in my head. It just got worse. I decided screw it this isn’t helping
Look gro psychiatrist, they can also help you if you need the hormones later. Plus more chances it’s get cover by the insurance.
I'm still baffled by this I would even reach out to the practice and file a complaint
But he had a phD in psychology from Switzerland. Didn't knew he was really bad and zero idea of what trans means
I hope you have better luck OP, I know it's not easy being in a conservative blackhole. It took a lot of blood sweat and tears to get out of where I came from to get real treatment.
I mean... the cure for being trans is.... transition, so....
Scientists have been hard at work trying to find the cure for being a boy and I am very interested in their research
Me too. It distracts, but I have suffered the consequences of it many, many times.
A pHD from WHERE?  There are plenty plenty plenty of religious based and backed educational institutions which likely wouldn’t be overly supportive of your situation.
Funny thing... there actually IS a cure for the hurt trans folks feel before transitioning... the cure is to actually transition\*. 

(\* in most cases. There may be exceptions to the rule.)
My place is super conservative so it's kinda hard to find one
If you want frustration, try Absurdle.
Not originally New York Times, they bought it for an obscene amount of money well after it got popular. Originally it was made by the guy who runs this website and that's also where it was hosted: [powerlanguage.co.uk](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/)
I don't want to be judgy, sweetheart, but in my experience most folks connected to a religion have tried to steer me to the straight and narrow...minded.
PhD means Phony Degree, DUH. All jokes aside it means jack sometimes since a PhD doesn't legitimize WHERE he got it from, the institution he got it from could've been just as narrow-minded and transphobic as he is. And it certainly doesn't teach compassion, forward thinking, and understanding.
Anything with Friar etc are compromised, they're religious ranks.
Switzerland is extremely conservative and happens to be quite transphobic.
my conversion therapist had a PhD.  nice guy, well meaning.  didn't have any real understanding of the world outside his own bubble.

lots of fields are really big... if someone doesn't specialize in a specific problem, they can be next to useless if called upon to deal with it.

e.g. i did electrical engineering degree.  i took \*one\* programming course, that i was allowed to pass only cos the instructor took pity on me (i used to sit in his office and he'd help me to do the programs cos i was so horribly lost).  But I was great with designing and building computer chips.  I somehow understood the deep physics intuitively.  But I couldn't do circuit design... just chip design.

So I could have worked in a fab lab and done well.  Anything else?  Nope, I was horrible.  My degree didn't mean I could do all E.E. things... just a very, very limited subset.

So, yeah, you would want to find someone who has studied gender issues and is expert in that particular part of psychology (although even then some of them still have the old Blanchardian garbage in their heads >.< )
I started art, archery and like two demanding clubs, like FRC robotics which I love. They are so trans friendly and it does distract well but the stress and deterioration isn’t worth it.
I've heard there is a service called pride counseling. They are a LGBT centric organisation of online therapists. It has been featured multiple times in Jammi Dodger videos he is a trans guy on YouTube who uses the service as well. But I don't have any personal experience with them myself.
I went to a therapist that said she worked with trans people but really she’d only worked with one trans person before me. She meant well I think and she wasn’t able to give me what I needed. 


There aren’t any LGBTQ therapists in my area so I understand the struggle. I ended up finding somebody good (a few hours away, geographically) who does virtual appointments. I found them through Boston Childrens hospitals GEMS program. Perhaps you could find your nearest healthcare institution that works with trans people and reach out to them for recommendations? Not sure if that helps, just an idea. Wishing you all the best.
Check out betterhelp.com
Check out some video therepy apps maby? Like better help, teleldoc, etc. 

My insurance provides free teledoc services, so I found an LGBT therepist through them. A lot of the actual therepists on there arnt even in my state. So finding someone shouldn't be hard. Also, there are open minded people everywhere even in the deep south, it's just harder to find those people in the south. You are not alone!
or for a challenge try [quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/).
Preach sister!
I'm mainly involved in robotics at my school, and its taken a bit out of me, but the club helped me grow as a person so I'm grateful for that
They get mixed reviews, it depends who you get matched with, but if nothing else you can specify you want a trans person as a counselor. They have to be better than this Friar.
Really depends who you get, I tried out pride counseling and got someone who told me at the end of the first session that my gender identity (non-binary) was definitely because of my relationship with my mother."	umyim0	trans	1336	0.97	2022-05-11 01:46:36
The owner of GayPrideShop UK, the largest LGBTQ+ store in the UK, told me to get used to being misgendered.	"This is a cross-post from r/transgenderuk
I've read the rules, but I'm not clear on the etiquette, so I'm sorry if I have not followed correctly. 

When i worked there from June - December, customers often misgendered me, but during halloween, when it was particularly busy, it happened a lot more. One guy looked me right in the eyes, and at the huge ""She/Her"" patch on my beanie and said ""see ya later fella"", which, obviously, made me feel disgusting. I told the owner of the store about this, and he said the exact words:

""you'd better get over it, because I make most of my money this time of year"".

He said that to me at the start of the first day of the Halloween rush, and I then, for three days, served most of the customers during the rush. Almost all of them misgendered me, and this period was awful for my mental health.

My first day off after those three days, I went to my GP and was prescribed anti-depressants. This was because of a mental health crisis I was having because of what the owner had said to me. 

In November, he -actually- misgendered me, in front of a customer, who then consequently misgendered me. He'd also make light of what had happened during halloween and would double down on what he'd said. 

They appear inclusive, because they include neopronouns, and they cover a lot of different identities. But from my experience with the two owners, any support they show for trans rights is just virtue signalling. 

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, this has sat with me for a while and I felt the need to say something."	"i feel that alot of ""lgbtq+ friendly"" companies are actually very queerphobic.
Unfortunately there is a surprisingly large amount of transphobia in the LGBTQ+ community from those who aren’t trans.
This is rainbow capitalism. Nothing about a business selling pride merch is liberators. I'm sorry you went through that OP
Well I straight-up would have told him that some people are going to need to get used to getting punched in the nose then
He wants money. I don't think he actually cares about advocating or misgendering.
I've heard of companies profiting off of pride before but an entire store DEDICATED to profiting off of pride without actually caring about LGBT people? Holy fuck.
Ugh. Where in the UK is the shop?
I swear to god this country is just the earth's butthole
I don’t support gays who don’t support me
Wtf :( I am soooo sorry to hear that.
Unfortunately alot of the ""support"" from companies regarding lgbtq+ is purely financially motivated. It's a shame they don't always care but atleast it's some progress, exposure can help normalise our culture but we still have a far way to go.
Only commenting because now they're mad so I want to get this post some karma boosting powers....
this.  this kind of shit is proof the pride flag and the term ""LGBT"" doesn't actually include transgender rights at all.
Fact is. Most people are too busy to care about anything other than their own ego….
All capitalists are bastards. They would sell out their communities for profit in a heartbeat. The “representation” they give us is just a ploy to squeeze more money out of the most exploited sections of the working class.
Terf island strikes again 😔
time to boycott
Well this is one shop to never give money to.

What really bothers me is that you mention *multiple* customers misgendering you. Why would there be any need to use gender specific terms at all? That seems malicious in intent to me.
Sorry that happened to you Estelle, I hope you’re in a much better place now.
that was brutal, they didn't even pull their punches they just went nuclear on you, like damn.
I would just misgender your boss and customers and ask them why they get mad
That’s so disheartening because they should know better. I’m sorry you went through this. Your employer doesn’t value you, they value profit. You need to work for a company that does values you, because you deserve it. Surround yourself with people who support your authentic self. It’s critical to do this when you’re trans or non-binary.
Being fair, and 100% playing devils advocate; sometimes you do just have to get used to it bc there will always be shitty people both above, below, and on the same level as you. It sucks for real, but focusing on it only hurts more.

Personally, I just decry them as dickheads who can’t be better.

Sorry about the abuse you faced, but thanks for the heads-up, I now know where *not* to shop!
You should post this to r/antiwork
like Disney they have been saying forever they are supporters then turn around and cancel all of Pixar's queer content and support the people behind the Don't Say Gay bill.
Their level of friendliness is directly correlated to how much money you have to spend with them.
That’s because companies don’t have beliefs, they aren’t people. They only have one interest: profit, and will seek this by any means necessary. “LGBT positive” companies are only using that label to commodify our community and cater to those who may be fooled by their aesthetic. The second we aren’t profitable anymore, they’ll go right back to hating us.
hannaford (a local supermarket chain) is genuinely really good though :)) im really happy they are actually super nice and just really kind..
YEP.

Capitalism is the enemy.
The bourgeois class will be liquidated someday, my trans brothers and sisters.
Despite what people say, violence sometimes IS the answer.
Odd how he did all that misgendering personally for free then

He's transphobic.
Based in Manchester, they ship globally.
Not just your country. There's a wrong way to be in every place you can go.
People in the UK tend to use gendered terms naturally, to my dismay 😅

I wore signage (sold by the store) constantly to try and get people to take a hint, the entire building is meant to be trans positive (there are signs saying ""no transphobia"" and a huge trans day of visibility mural) so I feel like it's fair to expect people to respect it.
What
Jesus Christ homegirl was just venting and warning us about this place. If you never feel shitty about this sort of thing then great for you, other people can use some support and that's perfectly OK too.
>That’s the reality of our choice.

What choice?
Choice? Just because your experience soured your outlook doesn't mean everybody has to be as jaded as you. If you need to talk, my DMs are open for all, but don't spread your misery and try bringing everyone down to how fucked up you feel inside. Jesus Christ.
sounds like someone could use some therapy and antidepressants. hope you get better soon!
Thats depressing me rn
walmart too!
I'm so fed up of these large media corporations that are just slightly ""technically not *too* big to be considered a monopoly"" limiting their creators, mainly when these limitations are because of bigotry...
In Maine? How trans-friendly is Maine in general, would you say?
Unfortunately for some people I am a scrapper more unfortunate for some people my brother is an insane person who loves to fight and will fight anyone who is transphobic. The older I get the less scrappy I've become but I will defend myself and more importantly anyone in the community. Sometimes some loud mouth transphobic jerk needs a nice jarring slap or a punch to the gut. Be safe out there everyone
Violence is never the answer!
Its the question, and the answer is always YES
it’s always a solution
The one if affleks? If so I'll avoid it and just use QueerLit
Based here in Manchester you say! Disgraceful. Have the owner come down to Wythenshawe, we'll show him a ""good time"" 😇

Side note if you're ever in need of a South Manchester friend just DM me and say hi, I myself don't know a lot of people from the community here! ^-^
That must be regional because I'm from UK and never used gendered terms to refer to people I didn't know since long before I knew about anything LGBT.
LMAO it's like tell me you have internalized transphobia without telling me you have internalized transphobia
uhhh no not maine but new england. idk abt maine but where i live is really nice honestly.
I feel this on a spiritual level.
Any time is go time, and these hands are rated E for Everyone! lol In all honesty I've lost a lot of my fight (physically) but I grew up in the ghetto so the savagery still remains if I ever need it.
It is that one yes, they actually have beef with QueerLit.
Dm me of you want a link to a Manchester based social group for 18-35 year old trans people! ^_^ it's a lovely group.
Ohh, I just looked it up and apparently hannaford’s exists outside of Maine lol. My bad. I’m in Mass and it seems pretty friendly, but I’m still scared shitless to come out tbh
All the more reason to support queer lit then!
Oh my days yes, I went there to ask about books that might help my parents get their heads round the trans of it all. They recommended the transgender issue and coming out stories, both of which my mum has now read and is helping my dad get used to gendering me correctly now 😊
Also, the staff there were lovely as it wasn't too busy so I got to have a proper good chat with the 3 people in that day. Love that place! Can't wait to move back to Manchester and get all my queer books from there 😁
I love Queer Lit! Such a genuinely nice business."	tjjrvh	trans	1331	0.99	2022-03-21 19:25:55
As I unpack my gender identity, it becomes less of a fetish	"For years I’ve had fetishes around forced feminization, crossdressing, and tights. As I’ve started to come to terms with my identity being genderfluid or non-binary, the sexual potency of those is diminishing.

Seems like the fetish was my way of expressing this repressed identity.  Now I’m just a maid boy out of habit...

Just thought I would share :-)"	"As soon as I came out to myself, I lost a lot of the 'fetish' part of it as well. Now I'm just working towards my transition.
Same here, at first I only thought it was a fetish but as I started to really question I no longer see it as a fetish, and sometimes can't even take it that way because it now brings the dysphoria tha has been exponentially increasing
Agreed. I only started 4 months ago to transition, but I now wear panties all the time with no fetish. It has normalized like it was meant to be. I have a long way to go, my wife made me agree to keep my beard for a year from starting hrt. It’s killing me though. But I think she needs time to process.
Erotically enjoying feminine clothing was my introduction to reconsidering my gender identity. I used to be hyper-aroused by even thinking of putting on tights or panties and now I’m wearing them around the house (and sometimes in public) while just feeling myself.
Chasing a fetish is absolutely what introduced me to the healthy trans community. As in, trans people (me) are more than just an embarrassing sexual obsession. 80s and 90s were a weird time to grow up non-cis.
The following blog post really helped. [Is it a fetish, Right? Maybe. Or Maybe it’s gender dysphoria.](https://medium.com/@kemenatan/its-just-a-fetish-right-91cb0a4e261)

After truly accepting that I am trans, that fetish feeling simply evaporated. I no longer have any desire for that kind of porn or behavior what so ever. It is quite a relief because I carried so much shame because of it.
It feels like a fetish because we're programmed for our identity cues, at first, by people who think of it as a fetish.  We're surrounded by brainwashing and misconceptions largely generated by people who jerk off in secret shame to the idea of us.  Of \*course\* it feels like a fetish, until you get past their programming.
It was the same with me. It was honestly a little jarring. When I finally came to terms with myself and started to live as myself. Almost all of my sexual fetishes and compulsions just evaporated.
I feel the same way! I only just recently came out, but the moment I did I felt the sexual energy I had around crossdressing and sissy stuff just kinda disappear. I’m not sure if it’ll stay like that though
This thread is dead on one of the most poignant and perfect description for a high percentage of us. 

I FEEL SO FREAKING VALIDATED!!!

Thank you Ash!
Very perceptive observation.
That's a very interesting observation! I am eternally fascinated by the workings of the human mind.
Yep. I started off thinking it was kink for a long time but quickly realised once I bit the bullet & delved into it that wasn't the case. After I came to terms with the fact that I am trans (like *the moment*, I'm sure you all know what I mean), the idea of those fetishes pretty much disappeared within a week, even ended up feeling revulsion towards them. Honestly I think they trigger dysphoria.

I don't miss it being erotic or whatever at all, I'm much happier with it just being non sexual and normal. It's comfortable this way.
Hear, hear.
Since coming out myself, I have pretty much stopped looking at all gender transformation content that I used to daily frequent. I instead get off by thinking about me becoming myself instead. So, I definitely agree with you there.
Its far from fetish now.  Sure helped get me off though.  Euphoria induced probably.  I need to express my femininity so i do and there aren’t any ideas of sex involved.  I just need it to be myself.  For years I thought it was fetish.  Crossdressing took over my life for a period of time. I went through a period of purging when I came into some money.  Oooooh boy!!! did I.  I started seeing a therapist 6 years ago. I went through a major depressive episode for about a year or so.  Back then it was just crossdressing with gender questioning tossed in.  

Seeing my therapist again now.  My egg smashed in September when I hit rock bottom again. My girl friend of 16 years called the relationship off.  I was  still depressed after I returned to work from my previous major episode. It effected our relationship.  2 days later after some serious introspection and connecting deeply to someone’s Reddit post. I came out to her.  I was unable to reconcile.  I was rejected again I felt. She already knew of my crossdressing. She let me do it and was fine it seemed even telling me I looked better than her sometimes. I figured she at least had the right to know what was going on with me emotionally.  So now I’m transitioning as of Nov25 last year.  

What an epiphany!!!  That’s why I say egg smashed instead of cracked.  Everything makes sense. Right from my earliest memories. I’m slow LOL 😝 and was always very shy. I’m 49 now.  It came down to me getting further and further away from an ideal the last 15 years. The more masculine I became and aged, especially in my 30s. The worse my dysphoria became.  It’s more than me thinking! I am a woman.  I am a woman!!!  Everything else didn’t fit!!!!

In retrospect it was never a fetish.  Just symptomatic of testosterone poisoning.
Same! I used to listen to some feminization content and while I was aroused by it, the arousal always “felt different” than other content. It wasn’t as much of I thought it was hot and more so being referred to as a girl felt natural and really good. Eventually started listening to content simply made for girls and felt really good about it, just as good as I did when I listened to boy content. 

Since coming to terms with myself as bigender, I have had no interest in feminization content. Which is good! I like being a boy and a girl, even outside of sexual situations.
This is a good post. I've always enjoyed porn with trans women but never really liked the fact so many of the posters title things like ""sissy boy"" or ""crossdresser"" because it's such obvious fetishization. It only occured to me recently why I had such a distaste for it.
Im dealing with this too. Im trying figure out how much of it is fetish and how much of it is how I genuinely feel about my gender. I remeber when I first started crossdressing, I wished it wasn't such an erotic experience because as soon as I had an orgasm the urge to wear dresses and skirts went away. Im not really sure how to interpret that. On the one hand, it seems my urge to look femme was atleast mostly sexual. But on the other hand, I didnt want to orgasm and lose that urge. 

That was several years ago, but I still feel a little bit of the urge fade post-orgasm. My dad is finally letting me dress fem around the house so I'm hoping to get more clarity on these feelings by being able to just dress up without it being sexualized. Of course part of that is also getting more casual outfits instead of lingerie and maid outfits 😅 

All of that said, I definitely still feel an erotic reaction to some materials like satin or latex. I dont see that changing even as I continue to explore my identity, and thats okay with me.
Got the nerve and I shaved my legs and under arms for the 1st time tonight. Feeling ANYTHING on my skin is bliss! Everybody should do it. It's so comfortable.... And it takes away some of the dysphoria.
Same, for almost a decade I did this.  Repression and bad coping mechanisms is a hell of a thing.
I got really into gender transformation comics about 10 years ago.  They were basically my outlet.  Just not into that stuff nearly as much anymore.  Or any pornography, really.  1 month in, and HRT nuked my sex drive.
This is actually explaining a lot for me right now. I've been going through periods of being relatively ok with my identity and being very ashamed of it and I've noticed that kind of thing happening.
U get fetishes? * laughs in ace*
I know this too much. Feminization and TG have been my fetish since I've discovered porn at age 15.

Guess it was just a way to manifest my gender dysphoria by the time. Now I've accepted that I'm a trans woman, it has become less and less of a fetish, and more and more of a dream that will eventually come true : being a woman.
Me too. I am in my 50's so in my younger years it just felt like a secret I dare not tell anyone. There were very few accepting messages in society. That kind of repression just builds pressure and causes a more extreme reaction.
Thank you for sharing this lily <3
Omg yes
This is kind of surprising to me, as this was not my experience at all. I was 7 years old when I knew I was trans, although I didn’t know there was a word for it. There was definitely no fetish attached to it. I wonder if trans men experience this?
Yeah that's also something I've noticed. I'm still into the things I were into before but it's not about me, it's not why I'm doing that, it's just my fantasies.
I did not actually  see it it until I just read your post but I totally agree with you.  Although  I still like the occasional dress up  and the euphoria it gives me,  excepting to myself that I'm a trans woman has dampened  the fetish part of all of it. I can see how that was a way to express myself while not being  out. I'm still not out to but a few people  so it is what is is. Love ya all. 😘
Same! I used to read TG comics all the time before I understood that I was trans, but now I haven’t had the desire to visit the site in months. And when I did out of habit, it couldn’t even get through one comic before I was bored. It’s so strange!
It’s the same for me. I kept going back to the porn because it spoke to me on a deep level. Now I recognize that I am non-binary myself and the only attraction the ideas have is someone could find me attractive because of my feminine side.
I mean, the fetish stuff partially helped crack my egg, sort of. I realized I was going in that direction, forced feminization porn and the like, but I didn't really want to, I just wanted to be me.
Honestly I think I'm weird. I identify as non binary but still sorta fetishize myself? Like I get aroused by myself feeling sexy when I present as feminine.
Yuuuup. This for sure.. lol
Still like forced femme, just from the other direction~
I get that..I do
Right! 🏳️‍⚧️
Agree with this 1000%. The fetish of wearing women’s intimates was my way of expressing who I really was. I guess it took til now for me to break free and start living my truth. Thank you for posting this. It helps to know I was t the only one feeling this way!! 💕💕

🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️Veronica🌸🌸
Same, though it might just be hormones killing my libido
Oh no. This post and the comments hit so close to home. It's validating and terrifying. Thanks =)
Never had the corage to say it before, but same.
I bought some panties to wear every day. I finally bought the size I need instead of wanting me be more small and petite than I am lol. They’re so comfortable and it kind of gives me a constant feminine charge. Years ago that was too scary, or I would have needed some justification, but now I give myself permission
It isn’t really about what she needs... she needs to respect your body autonomy. Imagine if you told someone they couldn’t treat any other condition for a year because you weren’t ready for them to? It’s preposterous and abusive. I hope you can do what you need to for YOU.
hey, I’m really glad you’ve been able to start transitioning, that’s awesome. It sounds like keeping your facial hair is causing a lot of dysphoria though. 

Whatever processing your wife needs to do can happen with or without seeing your facial hair — she can go see a therapist or talk to friends or journal or whatever — but you say that keeping the hair is killing you, and that seems much more pressing and important than an arbitrary time stamp on when you’re allowed to shave. 

Just my unsolicited 2 cents. Either way, congrats on taking steps to feel more like yourself — I’m rooting for you!
My girlfriend told me the same thing, but after explaining how much her decision was affecting me, she told me I could shave once a week as a “compromise”, but even that was causing far too much dysphoria. I decided that she can’t dictate my body or my appearance, as my dysphoria was far stronger than any discomfort she was feeling. My girlfriend (now ex) refused to even try to understand and wouldn’t read any articles I’d send to her on the subject that could explain it better than I could. Hopefully your wife isn’t the same! You can’t compromise on your mental health
The partners in the relationship that are affected by those of us that come as trans DO need time to process. They DON'T get a say in our bodies. I respect that you are considerate, but you are who you and she (your wife) doesn't get a say so. 

I'm going through this exact situation right now. 4-5 months in on HRT/GAHT and 6 months since I came out to my wife of 6 years. It was a horrible experience coming out to her just in the telling her part, but I didn't hold back anything and the next day while she was at work and my day off. I shaved my beard and all my body hair. I texted her and let her know the beard was gone. 
She got home and it was another horrible night. She has not given up saying she misses my facial hair. She has not given saying she's sad she's losing her husband, but that's on her at this point. 
It is difficult seeing her pain, but holy cow I feel so much better when I look in the mirror after my daily face shave. 
Sorry for the dump of info here, but I hope you find the courage to shave. It will be a relief.
Nah fuck that. Shave that shit. She won't ever finish processing if she isn't confronted with changes. That way she can process what's happening rather than just fearing change.
You need to give her an ultimatum. Either she has a partner without a beard or she has no partner.  This controlling shit is toxic as fuck....
No one has any right reason or baring over what you can do with and to your body 

If it’s not an immediate threat to them they can stfu 

Be you love you fuck what others think
I kind of miss the erotic thrill though lol
I used to say I was a tomboy in a boy’s body.  Wish I had known about being non-binary when I was 21 in 2002!
The 80s and 90s were a bad time for some of us. I was unmercifully teased any time I acted girly. I was bullied ruthlessly in middle school. I started my gender identity crisis last fall because I was so repressed it took being at the edge of suicide to start unburying my true self.
Yup, that's exactly what happened with me too. I thought I was fetishizing trans people, turns out I was just really envious.
This article spoke to me honestly. I still have some arousal from time to time I'm pre hrt and post self love the dysphoria tends to hit hard about an hour or so later but unlike my teen years the desire to transition doesn't fade at all.
Same for me. It was like flipping a switch overnight.
I wanted to comment this but didn’t have the link. Helped me before.
I used to fantasize about having sex dressed as a woman, and now I just want to be a woman.... not saying I’ll pass on the sex though lol
Yeah I had a lot pf fun with those, hopefully I can find new ways to enjoy feminine kink, other than being “forced” to be a girl because I’m too small and weak to be a “real man”
[removed]
""Testosterone poisoning""

Damn. That's soooo perfect of a description.
I think I’m bigender too :-)
Same. The degradation angle is pretty misogynistic. You can explore that without making it some big shame thing, that reflects badly on how you’re probably looking at women, trans women and femme nb people ngl.
See I always loved the “boy in a dress” and I think that’s me being non-binary
Yes!!! Love that feeling against any clothes- pantyhose, jeans, anything
Oh ya doesn’t it!!!  It’s great though.  I can actually focus on my feelings now.  So clear
Me and shame go waaaaaay back!
Wished I’d come to that conclusion younger. I’m 49 last month.  Just started HRT last November.
I’m 39. Back then I was terrified to do anything feminine because everyone would “know”
100% this, my condition has and never will be a fetish and hearing it is for people is sickening.
It’s like all of that part of you only had one outlet.... but once you allow it to be more than a kink... boy things change!
I'm the opposite. I still read TG comics... Well, story driven ones, anyways... When a character identifies as trans, it can hit in the feels in ways that I didnt know were possible before I came to grips with who I am.
That’s the testosterone doing it’s thing. After a while that goes away slowly and you just need to express yourself. Then after I started HRT I just need to be en femme as much as possible to feel normal and better about myself.  Not presenting female outside on a regular basis but I’ve been to my friends house a few times with her kids.(4 of them all excepting).  Euphoria inducing. We talk and talk girl stuff.  I feel validated every time.
Could be both!
Same, though t might just beest hormones killing mine own libido

I'm not there yet... I dread looking like a ""man in a dress"" or close to it so I'm kinda stuck since my body looks like a man. In my case the biggest need is for my body to look female since one of the biggest envy i feel from girls is that they can wear anything and still look feminine
Yes! This! I found the exact same experience recently.

Used to be that. I was mortified to even be seen near a women's section for clothing...

Just yesterday, for the first time, I walked into Walmart, straight to the women's section... Then browsed and selected myself some new panties! Ones that actually fit. It's a small thing, but a HUGE milestone for me! It was just a generic 10 pk of briefs too. 

I gave myself permission. I told myself ""I'm a woman. Women buy these things. You belong here in the women's section."" now it's not so scary!
My ex of 16 years new I was in a depressed state for a long time. It effected the relationship. She called it off in September. I came out to her 2 days later.  No reconciliation.  Realized later that she’s really not the unconditionally loving woman I was looking for.  Told her even if she was to come around, it’s too late. I don’t want to go back.  She was a violent alcoholic too. I stayed with her, loving her in a detached state understanding it to be a sickness.  My issues arise and she effectively bails on me. Sorry can’t do it anymore.  She was ok when it was understood to be just crossdressing. Coming out pretty much made up her mind about not getting back together. She’s too sensitive to what others think. Im 49.  She’s 51. F sakes. I get it, but grow up a little.  She was emotionally immature in some ways.  I really think it just came down to she’s straight as an arrow.  Can’t take that away from her. I can understand that.  She still says she really loves me and I do her but it like a Shakespeare novel playing out. The drama continues. Not stopping HRT ever!!  It’s about me now
I didn't give mine a choice in the matter, just went ahead and did it. The body hair removal piece happened while I was still questioning myself, and I didn't want to tell her unless I was sure myself, but she was freaked out. When she found my foundation, after coming home from visiting her mom, I told her what was up. 

She tried to be supportive, but had her own unresolved issues, and the fact that, after my egg cracked, I dropped the facade nearly entirely, she felt like she was living with a completely different person. 

At the time, she said she was fine with the changes, and wanted to be there for me, but asked that I not shave my arms. I didn't have dysphoria about them, and so I was like, sure... but then, when we'd be going to bed she started *stroking my arm hair* in an incredibly possessive way. That creeped me out completely, and ultimately drove me to sleep on the couch. 

When we separated 6 months later, the arm hair was first to go. (That turned out far better than I thought it'd be, because by that time I was on HT and it grew back all blonde and thin.)
[deleted]
I totally agree with that.  Humans are very adaptable given the circumstance.  One thing at a time though is easier. A lot at a time can be devastating
Me too. But this new life as trans thrill is like a 1000% better!
“I’m a lesbian trapped in a man’s body.” Hahahahaha isn’t that so funny?


... I was surprisingly dense (repressed) about a lot of things.
It took me to hit rock bottom after my girlfriend of 16 years ended the relationship. Depression symptoms for the 10 years effected the relationship. I came out to her 2 days after she broke it off.  She knew of my crossdressing before and it was ok but this was too much.
I was too. Always wished I could just do it too!!  Never knew why.
Dammit Ash. You keep cracking me up on this thread! Lol
I was lucky. When it was thought to be just cross dressing at the time.  It made are she lives much more interesting. I remember the the first time too.  It was so euphoric. I get aroused just thinking about it.  Now she’s gone. We’ve split. My dysphoria induced depression effect our relationship along with her violent alcoholism.  If she had accepted me when I came out there would of been a chance of reconciling but she hasn’t.  I don’t want to go back though either.  I want to experiment now that I’m single again. I’m far from feminine presentation right yet, too early.  I’m on HRT as of November 25
No doubt. You earned your paycheck today. Lol
Ya. I though so too when I seen it.  I have a pic I saved with a young woman with before and after photos.  She’s beautiful!  Shes wearing a  black T shirt in the after photo. Plastered in huge white bold block letters across the front. 

“I SURVIVED TESTOSTERONE POISONING”.

Had to save that one.  Hope to be there soon too!!
Same here.
Thanks for sharing your experience.
I feel that :) I guess most of the comics I was seeing didn’t have much in terms of story and were more about gratuitous sex. Stories can still have an impact now for me, but they have to be well written, whereas before, the TG element was usually enough for me to read and enjoy them.
bad bot
I feel you. Years ago I slipped into a dress and was horrified by my manly arms and their farmer’s tan. Felt like I was embarrassed at being silly and wearing a dress, but now I know if was gender dysphoria because the person in the mirror wasn’t femme
I feel great wearing women's clothing until I look in the mirror. It helps if you can isolate what you can work on now to alleviate some dysphoria. You'll gradually start seeing yourself in a different way. Just start taking small steps and do what you're comfortable with. 

I started shaving my facial/body hair and taking finasteride/growing my hair out as soon as I accepted I was trans. Losing weight is another goal I'm working towards. These things don't make me ""feel like a woman"" on their own, but they're pieces of the puzzle. Seeing yourself daily with those changes makes a huge psychological difference. (Depending on how masculine you are.)
Yeah. My wife says she isn't attracted to women, she is ""not a lesbian"" she says. So as I progress and dress and express my womanhood, she becomes more distant and more unhappy. I understand.  I would feel the same if she came out as a man. I am not attracted to any masculinity.  Some partners realize that they are more pansexual when this situation arises, some don't.  I had hoped to get a better response. But I am not willing to sacrifice anymore of my sanity (suicidal thoughts were abundant) to make sure another person likes what they see.
Me when listening to girl in red lol.
I mean, that was Eddie Izzard’s standard line for years and years...
So true!!!

Hearing you saying that the reaction is dysphoria eases me a lot. I was always afraid it was somr kind of sign that I wasn't trans
I'm not actually that masculine, i have had very lomg hair for years but also had a beard. My first euphoria moment was when I shaved it and put on a very oversized shirt i had for some reason that almost looks like a dress and I could see a girl in the mirror. However since then I've become more and more aware of my masculine traits and it's getting harder and harder to see the girl each day. However I can't sleep without being in that oversized shirt and even with all those traits appearing, putting it on and looking more feminine calms me down and relievs me, but I can no loger recreate the euphoria episode. But I'm afraid to go further and see something I'll regret, but at the same time I can feel my dysphoria getting worse by the day. Each day there is a new dysphoric part of me that wasn't dysphoric before and it's progressing fast. I feel stuck where I'm afraid to move but also afraid to stay put
Relate 100%
I love this comment, it's so true
For me, I think it was because I expected to see a girl or a femme boi, and I saw “a dude in a dress.” But we always look worse to ourselves than anyone else
Are you me? Jk I felt exactly the way you describe. I've been trying to go one step at a time and there's always something I love about myself, and something that causes immense dysphoria.
Wow. You keep nailing down all the feelings I've felt over the years...
It’s so gratifying to hear that and be able to share with people who have had similar experiences!"	mo3fie	trans	1238	0.96	2021-04-10 12:03:29
I hate when people use the word ‘transmasc’ to refer to trans men.	"When it comes to other people talking about trans men, I’ve noticed they call us ‘trans masc’. I’m not sure if it’s just me but it seems… weird. It seems like they’re avoiding calling us men for some reason, even though we are men.

Trans masc is an umbrella term for people who are trans and well… masculine. This is fine when trans people want to be referred to as Trans Masc or if you don’t know someone’s identity. 

I just find it uncomfortable to be called trans masc when I’ve stated I am a guy, a man. It feels dismissive of my identity. 

Does anyone else feel this way?

EDIT: I feel like people are misunderstanding me and thinking I hate the term ‘transmasc’. I don’t. I just dislike when it’s used towards trans men AS INDIVIDUALS, who stated they are men. As a trans man, it feels dismissive of my identity to be called masc instead of a man. 

EDIT: I wanna clarify that I do not want to exclude NB people from Trans Masc spaces or communities, I apologise if anyone felt like I was"	"I think it was essentially started to being used as a more inclusive all around catch up term (vice versa with transfemme) for non-binary folks.

Personally I feel the same way, if someone would use (transfemme) for me, not necessarily just for the same reasoning you have stated, but also because I feel like it would put me into this spectrum, of ""needing to be femme/feminine, because I'm a trans woman"" (or masculine for trans men), which obviously quickly can go into the territory of needing to uphold the gender roles. 

As an umbrella term for certain identities I don't mind it at all obviously, just am not comfortable, if someone tries to put me into that box/category.
i dont mind it as an umbrella term but i hate when its used for me personally
*I* am transmasc because I transitioned from a girl to a more masculine self, identifying as transmasc agender.

If someone states they are a trans man, they are a trans man. Fuck it, if they state they are a man, *then they are a man.* No questions, no versatility. It is what it is.
I prefer transfemme, as an mtf transition. I feel like it's more inclusive to nonbinary individuals and such, but also it's just a more comfortable term for me.
I actually like it being used for me even though I'm a binary trans man. I also feel like it is more inclusive towards masculine non-binary people who don't like trans man. But I also understand why many trans men don't like it.

It's the opposite for me. I hate being called a trans man because I'm nonbinary, not a man. Trans masc is okay, but I don't really use it beyond explaining medical and body stuff (also because I don't exactly fit the word masculine lmao). 

I do get where you're coming from, though. The way I do it is, when I know I'm talking to one or several binary trans men, I just use trans men. When I'm talking about something including afab gnc or nonbinary people, I use trans masc.
Here's my thing. My son is FTM. If I come into a subreddit like this and start talking about my son, if I don't have a quick clarification I feel like I could come across more bigoted than I am. So I use quick terms like afab or transmasc so I can set a point of relation. In meat space he's only ever referred to as a young man, he/him, etc. I don't know how to resolve this and I hate doing it because you're right, he's a young man.
I feel very similar about it. The reasons are multiple. 
For one, like you, I want to be referred to as a man, but there is also the aspect that I think it doesn't even apply to all people transitioning to the male end of the spectrum. 
Feminine trans men are a thing, or trans men who were always masculine and don't transition into masculinity but just go through male puberty to look more like adult men. 

When I read ""transmasc"" I tend to read it as masculine aligned NB trans person. 
Personally, I don't really feel included in that term.
Kind of agree. I don’t really care I just prefer to be called a man
I find it weird because it seems to me to reinforce a binary onto non binary people? I mean obviously it's different when people use these terms to describe themselves and their own community but when cis people describe all trans people as either trans masc or trans fem depending on what they were assigned at birth it makes me incredibly uncomfortable.

I also relate to something I've seen discussed before about this association between masculinity and man-hood. I am a trans man but I wouldn't describe myself as trans masculine, neither my man-hood nor my transness must be informed by my masculinity or lack thereof.

I don't outright reject all forms of masculinity for myself but I have seen non binary trans men avidly reject being called trans masculine for this reason, and I agree with not wanting that label on myself.
All trans men are trans masc not all trans mascs are men. its a term which encompass both binary trans men and masculine non binary people.
I understand how you feel! It’s important to make distinctions where they matter. I don’t think you’re being unreasonable, people should be called what they want to be called.
Not all trans masculine people are trans men. There are trans men tho (like me)
For me transmasc is much more comfortable than FtM, and as such I refer to myself by it, it’s also inclusive for masc enbys. Which I enjoy.

Expanding on why I don’t like FtM: 

one: being called female is dysphoric. 

two: it equates me with women. i am not a woman. 

three: i have always been male and don’t fancy misgendering myself every time i explain who i am.

four: it’s just an ugly word.

I understand if other men like it though, including you OP. This is not an attack. 

If this was worded badly then please tell me, been having a hard time thinking lately and this probably comes through in my text.
One that I hate is ""transman"" or ""transwoman"" cause not only is it a TERF dogwhistle but also it kinda emphasises that trans men and women aren't real men and women. I'd much rather be referred to as a woman that happens to be trans and not revolve my entire existence around it, y'know?
Transmasc includes nonbinary people, that's why I use it when I talk about well... transmasc people in general. It's not the same as trans men.
Plus it’s like they’re saying we have to be masculine but I’m trans male and a femboy
I don't really mind people referring to transmascs as a group with myself included, even though I am a trans man. I personally use it that way often, but I'd never call a trans man a transmasc, and I wouldn't appreciate someone doing it to me. I just see it as a more inclusive term, and I definitely prefer it over afab. Though to be fair, not every afab trans person is transmasculine, so you just need to be aware of who you're trying to refer to. 
I get where you're coming from and I might agree in certain situations where it's clear that non of us are nonbinary, but over all I don't see it as a problem.
I understand what you mean. Its basically a categorical thing that people get mixed up sometimes with their language. Trans men are men and fall under the ""transmasc"" umbrella along with Masc AFAB NBs. Same goes for the ""transfem"" umbrella. Often times people use the more general categorical terms to cast a wider net about who they are talking about but fall into to much of a habit and slip up when using the term to refer to a specific person. Ive never seen any ill will behind it, its just a time to say, 

""hey I prefer the more specific term ""man"" when I'm personally being referred to."" 

""Oh sorry about that, man! I wasnt paying close attention to my vocabulary."" 

""Its okay now! :)""
Trans Masc and Trans Femme are used as inclusive terms for trans men and non-binary people and trans women and non-binary people, but I do understand. If the label doesn't work for you, don't use it and correct people--I do, cause I might be a trans woman but I am far from femme in dress and attitude.
Ur first point about not calling us men being very sus is great, and I totally agree. Glad someone brought this up
Trans masc includes trans men and masc leaning non-binary people. They're not just refering to trans men.
I personally do not see an issue with it. I am great friends with a transman who uses this all the time and even I use transfem all the time. It's meant to be more open of a term because non-binary people, such as myself sometimes will orient masculine or feminine. 

While I do think the terms are of personal preference, I, at least, don't see much wrong with it.
It's easier to do quick classification when not knowing their preferred identity, I agree.

Transmasc, transfem, I feel like you're overthinking it. The first exposure to transgender for me is actually from HRT community. So it's only make sense for me to differentiate in such way.

I don't know about others, but I feel like it's more comfortable than saying AMAB AFAB. Like not reminding them how unfair things were.
i use it for myself, and i use it for anyone i know that’s masculine presenting and under the trans umbrella. its not perfect but i don’t think theres a better term, because id rather not call a nb person a man by accident, and transmasc includes anyone on the masculine side of the gender identity spectrum
I say trans masc and trans men bc that covers the load, but then again I don't mind being called trans masc.
I don’t mind either way but I understand your frustration.
same, im mtf though n sometimes i want to present as masc
Oh wow I didn’t know people could feel this way. I’m going to have to get more specific with how I refer to people. I think what you’re saying makes sense OP, and it’s not hard to just clarify with the person on how they want to be referred to.
I embrace being part of the trans community but need not place ""trans"" in front of my I am Woman.100%
Personally I find it easier to say I'm trans femme but that might just be me...
""When it comes to other people talking about trans men, I’ve noticed they call us ‘trans masc’. I’m not sure if it’s just me but it seems… weird. It seems like they’re avoiding calling us men for some reason, even though we are men.""  
Your feelings are 100% valid, but I don't fully understand why specifying trans masc. Transfem is the exact same but for trans women. Transgender + Masculine/Feminine = Trans Masc/Femme for short  
To call you trans masc is to say you are transgender, and masculine, as in referring to a man directly.   
If you could explain how this doesn't appeal to you I would love to have more insight
Well that term, like the sister term transfemme, has its uses in narrow contexts where the transness of the individual is important or relevant.

In most other contexts it shouldn't be used, just call trans guys men. But it has its use.
Same with trans femme. If you call me that, all you are implying is, that I am not a woman. Don't do that.
I get you. I'm non-binary and I feel similarly about people only ever referring to me by my name instead of using pronouns. There's nothing inherently wrong with my name being used but I can tell they're just trying to avoid using they/them pronouns.

It can be really difficult to tell people's intentions on these things but there are a lot of people who split hairs to try and ""compromise"" on our identities. And then when you bring it up it sounds like *you're* the one splitting hairs. It honestly feels like a form of gaslighting
I can totally get that. Nobody, cis or trans, is purely masculine or purely feminine anyway so simply identifying masculinity, while important, might be erasing the whole person. I can imagine from my perspective, and while there would certainly be worse things to be called, I just want to be called a woman. 

Thanks for posting, I haven't referred to anyone as transmasc, but I will definitely avoid it in the future unless someone specifically identifies that way.
It's an umbrella term, I do know one trans man who isn't entirely ok with it. As he's a Femboy (self given definition)

I use Trans man, or really best thing I ask them what they'd rather be referred to as. Most say men. So that's all I need to know to just call them men.
When I read these terms I always think 'Moving away from their assigned gender, towards masculinity/ femininity.' And yeah, non-binary people and binary trans people encounter the same struggles when moving in a similar direction. Where to get clothes, the effect of hormones, etc. So there the terms should be helpful to find people to exchange experiences with.

But the goals are different, and many non-binaries wouldn't identify as masc or femme, since they might be elsewhere entirely on the gender spectrum. And using the terms masc or femme for men or women seems kinda unneccesary (and kinda inaccurate... not every woman is femme, etc.)

So, in conclusion, I would say these terms might be helpful to self-identify to find other people with similar experiences, but they don't work when you try to decribe others with them.
For whatever reason when people say trans masc I think of Little Mac (masc sorta sounds like Mac) from Punchout lmao -august
I think it’s pretty much understood that transmasc refers to trans nb ppl
Yes, it could be considered rude when refering to you specifically, so remember to call out if you feel uncomfortable.

It’s really the reverse of the MTF/FTM problem.

Inclusivity vs specifics.
I totally get this, if you’re a binary dude like….you’re just a guy, masc is part of it but it’s not the same as being a man. Personally I like transmasc bc i’m nonbinary and it feels less limiting to me but i absolutely get what you mean, stay strong dude! 💙💕🤍
It’s a good umbrella term for masculine non-binary people or masc trans people generally however it’s not good on the individual level as it’s like reducing someone to their demeanor “you’re trans masculine not a trans man because you’re MASCuline” is how it comes across to me sometimes
That just seems like a personal preference of yours, really. I don't mind it at all, i think it's an umbrella term that includes trans men. Maybe specify you don't like being referred to as such?
I'll refrain from that habit 💗 I've definitely seen a horrible wave of hate against men inside the queer community for a long time now, an end should be put to this.
I get that it exists so that people can acknowledge a broader group when speaking about someone, but just like I don't want people coming up to me and ASKING if I'm trans, I don't want them making general assumptions either to be ""politically correct"".

If you state you're a man, then you are and no one should be making assumptions that necessitate them using the term 'transmasc'.

However, if YOU decide to use the term to describe an aesthetic, that feels different.

What do you think?

I often find I use the term myself not because I WANT to, but because when talking to other queer folx and they see I have a beard while being AMAB, they get confused about me being enby... So I know I tend to use it more to make others feel better at the detriment to myself.
I'm headed the opposite direction and don't know if I'm an enby or a woman, I use transfem because of that. I use transmasc as an umbrella because that's easier and I don't know what someone else's identity is.

That being said if someone tells you they identify as a thing, you call them that thing. Anything else is kinda crappy.
ill use trans masc sometimes, but like, ill normaly introduce myself as a guy, and thats a lot less words
It's frustrating that you made a vent post and half the comments seem like they're trying to argue that your feelings aren't valid. Thank you for sharing your perspective, I personally will try to learn from it.
I get that. It makes sense for non binary people to use it, but trans men and trans women works just as well for us binary folks.
We call trans women transfem trans masc is an umbrella term including masculine nonbinary people. However if the term makes you uncomfortable or dysphoric that’s totally valid as long as you understand that it’s not being used to harm purposely
I see this as confusion between descriptors and identity. Yes, someone can identify, or not, with a descriptor but that doesn't change the description.

For example, I've seen people who don't want to identify as trans but are a gender different than their birth gender. Or, a afab girl that identifies as trans. I'm not here to gatekeep anyone's identity, but trans and cis as descriptors aren't avoidable.
I'm a pretty damned binary trans guy and it does not bother me, because I think binary trans men fall under the umbrella term transmasculine, as do a variety of other people.

Like: if I were a blue whale, or a sperm whale, but someone talked about 'whales', I'd not feel excluded, or if someone talked about the experience of 'people writing books' instead of specifically addressing me as a technical writer, I'd not hate that either. They're just referring to a larger group and not to my 'kind' alone.

It would be different if someone were addressing me personally, but I don't think that's what you're referring to. Someone would have to be pretty in the know about both transgender issues and the way in which I personally identify - there are maybe half a dozen people who meet both criteria, and those are my closest peeps.
I get you, quite simply: man is man.
I only use transmasc when talking about all afab masculine people. I identify as transmasc but people think that means I’m just trans. Gender isn’t really my thing but I am connected to masculinity so I identify as transmasc. I use trans guy/man when talking about one person (if that’s how they identifies) but I use transmasc when talking about many people just to be more inclusive
I'm equally comfortable being referred to as a trans man or transmasc person, but I'm also equally comfortable with he and they pronouns.

I think it's a mistake to assume that any trans man would or should be comfortable with being referred to as transmasc - if you're talking to/about an individual man, call him a man. Similarly, if I want to talk about trans men and transmasculine people, I say ""trans men and transmasculine people."" Transmasc isn't a noun any more than trans is a noun. Most trans folks would object to being called ""a trans,"" so why on earth would you think it's okay to call someone ""a transmasc""?
I've been seeing a whole lot of posts from and about trans men recently.... was there a specific event that happened recently against trans men? Or is it just that yall are just finally getting fed up with the general fact that a lot of trans women here on this sub disrespect you and your struggles, or sometimes don't acknowledge you in the community?

I'll admit, i don't do enough to fight for trans men, but i always try to get people to stop when i see them disrespecting yall.
2 of the only people in my life who legitimately supported me when i came out as trans, are my cousin and my... half step brother (half brother to my step sisters). Both of whom are trans men and are freaking awesome people!
Ya know.
I hadn't really thought about that.

I sorta fell into the transmasc and transfem titles as if it was akin to a shorthand. (Though I know... It's... Not shorter or anything. Just lack of better way to explain it right now.) 

But our trans brothers are absolutely awesome, and I swear stronger than I could have dreamt to ever be personally. Nothing but respect and I love hearing from you guys because it gives me whole new perspectives on things sometimes.
I myself am a trans man. The thing is, I use the term “trans masc” or “trans masculine” because I’m nonbinary. I say I’m a trans masc enby. I don’t want to say “trans man” because I am not a man, not completely. 

I really hope this doesn’t come off as rude. I am glad that you brought this up OP
I totally see your point. Before I realized I’m nonbinary, I felt the same way. But now that I’ve realized I’m nonbinary, I prefer to present more masculine and prefer to use/be called transmasc. It’s all about preference, and not using it is yours.
I mean the point of being trans is just you are actively becoming another gender. So if someone is a trans man. They just are a man now. Least how I see it... A lot of these labels I always feel over complicate things...

I feel like calling people trans in general seems odd. Trans is not a gender. It is just a state of currently trying to change so you feel more comfortable.

I guess it became more defining when non-binary stuff and enby and all that came about more? But we have terms for those... So it makes it seem odd we use the term trans as a defining trait at all I guess... 

Like the point is the person is trans because they want to be seen as a man or woman. So call them a man or woman— maybe that's just me. Ugh labels are troublesome though. I know they help plenty of people.think I just dislike them from having so many swung around in a negative way.
Yeah... I don't appreciate being referred to as transmasc - because at one point long ago when i was  still figuring myself out on the gender spectrum, i *identified* as ""transmasculine"", but not as a ""transman"" or ""transmale"" yet.

To me there is a difference and i would appreciate being referred to as my chosen identity. 💚🙏 I identify as a transman/transmale, or just male if u wanna be super simple. 😘

Plus, not all transmen are masculine! =O It feels kinda like we are leaving them out if we just refer to most transmen as transmasc, doesn't it? =\
as a non-binary person, i like being called “transmasc”—*because* i’m non-binary and am not a man. i can definitely see why you’d be uncomfortable being referred to as “transmasc” instead of “male”. it kind of feels a little like when people specify “afab enbies”, as if there’s some fundamental difference between afab and amab non-binary people. like, the word to describe *you, specifically* should be “man”.
I know exactly what you mean. For me, I don’t typically blame any particular term (with the exception “females.” If you say “females” and don’t have a very specific reason for choosing that word, I assume you’re deliberately trying to exclude trans women).

But this, to me, is just a manifestation of avoiding doing the work. This type of language comes from the people in my life who think that changing my pronouns is a matter of memorizing new words and not changing the way they see me when they look at me.

So to answer your original question, I don’t take issue with that term (or trans fem, in my case), but I do know exactly the sentiment you’re talking about and I take issue with that in all of its forms.
I totally see where you’re coming from.

Yesterday, I attending an event called Transgender Day of Remembrance, commemorating all of the trans lives that have been lost due to transphobia.

And someone presented themselves as “transmasc”

I’ve personally never been called this by someone, but I can imagine the number of feelings a trans person can feel.

As you said, trans masc IS an umbrella term.

TRANS PEOPLE in General, are all different in their own beautiful way.

Some of us are fully masculine & others of us are both feminine and masculine.. 

Some are even right smack dab in the middle

Where I’m going with this is, it all comes down to what people feel is best comforting to describing their identity.


I really don’t think people mean harm in when they refer to somone as trans masc
I’m transmasc non binary but I see where you’re coming from. I would rather be identified as a trans man or hell even a man if someone where to miss identify me more than anything else. I think it boils down to personal preference though, and I see what you mean about feeling like it diminishes everything you’ve gone through just to feel like yourself.
I understand what you're saying. I being a binary trans person myself can feel like sometimes inclusive language sort of alienates my identity. So if somebody referred to me as transfem instead of a woman it kind of makes me feel like that and validates my identity as a woman because I don't identify as non-binary. I am entirely understand where you're coming from. For the record I would never want to exclude non-binary people so this is more my hangup than anyone else's.
Counterpoint: I’m definitely not “a man,” but I consider myself masc. 

Trans men are men and deserve to be referred to as such. That said, not every AFAB person on the trans spectrum pulled the full 180 to “I’m a man.”
I dont hate it, but I do feel uncomfortable (I made a post like this in r/ftm before).
To me I feel like being called transmasc erases my manhood, which is something everyone does to me at this stage of my transition. Plus I used to identify as NB and thought I was transmasc, but then I realized I'm just a man, so to me being called transmasc feels like a step back, back to something I am not.

Edit: because I feel like maybe an alternative might be wanted... maybe ftm/n, male/masc trans, transmen/nb, transmale-masc, t-male/masc, afab people, T-deficient, E2T (estrogen to testosterone), men/nb in the context of being trans related (just ideas)
If you’re a guy, just say you are a guy. However there are a lot of non-binary individuals who do not completely identify as male but as they/them. If someone uses they, them pronouns and lean toward masculinity in someway or another, they would be presenting as trans masc. If you’re a guy, you’re a guy. Just be you.
Yea I very strongly refer to myself as a man (hence my flair lol) and not transmasc. I really don't like the label personally because it doesn't encapture my journey. I'm more than just trans masculine. I'm a man.

But the term does exist for some people for a reason and that's totally cool too.
I understand your point of view because I would assume it would feel kinda invalidating being a trans man and getting called transmasc when transmasc people usually don't align with being a man
I think I know what's going on with this in particular because all of this discourse has led me to question my own attitudes..  A lot of transwomen, before they come out, sometimes before they even know they're transgender, see the way women get mistreated by some men and, knowing that it's going to happen to them in many ways, kind of psychologically divest themselves from men and maleness.  I think it's part of the reason why you get super-femininity in many new transwomen.  We don't want to be part of the problem so we overcorrect and start thinking in terms of maleness itself being the problem just because it's something we don't like in ourselves.  There's sloppiness and laziness in that thinking, not to mention self-centeredness.  I'm still not a fan of toxic masculinity but i'm glad all of this is being called out because it makes me realized that i've played too fast and loose in to what I'm criticizing.  


It's also related to the fact that white transwomen get exposed to white feminism before they do other forms of feminism, and they take on many of the flaws present in white feminism, including the use of language about hating all men.
I’m sorry if it was something I said in another post that made a lot of people unhappy, I used the term trans masc pretty much exclusively, I was doing so to include people who are trans and identify as masculine but not exclusively male, but again I’m sorry if that was a cause, I’m working learning as much as I can about the trans community so I can better understand their wants and needs so I can I turn be a better human being
Now that you've mentioned it, yeah I can definitely understand that and kind off feel the same.
I was gonna say “trans men” for a post but decided to use trans masc instead cause I thought for men’s day some NB masc people might wanna be included as well. But I’ll call a trans man, well, a trans man
The same could be said about transfemme. People should be addressed as THEY dictate, not how others view them. For example: for.safety sale I HAVE to present masc. It's a safety concern. I was AMAB. I was raised in a hyper religious family and currently live with them half way across the world from my home nation. So even though I'm a trans woman, I have to look, dress, and act like a man in all respects. It's all about respecting people's boundaries.
Eh... its kind of hard I get what your saying but you have to remember that some transmen don't like being called trans-men but prefer transmasc. The problem comes from the fact that we want things to be specific there are to many different terms and everyone prefers certain ones.

That's why I don't care what terms are used for me providing that I am not mistaken for masculine or a man. So in my case trans-woman/woman/girl/transfemm all work for me because they all refer to my preferred gender. But not everyone will like having all of them used some might even like only 1 of them.

So its a tough situation really.
That’s no different to people who call trans women trans fem….
If you don't like it then tell people that, it's an accurate and fine description so people aren't going to think its an issue if you don't let them know
I just get confused about what they are saying because I assume that if someone is using a term they are using it correctly and I'm misunderstanding their meaning.
“transmasc” refers to more than just trans men, and it’s most likely used as a way to be more inclusive. transfemme is also a word used a lot, in the same ways.
[deleted]
You seem to be missunderstanding the term, it doesn not refer to masculine presentation, but rather that you're transitioning to the male side of the spectrum. I personally love the term because it's literally trans men but more inclusive. Trans men refers to only binary transmasc, transmasc refers to both binary and non-binary ftm individuals.

To further clarify, this term does not state you need to be masculine to be ftm, transmascs can be feminine and femboys as well as cis boys can
No way I just talking to you about people.
[removed]
Why do so many trans dig up so many things random to complain about? Like, there's actual intolerance to be conquered without you being like ""Yeah, idk, should I be offended by this word that is used universally in non-offensive ways?"" There's all sorts of stuff to be actually offended by. That's why I write my congress members, engage politically, give money to pro-trans causes, give emotional support to other trans people, provide financial independence training for other trans people, etc. I've never once tried to come up with a new thing to be offended by and then posted on Reddit about it because there is already so much work to be done. 

End rant, go ahead and ship me my downvote.
I’m AMAB and transmasc.
When people say transmasc they aren't only talking about  trans men, they are talking about trans men AND AFAB masculine non-binary people.
I am a trans woman and I don't care for the term trans masc. But I don't see it as the worst thing ever.
Im also a trans man but i don't rlly care about it, i actually prefer being called a transmasc, i can make more jokes with that.
I kinda just use transfemme, transmasc, trans man, trans woman interchangeably, is that bad? 

If so should I just only say trans man and trans woman instead?
I really just think they are saying that to be inclusive when addressing a group. I like it bc sometimes I'm not sure if I'm binary trans or not but definitely am a man. I think if some one is addressing you individually its ok to insist that they just say man or trans man. Not here to dog pile I get it. I stopped using both they them and he him pronouns bc the cis where using it to misgender me now I only use he him
As a person who identifies with the term transmasc, I agree. Not that hard to just respect what people would like to be called, and neither is understanding not everyone wants the same label. All people under the trans/nonbinary umbrella are valid regardless of what they want to be labelled as. 

Also, from what I’ve heard some people think for some reason that “trans man” is… somehow disrespectful?? It’s only disrespectful if you’re using it to describe someone who isn’t a trans man or who identifies with another term 😭😭the people who say this are always the same type to refer to everyone as transmasc which is why I brought it up
Well I use the word transmasc because I identify as transmasc, a boy but nonbinary. I still want to be included in transmen spaces, but I don't really identify with the term transman since to me it sounds binary. So I use transmasc usually to refer to anyone who identifies within the trans sphere and the masc sphere.
I like using the term transmasc bc transmen seems more formal and i feelalmost like Transmasc is more casual. I dont know how you guys feel, im a trans guy and im fine with it.
I think context is important and unless they are referring to the individual in the context of trans masculine identities, I agree that you should be referred to as a trans man or just a man if the trans part isn't relevant to the convo. It's a more accurate descriptor than trans masc. Inclusivity is useful but I think some people don't understand how umbrella terms are supposed to work.
You can't change people.
You can't change them that's the way they talks about people.
I like this attitude. It’s deeply important to those of us who can’t identify with ‘man’ (or ‘woman’) 100%, but are very close to it, and allows us space to exist in trans communities with folks who have the same experiences as us, but if just talking about trans men, by all means just say trans men. I do think ‘trans men and transmasculine folks’ is a phrase worth adopting, too. Thanks for not being angry and gatekeepy about it though; seems every trans community I’m in has at least one post a week that is pointedly enbyphobic about this and that’s always hurtful.
Also agree that it’s imperfect: I don’t have to be masculine just because I’m transmasculine, but fucked if I can think of a better word lol
I think there is a misunderstanding there. The terminology isn't 'transfemme', but 'transfem', coming from 'transfeminine'. That doesn't imply stereotypical feminity but simply feminity, as in being a woman or close to a woman in the gender spectrum, which isn't a performance thing either. Both you, a binary trans woman, and me, a non binary travesti are transfem. That doesn't mean that categorizing you SOLELY as transfem when you are a woman is okay, but if someone is addressing both of us for example transfem makes more sense, although I'm also okay with ""woman' as a label. 
It's not so much about upholding gender roles as it is understanding they exist. We want to be perceived and addressed as women and for that we have to perform some roles. They are very elastic and we should definitely defy them but we still want to fit that broad category. Transness doesn't exist on a vacuum, it is informed by societal expectations and constructs
Yep. That’s why. But that said for my trans men friends who identify as male I say man/guy etc. I feel like the complaint is valid when talking about specific peoples for sure, but for a masc-leaning enbie who doesn’t feel male it may not be right. 

Same with women. My gf is a trans woman but I’m only transfemme.
Couldn’t of said it better myself
Yea this is why the term is useful too!
[deleted]
I feel like you phrased what I was trying to say a lot better than I did, thank you
This is a very important perspective. I find in a lot of spaces inclined to listen to trans people, that people will fairly easily accept a trans woman saying ""hey, it's important to actually call me a woman and not just trans fem, because while I fall under that umbrella, not calling me a woman undermines my womanhood"" but often respond to trans men with something like ""look get over it, trans masc is just more inclusive, deal"". Maybe that's just where I see though, so I dunno.
this is basically what I was going to comment let's gooo
I am transmasc nonbinary, but differently from a lot of AFAB enbies and similar to a lot of transmen, I have a lottt of body dysphoria, and my desired transition results align way more with transmen than the average nonbinary person that I’ve met

That said, I always took transmasc/transfemme to be an amalgamation of the two words: ‘trans’ meaning across/away from ones AGAB, and ‘masc/femme’ meaning the direction towards/ that is aligned with your internal sense of gender

That said, and not intended as a gatekeep, but I wonder if there are AMAB ‘transmasc’ folks out there? I can see AFAB/AIAB transmasculinity, because it is moving away from the assumptions of ones AGAB and toward masculinity

similarly, as an AFAB myself I wonder if it’s possible to have an AFAB transfemme? Since femjnijity is assumed and projected on those AssignedFAB

For me, it’s been a hard uphill battle against the assumptions of my birth sex to claim, embrace, embody, and find joy in my masculinity…while still not feeling at all like a ‘man’. for that reason transmasc feels right to me…curious to hear others’ takes

Edit: upon further reflection and reading other people’s comments, I am coming to understand that I use ‘transmasc’ as a shorthand to make myself legible to those who think in the binary, but my experience as a nonbinary person goes far beyond the term. And yea, if it was a bunch of binary transmen, I’d just call them men/transmen depending on the context
Oh shit.. based on my search for support groups, I always thought transmasc meant exclusively nonbinary ppl afab...

And that transfemme meant exclusively nonbinary ppl amab..

It confused me cause it'll say ""transmasc"" or ""transfemme"" only! And when looking up definition, it states that transfemme is amab enby's and transmasc are afab enby's.. what am i missing?

Did the definitions recently change?..

Didn't know I could be included in either trans masc or transfemme spaces and identify and either, regardless of my agab.. that's welcomed news to me..

As a nonbinary trans person, I prefer to not disclose my agab bc doing so triggers my dysphoria and defeats the purpose of my maintaining my identity: to be ambiguous about it cause I'm trans adrogynous/masc leaning and my private parts are irrelevant in my medical and social transition.

Hmm.. very interesting
Not sure if you're looking for alternatives but I often refer to myself as a ""man who happens to be trans"". It's a bit longer, but you could say something along the lines of ""My son, a young trans man, is...""
Why not just say trans men, trans women and non-binary people? That includes everyone. Trans masc/femme are non-binary terms.
thanks for understanding, feeling like people are saying im being too picky when i just came here to see if anyone else felt the same
I understand where you’re coming from, completely valid view and i respect that
I know, that’s why I really dislike when people refer to me as trans masc when i’ve stated Im a trans guy
I agree with you, I wasn’t talking about referring to groups but more about referring to trans men as individuals, hope that makes my point a bit clearer but yes i agree
I know what it means and i know what i’m talking about, i’ve seen conversations about trans men be turned into conversations about trans masc people people instead
I’m not saying I hate the term trans masc, i’m saying i dislike when it’s used towards trans men when they’ve plainly stated they’re trans men, like i said it makes me feel like they’re dismissing the fact i’m a man
Fair enough, I understand your point of view
my post was more about knowing a trans man likes being called a trans man and still calling them trans masc but yes i understand using it for masc people in general
thank you for being understanding
You’re completely valid for that too
But I’m not always masculine, I’m a Trans Man who is both Masculine and Feminine. I don’t feel transmasc i feel like the label that fits me best is trans man or just man
this is what i meant, i wish i could’ve phrased it like this in my post
Yes i know it’s a personal preference, hence me asking how other people feel about it
i fully see where you’re coming from
thanks for the insight
thank you so much
I’m a bit confused here. I never said I wasn’t trans, i’m definitely a trans man. I just feel like people referring to me as masc rather than a man is a way to avoid calling me what i am, a man.
I am talking about people referring to me, and other trans guy that i know have an issue with this, personally.

I have no problem with being grouped into Trans masc as a group even though i don’t feel like that represents me.
I don’t think anything major has happened recently and personally i’ve never been outwardly disrespected by a trans woman on this sub reddit, it’s just something i’ve noticed recently and decided to point out

Thank you for your support, it means a lot
I completely agree !
I understand that, this is why this post is about trans men being referred to as trans masc when not every trans man is trans masc
it’s okay, it was no one individual that made me want to post this or feel this way so it definitely wasn’t your fault, it was more of a build up over a long period of time

thank you for trying to learn about our needs
Which makes me cringe.
i know, in this context i am talking about referring specifically to trans men only, and how i feel uncomfortable with the word when being called that
I really don’t think trans masc is a accurate description of my identity. I am a man but not always masculine and i feel like calling myself trans masc would subconsciously restrict me to being masc only
As a trans man, respectfully, Trans masc is NOT “litteraly trans men but more inclusive.”
Yes Trans men refers to binary trans people who identify as men, which is what I and and wish to be called. Trans masculine refers to someone trans who identifies with masculinity which is not all trans men.
If someone asks you to call them a dude, call them a dude, or whatever they ask to be called (as long as it's not insulting or disrespectful to you or the community). You don't need to remember every individual in the world, just the people you know and are around if they happen to have a preferred way of being called. Like I call myself trans masc, but other people might not like the term for them.
I was talking about a personal issue I have with people invalidating my identity, i never claimed it was the biggest issue in my life. 

This comment from you seems very intolerant and ignorant, not cool
katie mate… come on now. you really trying to tell me that just because i as a trans perosn experince bigger intolerance i’m not allowed to speak about something that makes me uncomfortable? 

never said i was offended by it, just purely don’t like it by the way, which you think i am. 

Good on you. go do the work, write to congressmen who do not give a shit. you are holier and mightier than us all. praise be upon thee
that’s very nice im happy for you
people have referred to trans men, specifically trans men as individuals, as trans masc, i have seen it with my own two eyes mate
never said it was the worst thing ever, just said i don’t like it because it doesn’t reflect me and a lot of trans men feel this way 👍🏼
it’s not bad, transmasc isn’t a bad term when used towards groups of individuals that like/identify with the word

when referring to a binary trans man i’d usually 9/10 times they’d prefer you to say man or trans man but it is personal so don’t be afraid to ask
I think if you identify with ""man"" that distinction is important. A lot of non-binary trans masc people don't identify with ""man,"" so ""trans masc"" would feel comfortable. But just from a different perspective, as a genderfluid person who identifies strongly with ""man"" I hate when people try to take ""man"" away from me as if I'm not allowed to identify with it because I fall under the non-binary umbrella. I imagine it's a somewhat similar frustration. Like yes I'm trans masc but can you acknowledge that I am specifically a man, dammit! If people did that to me, I would be pissed.
idk who’s tryna change people here mate
well they can change one word when referring to me thanks
(Just gonna reply to one of the comments)

There is not really a reason to be gatekeepy in this instance anyways. I guess we either get to the point, where hopefully people will go to the length of adopting the phrase you've mentioned, instead of just ""lumping all into one for all the inclusiveness, to the point where it's actually hurting people"", or who knows... maybe we get an entire new term/s as language evolves through time, but that is for the future. People are still learning after all.

Like I have my own annoyances with the terms ""MtF"" and ""FtM"", whilst some people still use them (seems like they are kinda on the verge of getting forgotten nowadays from experience), I personally hate those (if applied to me), because it once again feels like putting so much ""importance on what appearantly has been in a long forgotten past, rather than what the present and the future is"".

The only time, when I get ""gatekeepy"" trans-related wise is probably when I see the ""anime weeb related t-slur"" and the ""si\*\*\*"" one, because eff those. And that probably are one of the only things, where I won't budge, ever.

Edit: For some reason this comment got automodded?
""Transfem"" and ""transfemme"" are both used. It's similar to how ""color"" and ""colour"" are just regional variations on the same word. Where I am, I see ""transfemme"" *way* more.
Yeah that's what I was thinking as well. I think it's valid when someone isn't comfortable with transfem/transmasc when used for them as individuals. Personally, as a trans guy, I don't mind transmasc at all, actually, I kinda prefer it. That might be because I'm at the very beginning of my transition and I'm at an age where it's weird to call myself boy or man anyways. Like I'm definitely not a child but I'm also not a man yet.
Exactly this. It puts gender on a spectrum, while still denoting the preferred pronouns and aspects of gender one has chosen to identify with. Absolutely loved this take on it
I think a lot of my problem with terms like MTF/FTM is that like… for one thing, it implies that a trans person “used to be” their AGAB, which is not necessarily true. Like, if I were a trans man for example, and you called me “female-to-male” it would be like you were saying I “used” to be a girl, but not anymore. But if I was always a man on the inside, I’m only changing my outside to reflect that. Not changing my gender. Ya know? Plus, MTF/FTM are used as their own gender acronyms in addition to F and M in a lot of places which kind of carries the implication that trans people are a different gender than the one they identify with… like, again using a trans man example, if I had an online dating profile or something and I was forced to choose between marking my gender as M or FTM, which should I choose? It’s almost as if to say that trans men are their own gender separate from cis men, rather than being the same gender (men) who may or may not have been born with XY chromosomes and a penis.
‘Man of trans experience’ is something I’ve also seen
Cause its wordy.

and no they aren't they're times used to describe binary and both non-binary people.
I mean it does include you too, so you'd have to tell them your preferred terminology
Is extending a conversation about trans men to transmasc folks a bad thing? I don’t think that equates to saying ‘trans men are transmasc’, just when replying folks are aware that what they’re saying may apply to either so use the more inclusive language.
Yeah, that sucks. But trans masc people do experience a lot of the same things as us. 

Also, it's still better then ""FtM"". It implies we started as women, which is complete and utter bullshit.
Have you considered the possibility they were just trying to include masculine leaning nb folks (or any other masculine identity that doesn’t identify strictly as trans man) into the conversation and it had nothing to do with erasure of trans men?
I can see why that can get annoying. While again, I don't think it's entirely an issue, if someone is obviously bothered by it and prefers to be call transman or man, that should be respected.

Is this something that happens often?
Thank you, I love you. <3
oh yeah if someone clearly prefers to be called a trans man then ofc thats what they should be called! i thought you were saying you don’t like when someone calls a trans man transmasc in general, not only when its clear that they prefer being called a trans man
I guess the difficulty then is when to apply inclusive terms. For the most part using a shorter hand word like ""Trans masc"" which is also inclusive to enbies while still for the most part referring to transgender men, is ideal. If anything up to this point I had seen it be so synonymous with transgender men in particular than even some non-binary friends have wished the term were more inclusive. Its just a very interesting dynamic
I’m glad I could help communicate:)
Im a trans man and it doesn't bother me because of the reason stated above, so that's how I feel about it. :)
Maybe they are, I can't say one way or the other.

But it's true that you're trans, yeah? And it's true that your ""transness"" is in a masculine direction, yeah?

If I called you tall, and you were, even if your identity were being short, you'd still be tall. Now if you asked me not to refer to your stature, and I did, I'd be an asshole. But as a description, it is what it is.
I think then if they were people who knew what they were talking about (which in my environment is virtually nobody - they still get confused over if they should call me a trans man or a trans woman, usually), I'd find it annoying, yeah.
Ah, alrighty.
And, of course! All my trans brothers are amazing and deserve the utmost respect and all the love and support they can handle!
I see. I should have read more carefully. You definitely did address this. 

Thanks, man.
Well if someone says it to you then ask them to stop ? I can guarantee the average cis person is not using terms like “trans fem” so I’m not going to get offended bc some tried to use inclusive terms I don’t like. I don’t like to be referred to as transfem I’m a women or a trans women if the context is relevant.
well you can let people know that you’d rather they not refer to you like that, but you can’t expect everyone to *not* say that you are transmasc, cuz like, you are, in the same way that i am transfemme
Okay I will make sure to do that :D
And it isn't actively misgendering people, which is what people are doing by calling people MtF or FtM.
I did say in my post that I would have stated I’m a trans guy, not masc
I never said trans men and trans masc people can’t talk about things together. But their experiences are not the same and if trans men wish to discuss something, such as their representation in the media, they should be able to without the conversation switching to something else
Trans masc people experince similar things to trans men, but NOT the same things. Conversations about trans men specifically should be about trans men :/ 

I use FTM because I feel like that describes me, I can’t deny I am AFAB, I don’t have Male anatomy. It feels comfortable to me, not everyone has to use it
it was about the representation of trans men in media, specifically people who played trans men in shows/ films
I often see conversations about trans men turn into conversation about trans masc people. 

Such as another post on Reddit which was about the representation of trans men in the media and the lack of it but it turned into representation of trans masc people which is completely different imo. 

It’s just getting a bit annoying :/
okay, i understand your point of view, thanks for sharing :)
no problem, i do understand your point though and i’m glad your brought that up
Im not sure ""offended"" is the correct adjective, and frankly It's never cis people I have issues with. NB's can call themselves whatever they want, but I had being included in their ""umbrella"" language.
yeh thanks, i know. i was making a post expressing how i feel and to ask if anyone feels the same way. 
i’m not expecting people to not call me trans masc even though i don’t feel like that accurately represents me, i do expect to be referred to as a trans man once i say i am though
That’s fair for sure. Your phrasing wasn’t too specific, so it sounded like, for example, you’d be upset if you asked a question about T for trans men and someone replied with ‘for transmasc folks, t can have these effects…’ 

Also as a transmasculine person, I am on T, I use he/him pronouns, I look like a man, i’m planning on top and bottom surgery, I’m growing a beard. Trans man representation in media is representing me even if I’m not outright a trans man. Should I not be part of that conversation?

At any rate, reading your edit, I’ll say that this is something that is constantly posted, normally with an ‘I hate this term and I want my spaces to exclude NB folks’, so that’s why folks are misunderstanding. We’re used to having to defend ourselves against that constantly and your post sounds similar even if the spirit is different.
Yeah, 100% you cannot consider those the same conversations. A transman would be included in a transmasc discussion, but the conversation would be moderately different if it were strictly about transmen.

I guess a lot of people see masc and fem as equivalents. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case it's not so great...
if you prefer ppl to refer to you with a specific term that’s obviously fine and valid, i just feel like “hating it” when ppl use transmasc to refer to you might be a little extreme, considering it’s basically just semantics of whether or not the term includes nb ppl or not
My intention was never to exclude NB people from trans masc spaces. I’m sorry that it came off that way to you, as part of the trans community I want to be welcoming to as many people as possible. 

My post was mainly about my discomfort with the shift in conversation from trans men specifically to trans masc as I feel it’s not the same thing. Also about my discomfort with being called trans masc when I have specified in a Trans man. 

Thank you for telling me my post might seem like i’m trying to exclude NB people
Thank you for your understanding :)
i hate it because it makes me feel like they’re invalidating me as a man, but again that’s me personally not trans masc people as a collective
Also, being almost-binary I’ve felt both the frustration of being totally not represented in NB spaces by folks who are like ‘fuck gender anyway, it’s all bullshit!’ And don’t feel the need to do anything medically (which is fair and still valid, just doesn’t match my experience) and of feeling like binary trans spaces can be unkindly rigid in both gender presentation/roles and who’s welcome/who they consider valid. this divide between binary and nonbinary trans folks is inherently gatekeepy since both groups feel the need to safeguard their validity and many folks do that by defining themselves in purist terms and rejecting anything that doesn’t fit that as ‘setting a bad example’. Honestly, given that, it’s a wonder we’re all as civil to each other as we are lol.
No problem, thanks for being able to have a calm and reasonable chat about it, and for approaching this with a kinder spirit than most folks seem to. I do fully understand the term is entirely imperfect and that until a better word is found, ‘trans men and transmasc folks’ should be used much more than it is. It is totally ok for you to not want folks to refer to you that way. ‘Othering’ binary trans folk is also a very real and prevalent problem and I have seen words like transmasculine used in that context, so I do understand where you’re coming from. Just figured I’d explain the knee jerk reactions you’re being caught off guard by 🙂
Yeye, no problem. I do hope this happens a bit less in the future as it does strike me as a bit odd that this occurs so often.
i understand what you mean, i see how that can be a problem. i’ll do better to make sure i always stay include to nb people."	qxcyx3	trans	1205	0.93	2021-11-19 09:55:02
Too ugly to be welcome in online trans spaces.	"I think I’m at the point where I’m ready to give up on connecting with other trans people, especially other trans women.

Nearly every online trans group I’ve been part of has devolved into a stupid high school drama popularity contest thing where beauty is the deciding factor, or was already like that from its very inception, and I’m finally tired of dealing with it.

I’m tired of the constant social reinforcement in these groups that constantly tells me I’m ugly just because of my weight, and then completely ignores me because of my ugliness, as if the only trans voices that matter are those of pretty, thin, white, cis-passing trans women.

I’ve never felt wanted, or even welcome, among trans groups, and I’m about ready to completely distance myself from my trans identity, if not other trans people all together because of it.
I don’t need to associate with other trans people since I know from over 2 years of lived experience that I pass perfectly fine, despite how many trans people seem to view me as ugly.

So, why would I want to keep trying to connect with communities that clearly have no use for me? Why would I want to connect with other trans people at all, online or IRL, when my experience with them has been universally the same across all groups?

Before I wrote all this, I spent over an hour crying because of how lonely and isolated I feel among people who should be my peers, but don’t give a shit.

Now I’m just mad; at everyone else for making me feel this way, and myself for being so upset about it."	"I'm sorry you had to deal with people like that. This is one of the main factors behind my not sharing photos online, I like to connect with people in a way that is totally anonymous and free of visual prejudice. Sure, it doesn't solve the problem of people's shitty behaviour, but it does the trick to prevent it. I hope that you will be able to find decent enough people that accept you.
Edit : saw your line about being upset as if it's your fault. It most definitely ain't, so keep your head high.
I find this place to be quite welcoming though. There's people posting their photos but I usually don't look cause that's not for me. I just focus on myself and do my best 😊

I'm not sure if you ever follow DR Z PHD on YouTube but she is very genuine and commited gender specialist who posts lots of helpful content regarding our confidence and certain thought distortions that might affect us.

She also replies to comments with general helpful guidelines as she cannot dwell deeper as you arnt her patient and she doesn't know you enoough to go into specifics. I usually take these guidelines to my own therapist and I find it very helpful.

In fact, her most recent video covers ""what if I transition and I will be unattractive?"" which I found really useful. If you have the time and decide to check out her channel, I hope it can be helpful for you too 😊

It sounds like you need to get off some of those subreddits, especially ones like r/transpassing. Subreddits like that have a culture around reinforcing beauty standards, especially cis beauty standards. You don't have to ""pass"" or look cis to be beautiful. Trans bodies are beautiful. Don't give up on finding other trans women out there that don't have this toxic mindset or behavior. I know they are out there. They may not be easy to find in the groups you are part of, but they do exist.
Holy shit is this factual.
No harm to fellow trans women ofc, but it feels like a contest or popularity trope around them. With trans women for me personally feels like a pity circle, and the trans men I've met would push dysphoria on you like it was nothing. 

It's more than ok to take a break from talking to them, and you have to remember that you're allowed to be trans and not obsess on gender all the time, too much of it can lead to overthinking and self deprivation, just make sure all your conversations are beneficial to both you and the other party.
I do understand your feelings. I pulled back from Facebook some due to that very same reason. To so many, being trans is a beauty competition. It's like the same group post selfie after selfie multiple times a day. I mean, that fine I guess, but maybe they have such a low self-esteem that they need that constant validation. ...? I've found that meeting trans people like that in person, they often don't completely look like all the ""filtered"" pics they post lol.
It can be hard. There is the three occasional non thin, non cis looking or non white selfie in here and seeing those it's certainly good as they are still very good looking people regardless and also get praise from other people. They're not the majority.
But then again: most people that aren't meeting these standards are more hesitant to post photos and as such end up underrepresented. It's maybe a vicious cycle but yeah.
That's only speaking for online spaces like here not irl.
Also don't know if it even helps being aware of this but here it is
Alot of trans people who are focused on passing themselves pick apart those who are trying to do the same, they will do this as an escape to feel better about themselves. It's a huge cope and very toxic. I would pay no mind to them unless they have something constructive to say. In most cases cis people are the best people to get advice from since they dont care about little details that trans people hyper focus on. If you think you pass and cis people arent giving you shit about it what's the big hold up. The trans community might prefer this hyperfeminised version of societical misogyny to pass but you dont have to go this path. Just be yourself women dont have to take a certain form to pass.
You literally just look like a cis girl
It sucks how often I hear about this. I’m very new to this community despite learning and knowing about the practical/explicit information (i.e transition, surgeries, costs, chemicals…). Its sad that this is such a prominent problem that people don’t feel safe or comfortable around people who should know the experience and challenges of also searching for the “same crowd”. I hope you know that it’s okay to be upset. Don’t blame yourself for other peoples’ problems. Listen to your favorite music! Watch your favorite show again! I don’t particularly like crying, but supposedly the human process of crying releases “relaxing” chemicals that give you relief after the act. So… have fun with that? Whatever you need to do to feel better, do it! (On the total trust I’m giving you that it is probably healthy, but I’m not judging)
Hey Girl! You look nothing else than a woman to me, and you’re beautiful too. I’m not sure the problems come from beauty contests, cause you would have been in. 

And now, I’m not an expert, maybe it’s just normal, but I see you also post nude pictures. This is one thing that can really scare me off online, I wouldn’t do it. Moreover because there was a post a few days ago about pictures taken from trans-subreddits that were put up on transphobic websites.

Don’t be sad, you will find kind people within the community, because there are. And I wouldn’t participate to the “beauty-contest-situations”, you don’t have to prove yourself, you’re beautiful!
Some people can get caught up in their own success and not realise how lucky they are and forget where they came from. This sadly happens everywhere with everything. Jobs... Money... You don't want friends like that.
I identify with but don't associate with LGBTQ+ because of this.
Don't worry you are not alone. If you are looking for friends feel free to PM me. I'm a big pc gaming nerd who's early on in mtf hrt!
Unfortunately, life for all women is pretty much a popularity contest where beauty is the deciding factor, it's not just trans spaces.

I don't know how old you are, but a lot of online trans spaces just have people that are really young. They haven't experienced much, so they don't really know much about empathy or kindness. I promise you that as you get older, SOME people have learned that life is more than looks.
I'm truly sorry you're feeling like and have been treated like this. There seems to be so much unchecked internalised transphobia in some online trans spaces that really allows some to be so cruel to others and try to enforce rigidly defined acceptable parameters for being trans and how to look and/ or present, and that is awful and disgusting. We should be supporting each other in however we experience and express our gender, and however we look, which is all subjective nonsense anyways. There do seem to be some more supportive and positive on here, but I understand you need to do what you need to take care of yourself. Love and solidarity ❤️🖤
You should join Trans safe space on discord. They are so welcoming and so helpful. I think you shouldn't hide who you really are.
I'm sorry it's been that way for you, i personally haven't been in places that made people who look less attractive feel unwelcome, at least not that I noticed, but I understand that a lot of circles can feel like that. It seems like it's not just in the trans communities, there are just a lot of groups who value that a lot.

I must add that I've looked at your profile and those who called you ugly have shit tastes, because you're beautiful. But even if you weren't beautiful that's still just wrong to treat people like that, I'm sending love.
I totally understand what you mean about not feeling welcomed. Before my egg cracked, I never felt welcome in lesbian spaces for much of the same reason.

If you ever need someone to talk to, my DMs are always open.

Also, looked at your profile and saw that you're a nerd and a writer! If you're ever interested in nerdy RP (literate, not erotic), hit me up. Our group is really welcoming and inclusive, with several trans people and we don't accept shitters so things don't get toxic.
Hello, trans lurker for a while here. I've had some pretty similarly bad experiences here myself as well -

I've tried to reach out to both trans communities and individuals before also in regards to advice and just trying to help figure myself out, and I've either been flat out ignored or gatekept in the very first instance for not already knowing enough about being trans. I can't even accurately describe my gender identity, and I've tried researching transness before but it often feels like so many people in these communities refuse to help or offer advice because they had to struggle with it also, so heaven forbid that someone else gets to do it without the hard work!

So here I am, trying to figure it out alone, not knowing what to research, not feeling welcome in trans spaces because I don't know how to speak about my identity without, I guess, talking about it in the wrong terms, and getting no help from anyone. I've tried reaching out on this sub but don't even get a single comment or upvote on what would be hugely affirming or helpful questions, so I've just deleted them all lol.

I also feel like ""Do I pass?"" should not be an encouraged question, because you're reducing the trans experience down to, as OP puts it, the aesthetics of the transition as the ultimate end-goal. Yes, passing can offer safety in what is otherwise a shit fucking world and security in ones own perception of their self, but if passing is normalised as the end-goal of being trans, so many people who can't get the help to reach that point or can't pay out of pocket on techniques to masc/fem are shit out of luck, and told that their own transition is illegitimate. If not expressly, than definitely subversively.

Ultimately it makes communities like this feel clique-y, when that's the last thing any of us need.

Sorry to offload like this, and it would be great if I'm the only person who has these issues - but I don't think I am.
Hey it's gonna be alright. They should not have treated you like. They didn't have the right to. I have no doubt that you look like an amazing person. You are valid. Don't give up.
People in general are / can be really terrible. The same things drive awful behavior no matter where it is found. Fear, anger, jealousy, loneliness, etc. 

It’s a sad thing to say deal with or ignore it and even worse to try and turn the other cheek or rise above such behaviors when it seems that does nothing to improve anything. 

But it does, be the change you want to see in others and treat others as you want to be treated. These aren’t just sayings as in a world so seemingly filled with negativity every person can have a chance to be a little less crappy to someone else and help make the world suck a little less each day

It’s okay to vent and be angry u/flirtynerdygirl and even though I’m just some random message in the dark internet 

Hello there! And have a nice day ☺️
Hi!  I have a very small discord with a few trans people, were very supportive of each other.  Dm me if you want to know more, we'd love to have you.
Sorry to hear you feel this way hun. Feel free to DM me if you want. No matter what, you'll always have my support. Keep being you x
Yeah the push too look as pretty and fem as possible is really bad and i dislike it, i am 2 meters tall and broadly build so i'm never gonna look feminine and fit in with peoples ideas of how trans girls should look but i have accepted that and i'm just gonna be me, a big buff trans girl. Btw you can dm me if you want someone too talk too
I'm so sorry that has been your experience.  I've noticed that there's at least a sub-section of people who don't accept trans people who don't pass because they believe it reflects poorly on them and we really need to stamp that mentality out.

We have transphobic ideas within our own heads and we need to ACTIVELY work to undo that. Some people aren't willing to put in that effort. You're valid, you're wonderful and I hope you find that safe space.
This really had little to do with the trans community and is more a reflection on society as a whole. Most communities, especially online, are extremely toxic. High school doesn't end at graduation and humans can be truly awful.

It's best to take a step back and curate the people you allow close. They don't have to be trans themselves to be allies.

Look for people based on their attitudes and not their tribes.


Hang in there!
Disclaimer I ain't trans, but am here to help support my trans nephew (ftm). I am so sorry you feel this way, especially from the group you should be accepted. Just know you are beautiful in your own right inside and out.  Don't ever feel put down, you are amazing in your own right. Just keep being yourself and try and ignore any hatred.
Unfortunately, being trans does not cure people from being affected by cis heteronormative standards. Trans spaces also are going to tend to be cesspools of bodily insecurity, and one of the easiest ways for the insecure to temporarily feel better about themselves is to put others down. Also also, and I say this as a very big girl myself, big girls are largely invisible to society. If you want to be seen and validated, that’s a huge problem. If you want to go about your business without being bothered, then it’s a feature, not a bug.
I think that’s why I gravitate more towards GNC folx
💕
Oh no, I am so sorry you had to deal with this! The human form is something that should never be trivialized to 'standards of beauty' because those standards are almost impossible to achieve! Please do not be discouraged and try to find a community that loves you for you.
post photos in a good cosplay, everyone is super cute in a cosplay.
There are a few things I’ve learned over the years.  The first is that just because somebody is trans doesn’t mean they are a good person.  The second is that if you look hard enough you will eventually find your crew.

My take on this is that you are probably making friends with the wrong people.  It might be worthwhile to consider changing your approach to finding trans spaces.  

Personally, I think online only spaces can often get dominated by bad faith actors, especially if they are big and do a lot of gate-keeping.  I’m not saying all online spaces are bad, but the better ones Imo tend to be smaller cliques of people who are good friends, and will imo those spaces will rarely be *just* trans people or *just* women.

Most of the friends I have found that have been genuinely good friends, I made irl by going to in-person trans support groups.  I’d make a friend through that, then hang out with that friend outside of that space, and then I’d meet their friends and reject until I had a crew I felt were good for me.  And I don’t think I’ve ever had a good crew that was *just* other trans women.
Personally I disregard the opinions of those who really don't know better like the people you are describing, they have deeper issues that being attractive on the outside wont cover up; And especially those who think that being Trans is something to be ashamed about with their twisted and false, unethical and socially destructive concepts of beauty and passing altogether.

I know that true beauty has nothing to do with appearance or form whatsoever and instead is who we are deep down within these vehicles we call bodies.

Passing for beautiful based on exterior factor or money, privilege and views around what makes us good enough to be universally accepted and so on is something that not only trans people are subjected to but all people who feed off of media in general and it's part of a major problem the world over.

All humans by design are perfectly beautiful and valid; But when we force the ideas that passing means you can walk down a dark alley at night and etc or expect others to be ok with whatever body parts we have - with no regard to experience, conditions, circumstance and even human rights or desires it's these restrictions that force the world into darkness and exclude those of us who only want to improve the understanding of what is means to be unique and human; and even contribute to the numbers of trans, non-binary, queer, intersex and gender diverse murders and suicide or worse.

It's not all bad though, But to accept this very ugly and rampant side of wanting to be our best self both internally and externally we should offer at least compassion for those who succumb to the unequal, dangerous and unrealistic pressures of life under the thumb of media but we don't have to be as bad as them and drink the kool-aid. These platforms or any cover ups used to create external beauty (surgery included) are why I have at my worst times loved reddit, because we can fuel our darkness and sadistic personas- I wouldn't recommend it though. Besides all this there is nothing wrong with wanting to seem truly beautiful but you wont be untill you can learn what real beauty really is.

Stay beautiful,

Belle
Yeah. So my thing is I had a friend and we did stuff from time to time but like she was catty in moments, like she was always trying to prove she was better than me. As someone who has two deployments to Afghanistan and other experiences that were also rough, I don’t care to be competitive over minute stuff that doesn’t matter. Regardless, I recently went out with this chick and her other trans friends. Her friends barely spoke to me and then they were going to smoke weed in front of a malls entrance. I didn’t want to do that because you know I’m like 28 and have a nice job? But hey they didn’t seem to give a shit about any of that. 

I have yet to have any good experiences with other trans women in person (besides my one friend who ghosted me for 6 months). 

The sad part is we need to be allies politically and set a standard that the younger generation can follow.
Those are some fucked up experiences. That really sucks!

But there are less shitty trans circles. If you feel it's still worth the effort, you can find them in your area too, I'm sure.

Side note: Are you from Germany? The German trans scene is awful and what you're saying reminded me of it.
Thank you for sharing. I've been feeling similarly and have also removed myself from the local trans community. I feel left out while the most passable/pretty trans women in my community are also the most popular. In fact, it feels like everyone lusts after them. I wonder how common this is.
Oftentimes when we receive weird vibes/responses from people, it has nothing to do with us, rather it’s a projection of their own issues onto us.  I’m not speaking for all trans women, but I have read about some who get dysphoria from other trans women, as they have this idea of how they’ll turn out, and when they see different possibilities/outcomes other than what they’ve imagined they get scared, and try to avoid those possibilities, cuz it doesn’t fit into their ideas/dreams for themselves.  I get where you’re coming from, but not everyone is like this, and perhaps the ones that are happen to be alone and sad too. 

Hope this helps, at least I was trying to here :)
Though I’m not trans (I’m a tubby cis gender femboy and I know it might annoy or offend transgender people that I’m commenting here) but I would say that looks are nothing to be worried about as people online shouldn’t have a say in how you feel. Sorry for waffling but what I’m getting at is that if you feel comfortable with how you look then that’s all that matters <3
you should come post in r/agender or r/NonBinary. a lot of us don't necessarily ""pass"" as male or female, and we're definitely not all up to regular beauty standards, and *thats fine*. even as a trans woman, your only focus shouldn't be on how trans women see you. fuck them if they don't accept you or want you. 

also, as a fat person, you have nothing to worry about weight-wise. you are legit curvy and all the more adorable for it.
Honey.....I know its hard but just be you....im 6'3"" and am have a very ""masculine"" build....I've been watching Cis women since I was 5 yrs old....in my estimation there is not a woman out there that is in the top 0.5 percent of women considered to be ""perfect"". What ever that is.....look around whenever u are out....I get dysphoric all the time about what I look like verses what I want to look like.....if you want to chat feel free to msg me
Don't try to belong in a group that won't accept you in the way you are already. Give love only to those who deserve it.
Huh, I've never had issues on the discord servers I'm on. I'm sorry to hear that though, it's tough to feel good about yourself anyway with dysphoria and I hate that they put you down to feel better about themselves.
Yeah the reason those groups caused so much drama wasn’t because they are trans, some people are naturally drawn to wanting drama for some reason. Most of the other trans folk I know try there best to avoid drama
I feel the same way. Honestly I just want some friends to chat with and game with. Idc how far along you are in your transition or how you look. If you have a good personality I'll love ya anyways. :33

Edit: Also. I think I'm ugly and def not even close to passing myself. But I'm told I'm not so you're probably not either. Self confidence issues on top of dysphoria is a monster
I have personally never experienced this, but, the furry community is a great online space for trans people, its not only trans people, but theres a lot of trans people there you will meet. And there's generally no transphobia, unless you find the odd splinter group filled  of rejects.
Sorry that is happening to you. I am looking for trans friends, I would love to chat. I looked through your pictures and I think you are cute. Haven't started HRT yet, but I plan on it.
I am so sorry you feel that way. You are beautiful, even if other people don't think so. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.
You ain't ugly at all. People can be toxic regardless of gender. Dealing with the toxicity of society is a lesson that is harder for some of us to learn...I often cannot handle it and will go through long periods of hermitic isolation. There are plenty of folk offering friendship and counsel in this thread, but if you have need of me I am here ᛫ᚨᚨᚨᚹᛖᛒᚨᚨᚨ᛫
The Discord for this very subreddit, as well as trans-friendly furry Discord spaces, if you're into that, never pull this shit from what I've experienced.
Girl you aren't even fat. Fuck them
Your a absolut Beauty
oh yeah it's just like that, You just gotta kinda be your own party and enjoy you and everything you like and not rely on others, and if someone wants to join in on your party then that's alright, but don't ever try to fit in friendo. If the friendship was meant to be it was meant to be but you don't need to be someone you're not, I mean you already know that because you're trans, but when it comes to people, being genuine about yourself gets you where you need to be with people who like you for who you are and yeah it sounds cliche but it became a cliche for a reason.

Find your people, they're out there, you haven't met all 7 billion of these humans yet.
dont say such bad things about yourself, you can be beutiful in your own way.
First of all, I'm sorry you experienced that, being treated as an other by people who are supposed to be there for you is painful and I know it can be demotivating in so many ways... I'm here for you.

Secondly, I see the pictures you have on your reddit. I don't mean to be weird or rude but you're beautiful, please don't tear yourself down and especially don't let others tear you down. 

I hope I managed to help, feel free to send me a message if you want to talk. I'll respond as soon as I can. Have a wonderful day.
>Says she's (perceived as) ugly

Maybe I should look at the post history

>Is heckin cute

*confused gay sounds meme*

Honestly, I'm sorry for what's up.  Life isn't perfect.  The internet is full of misguided people and bad actors.  Even I, the epitome of perfection in every way (do I really need an /s here?), sometimes act in ways I later regret.  

Plus I've read about how these forums tend to be filled with newer trans folks.

I wish I had some way to give more than just words through a series of tubes.  I'm sorry that I don't.

I can only try to support folks like you and me, and help shine light in these communities when I have the strength.  

So chin up, take it from me, the girl with the ugly knees: those who would tear you down don't deserve your comradery.
I just don't place a strong value patriarchal beauty standards. I would be nice to pass and be pretty, but ultimately my energy goes into looking cool.  I have control over that and it's much more rewarding. I am witchcraft!

I hate that our community feels the need to punch down at each other. In the end we are all in the same typhus infected discrimination ship of the imagination.
Gatekeeping trans communities are just the worst. Being transphobic against people just because they dont fill their beauty standard is just ridiculous.
I'm sorry you are treated that way!  You're definitely not ugly and your body is perfect the way it is.  They are missing out! And you're better off without their condescending attitudes 💙💙
I don’t want to invalidate your experience at all, but there are shitty people in every community. Just because someone shares your trans experience doesn’t mean they’re a good person, or that their opinions are right. And the way they treat you does not reflect the entire community. So I really hope that a few asshole people won’t cause you to reject your identity. Your identity is your own. Don’t let people ruin it for you. I truly hope that you can find a safe space with other (non asshole) trans people.
seeing your pictures and this post makes me feel awful for you. you're so so so so gorgeous and beautiful, what sort of super model spaces were you in that that's ugly? ;-; I'm so sorry you had to deal with shit groups/people.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. Calling someone ugly is uncalled for and wrong no matter the situation. Especially when calling peers ugly. They were all a-holes and petty jerks. In my opinion, all trans women are beautiful, unless they're jerks. No matter what they look like, they're beautiful. But trans women who treat other trans women like how they treated you? They're the ugly ones. You seem like a very beautiful and kind soul. I'm sending hugs hun, I'm here if you ever need to rant
Oh that sounds awful sorry you have to deal with that
Pretty is not the rent you have to pay to exist and live authentic to yourself. ❤️
I highly recommend both Transpeak and Trans Community Center discord server, they are both great
Yeah it hurts, ita real beauty centric.
I searched this sub out tonight just to see how things are going. I used to follow, i used to follow lots of trans subreddits. I used to subscribe to trans youtubers and seek trans people on dating apps.
I had thought trans people would forever be around me, the community would be around me but that has not happened.
Im sure my unattractiveness has played a role, and me not being into girls has played a role.

I love trans people, i dont really feel mad at 'the community', but in the end, i dont think 'the community' is for everyone.

My goal in transitioning is to be a woman, my goal is not to be a trans woman. I love being a trans woman, its neat and kinda unique, but i dont usually feel the need to participate and the further along i get, the more i like blending in.
This way works for me, im happy, and again i love trans people especially because i know the pain..
So, I looked at your profile, and I have no idea what these other people are talking about. You are fucking beautiful. Wouldn't bat an eye at even thinking you were trans as all. You got one pass, and for two look amazing doing it. Fuck the haters.
Hey, a trans man here who is a femboy as plus sized, I totally understand you. I personally haven't gone to many places expept here, because of my introversion and lack of initiative, but I definetly still have those insecurities and know how devastating it can be when ither trans people put you down or don't accept tou because of your looks or weight. I can be your hypeman if you ever need one, or a listening ear.
~~I looked through the comments on some of your posts and nearly all of them seem positive (or at least positive for the subreddit). Based on this post and some of your others I might recommend you find a therapist. It seems like you have low self esteem~~ I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I might recommend therapy
I'm sorry to hear that, you're super gorgeous, but yeah I've definitely felt that if you're not a thin white waif that passes perfect you don't belong or belong as much.
~~welcome to the world of human nature. They’re all nasty and spiteful, just like the rest of humanity.~~

Unfortunately, lots of people have insecurities that can compel them to act in certain ways that they otherwise might  not. I’ve  never tried to interact with anyone because I already know just how I would be treated. That’s a combination of personal worries and historical precedent.

im way too old to pass, way too old to be deemed attractive even by the most desperate.

You might be better off simply disengaging from it all.
[deleted]
I've seen alot of toxicity from the LGBTQ community that I'm just willing to distance myself from it. It can be so superficial, racist, disconnected from reality and overall unfriendly if you don't fit their narrative, its sickening.
It’s what happens when you put a bunch of people whose main life goal is to move past the one commonality they all have. Like being in high school.

It’s not about your appearance tbh. No matter how you look, there will be people who are passive aggressive because of the high percentage of trans people insecure about passing that take it out on others (subconsciously). I would say I’m conventionally “pretty” but still don’t feel welcome in these spaces.
Gurl you look good.

You are not ugly.
You are chubby, a trait what was consider for 1000th of years very sexy.
I am chubby myself and I have never felt something like this in my LGBT+ community.

I guess it depends where you are from, but this had nothing todo with the lgbt+ community itself.
From my personal experience, a lot of trans girls do the beauty contest thing out of performative femininity to be more easily accepted by the outside world, in real life most people just see no facial hair, boob, and girl clothes and assume girl no matter how you look. I do this to myself a lot because of dysphoria to the point that i shave my full body daily but I make sure not to do it to others because that’s just rude. I’m sorry you had to deal with the shittier part of the community.
Maybe stop posting in subreddits that slander us like r/traps… 

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this issue, it really should be all inclusive
I know you probably want to be around other trans people because you can relate but don't feel like you need to be friends with every trans person. Trans people can be assholes too, you'll find the right group of friends eventually. Sorry you are going through this. I felt left out in my high school trans group because I was the only overweight one and I was pretty much ignored all the time because of it. I eventually told them that I no longer wanted to be friends and I found the right people to be friends with. You don't have to subject yourself to their asshole behavior. You deserve better
I mean, based on your profile, you're definately not ugly. But even so, ugly folk should still have a place here. I. Sorry that assholes have made you feel unwelcome
I'm so sorry this has all happened. For what it's worth, from your pictures, I think you're beautiful as you are. You don't need the noise from those assholes trying to tell you otherwise.

It's not your fault. You shouldn't be mad at yourself for being upset about it, you're right to be upset. This is absolutely unacceptable.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that all, it sounds horrible. Judging people for their looks is horrible and I can't possibly fathom how fellow trans people would do that as well, since a lot of us know just how it feels to struggle with looks. A lot of us are here should you ever want someone to talk to <3
I'm sorry. Weight is a horrible burden. It's because it's unhealthy, that it's not attractive. Like how sane people will find too thin people unattractive too.
People suck, trans people at the end of the day are people just like everyone else. We have short comings, biases, and all the other human things. Look at Caitlyn Jenner, what an awful bitch.
I don't understand the weight or looks bit. I just looked at your pics and you're average or thinner than the average woman where I'm from. What spaces are you in that don't have diverse bodies? You look pretty to me. Is it possible that people are just being jerks to be jerks? I don't think it's your looks.
I do. Among cis people.

I wanted to find that type of acceptance among people more like me, but apparently I don’t deserve it.
I LOVE Dr. Z! She has really made a difference in how I'm seeing myself during my medical transition ❤ and she always answers comments/questions!
Thank you for the recommend, I'll be watching this after work <3
stg I pass better irl than on r/transpassing
I'm convinced at this point that r/transpassing is just mostly frequented by transphobes who have found that it's one of the few spaces on Reddit where they can ridicule trans people without getting banned. 

Imo at this point it's just an outlet for trans people to go mentally self harm by posting there.
That place is literally the second worst online ""trans community"" there is behind only 4chan
I definitely only see this online, although I suspect that's largely because I'm old, and this attitude is more commong among younger people that I don't really interact with elsewhere.
Lol well a lot of the online trans community is people who’ve recently come out and if you think about it it’s like a huge group of teenage girls…. So… not surprising that it’s a popularity contest lmao
This is honestly the primary reason I avoid filters. To avoid setting unrealistic expectations for myself and for others. I’d personally rather learn to love myself as I am now rather then an “idealized” version of myself that may or may not be possible.
That's a shame really, I'm hoping you are having a better experience on this board. While I do often take selfies - the selfies in question are for my own personal journal rather than sharing on the internet (I have shared a small handful) What I also find helpful is that any selfie that is submitted here is always held under review before it circulates, that way (unless they flair it as filtered/faceapp) the overly filtered pictures (or more nefariously, pictures of cisgender women/men) are less likely to be posted on this subreddit.
Because such a huge part of being trans is appearances due to societal norms makes it very easy to become obsessed with appearances.  Looks aren't all a trans person struggles with but it's a big chunk so we overly focus on it. And it's an online forum so it's easier to criticize and be hurtful to somebody because you see them as a profile not a living being with feelings. And you're so right about cis people. They will look at the whole picture instead of focus on the tiny details that we tend to get caught up on.


Also to add. When you're ""cis passing"" it turns into more of wow ok you're pretty. Rather when you're ""trans passing"" and it's like ""OMG you look SOOO GOOD"".  As if it means more to be beautiful when you're trans than cis.
Makes total sense

Like you want to be prideful but it's hard since you're image gets associated with the people using it in a shitty fashion
Being bi, I was used to being shit on in queer spaces even before my egg cracked lol
Same. Like, I do my best to support my fellow queers, but fuck do I not want to hang out with a lot of them.
Very much this. We haggard, middle-aged tr***ies don't really give a crap what you look like, as long as you turn down the music, feel OK being your authentic self, and stay off our lawns.
seconding support groups! look for lgbt centers that are at least semi-local, but a lot of them do have online resources if you can't make it in person
Twitter
This is kind of her point, right? She's complaining that being attractive is a requirement for validity in online trans spaces, and you're telling her that *she's attractive enough to be valid.*
Ever consider that the other spaces they're talking about are... outside of Reddit? They just said online spaces, they never specified Reddit. You're being kind of invalidating.
Sad thing is, a lot of them are my age.
Welp, DM me if ever you need support, a chat or a virtual hug. I'd be happy to lend an ear
You do deserve acceptance, no matter if you pass or not. You are no less of a woman than any other trans or cis woman. Beauty doesn't define your womanhood
You do deserve it.
You deserve Allll of the good things 🌸
Me too, its like she answered questions I never knew I'd face or have answers to what I'm facing now.

But as with all therapy, it takes a willingness to want to try otherwise it's useless. So far she has been very helpful in providing the information that is important for me at that time.
Because that sub is full of douchebags.
Don't tell /r/transpassing that you can't accurately judge if someone passes from photographs /s
100% in agreement. 

I got told there that my face passes but my body doesn't and that I looked like a cross-dresser. And then when I told them I disagreed with their comment, I got downvoted. 

What doesn't make sense though is that my post did really well. I got 200 upvotes but all the comments where saying my outfit sucked and my body didn't pass.
I have to remind myself really frequently that r/trans and r/traaa skew *really* young. Like, babies compared to my 30-yo ass. Aside from occasional really intense political beliefs I won't touch with a pike, a lot of them seem really concerned with being conventionally attractive by cis standards... Standards that most cis women also don't meet.
Yes!!!!! Same here
Oh yes, I like it here and a few other Trans reddit pages also! I'm not against selfies, but on Facebook its literally girls posting a half dozen selfies, EVERY day lol.. I havnt really seen that here ..
also counter point i feel like i get asked a lot by cis ppl ""when do i present femme?"" whenever i tell ppl im trans and im like yo i am literally right now (wearing tshirt and jeans, no makeup).
Isn’t it ridiculous? It’s like: 

oh trans girl sad? You’re so hott!! 

Are you happy now?
It wasn't my intention to be invalidating, I'm sorry if I came off that way. I stand by my recommendation of them getting therapy though.
Is the negativity coming from people in person or online? I’m in quite a few trans online spaces and it’s almost always very positive. I’ve never seen what you’re describing. I’m not trying to invalidate your experience, just want to figure out where it’s coming from! Maybe so I can avoid those places too…
Need to accept not everything deserves acceptance 

Lip service & baseless compliment’s to make someone feel better is a waste of time.

When you have some coworker trying to get you fired for there partner feeling self conscious being ugly with body hair like a Sasquatch. When you don’t even interact or stare at them much less want to be aware of there existence you will understand there are cases that don’t deserve kindness

Simply trying to have me fired just before my own surgery this august is BS. I don’t even know them but there both overweight 5 ft range weeabo, classic textbook walking comedy, both with long beard and neck hair that somehow grows out all the way down to he collar bone. Literally I feel like there both so unfortunate one decided to transition and hookup with a distant relative of the same misfortunes.


Only having the matter put my lifelong plans at jeopardy just prior because these two having baseless claims telling my general manager I don’t want to work there anymore, and I don’t help them. Despite being one of the three individuals at the same time pulling there slack from how useless they truly are as a coworker. among a dozen other childish bs claims.

I don’t even have a the patience to share all the details just know people like these don’t deserve pity
It's because they're baby trans people, and haven't figured out how to exist outside of those beauty standards. Which is legit! We've all been there, but that phase *is* kind of annoying to be around if you're well past it.
Crickey, that is pretty bad. Just glad I'm not on Facebook
Yeah I mean I dont wear makeup and dress butch, doesnt mean I dont pass as a woman? Like what women have to be feminine and prissy like a princess to pass? If you answered yes that's what you call 'internal misogyny'
I do have low self-esteem.
Which isn’t helped by all of this.
It’s online. On Twitter.
Which may be the worst, most popularity contest place for anyone to be.

It’s also not overt negativity as much as it is lack of positivity.
Girls like me typically go ignored when it comes to compliments and reassurance in favor of hyping up the same dozen or so big profiles run by the aforementioned young, thin, pretty, white, cis-passing girls, and those girls only talk to and hype up each other. 
It’s like they think the rest of the trans community exists in their orbit.
ya, it's definitely more difficult, and until you know me you might not assume i'm trans. vOv
Yeah I mean I dont even try to ""pass"" in the eyes of society cause it favors those who are small and petite, with a squeaky voice and dress all the same. I'm practically the opposite and stick out like a sore thumb. Might as well just embrace it rather than trying to hide it."	tgy4zl	trans	1143	0.92	2022-03-18 10:18:58
After battling with my body and identity for 24 years, I now, 4.5 years after coming out, 3 years on HRT and 1 month post SRS, finally feel at home and happy with myself. I can finally say I love who I am. Keep fighting. There's light at the end of the tunnel.		"gorgeous :)

Hey my love I’m having surgery with Dr Sutin approaching, booked for March, was wondering if you had PI or Sigmoid colon vaginoplasty? And how you found your experience please? I want my mum to come with me x
HRT means Hormone Replacement Therapy. Traditionally estrogen (E) and antiandrogens (testosterone blockers) are given to AMAB (assigned male at birth) individuals and testosterone (T) is given to AFAB (assigned female at birth) individuals. And SRS means Sexual Reassignment Surgery, which can include a variety of different procedures for people with in the transgender and non-binary community.

Also, welcome! Always nice to meet an ally.
Exactly what the other person already said. :) And thank you! I find it amazing to see allies out here just supporting us. Means the world. You're doing gods work
HRT is Hormone replacement therapy 
SRS is sex reassignment surgery also known as GRS genital reconfiguration surgery
It took a long, long time and there was a lot of pain in between, but it's possible. You can do it ♡ I wish you all the best. And thank you :)
Try taking a look at r/Transgender_Surgeries! There are a lot of people on there who post their results. I personally, both functionally and aesthetically am incredibly happy with my result and there are some really great ones out there. Just gotta go with the right surgeon :)
So it actually looks like a afabs part?
Depends on the technique, but there are quite a few results that are cis-passing. I'm happy to say I'm in a similar boat.
Im happy for you. I just have one more question tho and its a bit more sensitive so mind if i ask it?
Feel free to ask away, I'm pretty open regarding that stuff :)
I found a video on the hub (Ik it’s unfortunate it’s the only place we can really turn to as far as I know) of a trans woman explaining the process, the feel, and answering questions on the topic and it wasn’t really sexual at all besides her having her vag out to show and explain things and the usual “don’t feel discouraged if you can’t climax the first few times it’s a whole different process” and I think she’s doing more videos on it so if u want to ask questions it’s probably a good place to do so. And for anyone questioning my motives I’m transfem and was curious myself and found exactly what I was looking for, an informative but not sterile and clinical veiw of gender affirmation surgery
Thanks. I was just wondering what about pleasure? And orgasms? Im curious to know.
Ah... i mean i might look it up...
I've had bottom surgery about 3 years ago now, I can absolutely achieve orgasms, and it's absolutely sensate and pleasurable.
Still a bit early in the healing process for that, but I can already tell I'll definitely be able to have both once I'm a bit further along. Once I'm at the 2 month mark that should work just fine!
Is it different from pre srs?
Omg i can only dream of achiving a female orgasm
Personally? Yeah. I'm actually able to get off with my husband, which is something I actively couldn't do pre-surgery. I could finish by myself both pre and post, but being with him is something else honestly, it feels _ENTIRELY_ different, and I don't think I could adequately explain why.
That sounds incredible. Mind if i ask where the testicles go? Just into the garbage or?
HAHAHA omg, they do yeah, I even asked the surgeon in Thailand if I could have them as a souvenir and he gave me a strange look!

I really should have asked my surgeon if I could have had my skull fragments put into something as well, too bad I didn't remember to do that :("	r9u0cn	trans	1121	0.99	2021-12-06 00:39:09
I’m starting to realize the outcome of me being trans	"I’m 17 (MtF she/her) and realized I was trans 2 years ago and came out to my parents about it a year ago. They were extremely resistant about the idea but thankfully my mom came around and generally accepts me. My dad on the other hand is a closed book to the fullest. I don’t want to explain more than I have to but he is extremely transphobic and homophobic towards me as a result. 

I talked to them a bit about wanting to medically transition and while my mom was open to the idea my dad was furious. They both got into a heated discussion about it and eventually they decided to decline me the care I needed. My mom just abandoned me there for my dad because she felt it was the right thing to do for the general good of the family. I understand her sentiment but I just feel so betrayed because of it. 

Everyday I resent them more and more for how they treat me from not using my name, misgendering, and turning blind eyes to every scenario possible. I’m almost 18 and about to set out on my own but as I’m starting to get my stuff together I realize more and more that why I’m doing and what I need to do is something that they would never approve of. I seek my independence from their unforgiving behavior and am starting to realize the consequences it will create. They always yapped to me about family and doing what’s right but from what I seen of them they only look out for themselves. 

Now that I’m looking out for myself and my identity they are becoming increasingly more hostile towards my abandonment of their beliefs and I know it. They wish for nothing but what they want but I won’t let it happen. I deserve to create agency for my identity and my life as who I am in my own way. This abandonment will leave me without a family, inheiretence, money, or relationships but that’s a sacrifice i’m willing to take. They never supported me and I know they never will but I know that I have to do this for myself. I have to do it for her."	"Right on.  You’re the one who lives your life, not them.
This is a powerful ode to liberation. What you have recognized  I believe is a gift. Not that many of us find the ability or good fortune to be able to stand in complete naked, transparent, and unflinching solidarity with our true self for all around us to see. 

The relationships around us reshuffle as we become aware of the true meaning of love and we recognize who loves us and who doesn't. Because to truly love is love without ulterior motives, to love one not for what they do or how they fit into our lives, or what they do for us, but for who they are. 

This seems simple, but when we are not being our own authentic self, we are unable to recognize all the relationships in our lives founded on falsity, or all the ways convince ourselves that we are loved even by those who really don't love us at all. We are a bit like the King of Rohan with our eyes covered in cataracts and evil voices of ""loved ones"" whispering in our ears what we feel and who we are.

When I cane out as trans, already most of the family relationships I had had melted away. Shortly after, I lost the last one. Don't get ne wrong, I did some of the pushing away. Being trans is kind of a superpower. 

It snapped into sharp focus the idea of the dark side of love that this person dwelled on in the way the hay treated me for so many years! I saw them for who they are! 

I like this song by Palace Brothers ""No More Worhorse Blues"". The workhorse is the perfectl metaphor for the person who lives their life for others until they change their mind and realize they must live their own life and throws off the yoke of their work to be ""a grazing horse...a racing horse...your favorite horse!"" Everyone's musical taste is different and although the musical zeitgeist of the early 90s raw indy voice and guitar may not be to your liking, I hope you can hear the lyrics. I will post this elsewhere.

 I hope you forge ahead becoming you, strong and lovely and super powerful. You are loved and will be loved. You have the unique gift of recognizing how truly alone most of us really are. Love is real when you feel it from here.
If you have known this for two years. I don't imagine that this will ever go away. She will never leave you, as she is you. 
Take care, be careful this is a long hard road. Keep an eye on education as you move through this as it is a powerful tool to give you the resources to be successful with everything even your transition. 
I wish you a peaceful transition.
Unfortunately, this is a reality many of us face. It's difficult, but we get through it, and we build families of choice along the way. That said, I will give you a bit of practical advice as I've been where you are before. 

1. You're about to turn 18. It is important to prioritize your transition, but it is also important to prioritize your next steps into adulthood. Are you planning on going to college? Do you have somewhere safe to live and some money saved up? The freedom you will experience when you leave your parents' house will be wonderful, but you'll also need to prioritize your safety and wellbeing (insurance, housing, a phone, etc.). I know many people who made the decision to not totally disown their parents until they were completely financially independent. It did not keep them from being out to their friends and colleagues at college, and it kept them safe until they could provide for themselves 100%.
2. Some parents come around. Some never do. I am completely no contact with my father. There will come a point where you may have to say ""I cannot accept this type of treatment and therefore, I will not spend time around you unless your behavior changes."" For me, it was valuable to be able to say to my father, ""I have warned you of these consequences and your behavior remained unchanged."" And then... our relationship was over. And I was free. And honestly? It's better than I could've ever imagined.
3. Which brings me to this point. Right now, everything seems so big and so scary. And in many ways, it is. But please believe me when I tell you, your life will contain so much more joy and love than you could ever dream of. You will meet so many wonderful people and find so much peace in getting to live more fully into yourself and get to know the young woman that you are. The work you are doing now will pay off, whether it is preparing for college or beginning to calmly set boundaries with your parents. I wish you the best on this journey, but seriously, it's not all gloom and doom. It's gonna be okay- it's gonna be better than okay- it's going to be really, totally wonderful.
You know who they truly are now. Pretty sad and disappointing to realize. Still, you will always go further with the truth. Go for it young adult!💕❤️😊
I am not sure if it helps; but quietly asserting your right to ownership over your own body is a part of becoming a woman, and its a stressful time for cis and trans women alike. Sure there are unique challenges to being trans, but there are also unique challenges for cis girls. 

My point is, find reassurance that what you’re going through is unfortunate and scary but normal, and if you approach it as such it will get easier for folks around you to accept you. People (even parents) respond to confidence. Keep your cool, don’t give them the fight they want but keep your focus and go toward what you want. You’ll get it 🥰
This is so relatable did our parents get a ""unsupportive course"" or something
Good on you for realizing this. I turn 30 in a few months, and after going no contact for several years with my parents, I tried so hard to make things work, but absolutely nothing changed with them after 5 years of no contact with a 2 year reconnect. I finally blocked them yesterday, and this time I know it is the right call, and today I feel free. Some people are absolutely capable of change, but it is not your responsibility to manage them, and your health is the most important in your life. 
You deserve to be respected, and treated nicely! I hope you have a good day! c:
It's terrible that so many people have to give up their families just to get proper medical treatment, but as much as it hurts, it will be for the better. They are selfish, and you deserve happiness. ❤️
Make damn sure you can fully support yourself (food, shelter, utilities, job) and have an external support network (friends willing to, say, let you crash at their place for a month) before you burn that bridge. Take what your parents are willing to give you, hold love and forgiveness for them in your heart without compromising your boundaries, and be prepared to live your truth! You are you, and nobody can take that away from you.
Insert* ""you do it for her"" lyrics -steven universe
I’m proud of you, girl. My dad was/is also a homophobic and transphobic POS, and I was nearly twice your age when I started my medical transition: still loving every minute of it.

Like you, I lost all support and chances of inheritance: I currently live in a camper and wait tables @36. The comfortable life I could have had came with too many strings attached, and I would rather be a poor trailer park girl than a middle class repressed 🥚.

Follow your heart, and live your best life. Also capitalism must be destroyed.

🖤💖🏴🏳️‍⚧️🏴💖🖤
If you disappear for a while after you turn 18 it’s possible your mother will come around.
Good for you. Live your best life, sis. 

If parents can’t support who their kids are, the kids aren’t going to stick around.
Absolute goddess mentality 🫡 

I’m really sorry your parents are transphobic. That sounds agonizingly difficult and I wouldn’t even begin to know what to do in your situation. You are an incredibly strong woman. She will prevail ✊
Your situation is sad but not uncommon.  In the end, you'll have to live the life you desire....one that fits you best.  Life is really short and being happy cannot be undervalued.  There's hope you'll find peace with your parents.  My experience was similar to yours but because my parents divorced long before my transition they didn't have their own marriage to save.  Mom was supportive and dad was not.  I pressed forward and did what I knew was best for me.  Fully transitioned......including work etc.  Everything worked out over the course of some years.  I have high hopes it can for you as well.   If possible, try not to be too angry with your parents.....they'll need time.  In the meantime, begin making your plans with the assistance of anyone in the right places to help you.
I am on the same boat. However, I’m almost 22 in two months and still live with my parents. I’ve been out for 4 years and medically transitioning for nearly 2. In the meantime of trying to get accepted into a job and doing what I can around the house, my family makes my transition about themselves. That I’m “selfish” and that the entire world doesn’t revolve around me, and if someone declines to call me my preferred name and pronouns, that’s “their boundary”. Any boundaries I make regarding to being respected gets thrown out the window. I either have to submit to being called my deadname and “she” all day, or resort to unnecessary drama all because of a fucking name and pronouns. My mom is trying to come around but resorts back to deadnaming and misgendering, it’s a frustrating cycle. 

My advice is apply to as many good paying jobs as possible. Save up and move out when you can.
You have to pay attention to that hostility. That is the dark side of love right there. That is the true face of their love, a self-serving love betrayed. The veil is lifted and maybe the first time in your life, they are showing you a deep essence of their true self, maybe the most sincere thing they ever showed you, next to the joy they expressed when you most perfectly matched or exceeded their expectations. 

But I think it's important at the same time to see it with some compassion and some hope and to not mistake it for the totality of their love. They may change. Limbic creatures detest change and will fight it tooth and nail, but some of us are also eventually capable of being human.
If youre in the US they are legally required to have you inherit 1/3rd of their money if you are their next of kin.
so much love and strength to you. ❤️
You are such a strong woman
I'm so sorry you are on this situation. I came put at 45 completely independent and kind of had the same reactions. Mom not comfortable and dad rejecting. Eventually my mom came around but dad is stuck in transphobia. My mom is avoiding to take much sides and ultimately she lives with him. If I had come out at your age I would have had the same situation that you are having plus violence. 
It's sad to realize you are losing them more every day but in the other hand you are working on your own happiness. You won't be happy without transitioning, so you better understand what lies ahead of you. 🫂
I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I'm in something similar. My parents are less outright hostile, and I""m older, but it rings true too. Please, when you are able to get out of there cut them out of your life and don't look back.

Your family sucks, but it won't be the same. You will make a new one. You'll find people that actually care about you and make you feel happy. People call the concept a found family, but regardless it's real. <3

PS: Make sure you have your documentation, like your ID and birth certificate, any money you have earned, and anything else with you just in case. Some people can be cruel. And that their names aren't on any accounts you have. If you have a bank account as a minor I believe you have to have a parent/guardian open the account with you.

Good luck. You'll be able to be yourself soon enough. <3

Been there, good luck on your journey, it's a difficult one, but definetly doable!

Quick tip: make sure the place you move to can be set as your homeadress, otherwise your parents will get your post, and can use this against you.
I’m so sorry man. Goodluck, do it for yourself. People who truly love and care about you for you will come around.
Same lol
Same lol
You're already so self-aware and that's a great start! I'm really hoping you have somewhere to go at 18, because I wouldn't live with them 1 minute more than I have to. For them to deny you that is cruel at best, these are the types of parents that claim to be good parents but then wonder why their kids don't talk to them. Trust me, this is tragically more common than it should be. But you've already got a great head on your shoulders, I know you'll do great out there! And once you find a space of your own a massive weight will be lifted from your shoulders. Hang in there!
are you me? this is my exact situation, ages and everything. i will read the comments religiously
I get that feeling. No family or friends close enough to call that.
That's so strong of you, I could benefit from a fraction of the guts you have 💜🙏🏻
This post gave me a lot of hope. I’m also seventeen, and in a nearly identical situation where my parents don’t accept me, especially medical transition. My parents have the same dynamic as well. I’m FTM not MTF but I’ve never related to a post more. You’re not alone OP, and I wish you a lot of luck. ❤️
do it for her!! YES!! i’m so sorry this is happening, and i’m so sorry it’s such a relatable and universal experience for most of us. i’m wishing you only the best for yourself!
Thank you for making this. I'm in a similar position and christ this made me feel like what I'm doing with myself actually makes some sort of sense haha. I'm still getting used to being me and this really did help me. I wish you the best of luck, and seriously thank you for making this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who needed to read this. Just remember you're never alone and that you're also a total badass in my eyes :)
I legit had to look my father dead in the face and say, ""you either accept me as your son and stop your shit, or you can bury me in the ground and have no children"" course I was 21 but it still hit him hard and made him think about what I ment to him.
I'm sorry to hear that :(
If it's of any help, I'm a trans girl about to turn 17 and dms are always open if you need someone to talk to 💜
Happy cake day
Thank you, I appreciate the kind words.
Wow this is a beautiful comment.
This is really good advice! Prioritize your education; it will make transitioning much easier and will make it easier to find other trans people and sources of support and found family.
This comment is so beautiful, I love this community so much
Thank you for saying that. I will admit the journey ahead is gonna be pretty rough but I’m willing to accept whatever comes my way to secure my happiness.
I can’t describe how much it pains me to have to live into my older years and look back on a childhood I never had. The fact that all of that was denied from me and actively so, hurts so much. I feel like if my dad could, he would be actively more violent towards me being trans but thankfully the laws are a thing. I just can’t shake the feeling that I have to inevitable live with all this baggage that I feel no one will ever be able to truly understand.
Delete this shit.
Am nearly 40, the only thing that hit me like a rock is how sweet my life is without kids.
I think he’s just transphobic. And this comment is generally pretty dumb.
Op is the only one who decides if they have children or not. Pretty simple right?
You're so very welcome.
Thank you 🙏

It’s an overwhelming generalization based on your personal experience. Some people have kids in their twenties. Some people have kids in their teens. Some people never have kids. Some people choose to bank sperm in their twenties because they’ve fully and seriously considered the kinds of family planning they want to do. Some people just wing it. Some 18 year olds do what is best for themselves. Some 18 year olds make big, stupid choices. Any post that generalizes about what everyone does in their 20s is a pretty dumb. Don’t you think?
I briefly went through your profile history/comments and noticed you casually dropping slurs such as the f slur and the r slur. After a dumb comment like this i had to check and now im curious why are you even here?
Based on what you're saying op would already be familiar with this concept so ... What are you adding to this conversation? Rather than just distracting from ops valid points by implying they should sacrifice their mental heath for their parents opinions and biasis. And your own opinions and biasis.

Heyoo lovelies! Any work related stories where your trans-identity has given you problems? Know there are a lot of shitty bosses and customers out there, expose them 😤👌 Working at hecking 7-11 myself but I'm lucky enough to pass so I'm incognito mode🕵️‍♂️ 8 months hrt		"I work at AT&T as a sales consultant. When I went full time, one of my first customers would only address me as ""Caitlyn Jenner"". I corrected them and reemphasised my name. Continued to be disrespectful. I told them it was obvious we weren't seeing eye to eye and would get them a new sales representative. I told a manager I was stepping away from the interaction and told him the story. He then made the customer leave the store unassisted and to return when he can treat all employees with respect. Soo atleast work is supportive..
Same I'm incognito mode but for the opposite I dress as a male everyday and will have to untill I can pass because my boss is transphobic and would find a reason to fire me if he knew I was trans...only reason I stay and play spy is for the insurance so I can transition
I used to work as a cashier at Goodwill and started getting a lot of unpleasant remarks from the customers. ""Hello sir, er ma'am, or whatever"" all day long. Some were even more cruel. It was awful. It started to affect my mental health and like a weak idiot I started to call out of work more just to avoid dealing with that. Lost my job soon after. This was late October 2019. Nobody will hire me. I've had plenty of interviews and nobody wants to hire me. It's awful. I've never gone this long without a job. Almost makes me want to revert back to being him just to find a job. Rent is due next week and I honestly have no idea how I'm gonna pull this off. It's scary. Very stressful times.
Customers I haven’t so much had to deal with since I haven’t started HRT yet, so I still look male. But some co workers and a manager of mine know and they’re chill. Where I work, theres some other people of whom identify in the LGBTQ+ community so I don’t get anything negative for it.
Working with kids, and starting my job as a a guy and transitioning caused a lot of confussion, most people have been supportive, but i often get deadnamed, and recently a kid called me “miss man” lol
I'm not out at work (yet), but I have had to argue against some normal transphobic misinformation from coworkers. Nothing too bad though

Good thing recently is I swapped from a position that had me in a baggy yellow vest to a better fitting apron and it's giving me weird levels of euphoria lol
You are so pretty!
You are actual fucking goals
I get misgendered all the time at work and it’s awful. Also since transitioning I swear some of my bosses are on my ass constantly trying to find something to get me for. I’ve worked there 10 years and I’m so over it, but the benefits are paying from my GRS so I have to stick it out for now :(


You look beautiful!
I was using the men's bathrooms at work in a building full of state lawyers, they all complained about me one lady went so far as to ""proclaim"" herself trans for ten minutes in front of me to use the men's room while we cleaned the women's. 
 
I got reprimanded for saying to her ""lady its not that easy""

Eventually I was moved from that building because of the complaints they wanted me using only a gender neutral bathroom. 



At the job before this I used to get told to ""fold clothes with the other women"" and forced to stock in the makeup isle. 

People would magically forget my pronouns and such. 

I guess it's my fault for wearing makeup and still holding onto feminine traits.
I work at a call center. Im trans ftm, and I use the mens bathroom... There WAS this transphobe who constantly misgendered me and another trans coworker, I cant go quite incognito because some systems everyone can see has my dead name (havent gotten it legally changed yet), so you bet your sweet bucks.. as soon as he saw that, he started dead naming me too. Pissed me off. One day I was in the bathroom and this fucker comes out of a stall as I'm washing my hands and asks me why I'm in the mens bathroom. I looked at him and was like ""excuse me?"" I hardly dignified it with a response and left. Told my supervisor and my supervisors super visor too because I know her s/o is nonbinary and she doesnt stand for that crap. Had it sent all the way up to hr and that was the nail in the coffin for him. He was fired for that :)
Not a terrible story, but a new hire at my job(I work at a restaurant, we were in the kitchen for this shift) was referencing me and said, ‘she’ so I corrected him. His response was, ‘Sorry. I saw you and thought you were a dude, but then I heard your voice.’ My voice, even as a kid, was/is not overly high, not high at all, most people assume I’m a cis man because of it and how I dress, so that comment hurt a lot, even thought it’s a minor comment. I do get a lot of customers that address me correctly and the ones that are unsure usually just don’t use gendered terms while they talk to me. Overall pretty stealth to the newbies and customers, since my boss is lesbian and a bunch of coworkers are LGBT+ they all know and don’t have a problem, but that comment tore some of my new confidence down.
Other than being unable to get one, I have no stories of being trans in the workplace
I pass outside of work but am terrified to go full time my own self conscious.
I work as a server for TGI Fridays full-time. I've had a few issues not any real big ones however. Misgendered worse some days than other. I'm fairly androgynous with some days being more feminine than others. Being the feminine side of it helps that when I do correct people it sticks. 

The worse was when I fist started prehrt. I've had table ask for another server saying they has kids. The management is super supportive and just told them that if you can't respect my server you should just go to chikfila as you won't be eating here. 
Keep it up! And to others who have issues I totally understand. My recommendation is if it gets to be too hard go for restaurant work when you can't find work. They normally are super supportive and understanding at least until you find something better. 
Don't give up!
And remember: Their approval is neither required nor desired.
I don’t have any stories about myself (ftm) but my mom and I went to vans store to return some shoes. Of the three people working there, two used they/them pronouns (they both had pronoun pins on) and she midgendered both of them. I think she noticed their pronoun pins afterwards and felt sorry but then we left the store. I was very nervous the rest of the day. The whole experience made me even more hesitant to come out to her. ￼
Unrelated to your question but your makeup is just gorgeous, although I can totally see you passing 150% even without it
Yah gorgeous
Your perfect!
Wow... 😍You are a pure female beauty.
I did just quit my job but it wasn't because of being trans my boss was just an all around cunt
I work at a pizza place. I face more issues with the customers than with my bosses or coworkers. I introduce myself when I answer the phone and give the customer my name before taking their order. I legally changed my name to ""Jack""  last year so that's the name I give them. But some customers get really confused because my voice doesn't sound very masculine for a person named Jack. 

I am 6 months on T and right in the middle of my voice dropping so I'm very squeaky and my voice cracks a lot. And when I enter Customer Service Mode™ my voice gets higher pitched. 

Customers have started questioning me if Im a girl or a boy. And if the name Jack is short for Jacqueline or whatever. 

I've become so much more dysphoric at work and answering phones since these customers have so many questions. I am often left red in the face and am forced to bring the focus back to taking their pizza order. 

I can't wait for the day when im finally able to be incognito. 🕵🏻‍♂️
Coooot!
I didn't lose my job when I first came out as trans, but a month after someone in my company found out I was dating men things got a lot worse real fast. Within a month they changed everything about my role at the company and then used my deficiencies in this new role to make up enough reasons to fire me semi-legitimately, to the point where I'll have a hard time fighting it.

I worked at the company for 6 years and was considered their top empoyee when I came out and started dressing full time as a woman and coworkers were ok-ish about things, but over time more and more problems started to arise and after a year I was still being misgendered by the owner regularly and despite me being very high up in the company people started to undermine my work constantly.

I was already dealing with a lot at the time as my mom was on her death bed with extremely bad cancer, when they found out I was dating men. The owner asked me into his office not too long after and asked me if I needed to go so ""full force"" with my transition and suggested I slow down.

Two weeks later I was fired shortly after I was checked into a hospital program when I had a mental breakdown due to all the stress I was under at the time.

Two weeks after that my mom finally passed away.

It honestly felt like they took advantage of a rough time in my life to force me out leaving little recourse to fight back.
You are lovely!
I work at a regional fast food place and I love it. I don't get misgendered by customers and my preferred name is on my name tag. Unfortunately, since I don't have my name changed on my Social Security card and driver's license yet, I have my deadname in the system, and sometimes my coworkers misgender me, which really bothers me.
Omg you’re so fucking pretty
I've been way too nervous to apply for a job yet... haven't changed anything legally and I don't rly know what to do.
My work has been very supportive of me. I've had to rarely correct my coworkers and the only transphobic employee we openly had, I had a hand in getting fired when I overheard him saying some nasty shit about one of my fellow trans coworkers.

As far as issues go, I've had some compatibility issues with the two trans co-workers I have. For various reasons, they just don't like me much and I think it has to do with me being open about being trans. I'm not afraid of talking to people about it and they try to be much more incognito. I've even been told I'm more passable then them and it might have to do with them being jealous of me for all I know.
When I started working with crazy shirts (graphic tshirt chain) I was just starting my transition. My bosses were very supportive for a while and since one of them was actually in and LGBT relationship, I believed I was in an inclusive and supportive work environment when one day my boss comes up to me saying I had been 5 minutes late the day before. I knew I clocked in 7 minutes early because I had to write it in the overages book. Slowly over months this continued and I would be given more and dirtier jobs. The whole time I was given tardies on my record even though I never was late. Eventually the company decided to let me go and I didn’t make a fuss since i had been shown the door for months. Moral of the story is to not trust lesbians lol jk but for real, just because your manager may be lgbtq* doesnt mean you’re safe from discrimination. 
TLDR don’t work at crazy shirts
looking amazing! <3
wow, you are absolutely gorgeous. i hope one day I'll be able to look similar. You're so inspiring.
I work at GameStop and I get men who say ""Oh you're a girl, you dont know anything about games""
Or I get little kids going ""You talk like a boy!!!""
Beautiful human being 😍
Pre-T I worked at a donut shop and was going by my birth name. (Wasn't safe for me yet) Then I couldn't stand it anymore and started T and changed my name at the same time. And everyone still called me by my birthname, even when I grew very evident facial hair. 😓😵😬 Being called 'she/her' when having an actual beard; besides being disphoric, is an overall very strange experience.
........?you should be modeling
I work in a production line plant that makes food for 7-11 and Starbucks, we work with local jail work release so there's a lot of jail culture there. My direct supervisor is homophobic and transphobic, he misgenders me when my pace slows or he's not happy with the way I'm working. He did it in front of a trusted supervisor one day, I told her I was getting tired of him waiting for me to slow down to disrespect me, I think she threatened a write up because later on break he pulled me in private to 'apologize'. I told him that typically I'll correct someone 3 or 4 times, because I know the way I look and sound don't align, and that after that I just consider you to be disrespectful and let you go on your disrespectful way. He hasn't done anything of the sort since, probably for his own job security, but a trans girl on another production line who isn't as passable gets shit said to her face by supervisors and co-workers on a daily basis, some people really have no self respect or self love and it shows in the way they have to talk down to people to make themselves feel better
Well, unless you’re counting a peasant-class didicoy named Big Tinker, then not many.
Omg I would die of slurpee 😍
Omfg, some people 😤🤬😤🤬😤
I've heard too many stories where the manager sided with the customer, and disciplined the employee. But I'm glad things are starting to change.
Pro gamer move
Wishing you the best of luck :'((💓💓
Oof, miss man is pretty savage :') but smoll kids be smoll kids ya know
Thx uwuwuwuwu
It's never your fault that those people were shitty. That's purely on them.
Hey just so you know you sound pretty cool.
Glad to hear he got fired 💕💕 I'm sorry you have to deal with those people still in 2020
I used to work in a call center for a few years, even in the sticks they were very open colorful supportive people. Glad to hear you got some justice served and you have a good work family
Your boss is bad ass for telling those idiots to essentially fuck off. This makes me happy :)
Thank you 💓💓💓💓 I love playing around with makeup 💕💕💕
Man that is some really shitty treatment, one thing I've learned since I started going to a new clinic in DC is that in situations like these you actually have a lot of backup to make a discrimination claim. Anytime you're pulled in to a 'private meeting', make sure you audio record it on your phone, you never know what someone might say that can be used against them later
💕😍💕😍💕thxxxx
Man, some people :(((
Thx ÚwÙ 💕
Yep! My management team and every single employee have had my back from day one.... and I live and work in the Bible Belt..
Thanks. I just wish society was more accepting of hiring trans people that aren't quite passable. I'm 6'2"" and have a deep voice, so unfortunately I'm unable to seamlessly blend in without getting strange stares all day long. Anyway enough of my sob story. I'm hopeful that an opportunity will eventually arise.
No you
Yep, as much as this place can suck sometimes, I'm lucky they support me in that way. Its very rare for anyone to misgender me and I never get dead named. Throws my supervisors off when they are looking up my numbers and type in my chosen name only for nothing to show and they are like ""god this throws me off everytime, I'm sorry. *types in dead name*""
I am still learning but I also love playing with it, I will try to replicate your look here one of these days!
I wish I was clear minded enough to think of this at the time, but with everything else I was dealing with I was already so overwhelmed.
Welcome 😊
Voice you can always practice :0, I had a deep voice to, but I've always loved singing so I'm good at going high, and by forcing myself to talk in the highest pitch I could everyday for many months I ended up normalizing the high pitch voice and I no longer had to force it, now 3 years after I can go even higher :3. And there are a lot of cis woman who are 6,2 so it ukiii 💕💕 there are a lot of voice training resources out there :3
I just hope someone sees my advice and takes it to heart and it helps them in the future, sadly the past is in stone but it sounds like even if you were successful in the company you wouldn't have found happiness in that environment"	f8q6ww	trans	1073	0.99	2020-02-24 11:57:55
why should I disclose that you are trans	"If you are stealth + post op why should you have to disclose to anyone that you are trans?

The only people that know I am trans are my family and a few doctors.I dont feel like I need to disclose such a intimate part of my identity to friends and people I date.I am a woman and I shouldnt have to give out private medical information to anyone that doesnt absolutely need to know abou it"	"I mostly do it because I don't want to spend time with anyone who would have an issue with me being trans anyway.  
  
Definitely don't *have* to do anything though, we don't owe cis people a thing.
Correct. You don't have to tell anyone. It is of no relevance whatsoever save maybe a few medical which, personally I would tell my long time partners. 

Your life, your decisions. Nobody needs to know
Plenty of us are out and proud for as many varied reasons as people are stealth. You don't need to disclose Shit.
Don't disclose unless you want to. It's none of their business
I only disclose that to dates and guys i meet. I feel that’s important for the guys i meet that they know so I won’t get myself into trouble if they find out differently. Plus, having to start off in an honest foot is always a one step to a healthy relationship. I think the guys ive been or will be with deserves to know what they’re getting themselves into. Don’t do it if you’re not comfortable.
i feel the same. I also dont disclose iam trans in my daily life. Why should they know it usually and unfortunately only complicates things in life. And i dont feel like i want to life my life as trans advocate all day long. Since there is still a lot of transfobia in the world this is prob what would end up happing if i disclose.  
In an ideal world though it would be nice if it didnt matter and it saddens me inside it does.   
That said i still try to actively fight transfobia if i hear/see about it around me.
For the most part I’m already pretty andro which allows me to go stealth if I want to. Even though my voice is pretty good I actually have some vocal damage so I don’t have to lie about that if people pick up on anything weird about my voice.

As far as disclosing it goes I really don’t disclose myself being trans very often because in most circles it brings unwanted attention and negativity that I don’t need in my life. Once I get bottom surgery I don’t think I’m going to reveal it unless it’s to prove a point, improve LGBT awareness, or something similar. Otherwise it’s just not important
People you date long term, you absolutely should. For safety if nothing else. People can get violent.
I think the main reason it happens is when people want to keep a significant number of friends or acquaintances from before they were out. 

If not, then I don't see why you need to let people you meet casually know.
This. As there are anti-Trans people than supporters. I think it should be a secret to the person themselves. I got harassed for coming out months ago. It’s not worth it.
You definitely don’t have to disclose it to anyone, but I think if you are in a serious relationship it’s an important thing to share at some point. It’s part of who you are, it’s shaped the person you are, it affects things like family planning, and if you are together long enough you are bound to experience medical issues which it may impact, also if your family and friends know then they will likely inevitably find out and question why you didn’t tell them sooner. You don’t have to tell casual acquaintances or really anyone, but for your safety and prolonged happiness I would tell serious partners.
Not necessarily a ""have to"", but I like being a representative of trans people and do my best to make us a bit more common knowledge. But only if I feel it's safe to do.
There's only one instance this would be important to mention. If your partner wants biological children with you. That's it.
You don’t have too! It’s not an obligation!
you don't have to unless you want to. unfortunately disclosing that you're trans is often life-threatening, and there is simply no reason to endanger yourself like that. share only with people you really trust and who you know will accept it as a hard thing you dealt with, not as a reason to change how they perceive you.

anyone who feels lied to or tricked or duped by someone not disclosing that they're trans is just a transphobe. they aren't worth your time.
Personally I can't imagine keeping major secrets like that from a serious partner. I'm open about all aspects of my past with people I date seriously.
I couldn't keep it a secret forever, and I don't want to find out what keeping that big of a secret might do to a long term relationship
I don’t think you need to and you are allowed to share as much or as little as you want about yourself. 

Two things that float to my mind are:

1. If you’re in an intimate relationship with someone they probably should know. Being trans usually means being infertile which is something to discuss with a potential life long partner. In addition, I personally would be worried about them finding out and having it ruin the relationship. Like they might be offended or upset that you “lied” or “misled” them by not being upfront about it. Not saying that’s right, just that is how some people feel. 

2. I think there is a certain benefit to the trans community at large by more trans ppl being openly out. More visibility in the trans community is never a bad thing. The issue is ppl are transphobic, not trans people for just being themselves. No one should treat you differently for being trans. Being able to pass as cis is a privilege not all trans ppl have, and very few other minority groups have. People of color, gay people, disabled folks, all rarely have the ability to “hide” their minority status, and (to me) it feels a bit unfair that some trans people can and don’t help to change the stigma. 

I say all of this as a passing trans woman who often rarely discloses her trans status. I think, it’s not something I go around telling *everyone* but once I get to know someone well enough I usually do share it to avoid any awkward situations. It’s also plastered all over my socials, so once someone adds me on IG it becomes pretty apparent. I don’t think it’s something you need to shout from the rooftops, but also I hope that you don’t feel ashamed or scared to tell people. 

I guess I would turn the question around on you…why *shouldn’t* you tell people? If you believe there’s no shame in being trans, and that trans and cis people should be treated equally, why would you have a problem with being open about it?
The only information that in any way pertains to them is that you are infertile, any other information is completely unnecessary.
You don’t have to disclose to anyone in your regular life. The one exception I would say is being in relationship with someone who wants to have children, it might be a necessary conversation. But I’m of course no expert on relationships and happy to hear if folks disagree.
you have absolutely no reason to. i don't even view it as part of my identity but rather a process. like if i had surgery to correct a cleft pallet why would i tell people? the only reason dates want to know is because they're transphobic
I would only disclose that I am trans to my (future (sad)) partner. Until I get bottom surgery then it doesn't really matter if they know or not. 

To clarify, I would most likely only disclose if it were a sexual & romantic relationship.
i don’t do it, but when people i’m close to ask, i tell them. one friend was super pressed about it tho. he thought that every trans person was legally required to tell their partner that they’re trans. bro that took forever to explain to him🥲
Nobody has to know. That's literally none of their business..
I'm already married so like, the only people I plan to tell for the future are those that need my legal information.

HR, doctors, law enforcement, the BMV.
I feel like any SERIOUS relationship would require trusting the person enough to let them know about your life and experiences. 
But a casual fling, or a first date? Nah. Not unless you want to.
I think that if you are in a long term romantic/sexual relationship with someone, you should probably disclose, if for nothing else, the fact that you can't have biological kids together.

But on the first few, or 10, or 20 dates?  Yeah, no requirement to disclose.
You don’t need to disclose that to anyone.

There is only one, and for me really ONLY ONE reason or situation where it would be required: if a AMAB partner wanted children. Then, and only then, would I disclose it. Otherwise, only if I absolutely, positively feel that it is a “Good Thing™️”
I generally disclose to people if I think we're going to be friends longer term. Not because I ""should"" or ""have to"", there's no deception if I don't and I don't owe that info to anyone. 

The reason I do it is because it's a part of my life and I want to be able to talk freely about my experiences. I don't want people in my life who treat me different for being trans. I don't want to have to censor myself and think about how to tiptoe around certain words and situations in my past.

Like if I talk about high school I have a story about how I was pissed that the boys got to do some wrestling but the girls didn't (I'm a trans man.) If people know, it's like telling any other story.  If they don't, it makes no sense. 

When my friends who wear bras talk about how much they suck, I can be like ""yes bras suck, I remember."" 

My deadname pops up in random places still, even after being legally changed for several years, and it's not fun but I don't have to make up some story about it to explain it away. It is what it is.

But I've also been lucky that nobody treats me differently because I'm trans, maybe things would be different if that were a problem for me. 

I'm not trying to say it's bad if you *do* want to make up stories for things, I just don't have the energy or motivation to do so. That's your private medical information, only you get to decide who knows.
I don't think you have to be post op to be stealth either
I always disclose. It’s an act of good faith. And I’m not ashamed or afraid of being trans. I would tell them because I would not want to miss out on someone great if they felt I was dishonest early on.
That's the beauty of choice: it's your life, your body, and ultimately your rules. You don't have to disclose jack if you don't want to.
I would only disclose it to people who you want to be romantically or sexually involved with, nobody else needs to know because it shouldn’t effect your relationship.
I wish I was passing and post op that would be amazing I don't feel I would need to disclose that I'm trans unless my partner wants to make babies but I'm transfem and I'm mostly into dating literally anyone who's trans regardless of gender (cis ppl scary)
You don’t have to and I wouldn’t. The second I fully transition I’m not saying anything.
Does it ever scare you that you might get a violent reaction from a partner who finds out later? Especially if that person would have made a different choice if presented the option.
I think I'd disclose it to a potential long term partner because of the fertility part. Otherwise I don't see any reason too at all.
I've never disclosed, if they find out they find out, if they're pissed I just stop talking to them. I shouldn't have to tell you what's in my pants, or the constant pain I feel everyday. You don't tell a complete stranger your dick/cup size, show them pictures, etc. so why should I have to?
i only disclose being trans if i’m going to be doing smth involving my genitalia, or atleast once i pass thats my plan. but post op you don’t need to tell anyone
God I wish this was something I had to worry about.

I guess it depends on your age and where you are in your life as to how you feel about this. It is also a reflection of when you transitioned. 

For the kids,  passing that well is a real thing and I know all I ever wanted was to be a cis girl. But I’m not, and that isn’t a fact I can just wish away. 

If you are actively out for hookups and sex with no strings, while this has never been my thing, I can understand if you would want to be completely stealth. But when you have or are looking for a life partner you are sharing all of yourself with that person - there is no room there for secrets of any kind because complete trust is the basis of real relationships.

As for everyone else in your life - its none of their business.
I personally (if I were at a point where I'd had bottom surgery and could go stealth) I would probably disclose to my partner. Odds are I'll have a partner who's part of the LGBTQIA+community anyways.

Also I'm not the kinda girl to hookup with strangers but if I were I wouldn't disclose. If you're the kinda person to hook up with someone you've got to be ok with the fact that you might be sleeping with a trans person and that they might not tell you because they know trans panic is a problem in cishet people and some states even have the ""trans panic defense"" so a transphobe could get either off the hook or a lightened sentence when they kill a trans person. And if you're not ok with the possibility of sleeping with a trans person you're not mature enough to hookup with anyone.
That is a Speech 100 way of explains that 🥲
It helps declare to others that you are a safe space i think
I have a similar opinion, once I get surgery I dont need to tell anyone, but, I think that in a long term relationship I should tell it, not for any issue with trans people but for future conversations about parenting for example, alltough u are free to tell whoever u feel to :3
I only disclose on dating apps, mostly because it is important for the people there to know - I can only date someone who is okay with me being trans. Especially because I won't be having certain surgeries and I need to date someone who is okay with that, even more so if we end up having a sexual relationship.
I usually don’t. I’m not even post op, and am yet to start hrt. But I pass well enough, and I just don’t tell people, like colleagues and such, at all.
Always when dating, all other people it’s not their business. Also I’m pre everything so I don’t have a choice
You don't need to tell anyone. Speaking for myself I tell people and tend to be pretty out there with it but then not everyone is obligated to feel that way. I think people should be allowed to judge for themselves what level of out-thereness they express if any.
You dont have to. It's not your obligation.
You don't have to at all. IMHO though, I want to be proud and visible eventually, but it is always my choice when and to who to tell. Personally, I don't want to trade one closet for another. I'm tired of secrets, they are exhausting.

But more importantly, Visibility is crucial for trans rights. I want to normalize and undo the horrible cishet created trans-boogyman that is pervasive. 

Not everyone can do this safely, it's definitely a privilege. Yet some of us can, and I'd encourage that.
Personally I think there’s no reason to tell anybody except those you date. I am MTF myself but I would not like it if someone was not honest with me. I don’t know I guess it’s something of respecting somebody’s sexuality and if they’re not into trans people I understand, doesn’t mean they hate trans people but everyone had their own type and it feels dishonest not telling them, to me. Kinda like catfishing but different. 
(Example: Like if you are a trans woman and can’t bare children that’s something your date should know, maybe they want to have blood related kids with someone) Everybody else I agree you don’t owe it to them to tell people. They’re personally not closely involved in your life so it’s nobody’s business, even friends, but those you date can be within those personal boundaries so it’s just respecting what they like. Also for safety because some people might not respond well to it and could harm you. Doesn’t make you less of what your preferred gender is though. You are your preferred gender and deserve to be!
I would tell anyone you get into a relationship with. It's a really big part of your life and they deserve to know. My therapist compared it to not telling a potential partner that you have kids.
I’m not sure why we must disclose to anyone, I’ve gotten to the point now that I have cis reasons in mine for my facial hair if anyone rudely asks me :) just gotta say it’s a hormone imbalance no one needs to know I’m trans. You can think of reasons that a cis person could never have children and use those if you really wanna keep the information to yourself for the rest of your life. No one is owed anything about you being comfy in your own skin.
I wouldn’t tell anyone. I dont see the point. If someone is transphobic that will come out in general conversation. You don’t have to be the subject of it.
Therapist and I talked about this. I don’t have to tell anyone unless I expect it to be long term, and even long term it’s just out of courtesy and what you feel you need to do.
Im not on T or anything yet but I feel like even when I 100% pass I’ll still have to tell certain people (like romantic partners) that I’m trans since it could be very dangerous if they found out some other way. I’d rather lose a potential boyfriend than have him find out later in the relationship and try to kill or harm me for “lying”
Yes its unnecessary to disclose.
Only to a partner it think this should not be private since there may be a wish for biological children. But its nothing i would tell on the first date.
No you never have to tell anyone, I do it because I don't waste my time with transphobe and idk if I pass.
If you don't want to tell people don't, we don't owe this to cis people.
When it comes to a relationship the first step is honesty, otherwise you’re starting off with secrets
If people want trans people to always tell others they are trans like as a first thing then we gotta start telling people our race, ethnicity, religion, IQ, age, height, weight because some people have a preference for those too
I’m a woman but I’m still genetically male. I don’t care for all the labels, but I would never date anyone or be intimate with anyone unless they knew that I was genetically male. Just comes down to honesty and respect. 
For every day stuff, nobody needs to know.
I do it because some people dont like pepes
I think that the only real situation where you're a *bad* person if you don't disclose is with a sexual partner. It's not just a safety thing, but also a consent thing.

Besides, if my partner doesn't want to have sex with trans women, why am I interested in having sex with them?
If you were going to have sex with someone, they should know even if it doesn’t make a difference imo
Just make sure you are clear you can’t have kids if things get at all serious with someone you are dating. That’s a deal breaker for some.
even before any of that, unless it comes to undressing, you shouldnt disclose it at all. like actually should not
Maybe just in case in case a person would expose you BUT I think disclosing to someone you truly love and trust
If it’s a romantic partner or just a straight up hookup I feel like the individual should be aware of it. I feel like keeping it a secret from someone you are dating or have the intention of dating is disrespectful and might even result in putting yourself in danger if they end up knowing about your “past”. At least that’s how I view it.
you shouldn't have to, although with partners you should say your post op after a bit
Post-op, I don't think you need to
You don't have to, but it might issues in your dating life if you don't.
Obviously friends and strangers don’t need to know cuz it’s not their business, but if dating someone or being intimate then yea they deserve to know.
Who is telling you (individually) that you *have* to disclose? Like did something happen to you or are you talking about things you've read/heard from others?
I dont because im life in Poland…
I think it is all about knowing the people that surrounds you. If u think u live in a community where there is so much love and respect I don't really mind sharing. But I put my guards up to people I dnt trust :)
Huh… never thought of that
Well I don't pass but when I eventually do I'm going to stealth and only tell my partners but that's all who needs to know. I'll still always be proud to be trans though
You dont need to disclose that if u dont want to, its up to the person itself to decide! For me i decided to be openly trans and i proudly tell people that i am a transgender and many dont know whats that then i say a man in a womans body, and theyre chill with it and mostly are nice, but i do that mostly cause i just want people to know that yes transgender people exist and were just humans! i am proud of being trans and having people that no matter what love me with me ^^
I never understood why it matters post op... I mean unless your advocating or something you are what you are at that point.
See I’ve solved this issue by only really being friends with other queer and trans people, but I also don’t pass yet and truly don’t ever know if i will so theres not really another option atm
i hate how many people are adding 'UNLESS: random scenario' like. cmon y'all.
I just think that people,even those that arent transphobic treat you different once they find out you are trans so I would rather they see me just as a woman
This is my stance too. I don't try to hide my trans history (not that I could with my body type anyway) and I really wouldn't want to hang with someone who was going to treat me vastly different for being trans anyway. 

I'm lucky to live in an area with a lot of trans folks, so almost everyone I know has at least 2 or 3 other trans friends (usually more), so it's extremely normalized.
What exactly are they ""getting themselves into""?
ultimately nobody *has* to
Even people, I dont meet casually,why should I tell them?

How many of us knows about our friends private medical data? I honestly dont think you should tell anyone that doesnt absolutely need to know
Same here. I'm pretty out there yet since I'm disabled and stuck in bed most of my interaction is online. It's easy for me to be out there in Second Life where I do most of my social interaction or on Twitter. Plus I live in a house full of ex-Air Force people who have kids who are in the military-one of whom is a Navy SEAL. I don't have to worry as much about someone coming here to mess with me.
even then, cis people sometimes cant have children.
>I guess I would turn the question around on you…why shouldn’t you tell people? If you believe there’s no shame in being trans, and that trans and cis people should be treated equally, why would you have a problem with being open about it?

Becauase mots people will treat you different once they realize you are trans.Also its safer to be stealth
“legally required” … jesus. Well I guess thats what the alt right want everyone to believe.
Honestly? HR, law enforcement and the BMW only need to know your current legal information. They don't need to know that you're trans.
> doctors

as a note, you don't need to disclose you're trans to doctors, unless it is relevant to whatever medical problem you are having.  In fact, it's often a good idea to NOT disclose this to medical personnel, in order to avoid 'trans broken arm syndrome', which is when whatever your medical problem is, is blamed on being trans, without any logical reason why, or further investigation.

Doctor, I think my arm is broken.

Oh, that's because you're trans, you need to stop being trans, it will fix your broken arm.
Why would any of these other than your dr have any need of this info?
This perfectly sums up my view as a trans woman also.
that is Not the same. being trans is not an extention of yourself, as a child is. being trans is just being **you**
Why?
Why should you disclose if you undress though?
For me personally I don't have any issues with sharing that I'm trans to people. Most people don't treat me an ounce different from other women and people that are close to me regularly forget I'm trans too.  


But it's okay if you don't want to tell. In your case I'd say the only like really important thing you should disclose to anyone you see a future with is that you can't bear any children but yea. Personal preferences in going about in your life it's all up to you, just wanna share that it's not all bad or bleak or whatever.

Exactly the same here, as soon as someone finds out your trans their thought immediately go to your fucking genitals, why the fuck should I give anyone the right to speculate about my body.
I mean some people might but it really depends what you mean when you say, 'treat you different'. Treating you different isn't necessarily a bad thing. That said it's totally up to you whether to tell people or not.
A relationship with a trans person, I presume
Well, if someone knew you before you were out and now you're post op and passing well enough to go completely stealth... the change makes it's kinda obvious unless you break all contact.

That doesn't mean you have to go into any details other than 'well, yeah, it's me, this is how I look now, I'm using the name X now, my pronouns are such and such', of course.
I think that depends on your personal choice then, there's no real need to let people know for sure. But I guess it'd be more comforting to know the person you feel you trust isn't going to go full transphobic on you if they accidentally find out.
For a lot of us it isn't just private medical data. I'm happy for you that for you it is.
Safer, yes potentially. Depending on where you live. I live in a very progressive city and have no fear for my safety as it relates to my transness. Being a woman I fear walking alone at night, but at no point in my daily life do I fear anything bad happening because I’m trans. If I lived in a more rural/conservative area, yes most definitely I would be more on edge. 

As far as people treating you differently…idk about that. I think some people might, but again, that’s their problem. If someone wants to treat trans people differently just because they’re trans, that’s not someone I want to associate with. I’m not going to hide parts of myself to “fit in”. I’m a trans woman, and people can either deal with that, or get out of my life. On the other side, I’ve come out to people and have seen absolutely *zero* change in how they treat me/we interact. They literally are like “oh that’s cool, I didn’t realize. Anyways…”

I just think you might not be giving everyone a fair shot. If people are bigots, then why would you want to associate with them? If people are welcoming of trans folks, why shouldn’t you tell them? How do you know *everyone* will treat you differently? And what if you told people and they didn’t? It’s *incredibly* liberating to be fully, openly, authentically myself around people without fear. That was the kicker for me…it took me years to come to terms with my transness and come out of the closet. I’m not about to hide that now that I can and ostensibly go *back* in the closet. Being trans is a huge part of my life and I’m very proud of the person it has made me into. 

I think, if you have a real, demonstrable reason why being open with your transness would cause you personal harm, then yes, by all means your personal safety and comfort should be paramount and you should be stealth all the way. But it sounds a *little bit* to me like you *want* to share but are either ashamed of being trans, or that you’re afraid other people will find it as a negative. 

Idk, again, you’re free to do whatever you choose, and should do what’s safest for you. But I think in a perfect world trans people would be out and open about it, and no one would bat an eye. And the only way to get *there* is for more trans people to be visible.
fr😭
Yeah, if I ever get around to changing my legal information.

1. I'm lazy
2. I'm not sure if I want the gov't knowing I'm trans. Just in case. I'm like, a single election cycle from getting my children taken away from me for being a trans parent.
>  the BMW 

my car knows I'm trans.
Cause my legal shit is in my deadname.
Because with something as intimate as sex, I feel like its just an important thing to tell someone idk
Couple reasons:

1. If it's a guy, he could find out later & get violent (potentially very very violent)
2. Even if there's no risk of violence, the other person will inevitably find out at some point (unless it's a one-night stand I guess?), which would make trust in the relationship very difficult from that point 
3. If you have any reaon to suppose the other person would have a problem with your transness, they have a right to that preference.  It's a stupid preference, sure, but we should all get to pick who we have sex with - no exceptions; if you have any reason to suspect that someone would not choose to sleep with a trans person, then allowing them to assume you're cis and having sex with them on that basis is a shitty thing to do to that person.

Obviously, that only applies in situations where it might be an issue.  If it's someone you met in a specifically trans-friendly LGBT space, and/or they're trans themself, meaning you have zero reason to suppose they'd care in the slightest, then that's totally different - there's absolutely no need to interrupt the evening to say ""Just so you know, I'm AMAB"".

But if it's, for example, a straight cis guy and that's all you know about him, then the odds are (unfortunately) fairly high that he would have an issue with sleeping with someone AMAB; in that situation, it seems wrong to hold back information that you know might well have affected his decision to consent to sex.
hm well if youre post op, maybe you have a point, you might not have to. but even then there are differences in uses, like lubrication doesnt work the same way, and there are different kinds of operations (dont ask me what kinds, im not looking to get one)

&#x200B;

my point was not to disclose at most of the times. you can make out regardless of genitals, so theres no reason to. 

&#x200B;

maybe one reason to disclose it is to avoid getting hurt, to gauge their reaction, but then again getting to know you might outweight the immediate weirded-outness many people have. like if you ask me to go to a party with you and im in my PJs, ill say no, but if you already got me to go for a walk with you, i might be easily convinced to go to that party too. transness is the party, and the walk is the getting to know you part.

&#x200B;

i personally dont bother with passing or explaining myself, im just me, i tell people who ask, but then again i have no idea what dating is like
My situation is almost completely opposite - I seem to have a lot more friends now (and I've gotten much closer with some who were only passing acquaintances before), and lost only one, which was quite surprising seeing as my bubble is mostly conservative. I'm even getting the old fashioned treatment from some, e.g. they open the door for me or try to greet me by kissing my hand (which is super awkward but also super affirming).

That doesn't make your experience any less valid, obviously, and doesn't mean anyone should come out to everyone they meet. I told most of the people I regularly interact with, but for the rest? Nah, I'm a woman like any other and I don't see any reason to tell them something that's none of their business. I've got lucky with my friends, I'm aware it wouldn't be the case with everyone.

Regarding #2...they already know this. If you're taking HRT that doesn't align with your birth gender then they already have that information.   
  
Updating your legal documents will allow you to at least partially avoid discrimination on lower levels.
Okayyyy I agree but OP asked. I didn’t show up to their inbox and start lambasting them about why they shouldn’t be stealth. They asked a question so I answered?
The federal gov't can get access to my medical records due to the patriot act, but that's not something they *know* until they request the documentation.

Indiana would need a court order to see that.
The federal govt can’t LEGALLY do it. But they can and do access that information unfortunately. And if you ever found out that they know, good luck proving that they didn’t find out some other way. But as far as I know they don’t like…randomly do it for shits. There’s almost always a reason for them to go digging."	wmjfp5	trans	1062	0.95	2022-08-12 11:55:57
'Transgender people tighten gender stereotypes.'	"The amount of times I read this bullshit...

I'm not. I'm just trying to explain to your cis brain how I feel. The problem is that you wouldn't accept a 'I just know'. You also wouldn't believe me if I told you about how feminine I was as a child (I'm a trans guy). I mean we all know that trans guys can't possibly be feminine and trans women can't possibly be masculine, right? 

It's not trans people who are pushing these stereotypes.It's these cis people who need a very clear and basic explanation of everybody's gender identity so that they can verify that we are truly the gender we claim to be."	"> “*What is it about you that you think makes you a man/woman?*”

\- Generally someone who will reject anything you say as a stereotype that doesn’t mean anything
The amount/force of gender stereotypes pushed onto kid's will sometimes scare them from being able to explore who they are, making them not able to make a track record of childhood experiences where it was ""obvious that they're trans."" Then people/family will act like it's their fault for not knowing sooner and doubt their feelings and experiences, I hate it
""no hate""/""no bad intent"" posts where they ask trans people about their ""inside feelings"" in relationships to their genitals makes me uncomfy. And there are already so many posts like this on this page anyway why can they just scroll a little and read those
I stopped talking to stupid people a long time ago. It was a very rewarding decision.
""You didn't show signs as a kid""  I did, but mostly, I had to hide any femininity, because otherwise my dad would've screamed at me and possibly hurt me.

Most things I did as a kid were either to blend in (playing sports even though I hated it, saying my favorite color was green instead of pink) or was me compromising because I couldn't get what I actually wanted (action figures instead of Barbies, Mighty Max instead of Polly Pocket)

Years of repression and being punished/bullied for being girly turned me from an extremely feminine kid into a rather butch adult.
It's like nobody can reason any more.
I miss being feminine sometimes, I just don't wear feminine clothes right now to avoid my annoying family constantly calling me womanly words
""They're forcing GNC people to conform!""

Me, a trans femboy: *exists*

""They're forcing gay people to be straight!""

Me, a trans femboy: *kisses my boyfriend*
People seem violently opposed to the notion of allowing others to be their authentic selves. Very sad.
That just dumb, I don't hate wearing dresses and skirts, as long as its a costume, I'm really into medieval and fantasy costumes and am learning to sew.  
But I sure as hell don't feel like a woman. I hate most of my body and if I woke up in a mans body tomorrow I'd be much more confident. But even then I still woudn't mind wearing a dress for a costume. Gender stereotypes are dumb.

Edit: spelling mistake
This. I'm a trans woman but I don't really try too hard to be super feminine. I don't CARE how people perceive me because it's all a performance and I just want to do certain things / have people use my pronouns. For a lot of cis people, that makes me a man I guess. \*shrug\*
Over here supporting feminine stereotypes with grease and gun oil under my nails blasting Meshuggah and Decapitated 🤷‍♀️
People keep saying shit like ""wearing a dress doesn't make you a woman, you know"" and I'm like *no shit, asshole.* I don't wear them because they make me a girl, I wear them because I WANT TO and because it wasn't socially safe to do so until I looked like one.

Cishet society's roles and standards are what made me ""conform"" to stereotypes because it wasn't safe for me to not conform
How it started- ""how could I ever take you seriously as a woman you look nothing like one""

How it's going- ""why are you conforming to gender stereotypes!""
Even if that made any sense trans people are not responsible for increasing the overall total of gender non-conformity in the world. If cis people care about it so much they can be GNC.
I'd like to see what some of these people would do if they saw a non-conforming or non-passing trans person being harassed for not conforming to gender roles.
(Spoiler alert they'd probably join in because they hate all people who don't conform to their framework)
How do you know your a man 

My response: Because I feel like one and deep down I know I am one no matter what I do female pronouns just don’t feel right because I’m not a girl 

Expected and wanted response :well this and this and this even tho I’ve done this and this and this 

Their actual response: well you used to wear dresses and liked mermaids and were okay with it 

My response: clothes aren’t gendered dresses are comfortable. I did the hair and makeup stuff for you. Mermaids are just cool. And I never was okay with it I just didn’t know how I felt or was in denial 

Their response “blink blink”
patriarchal structures and terfs are who tighten the stereotypes…
Its hard to keep on trying with those people :/

Like we sre who we are no matter what
this need to be spread around more
being trans is wild. I got critised for painting my nails by the same person who not ten minutes ago told me i'm enforcing the gender stereotype of men being unemotional or some shit like that. they will only ever see what they want to see, no matter what you are. making an attempt at appealing to a cis person is a useless waste of time
I have been that person. A friend of mine told me that he knew he was trans because he ""hated wearing dresses as a kid"", and my feminist, anti-biological-imperative brain kind of exploded. I felt really defensive there, honestly.   
I want to live in a world where people can exist in whatever way suits them best, without social pressure.  
For me, ""I knew I was trans, because I'm trans"" was more than enough. You are you are. Tying gender up with arbitrary markers seemed reductive.   
I've been lucky enough to have a few friends walk me through it now, though. People like stories - palatable, bite-sized explanations.   
Huge, complicated, fuzzy, nuanced explanations are wonderful, but sometimes reductive simplicity is useful. 

Besides, my friend didn't owe me that larger conversation. If that's as deep as he wanted to take the conversation, that needed to be fine. At the time, I think there was some part of me that thought that my judgement mattered there. I wanted a story I could get behind, rather than just getting behind my friend.

I'm grateful that I've had patient friends talk me through some of my dumb shit.
as a cis ally, I'm sorry the other cis people are so dumb ;-;
Please invite my they/them ass to your busted-ass lunch table for show and tell lol.
This is an interesting topic. 

I'm not trans. I've always thought about a social experiment about a micro-society where everyone is forced to wear the same clothes, have the same hairstyle and do the same things.

Would still be there people with gender dysphoria in this society? what are your thoughts?
YES TY this is something I've struggled to articulate for a while now!!
PREACH! I absolutely hate thinking I can explain this shit to cis people and then I actually try to explain this shit to cis people. It’s literally a waste of time. 

Nowadays I don’t even explain it. I just shrug and move on. The real good allies don’t generally need an explanation, they just don’t like seeing people get hurt so they stand with us. You don’t have to understand my whole identity to see me as a person. 

As for the damn therapists, I got nothin’.
Well said 😊
Some people just don't understand that gender is such a complex topic and trans people don't want to have to explain (and shouldnt have to explain)advanced psychology/ biology shit to someone who doesn't really care so we simplify shit to help little pea brains understand to avoid breaking down our whole identity anytime we are questioned.
aka my mom
My answer would be ""the fact that I am one""
This happened to me… I knew I was neither a man not a woman since I was 8 but never told anyone or knew the word non binary until 5 years later :/
Partly the exact thing i experienced
Apparently growing my hair out until I could see it flap around me if I shook my head wasn’t a big indicator..

Also having to choose a female character in any video game because playing as male makes me enjoy it less. 


Also shaving my body (unfortunately there’s a fair bit to get rid of and I’m shit at shaving), holy shit I love how a hairless set of legs feel
what I wouldn't have given if somebody sat me down and just said ""listen, stupid kid, if you don't want to be a man, then don't be a man""

instead, all I got was ""you were born a man so you have to be a man and if you don't like it, no one cares, you just have to push through, stop being a p\*\*sy etc""

and I internalized all that for 32 years, JFC I hate this feeling so much

no wonder I showed no signs, any time I had even as much as a girly thought (or really, just a thought I perceive as girly) I felt I have to hide it any way I can and overcompensate with carefully planned masculine behavior
This.

I had masculine interests as a kid. I really admired girls, but felt forced into male gender parameters.
Me
As have I and the quality of conversation I do have has improved dramatically :)
If I stopped doing that there's not many people I would talk to.
I can relate to this a lot. I grew up in a very conservative area and just being gay was taboo much less trans. I dealt with a lot of bullying and I never got to or let known what I actually enjoyed doing because it was feminine and ""boys are not supposed to like or do feminine things"". I was bullied just for being a bit of an outcast much less if I actually did the things I enjoyed. 

It just seems people see what one did and assume because they never realize we have to hide for whatever the reason might be.
I didn't show many signs because I was autistic and a tomboy. Only that I looked like a boy so people didn't know I behaved tomboy-ish instead of boy-ish.
This is one of the most annoying things. You want to wear what you like and is comfortable but you can't cause either they will misgender you or say something bout how you sure you are trans because that is feminine/masculine. It's like I'm just being comfortable and wearing what I want to wear because you know clothes! So many times did I wear something when I first started transitioning and something like that happened. Like come on I can't afford to change out my entire wardrobe just like that. It costs money. And even now it still happens. Stupid....
Welcome to the world and here’s to hoping it improves
This is not correct. I'm a cis person and I just don't understand the feeling, because I don't feel like a man. I feel like if my mind was transplanted to a female body I wouldn't have issues with that. And that's the only way I can think of being trans... so I just don't understand it. However, there have to be logical reasons I am just missing
There's honestly not any point to this kind of thinking, because that's not the world we live in, nor will it ever be.
Or the fact that you don't only have to explain it once. You're expected to explain it to everyone everywhere forever. And you better be happy to do it.
why are we the only people required to show scientific evidence to prove that we exist?
I’m autistic too. When I was a kid, my dad was my role model. I wanted to be just like my dad. I loved wearing suits because my dad wore one to work. I loved working in the yard with my dad. I wanted to play guitar like my dad. I wanted to be tall and have an Adam’s apple and a deeper voice like my dad did. I remember deliberately hiding some things about me because it was “too feminine for a guy,” at least it was in my head. I’m sure there were feminine things that I subconsciously hid too. 

I didn’t hide these things about myself because of my parents. They wouldn’t have cared. I hid them because I felt the pressure from society to conform. 

I tried to copy what my best friend did in an effort to fit in with other guys. I always failed to fit in. I made friends with girls with little effort until society made it seem weird for a guy to have girl friends (in middle schools). It took me the first 16.5 years to figure out that I didn’t like my body or my expected role in society. I was only trying to fit ideal that I believed I was supposed to be.
Yeah, I'm autistic and a tomboy, too.
yeah this is what I was thinking about but in actual words
Yeah clothes have no gender imo it’s just the fact that people will deadname tf outta me if I wear dresses or flowery clothes (which I hate flowery clothes anyway but not the point)
valid I guess but this has nothing to do with my comment
It would resolve a fundamental issue: Is transexuality biological or social?

By mental experiments the theory of relativity was concieved :)
The fact that I know I will have a lot to explain when I come out that I am debating on writing a fucking presentation to show my mom because I know i will struggle to explain and she definitely won't accept me until she understands.
The point I'm trying to make is that a lot if not most of the people just want to understand. There will always be people who just hate trans people and want to hurt them though
Being transgender is not a ""fundamental issue"", nor does it need to be solved. It does not matter whether it is biological or social; it just is.
I wrote letters to all my family & friends. They still had questions but I drew boundaries and tried to answer some questions I figured they would have.
If the fact it took me 30+ years to explain it to myself and figure it out, it isn’t going to be able to be simplified into one statement. Unfortunately, many people just want a quick and easy answer so they can move on with their lives.
I don't want your weird wisdom. I didn't ask for it nor is it warranted or has anything to do with my comment, which was me recounting an experience I had with transphobic cis people and their double standards and my conclusion that trying to appeal to that is useless. 

if your response to somebody recounting transphobia is ""not all cis people"", then it feels like you're just offended that cis people aren't all that great. i'm done with this discussion, this is irking me
Knowledge is power. I advocate for science. 
I understand you are at a defensive position since there are a lot of transphobic people. 
But the more we know about transexuality scientifically, the less arguments for them.
I think I'm gonna do that. I go non verbal when I'm anxious so I think writing it will help me get everything out
You said ""making an attempt at appealing to a cis person is a useless waste of time"". It has to do with your comment.

It is not wisdom, it's just a comment. 

Seroiusly this makes you angry? then you have mental stability problems.
Do you give the same energy for homosexuality?
Of course, it would be interesting to see what happens in an experiment where the norm is being homosexual.

Am I invalidating anyone's identity if I believe lesbians can't like trans men?	"I'm ftm and I've personally never been comfortable being pursued by any lesbians/straight guys. However, I've noticed a decently large amount of transfems identifying as lesbians while dating trans guys on trans subreddits like this and i wanted to know if and how that would be possible?

My gf is trans too *(used to identify as a transbian)* and insists she couldn't love me if she wasn't bi, but I notice a few people say that they have 'exceptions' or that trans guys fall under their lesbian sexuality?

I personally found that idea very insensitive and invalidating. Would a transbian date a cis man? Would those trans girls be willing to date an mlm guy or a straight girl? Would that not be invalidating their female identity? Could an mlm trans guy be dating a trans lesbian? I'm curious because I've never seen it go the other way around and it feels like this stems more from the lack of transmasc representation and the common view of trans men as butch lesbians rather than 'real men'. To me it feels transphobic, as though transmascs are held as a less important identity and can be regarded as female rather than admitting to attraction towards men *(even if it's exclusively trans men)*.  If someone identifying as a lesbian dates a trans man, why would they not want to change their label to something that is inclusive of masculine identities in order to validate their partner?

I really hope I didn't come off as rude or invalidating, I tried my best not to. I'm really curious to hear any differing opinions, does it apply the same or differently for trans women, if so why?

EDIT: Wanted to thank you all for the amount of responses I got, I was not expecting to hear so many people's opinions but I'm glad I did :) I also wanted to apologize to anyone who recieved any harassment in the comments, that was not my intention but I am sorry regardless.

I wanted to clarify a few things: I absolutely agree that lesbians can date enby and masc people, this was referring to (mostly/fully) binary trans men like myself, many of who find it transphobic to be grouped in non-male orientations. I am also NOT going out and telling people what labels they must use so please do not do that to people here!

That being said, I've noticed a lot of people disregarding the bisexuality of people who prefer one gender and invalidating trans men's discomfort and input in this discussion which I find upsetting. My opinion remains largely unchanged, but thank you for taking the time to engage.

Bonus EDIT: For those of you giving me advice for my relationship, sorry for the confusing wording. My gf and I are both bi and happy with our identities, this was not supposed to be about us."	"trans men are men so you are completely right
as a transfem myself, i have thought abt this recently. i do worry abt you transmascs because this is typically how society treats you guys under the LGBTQ+ umbrella and it's totally unfair. my amab bf is straight, because he does his best to look at me as a girl (context, he has admitted that i don't have to get the surgery or even transition because his attraction is far beyond skin deep, so ik he's not taking advantage of me but at the end of the day he doesn't like it up the bum). a partner should do their best to validate their partner. maybe if said transmasc person willingly keeps some of their feminine traits / styles (like maybe if they were a trans femboy, i've seen this before) then you could argue that they have an attraction to anyone with feminine qualities (because that is a thing), but you say this in a way that makes me assume that this isn't the case. i hope people start giving you the validation you deserve brother. i don't think your partner means harm if they are transbian, but try to bring this up to her. communication is key!

edit: i've never met someone who supported me as much as my bf. the first vc he hopped in with me after hearing that i'm trans, he was calling me May and using she/her/hers pronouns. he also got more comfortable with coming out abt his feelings, and trust me the feelings are mutual. we've been friends for 4 or so years, since my junior year of hs. we made the whole school think we were gay but we both apparently actually had feelings the whole time. issue with him is that he hates pp and so he only became comfortable with telling me when i made it clear i'm not keeping mine. he's typically an edgy troll so i was always scared he wouldn't accept me, so when he did respect by name and pronouns i should've known lol. wish he had told me when we were still neighbors.. wish i'd come out way sooner
Nope that is perfectly fair especially if it's a situation of you feel invalidated
Well trans men are men, if a woman is in a relationship with a man that's a straight relationship
I am fully with you generally. Lesbians and trans men historically had a lot more overlap than they do now so folks make cases for inclusion...But I (MTF) for instance dated an amab nb person who would *not* stop calling themselves ""gay"", even after I talked to them about it. It ended up being one of of the primary reasons I dumped them. 


So I get how you feel and have personally felt the same. You're a man.
How I see it, someone can identify with a particular label for their sexuality, and can date someone outside of what that label would imply, but in that case shouldn't use the label to refer to the relationship. 

i.e. someone could identify as a lesbian and date someone outside their typical preference (a man,) so could still identify with the label but shouldn't use it to describe the relationship they're currently in.
It's more invalidating to consider yourself lesbian whilst dating a trans masc imo
The literal way of seeing it is that transbians like women and transmascs are men
Trans men are men, so a girl, cis or trans, being with a trans guy, isn’t in a lesbian relationship. Thouuuuugh… some girls really want to make clear they’re not into cis men, for some reasons. There isn’t any term saying «I’m excluding cis men from my sexuality but I’m cool with everyone else». Sometimes it’s just easier to keep the lesbian term, even if sometimes it’s not really defining ourselves
So yeah, this happened to me. I'm mtf and I thought I was a lesbian. Then this guy comes into my life, I don't know why, but the first time I saw him I nearly fell to the floor. He is trans (ftm), I didn't know it at the time, I thought he was a cis guy. Well anyways, I've been conflicted with the lesbian label ever since, and then stuff started happening between us. So yeah, I'm definitely not a lesbian, at least not right now. The thing is, I've never liked a guy before, he is literally the only one. 

I'm of the opinion that sexuality fluctuates, so for example, I was a lesbian, I couldn't ever be attracted to men, then he appeared, now I'm bi, in the future, I might be still bi, go back to lesbian, or turn straight (please god no). Anyways, what I'm saying is, this are all just labels we use to try and define ourselves, and yes, dating a guy still identifying as a lesbian is invalidating, don't do it.
It certainly feels a bit peculiar to me, but there are some transmasculine people who are comfortable being associated with the phrase lesbian. Heck, technically *I'm* not a lesbian and *technically* my relationship isn't one but we use those terms for each other sometimes. 

If people are invalidating their partners' identities then yeah that's definitely an unhealthy relationship but if that's a term that they feel comfortable with and feels associated with their relationship, I'm not so bothered by it. To each their own, sexuality and gender are complicated and as a nonbinary person i completely get why someone would still feel politically aligned with a gender they don't technically belong to.
What I've heard from trans history actually FtMs are not usually an issue for lesbians and part of that is probably they are not recognize them as real men as a cis guys. But MtFs are topic for them, usually rejected all the way by lesbians . There were a lot of issues in the past and for that reason there was created festival Camp Trans. The acceptance even in LGBTQIA+ community is an issue and usually acceptance of MtFs.
I’m right there with you. I genuinely believe a lot of the “I’m gay lesbian but….” mind sets stem from compulsive heterosexuality. It’s something that’s bright up a lot in lesbian subs but rarely mentioned in trans subs.

I used to say I was 99% attracted to women. Then I started reading up on comphet and realized it described almost exactly what I was doing and thinking.

I do feel saying something like “I’m a lesbian who’s also attracted to men” is disingenuous and invalidating. This is a pretty common feeling in cis lesbian circles. Many of them say “well I’m not attracted to men at all and am a lesbian. So these two definitions of lesbian cannot co-exist because they are contradictory.”

It’s also going against the core mantra the trans community says over and over. Trans men are men, trans women are women.  If a was dating a woman that kept insisting she was straight, I would feel incredibly invalidated. Because fact is, she would be in a lesbian relationship.

I’ve had women interested in me that clearly didn’t think of me as a woman, but as a very feminine and pretty man. Like “no girl, you can’t call me ‘daddy’ would you ask a cis woman that?” Yes I’ve actually had that happen to me.

Anyways point is I feel sexuality is broad and nuanced, and we have plenty of accurate terms to where we don’t need to co-opt more widely known labels because they are more generally accepted by the hetero population.
if someone is a lesbian and says that includes trans men they clearly dont see trans men as actual men. obviously gender and sexuality can be complicated and is often more fluid than some people like to think of it as, but yeah thats just transphobic
by definition lesbians are not into men. you are a man. by trying to date you a lesbian is trying to say that she doesn't see you as a man, which. fuck that
No.

Trans men are men. Lesbians are not attracted to men.

It is both transphobic and lesbophobic to claim that lesbian identity had to include trans guys.
I'm a transbian in a relationship with a cis guy.  I'm about a 5 on the kinsey scale but I don't control whom I love

I get where you're coming from and those feelings are valid but love isn't a logical process that follows our sentiments like *I'm not supossed to love this person*
trans men are men so lesbians dating us just invalidates every trans masc to ever walk the planet.
I, a gay trans man, am in a 12 yr relationship with someone who was a lesbian for the vast majority of it. They tried to be straight for like six months. It was terrible. So, we were just a married gay and lesbian. That’s who we were. 

 The problem I think is that ppl reduce sexuality to just ‘who I fuck’ and it’s a lot more nuanced than that. My partner had 20 years of lesbian activism, culture, life behind them when we got together. Had I insisted that they id as straight or even bi *I* would be asking them to erase all that history. And that’s pretty messed up. It was half their life. So this conversation veers very close to asking ppl to deny important parts of themselves. 

Lastly, who my partner is doesn’t invalidate me in any way. Their labels don’t have anything to do with *me*. 

ETA:I’m a person in my own right. Also some spelling and formatting
You would be invalidating the identities of trans men if you thought that lesbians could.
I have a horrible suspicion some people here saying you’re forcing others to use labels don’t see trans men as men. I also feel like you’d never hear this same question asked the other way around, it’s both transphobic and lesbophobic to say lesbians can like trans men
Honestly i think youre right. Im a nonbinary transmasc and i welcome lesbians being attracted to me, but binary trans men are men. Attraction at its base might go for expression so i see how some lesbians may be *attracted* to some trans men, but once they know theyre men then they shouldnt pursue that attraction without acknowledging that theyre attracted to a man. Plus, masculine lesbians exist so its not like every lesbian has to be attracted to feminine presentation exclusively.

That said, attraction can also be very fluid and restricting people to labels can just cause distress all around when an exception is found. But if a trans man is not comfortable dating a lesbian who sees him as their exception, then just.. dont date that lesbian and let them know exactly why. You cant stop people from being attracted to you but you can let them know that nothing can come of it if they dont acknowledge your gender.
Of course not. If a lesbian likes a trans man, that's invalidating his identity as a man.
People can identify strongest with one label, but still find people attractive, or another reason they want to be together with that person, that fall outside of their orientation. If that wasn't possible, ace and aro people couldn't date anyone. Labels are more of a guideline instead of hard rules.
you are not lesbian if you like trans men, no
But a lesbian is a woman who likes women, so she can't like a guy? Trans men are men so therefore a lesbian can't like them
Yeah we’re men so it is invalidating to our existence as trans guys ❤️
as a straight female, im attracted to trans men and also cis men, and in terms of how manly they are to me it feels the same
IMO the person comes before the label. Labels should be subservient to the people that use them, not the other way around.
I don't consider you rude or invalidating. 

To me, a transfemme lesbian; anybody can date anybody they like and want to spend time with.  We may have *personal preferences* \- but ultimately, a *person*... is who we are attracted to.
I think this is an interesting question. I am in the camp of saying sexuality is a spectrum and different for everyone. Some folks have different romantic and sexual orientations too so they may use labels that reflect who they would be in a relationship with long-term versus who they might hook up with. Labels and language are supposed to help us create connections but they aren't always clean around the edges. 

As an example, I'm transmasc, but my partner has always used the world lesbian as a label before me. When we got together, my partner asked if it bothered me and I kind of shrugged and said ""so you are a lesbian with an exception."" I know she doesn't see me as a woman so it doesn't bother me. 

Now, if I were casually dating, it might feel invalidating, especially since it's hard to judge sometimes if people really do see me for ME or if they are just good about being respectful of language. 

All of that said, I guess my vague response for myself is ""it depends"" lol
I think many women who’ve been only ever attracted to one man—cis or trans—and had everyone else they’ve been attracted to be women would consider themselves lesbians still. Labels are imperfect.
In theory yes it’s easy to cast judgement and say it’s transphobic for lesbians and trans men to date but I think real life and relationships have a bit more nuance than that. If lesbians are intentionally seeking out trans men as part of their dating pool that’s gross imma just throw that out there. However there are instances when two people are in an established relationship and one comes out as trans and both partners are willing to accept the other’s identity and still love each other because they don’t see their love or relationship as being about gender. This doesn’t work for everyone and it’s okay to break up if your sexualities are no longer compatible, but each couple is different.
I'm an out and proud transbian and around a year ago I was dating a closeted trans guy. During the course of our relationship he came out and we both had an identity crisis because of it. I still really cared for him as a partner despite identifying as a lesbian, and he was questioning whether coming out and transitioning was the right thing to do (for my identity's sake) 

In the end I gave up on putting a label on how I felt about him and just enjoyed the time we had together as a straight couple. We did eventually drift apart and break up and are even better friends than we were partners, turns out he's gay too.

My advice is to not worry about labels and just enjoy the relationship that you do have. Love is beautiful and she's still with you because of who you are as a person, not who you are as an identity xx
My gf and I are both genderfluid lesbians. I'm transfem and they're transmasc and neither of us feel invalidated because neither of us are men. In your case though, it is absolutely invalidating for someone to call themself a lesbian and also be attracted to binary trans guys. If a lesbian is attracted to nonbinary transmasc people I wouldn't say that's universally invalidating but some people may still be uncomfortable with it if they're nonbinary but also identify as a man or are very heavily masc aligned. For example, my ex was a trans guy and he called himself gay even though I was still nonbinary and transfem at the time and I kept rationalizing it to myself by saying ""it's technically okay because I'm not a binary woman so he can still be attracted to me"" when in reality I felt really uncomfortable and invalidated because my identity was still very fem aligned and I felt like he saw me as a guy
People identify their sexuality by what they're primarily attracted to. But sexuality isn't a rule or a box that you have to fit yourself into, it's a manmade concept to help us understand each other. Just because someone who indentifies as lesbian likes a trans-man doesn't mean they are no longer lesbian. But I guess you could say if a woman was to date a trans man it wouldn't be a lesbian relationship but a hetero relationship.
I think people’s sexual orientation is their own business. None of the terminology is perfect — especially in a world where people are becoming more open and less closeted about their transitions and where it is more acceptable that sexuality is fluid. 

If a woman identifies as a lesbian, but falls for a trans guy, she shouldn’t have to change the label with which she has identified her whole life. She probably finds some aspects of that trans guy attractive because she is *also* attracted to women. It might be based on the shared history of having been raised with similar experiences (Girl Scouts, etc) or it might have to do with what she prefers in bed….If that bothers you, then that is totally understandable and you shouldn’t  date that woman. But there are other trans guys who it won’t bother and it doesn’t mean those guys aren’t trans guys or that that woman doesn’t *really* love them.

Totally different situation, but just to illustrate how complicated these terms can be….My trans-feminine non-binary partner has identified as heterosexual (meaning attracted to women and female presenting individuals) their whole life. Now they are taking hormones and transitioning — and are still only attracted to women. So do they call themselves a lesbian? Even though they don’t fully identify as a woman?  Calling themselves lesbian or homosexual doesn’t really fit with the part of themself that still identifies as a man. But what other (commonly-understood) word is there that represents a person who isn’t interested in men, but also is not themself either a woman nor a man?  Shrugging and saying “I’m straight” might not be all that accurate, but it is what my partner is most familiar with, so they are sticking with it for now. A lesbian who is sometimes attracted to trans guys might find that the familiarity of the label and the identity with the community might outweigh the relative inaccuracy of the descriptor. Especially since identifying as a bisexual means getting a LOT of unwanted attention from cis men.
As a lesbian, I say that you are right and ""lesbians"" that ""like"" trans men are just transphobic chasers.
Well, I am a straight girl, and dating a trans man won't change anything; it will still be a straight relationship, nothing else.
Not really no? Trans men are men and people who identify as lesbians are just attracted to women and those on the feminine spectrum.

Now if you're attracted to men/masc ppl and identify as lesbian for whatever reason then it's whatever.

But if you ONLY like women and those with femme aligned genders but decide to go after a trans man anyways you are transphobic. Major chaser energy.

I'm a transmasc demiboy, and I don't like the thought of dating lesbians or straight men. Not a preference, I just don't wanna date them cause I'm not a woman and my gender isn't femme in anyway. 

I am however a femboy, I like dressing up femme sometimes cause I like feeling pretty. 

My PRESENTATION is feminine, my GENDER is not.

So if a lesbian/straight guy knew this and still wanted to date me (without reconsidering their sexual/romantic orientation) that's transphobic cause they probably see me as a girl. 

Honestly it really depends on the person and their relationship with their partner. If they're both comfortable, then it doesn't matter. 

Lesbians who don't like men/masc ppl are valid, ppl who identify as lesbians but like men/masc ppl are valid.

Lesbians who don't like men/masc ppl at all but go after trans men/transmasc anyway are valid in their identity but they are gross and stinky and I don't like them.
I think its definitely very invalidating when attracted-to-women people are also attracted to trans guys. No doubt. At the same time, i personally (trans woman) identity as culturally lesbian, but sexually pan. I get if that would make trans guys or hell even cis guys uncomfortable but i dont know how else to describe the way i am. Idk.
My experience with dating a trans guy as a lesbian identifying trans women was difficult to say the least. He had amazing qualities but I really struggled with being attracted to him and ultimately that is why our relationship ended. Just want to point out that for the first 3ish months that I knew him I didn’t even know he was trans. He did finally come out to me at my surprise. I tried to explain to him that I was not attracted to men sexually and that definitely applied to him as I only ever saw him as a man regardless of what genitals he had. I couldn’t imagine myself dating another trans man or trans masc person because 1 I’m not in any way shape or form attracted to men or masculinity and 2 a person’s genitals or reproductive organs do not dictate their gender. So if someone claims to be a lesbian but dates outside of that then they are more than likely using the wrong identifiers or they do not see you as a man🤷‍♀️

This is definitely a conversation you should have with your partner especially if it makes you uncomfortable. Also yes many people in the community trans or not can be transphobic. It may not be intentional but it is still not okay behavior.

Edit: I just want to add that I did date him because he was incredibly nice and a very loving person to me and my children. I thought that it was something I could adapt to and I did really care about him but ultimately the two of us were trying to force something because of the fear of loneliness…..I really wish that we could have never crossed that line and just remained friends.
If someone identifying as a lesbian is dating someone who is a man in their gender (not necessarily using he/him pronouns, but seeing their gender as male), then it would be invalidating to continue identifying as a lesbian. 

As a trans man myself, I would be offended if my partner still identified as a lesbian. Because Homosexuality refers to someone liking someone of similar gender to themself. In the case of Lesbianism, that means anyone who doesn't identify as a man (so this can include nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, genderflux, etc. individuals). If someone uses He/Him pronouns, but does not identify with male as their gender, then these individuals are not men, and therefore still fall under the Lesbian label. 

I am not one of these individuals, and other trans men like me do not fall under these labels because we are **men**. 

People forget that being Bi and Pan doesn't mean you have to be exactly 50/50 on your attraction towards Male-identifying and Female-identifying individuals. You could be attracted 99 99% to women, or men, or Non-binary genders, and still have that 0.01% that likes that one specific person who's gender is different from those you're usually attracted/have a preference to. Still makes you Bi/Pan. 

To think a trans man is able to fall under a lesbian's sexuality label is very transphobic and makes me very upset. Trans Men are **Men**; just like Trans Women are Women. No if's, and's, or but's. If you don't respect that, then you need to get out of here. 😤😤😤

Know you haven't been offensive in your expression of things, OP. While there are nuances to things, there are a few things that are clean cut.

EDIT: After talking with individuals, I do have some amends to my original response to add. 

1) I think the most important thing to denote with some of these things is the intent of and the individuals involved. Some people are going to be okay with it, and that is perfectly fine. You don't have to change your labels if that is something that is what you are most comfortable with. That is something that is important to discuss with at the beginning of a relationship, or before getting into a relationship. 

2) There can be a very distinct difference between binary men, and those who are Non-binaried identifying men (such as those who are genderfluid, genderflux, bigender, etc.) Cause those individuals will have a different opinion about such things than those of us who are binary men, especially binary trans men. 

Those who are binary trans men, I feel a majority of us do not wish to date someone who identify as lesbian, as we ourselves see ourselves as not fallinf into the category of someone in that sexuality. 

Those who differ in labels otherwise are welcomed, so long as no malicious intent is involved c: I think we all just want people to feel safe and comfortable, especially with how much Transphobia and Bi/Pan/Omniphobia is out there, even within our own Queer Community.
I'm with you, though it's a complicated subject and things will differ with each perspective brought to the table.

I'm transfemme, she/they and definitely enjoy causing some gender confusion in others, but lean towards the feminine side of things. Would rather be viewed as a girl first and then share my non-binary with other queer folk who get it.

But I hate it when a cis gay or even bi guy is into me. Gay guy ends up focusing on my amab body parts, which I don't want and state and it usually still happens.... They just want my body, and for the wrong reasons, so pass. Or I get bi cis guys using the ""best of both worlds"" thing... and then I feel awful and like a fetish thing, not a lovable girl. It's frustrating, oh so frustrating. Very insensitive and invalidating for sure... For lack of better terms, they're attracted to your dead self, the parts of you that you are trying to reconfigure, let go and change... They're holding on to those qualities and I just don't think it will result in a healthy dynamic.
When I was earlier in my transition, I thought I was a lesbian. Absolutely no men for me, then my now boyfriend (ftm) kissed me and I realized I wasn’t all gay.
When I was figuring out my identity I identified as a lesbian for a short stint but mostly because I had some unresolved trauma towards cis-men. Trans-men didn’t apply to that, they were “safe” in my mind because we understand the “”female”” experience of toxic cis men. I realize now that I only identified as a lesbian so I wasn’t putting myself out there as a single fem-aligned person on the market for cis men. Now I just identify as bisexual, but I’m mostly t4t
Trans men are men, not ""women lite"", they are men. Lesbians are attracted to women, it by definition excludes men because that is the point. Lesbians cannot like men. Trying to claim otherwise is extremely lesphobic and comes of as conversion therapy rhetoric.

This whole argument is dumb as hell, no one does this shit to gay men, the world doesn't revolve around men. Women can exist without attraction to men. The fact people here are even attempting to claim otherwise is horrifying. 

Also trying to include trans men into lesbianism is insanely transphobic, trans men are real men, it would be no different than trying to say a straight man could be lesbian when that's not real and people pushing that belief are supporting corrective r*pe.
no you’re not invalidating anyone by saying that. if they like trans men they are not lesbians they are invalidating the men they’re interested in and prove they don’t see trans men as men. <3
Genital preference =/ gender preference. Basically, lesbians aren’t attracted to men. Trans men are men. 
Lesbian means non men loving non men. Enbies aren’t men, trans women aren’t men, cis women aren’t men, so all of these people can be lesbian. Same goes with gay/mlm, just for enbies and men.
Gender is a spectrum, why should sexuality not be one?
Personally I feel that labels for sexuality are just way to confining, for me I think I'm a lesbian but I can get turned on my man too. Just enjoy who you want to and pick a label that you can tell other people when they ask. At least that's what I do 😝 hope you find something that works for you guys
We make the labels for the people, not the people for the labels. 

This whole conversation feels _deeply_ confusing to me\*, because... like... they're words? ""Lesbian"", as a category, means different things to different people, to a frankly frightening degree. So does ""gay"". So does ""woman"" or ""man""! 

All of these are labels we give ourselves. They may correspond in some way to some fundamentally natural or biological _thing_, but at the end of the day, they're terms we use to describe ourselves, and if the term doesn't help us understand ourselves or help others understand who we are... The whole thing's a waste of time.

Personally, I've found that fighting over the boundaries, over where these labels start and end, is basically always a huge waste of time. They're words! They mean different things to different people, and the whole point is understanding each other. My partner has at times identified as a trans man, a butch lesbian, or both. You can say ""I don't really understand how a trans man can be a lesbian"", because that's a matter of semantics and understanding (and if he's in a good mood, he might explain how he thinks about it), but to say ""You can't be a lesbian, you're a trans man"" is to miss the point. ""Lesbian"" is not some platonic category. There is no High Council Of Elder Lesbians who are going to come down from on high and separate the self-identified lesbians into valid and invalid, as much as TERFs wish there was. It's all communication. If you're asking if it's ""possible"" for someone who identifies as male to also identify as a lesbian... Well, obviously! You started the thread because you noticed that there were people doing it! 😁

I hope any of this makes sense. If I had to summarize, I'd say the TL;DR is ""Yes, _but_ it's complicated and has to do with how you think about language"". 

------

\* Why yes, I _am_ autistic, thank you for noticing
If you take the definitions strictly than yeah, but for me sexualities aren’t rock solid so a lesbian could have that one man they like and they could be trans. Now a lot of lesbians do this and invalidate trans men so obviously fuck that shit but sexuality is too complicated to give binary answers
I agree with you however, if a lesbian is dating closeted trans male and then, the trans male comes out to them, then the lesbian is not obligated to change their sexuallity even if they stay together.
In my opinion, the labels we use to identify sexual orientation are just descriptors, tools for who we are generally interested in. Sometimes there are exceptions to those labels and sometimes those exceptions are boundary pushers that expand someone's understanding of their sexuality. 

Just because someone is open to dating a particular trans person or because someone who is straight but their partner transitions doesn't mean they need to change the label they self prescribe or leave the relationship. It just means that the label they self prescribed doesn't fit that situation. 

A straight woman and a closeted trans woman start a relationship under the assumption the trans woman is a cis man, then the trans woman comes out and transitions. If the relationship continues to work, then that doesn't automatically make the cis woman bisexual or gay. She may not be open to initiating relationships with other women under normal circumstances, but in a particular situation the label simply just didn't work. That doesn't mean the label ""bisexual"" works either though.
trans men are men. Lesbians who like trans guys aren't lesbians!
If a lesbian likes trans guys, they’re bisexual. Trans men aren’t women so they shouldn’t be pursued as one. If she does, she sees you as a woman instead of a dude.
I agree with you 100%. Being lesbian means not being attracted to men, trans men are men, I would take offense to being sought after by a lesbian or being an “exception”.
At what point are we going to get over this need to have a word to define everything and just let love and passion rule?
Honestly, I am transfemme (mtf) and my girlfriend is straight while I identify as a lesbian. I think it mostly comes down to your preference for how you refer to yourself.
Trans men are men if she's into men she's not a lesbian
A bit. I like people that I'm not sexually attracted to. Ace folk date people too despite their not being a sexual attraction. If they can do it, why can't a lesbian?
You're... a man.... therefore a lesbian.... can't like u
As an AFAB genderqueer person, I don't take offense to any potential partner's sexuality. I think if I identified as a binary trans man (have identified as a trans guy in the past, and it's totally possible that I could feel that in the future) I would feel uncomfortable with that on the surface, and communicate that to a partner if they continued identifying as a lesbian. But as other folks have said here, my partner's sexuality is their own, and has nothing to do with me. So if they explain that they identify as a lesbian because of their experiences and how they view their own identity and sexuality and gender, that's entirely up to them, and I'm okay with that. As long as they're not telling me ""Oh well I'm still a lesbian because you're AFAB"" because that's when it becomes an issue affecting MY identity.

If I were to start dating a straight girl, and she wanted to continue using the label of straight, even though I'm non-binary and queer, that's entirely up to her. If she told me she identifies as straight BECAUSE she sees me as a man, that's when I would be like hmmm I don't like this.

My partner's sexuality is not mine to define. If I'm uncomfortable with the way they view me, or if I feel fetishized in any way, or if I suspect there's some homophobia or transphobia built into their logic, I'm just not gonna date that person. But if I communicate with them about it, and understand that it's a claiming of their own identity, and has nothing to do with my identity, who am I to assign a sexuality to them?

Edit: I read another person's comment here about being demisexual, and I think that applies to where my logic is coming from. I identify as generally queer, but also like identifying as bi, lesbian, demisexual, and a dvke, because those are all the identities I feel belong to me at this point in my life. While I mostly date lesbians, if I were to ever be in a relationship with a man (regardless of them being trans or cis) I would still identify as a dvke / lesbian, because I'm mostly attracted to women, but my demisexuality sometimes allows me to form a romantic connection with men under the right circumstances. If my sexual identity made a trans man uncomfortable, I just..... wouldn't date him. Unless he understood that it's my own identity I hold in relationship to a very personal history of my sexuality and every non-sexual aspect that goes into it, not an identity defined exclusively by my relationship to him.
you’re absolutely right
Men do not fit in that circle.Women who only find it in women are lesbians and the subsets exist there.Some trans women only find it in trans women.Some cis women only find it in cis women.Speaking from a Pan point of view my opinion.
I'm so glad to see the overwhelming response here agreeing with OP, and recognizing trans men as real men.

I'm in a number of NB/Trans facebook groups and servers which all insist that it's totally normal for lesbians to make exceptions for transmen, to be a transmasc and continue calling yourself a lesbian, etc-- I've never understood these lines of rationing tbh. feels like so much compartmentalizing to me.

I'm not going to tell anyone else how to identify, honestly, but I honestly find all of it kind of ridiculous....
It’s complicated, because “Lesbian” is both an orientation and an identity/community. It’s perfectly valid to identify as a lesbian even if you occasionally date men. 

However, if a woman in a relationship with a trans man and calls it a lesbian relationship, that’s invalidating to the man’s identity and not a great thing to do.
I feel like most people confuse sapphic and lesbian, event lesbian people sometimes. Sapphic is much broader and can include non-binary and women-aligned people, not exclusively women. Also an orientation precisely describes... An orientation! Meaning, the """" goal"""", not the journey of I may phrase it that way. In other words, an orientation refers to preferences, not to one's actual dating/sexual/etc. behaviour. You can be a lesbian, have relationships with guys and still being a lesbian because, *in general* you prefer relationships with women and/or women aligned people.
It depends. I'm a lesbian, but rarely I would consider dating a man. I don't prefer men over women, but sometimes I'm just into men y'know? That being said, liking a trans man because you consider that person a woman is definitely invalidating them...
Sexuality is a spectrum. Nobody is attracted to a person’s gender. They’re attracted to their physicality or perhaps personality. Terms like gay, straight, and bi are too absolutist for anyone, especially if you’re dating someone who’s gender queer or currently transitioning
As long as the lesbian isn't doing it in a way that invalidates the trans man's identity (eg ""you're not a real man, so it's fine""). 
But yeah I think even if you identify one way, you are able to date outside of that, and that shouldn't erase who you are.
There was a pretty good show called ""Bob and Rose"" about a gay man who ends up dating a woman. He doesn't say he's bi now. He is gay, but he loves her.
Here’s my answer: Trans men are men. Lesbians are non-men loving non-men, which then means that if you’re a lesbian who’s in love with a trans man, then you’re not a lesbian because you’re then in love with a man!
I'm a lesbian, I've always identified as a lesbian and that identity is important to me. Having said that, there have been instances when I will see men who dressed or acted femininely and I have found them attractive. I don't think this should make me not a lesbian anymore.
Yes you are, to your title, because you are pushing your own feelings on other people.

On the other hand, if you are told that you need to feel ok with being pursued by lesbians or that *your female partner needs to be bi to be attracted to you* (😳) then you are being invalidated because they are pushing their feelings into you.

Essentially, always respect other trans people's identities. 

It does not impact your identity at all if some trans men date lesbians (or even if they *identify* as lesbians, like some trans men do), just like you aren't invalidating their identities by existing is a trans man who doesn't feel that way.

Gender is super complex and everyone experiences it differently. The beauty of being trans is accepting that.
can't is a bit strong. some people may identify as say lesbian, but then might find a man attractive. identity is not an immovable object, we are not defined by our identity, we define it. that being said, i would definitely tread cautiously if someone said they were a lesbian who were attracted to a trans man. could very well be a true, good faith statement, but a weary eye is valuable in the situation
there is a strong history between the transmasc community and the lesbian community- you will find people who are transmasc and still identify as wlw/lesbian (look up “cuspers” if you’re curious). but specifically trans MEN and lesbians? i think most would find that invalidating and dysphoria-inducing
I think it depends. If someone identifies as a lesbian because they like 95% of women and 5% of men, that's perfectly valid. I wouldn't be comfortable dating a ""straight"" guy, but that doesn't mean he would have to change his identify; if anything, we should break up if his identity invalidates mine. If other people are okay with dating someone who identifies in a way that doesn't exactly nod to them, than it's totally fine too. They're all just labels.

I identify as gay, but if I met a girl who I liked and we got together, I would call myself bi because I think that would probably tip the 95/5 scale.
Nah… we have levels to the amount of masculinity and femininity that we are attracted to. That’s simply your preference and there’s nothing wrong with that.
So how I see it is, trans men are men which would make a relationship where its a lesbian and a trans man a straight presenting relationship. Of course, lesbians can still like trans men, because sexuality is a complicated thing and it may be more towards personality than appearance.
I really thought we were moving out of the rigid sexual definition matrix and started moving towards a more analog representation of identity. Everyone here seems to be satisfied with pulling out their dictionaries and drawing the lines of what it means to be a ""lesbian"" and no matter what the dictionaries say this is all going to vary dramatically at the individual level.

To answer your top level question as written, yes, I'd say you are invalidating identities if you believe that X can't Y. It doesn't matter what terms you put in there. People can choose their own labels to help communicate their preferences and needs, and they can exceed and extend those labels however they see fit.
Trans men = men so lesbian excludes them. Trans-masc people don't have to be men so defining lesbians as non-men loving non-men, they can be included, but it's best placed down to the individual whether that label fits for them or not.  
As I am not a lesbian or trans-masc, I leave the issue for defining if the label lesbian means NMLNM or WLW up to others, I more frequently hear NMLNM.  
If someone dates a trans-man because they don't see them as a man so it's ""okay,"" they are transphobic.
Well, I know some lesbians go by the definition ""having a queer attraction to women"" under which a lesbian dating a man would perfectly fine. And while I obviously can't speak for any lesbian but myself, I feel like that definition does a much better job of describing my experience with sexuality, even though the ""nmlnm"" definition still fits me.

All in all, gender and sexuality are both very complicated, and we're all just figuring them out and using whatever labels are available to describe them best.
I mean...kind of? Just because someone is a lesbian doesn't mean they're not allowed to like whoever they like. They're even allowed to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't identify as a woman if they so please. Identities aren't hard rules they're guidelines with blurry borders. People can identify as lesbian one minute, decide they feel bi then be straight and go back to being lesbian and nobody really has any say in whether they're allowed to do that. 

How you identify is a personal choice that only you yourself have any say regarding.
I think it depends on the individuals involved.  Obviously, a lot of female-attracted transmascs feel exactly like you do, and you're perfectly entitled to insist on that boundary in a relationship that you're a part of.  If a female romantic partner referring to herself as a lesbian is a no-no for you, you can express that and, if it really is a deal-breaker for both sides, well that sucks but sometimes people are just incompatible.  

On the other hand, happy, consensual relationships between lesbian-identifying women and transmascs do exist, and I don't think that's anyone else's business - so long as both participants are content.  ""Lesbian"" can mean a bunch of different things in different situations - for example, a woman who is in an open/poly marriage with a man but strictly only hooks up with women may use ""lesbian"" to indicate that she is 100% not open to dating/sexing men, despite obviously being capable of attraction to a man (her husband).  If the husband is trans rather than cis, that doesn't really change anything (unless he has a problem with it, of course).  

Or, what if two AFAB nonbinary lesbians date each other?  Just because they both go on T or get top surgery or both doesn't mean they have to give up the ""lesbian"" identity/community/label if they don't want to. 

But, to be clear, I mean this strictly in the context of mutually consenting individuals using whatever label(s) they feel comfy with for themselves, personally.  When it comes to TERFy cis lesbians objectifying/fetishizing transmascs on the basis that they see them as butch women, that's just transphobic BS.
Your personal label is the one you choose. There are gay men who are in relationships with women and vice versa. But like someone else said, calling that relationship a lesbian relationship would be misgendering someone and be a bit transphobic.
I’ve heard of bi/pan lesbians and I don’t know how that works in terms of men. About trans women, I’ve seen some gay men wrongly chasing them, not recognizing them as women. There’s probably something to say about how Grindr’s “Trans” tag is used by trans women, trans men, enbies, and cis men with a different intent.

I refer to myself as trans (woman), non-binary, and vaguely masculine nouns sometimes, and I honestly don’t think sexual orientation even works with me. You’re attracted to me in a given way to some extent or you are not. Theoretically, I would have the best success with pansexual people.

Identifying as approximately bisexual, I can theoretically be attracted to any gender, but for some reason, no matter what that gender is, the attraction always feels gay.
So, it's complicated.  

Yes, words have meanings.  But Individuals don't always fit neatly into boxes, and if an individual wants to stay in their box or fly the flag or however else they claim the label, for honest reasons, however confusing, I would call them wrong.
unless they're using the split attraction model (as in their sexual orientation is lesbian and their romantic orientation includes attraction to men), then anyone identifying as a lesbian who's attracted to a trans man is either being transphobic or is in denial about their attraction to men. trans men are men, end of story.
I’m a dude and dating trans men doesn’t make me straight…because they’re men. So I’m wondering of a lesbian dating a trans men might be moreso bi?

Edit: typo
A binary trans man? Yes. That's not right but some trans masc people identify as lesbians and are fine with lesbians because technically they aren't fully men
They can't they are men and lesbian means non-women loving non-women ( nwlnw ) so they cannot love men if they love trans men they'd be bi or any sexuality that contains liking men and women
lesbians are fem-aligned attracted to fem-aligned, along with nonbinary folk  
transmen are not fem-aligned nor nonbinary  


overall, I agree, it seems super invalidating to basically be referring to a transman as a lesbian. that's basically what we've been called all our life because we're not guys, we're just masculine lesbians! (/s) it's the cycle all over again, but with a shitty gloss of paint over it.
I think sexuality is a complicated thing. For example, I’m transmasc. I usually call myself straight now (attracted to girls & some nonbinary people). But if someone dating me called themself lesbian, I’d be totally fine with it as long as they didn’t call me their girlfriend or say we were wlw or anything. I think being comfortable with it comes down to personal preference, but overall saying you’re lesbian and then being attracted to women, nonbinary people, and trans men but no cis men honestly just says “I don’t see you as really being a guy”. A trans man being a lesbian’s “exception” is fine, or if that lesbian is also attracted to cis men it’s fine, but if it’s just trans men, that’s pretty iffy.
(Sorry this was kinda rambling and repetitive! I just wanted to share my thoughts)
If sexuality is a broad spectrum, then I believe they can identify as one thing and cartainly act outside that identity in ways some might feel doesn't fit the definition of that label.

And as a trans woman married to a gay identifying man I feel I'm certainly not invalidated, you can't help who you love 💕

Though it certainly doesn't feel validating for people (especially those within the LGBTQ+ community) to knitpick words, labels and definitions.
Labels aren't always absolute, straight people can like the occasional person of the same gender, gay people can like the occasional person of the opposite gender. There are probably instances where this does happen due to transphobia but there are also going to be instances that aren't transphobic. Some lesbians might not like any men, some might like one or two specific men. Trying to define someone else's sexuality for them generally doesn't go over well.

tldr: sexuality is complex and no two people are identical. Let people define their sexuality for themselves no matter how they do so.
I think it's fair to be uncomfortable with that personally but lots of trans men / trans mascs have talked abt how those identities intersect. I'm trans masc (present like a man in a lot of my life also) and my gf is a lesbian. It comes down to what gender means to you imo
""Am I invalidating anyone's identity if I believe lesbians can't like **me**?""

There's no reason to put your beliefs into a generalization. If you don't want to be pursued by a lesbian, cool. Tell your pursuers no, then adjust your internal view.

If someone identified as lesbian and wanted to date ftm, don't worry about it; you've already set your boundary.

What you've written is just waiting to hurt someone's day for no good reason, *even if you're right.*

Have a good day.

Sexuality and gender are fluid. Many women identify as lesbian when they are bisexual because their preference for women is strongest. 

If it bothers you personally, talk to your partner about it.

If this is pertaining to other people's relationships... It's between them and their partner or love interest. 

I used to know a genderqueer lesbian, who at one point fully transitioned and once identified as trans man, then half detransitioned. She now dates a gnc trans man, and neither are bothered by the label lesbian.
I don’t care what label someone uses and who they are attracted to. Why impose your opinion on someone’s life/identity?
By being trans men, we aren't cis, so we are therefore inherently queer. Labels are the best term that fits at the time and people evolve. Lesbians also fall under the general queer umbrella. People are allowed to be attracted to anyone they want. No one is bound by a label that they placed on themselves. I will never understand gatekeeping when it keeps out people who are legitimately interested in being with you as a human.
Forcing everyone to accommodate to the same labels serves no purpose and is inevitably ostracizing to somebody. If somebody is a woman who dates women and being a lesbian is an important part of their self identity, it's kind of ridiculous for someone who isn't involved in the situation to insist that that woman drop the identity of ""lesbian"" because they're dating a trans man. Just leave them alone. It doesn't hurt anything. isn't that what we're always telling the right wing crazies? ""Just shut up and let me live my life. I'd you don't like it you can leave."" Why would you not practice the same tolerance you expect from others?
trans MEN or transMASCS? bc you can identify as a lesbian and like a transmasc, but you cant if you like trans men
(bc lesbian is nonmen loving nonmen)
Are you lesbian? 


If not how do you know if they can like trans men or not? Your answers really simple here. Stop over thinking things and focus on your own business
I think some trans mascs use it to signify that while they’re men they want a lesbian sorta relationship. I couldn’t tell ya the differences off the top of my head but there’s def a different vibe between a sapphic and a Hetero relationship for the most part
Technically, they can love men, but not feel romantic and/or sexual attraction toward them.

But yeah, in that context, it's invalidating, it's like saying ""transmen are butches"" or ""transgirls are femboys"".

There's a nuance to make for enbies, but I think most of transmasc enbies aren't willing to be called butches.
Idk. I'm non binary, and for a long time I thought of myself as a lesbian. Because, you know, girls.

Then I got a crush on someone I didn't know all that much about, asked around, and found out he was a trans dude. 

I spent a good while thinking about what this meant. Because I still liked him. I didn't think of him as anything other than a cute guy with great hair. But I never thought of myself as bisexual. I don't know. 

We're dating now, and I still don't know. I've never really told anyone I was a lesbian in the first place, so now my official position is that my sexuality is unlabeled. I like most girls, I like some guys, and fuck if I don't like non binary folk. No labels, no worries.
Trans men are men. So even if they're pre transition and a lesbian, not knowing theyre a man, has a physical attraction, when they realize the person is male, they should understand he will look more and more male over time and that he wouldnt want to be treated like a girl.
this isnt real, you are living in an echo chamber, no one in the real world cares, just fuck who u want
I identify as a lesbian because I am exclusively attracted to romantic relationships with women. I am also in a romantic relationship with two men. One is cis, one is ftm. 

Because I identify as NB, my partners and I usually just use the term “queer” relationship. I think that is the MOST appropriate when genders are blended. The way you identify isn’t changed based on who you are with—the identity of the relationship changes based on who you are with.

So calling myself a lesbian (something I realized after being married nine years and with my girlfriend who is now a man), is still correct. But the fact that they are both men excludes me from saying I’m in a wlw relationship.
To the best of my understanding, their are trans men that identify as butch/masc lesbians and trans women who identify as gay femboys/twinks, but that often wades into the realm of Blanchard and other transphobic gatekeepers.  Their “logic” is that trans people we recognize as straight are homosexuals that are transitioning due to external and/or internal homophobia.

I’d recommend being a little weary of anyone using these terms.  You’re gf probably has other reasons, but the trans people that agree with Blanchard almost always have lots of internalized transphobia and typically only except binary trans folks.

Transition changes or reveals many people’s sexualities.  You’re gf is probably working out what labels work for her or not.  I’m in a similar spot.  Being a lesbian always made sense to me, but now I’m questioning if I might be pan or something else.
Someone may perceive you as a woman/female, but that doesn’t have to invalidate your own self-perception.

Some people are hung up on genitalia some aren't. It's complicated, personally more trans lesbian woman but also ex cis het. More attracted to femme guys/trans women and trans men. Some trans men are attractive to me since there is some feminity left. Have a aversion to hair but not phased by more masc trans men in some cases.

Like super close to a stereotypical Dyke at work and out. Sexuality is complicated and not binary for me.
They could in the sense of QPRs (queer platonic relationship). They could also be homosexual while also being biromantic
It stems from the different ways we are misgendered.

To the transphobic world, a trans woman is a ""man"" trying to be a fox in the hen house. They generally ignore straight or non-monosexual individuals in opposite gender relationships, or just write them off as gay men trying to trick straight men.

For trans men, they are women who went to claim male privilege, or they are tom boys who are confused.

So, based on those stereotypes, it is less likely to be overtly considered for MLM relationships for a trans woman, because trans women are seen as sexual predators, out to invade women's spaces or trick men into gay sex.

Where as, because in TERF logic, trans men are just confused women, many TERF lesbians will fight that trans men are lesbians, because it continues their own rhetoric. (They often forget that some trans men are gay, because two dudes dating doesn't help their argument.)
I struggle with this. I'm mtf, and I've always felt extremely uncomfortable around men. From my own family to classmates, just...never felt safe around them. But I don't get that sense of danger from trans men. I don't know entirely why but I feel safe and comfortable and can usually pick up on a trans guy because of that. If I were to date a trans guy I would definitely say I'm straight, but otherwise I'm only attracted to women, and I wouldn't likely date a trans man for that reason.
 This entire problem (it’s not your problem you are completely correct) comes from people not understanding how labels work. You don’t just say you are one thing if you don’t fit the criteria for that. I can’t say I’m bisexual if I ONLY like one sex? Same way I can’t say I’m homosexual and then like two sexes
read the title. answer: No.

edit: read the body text. answer: its something ive seen as well, and i hate it. to keep this brief, whats happening is an overimportance on genitalia when relating to gender. thats simply transphobic. youre right, lesbians want women, think of a vagina as inherently female, and only date trans men (in these particular scenarios) because they *might* have one. thats a horrible reason to make an 'exception'. its not invalidating to say that op. its only the respectful thing to do if youre truly attracted to your partner to identify yourself at least a bit more fluidly in order to include that partner. the invalidation is coming from the other side.
I think it’s straight, your a guy so I don’t see why it wouldn’t.

And this is coming from another bi trans woman
There's this idea of heteroflexible/homoflexible. The idea there exists a spectrum of sexualities from fully being attracted only the opposite gender to fully being attracted to the same gender. this 'flexible' thing would be when you're on the verge of being fully straight or fully gay.   
On the  hand, this idea seems valid in my opinion. There are reported cases of cis wlw dating cis gay men once on a blue moon and dating the expected gender the rest of the time, so this could theorically extend to transpeople. On the other hand, not even mentioning the binarism of the whole thing, there is something iffy to me, because lot of those hetero/homoflexible stuff I heard were stories about cis lesbians or straight dude dating or having sex with a trans dude. And I do see in what way this could feel invalidating for transmen. This contribute also to my own insecurities as a trans fem lesbian because this is part of the trend of cis lesbians willing to date transmen and not willing to date transwomen.  
I'm not sure those lesbians should drop the label because they partook in this trend once or twice, but i definitely think that if you keep doing it you should have a good think.
I’ve just kinda dropped the lesbian label at all. I’m just pan. I let my relationships excitedly define and we discuss. I’m a relationship anarchist so they each are significantly individually that relationship. Many of mine are asexual and we feel close. 

I put more emphasis on being a feminist than a lesbian. I’m into people who are into feminism and things that don’t uphold patriarchal exceptionalism. I feel like so many lesbians aren’t “gold star” and feel separate from gold stars since sex labels get very focused around genitals, and for some reason people think your hangy thing makes your gender, not your consciousness. 

So your man might feel affirmed in a feminist relationship. Many of us I feel are connected to the feminism part of lesbianism but don’t count ourselves because of it’s politically/bodily exclusive nature.
Maybe that person's sexuality needs a better term.

For example I was born male, but I consider myself to be non-binary/gender fluid/post-genderist. I'm mostly attracted to femininity. So I like women and trans women. 

But let's be real. Some femme men look just as feminine as trans women, both gay and straight. And I can't deny that physically I'm still attracted to that.

Some might consider me straight because I'm attracted to femininity. But maybe some would consider me to have lesbian tendencies if they consider me to be a woman.

The same goes for men. If they consider me a man then I guess me being attracted to femme guys makes me a bit gay.

So if she's lesbian because she's attracted to a woman with masculine qualities...maybe it's not so weird/wrong/paradoxical. She could like a butch lesbian but not particularly care for boobs or vagina. Does this make sense?

It's all a spectrum. And tbh, I'm not an expert. I had my gender/sexuality crisis at the turn of the new year. I'm new. But this is what makes sense to me.
Eh. Sexuality is fluid and messy. I've had lesbian friends want to have sex with men every so often, and they still consider themselves lesbian.

I'd be very very hesitant to invalidate someone's own identity, if they've told me what it is.
trans men are men, so probably not
Bruh. I’m chill with that. Trans men are men. All the t4t girls I know that date trans men are masc attracted and consider themselves straight. They date trans men and cis men.

But like t4t is just a higher form of love. Where you love someone for how hot their body is.
If she wouldn’t gizzly globble on a cis dick, she ain’t gizzly globbling on mine.
Before anything else, trans men are men, and lesbian saying something like “as a lesbian I am attracted to all AFAB people” comes across as transphobic. That having been said, there is nuance in these terms. 

There are circumstances in which a lesbian might date or have sex with a trans dude. If we’re using the split model of attraction someone can be sexually attracted to certain groups but romantically attracted to other groups. Would it be inappropriate for someone who is sexually attracted to women but romantically attracted to others or vice versa to refer to themselves as a lesbian? I don’t think so. 

Rigid labels aren’t particularly helpful. Ultimately what I want out of these labels is for them to serve people. By holding ourselves to overly strict definitions we make communication difficult. I could say “I’m a homoflexible panromantic abrosexual non-binary woman who is almost exclusively attracted to other women even when my sexuality shifts to include other genders and is open to dating anyone but is only ever seeking women because that’s where my primary interests lie and dating someone who I may stop being sexually attracted to adds complexity to the relationship.” Or, because that requires a lot of explantation to express a fairly simple idea, I can just say “I’m a lesbian,” and my non-binary partner can be fine with that because they understand that there’s nuance and flexibility in the language that we use. I refer to myself as queer, but there was a time that I called myself a lesbian and despite all those caveats a couple sentences ago the term was a pretty accurate description of how I navigated the world.

My personal experience is pretty specific, but there are plenty of cases of like lesbians who realized they’re trans men or non-binary who are now faced with this issue of losing their entire community. Rather than leaving them out in the cold we could just say, “if you want to keep being a lesbian you can do that. You’re welcome here.” 

There are too many potential edge cases for us to say, hardline, that people from X group must be/do this or that. It would be more useful for us to say that, at the core, [group] are people who [thing], and then treat it as a gradient that radiates in all directions and commingles with other identities’ gradients. This preserves the sort of quintessential image of the group while being inclusive enough to encompass all those who want/need inclusion in the group.
I kinda want to weigh in here, when I had met my ex they where none binary but after month and a bit they said that they where transgender. That never really bothered me because I had loved them either way... sadly it didn't work out in the end, but that's the way life is sometimes
You clearly have a point. For my case, I identify as a transbian, because I'm attracted almost exclusively by women, but it still can be exception. One of my partners is a cis man, so I probably more of a bisexual/homoflexible, but for some reason I hardly identify with that label and I am way more comfortable with the transbian one.

>why would they not want to change their label to something that is inclusive of masculine identities

This sentence you said clearly give me something to think. Maybe identifying as transbian can be bad for my male partner ?

I have already thank about this : does this feeling come from ""internalised heterophobia"" (internalised homophobia as I grew up male but reversed because as trans I'm female) or something like ""compulsive homosexuality"" (same principle) ?

So I don't know how to say that when speaking, but for the writing part maybe something as TransBIan (or Trans-Bi-an would be a more inclusive variations ?

I would like to have people opinions about that :)
This is such a complicated series of discussions, in my opinion, because labels are subjective and not objective. People are free to use whatever label they like and define it as they wish for themselves, but they must also realize that not everyone else will jive with their definition of the label. 
I’m a trans guy in a relationship with a once hard-core lesbian. The thing is, even before me, my afab nb partner was sexually more expansive than “lesbian” would suggest. My transition has been difficult on my partner, not from an attraction perspective, but from an identity perspective. They have had to reconsider their self label because it made me feel invalidated. 
Ultimately, someone’s label is theirs to define, but it can still feel invalidating to their partner. If they refuse to consider your feelings, then I see that as problematic from a relationship perspective. If their label is more important than the relationship, then people will end up hurt. 
Open to different interpretations and perspectives! Hopefully I got my thoughts across somewhat coherently.
If a lesbian woman, as in not a bisexual woman with a preference, is seriously interested in a binary trans man post hormones, then she is likely fetishizing at best and transphobic at worst.

I will say humans don't control their attraction, so a pre hormone trans man may be attractive to a lesbian, but that doesnt mean it doesn't then become an issue if she finds out he is trans and decides to pursue a lesbian relationship with him, especially if she then pressures him into delaying a transition for the sake of her attraction. If she says OK maybe I am bisexual and respects his identity as a man in pursuing a relationship that's different.

Gender and sexuality are fluid so it's hard to definitively say any lesbian identified woman attracted to any trans identified man is wrong, but when the binary is established and it becomes a woman only attracted to women being attracted to a trans man because of his vagina and her perception of vaginas=womanhood thats a problem.
I know some trans men and some nb masc people are okay with it, but me personally? I would NOT date a lesbian, I'd actually be insulted if a lesbian tried to date me.
A lot of these terms are used as umbrella terms which is why when you break down into the nuance behind it it can get confusing. Before anyone reads further I would like to reiterate this is just my interpretation and understanding of these terms through the language and history that surrounds the LGBTQ community. Trans men and trans masc fall under the same umbrella but they carry slightly different connotations and blend with other identities in their own unique ways. We all know that the trans umbrella also holds the non-binary umbrella in the non-binary umbrella holds trans masc as well. There's binary trans umbrella (trans men/trans women) and the non-binary trans umbrella (trans masc/trans fem).
Lesbianism is a very interesting especially through the historical perspective because historically the gender concept of what a woman was was directly linked to what a man was. So a lot of lesbians didn't feel like an actual woman because how the gender woman was defined by society was in relation to men when lesbians didn't want any relation to men. This is why the non-woman loving non-woman label applies here historically. The term lesbian has changed in its definition and interpretation through society many times. A lesbian icon for example is Sappho and now there's a new developing sexuality label called sapphic because the modern interpretation of the word lesbian was heavily altered after the terf invasion around/during the 70's. Sapphic is a new reclamation of the original interpretation of the word lesbian (non-man loving non-man). 
So if a non-binary trans masc individual was comfortable being in a relationship with a lesbian through the interpretation of the non-man (still masc) loving non-man it'd be fine. If a binary trans man was in a relationship and the person wanted to continue to refer to them as a lesbian they would be wrong and an asshole. A lot of these conversations rest on the fact that when you're with a person you need to establish what language is and isn't okay with each other as individuals. 
Once again this is just my interpretation of these umbrella labels and individual preferences are unique to the individual because everybody's gender and sexuality has added nuance unique to them that can't easily be contained/commincated with that one umbrella label.
This entire conversation has me wondering what do you call a non-binary person loving non-binary person (nblnb or enbylenby)?
Related Question for other trans men in the comments, do you think feeling dysphoria from someone who identifies as lesbian dating you could be a signifier that you're transmasculine/ trans man? Context: I have been unsure if I'm NB or Trans Masculine for a while now but I feel a bit uncomfortable when I am approached on dating sites etc by people with 'lesbian' as their sexuality or with things like 'women only' in their bio. Do any NB people feel this way or is it mainly Trans Men?
I'm a female (Cis) who has dated a trans female (mtf) and I was strait prior. However I fell in love and had announced a change in my sexuality as Pan. Me dating someone who hasn't had genital surgery isn't saying I'm strait. As I didn't love them for their body. I would still love them if they got surgery or not.
I think it's disregarding of an actual person to date someone based on their biological gender. If your only into females and date a trans male, you are disrespecting their identity and are only seeing their body as their biological gender.

Sadly, trans often get used for kinks, for their body, and so on. It's a common issue and leads for distrust when it comes to dating. I can only dream of how painful it must be to think someone accepts your real identity, but in reality only used you for a kink.
Well, there's a difference between homosexual and homoromantic though
I am all for people identifying however is most comfortable to them, but I do believe that arguing about it is arbitrary and often just ends up being transphobic. I personally believe that lesbian means non-men dating and being attracted to eachother. Trans men do not fit in that definition, and therefore can technically not be lesbians or in lesbian relationships. However, again, I support people labelling themselves however they feel most comfortable. I'm not going to tell a trans man who labels themselves as a lesbian they're wrong. The topic is pretty nuanced and difficult to not offend someone because it's as sensitive as people's identity.
Trans men are men - I'm a transbian and have trans guy friends and don't feel attracted to them.  Great friends, though.
on a simple level, i wouldn't say that's an inherently bad view, but it becomes more complicated when you apply it to people who transition while in lesbian relationships and remain in said relationship and both partners are still attracted to each other.

The thing is... is just like there are people who only dated straight but are actually bi, there are people who date only gay but are actually bi. I think it comes to how society is. A man is seen by a woman dating gay as so unlikely to have those traits like sensitivity, openness, acceptance due to how society feels to be for her, that she just forfeits that playground all together. So its not really invalidation of identity, its more like they arent going to identify as bi if they arent going to date cis men due to their perceptions, even though in a non-gendered society anything would be on the table. I think you get where I am getting at with a transman... she sees them as much safer option which is can firmly confess she will give a chance to as they are perceived to be much more likely to be able to sympathise with womanly issues and be open as people who are seen as born as the sex that is allowed to be sensitive.

These are obviously all stereotypes, but they are most likely subconcious and people just don't realise it...
They can it depends what they like. If a trans man has a vagina it could still be attractive. I know of a lesbian transmasc relationship where she still identifies as lesbian. As well my friends that are straight aren’t into anything other than a 
Natal penis so trans masc doesn’t work. But I think it’s ok to have our own preferences even if it might seem invalidating. You do you and find those that are cool with you the way you are. No one is ever going to please everyone.
It would bother me. 

I’m also a trans man. I would be really bothered if my partner identified as a straight man, or a lesbian woman. Because I am not a woman. And I believe, if they are using those labels then they are lumping me in with women. 

I recognize Butch female identities. Those are perfectly valid and if they are a he/ him lesbian then that is perfectly fine. 

But I personally am not. 

I would hope my partner would be inclusive of me in the same way I would want my identity to be inclusive of them.
I don't have the same standards as you. People are complicated, they're identities are complex and people don't always expect who will make them horny. I just want to be desired by someone decent who doesn't mind that my desires aren't exactly innocent either.

I don't mind a self identifying lesbian lusting after me. I might just like them back.
No, you're not invalidating anyone by saying that. As an ftm guy, I'm sick of the ""it's not transphobic if trans it's towards trans *men.* It's only transphobic if it's towards the IMPORTANT trans people"" mentality. It fucking *stings.* I agree, we're not your quirky masc girlfriend. Part of the reason I don't date is because I would *hate* to be called someone's ""girlfriend.""

If you identify as a lesbian and have an exception, that I would consider different. Most people use a binary sexuality label, but I think sexuality is fluid/a spectrum, and I think a lot of heterosexual/homosexual people might find there are a few people they'd make an exception for, but that group is so small that they don't change their label for them, if that makes sense. But that's a different can of worms, and I think if you identified as a lesbian then met a trans man you were attracted to you *could* date him, however at the point where you actually started dating him you two would need to have a discussion about what labels he's okay with. I'm at a point where I'm not secure enough in my masculinity to be a lesbian's ""exception"" without feeling invalidated, but I think I could date a bi girl with a preference for women.
I'm a transwoman and actually see myself as bisexual, but I feel attracted more often to women, until I perceive that I'm bi, I felt like lesbian, because until that moment, I only get attracted to women, but then came my first boyfriend, he was a transman (was, because he regret transicioning and identifies as a cis woman now), and changed my label to bi, because I was atracted by him, a man, but we broke up and she told me that she felt like a girl, that being trans was a fase, I don't know, she cheated me so I don't pay any attention to her problems on that moment, and started to think, if she was a girl and just pretend to be a man, what by her words was an error, so I still lesbian and my attraction to her was of two women? And I still on this doubt, until my husband get on the scene, a cis man, and I felt attracted to him, so I perceived, yeah, I'm bi.

So, with this long story, if someone don't make any effort to change their label to include your gender, this person isn't worth your time.
this is basically just the age-old ""I'm not into trans women because I'm not gay"" argument on their part, and is just as invalidating.
As a bi person, I feel like self-bi erasure also might be at play when people identify as lesbians and date trans guys.
Trans men are men and at the same time identity is personal, nuanced, and valid. 

In general terms, no, lesbians aren't into men. 

There are, however, people who identify as lesbians who are or have been attracted to one or more men or group if men.

Both of these things are true.
i feel that it is up to the individual how they want to identify and it's a conversation that should be had between partners. defining anything as objective fact removes the purpose of the freeing nature of the queer community - and if anyone disagrees with me that is fine too.
I agree. Trans men are men.
Personally, my girlfriend identities as a lesbian and I’m a fairly masc trans guy - I’m not binary but the non-binary part isn’t like, fem leaning. But I really don’t mind because I know her attraction is like… 85fem/15masc and it’s easier and gives her a space in her specific community for her to just say lesbian. It’s not just a description of attraction it’s also an important community place and personal identifier.

We also refer to our relationship as a queer and as a gay relationship comfortable even though she’s a girl and I’m a guy because that’s what fits our relationship.

Personal identity is very YMMV. I know she’s not invalidating my gender. But if another lesbian I didn’t know as well situationally approached me I’d be like uhhhhhhh……………

So… Yeah, it’s situational and personal. Everyone’s life and personal identity and relationships and the words they used to describe them are different.
So here's the thing: both lesbian and gay are terms that can be used as a standalone sexuality, and part of a sexuality.

I had a friend who was pansexual, but homoromantic. She was sexually attracted to anyone, including men, but she was not romantically interested in anyone but women. So she'd also refer to herself as a lesbian. Another friend of mine was omnisexual, but 90% of her attraction was towards women, so she'd refer to herself as a lesbian all the time, even being married to a man. The way I see it, lesbian can be used the same way we use ""gay"" -- as an alternative to queer, to say ""I am not straight"". Personally, I prefer using ""queer"" because I don't like people assuming I'm only into men, because I'm not. I'm pan, so I'm attracted to anyone within my age group (or older; I have a thing for men in their 40s like whyyyyyy 😭).

My line is drawn when you don't identify under an mspec sexuality, but JUST ""lesbian"", and ESPECIALLY if you specify ""I am not attracted to men"". If you're not attracted to cis men but you're attracted to trans men, then you're just transphobic. I've straight up called cis people out on their ""I date trans men but not cis men"" bullshit and blocked them, because we are NOT a separate category. I am a man. Being trans is only a part of the descriptor.

Anyone that claims to not be attracted to men but dates trans men is a transphobic chaser. Anyone who's bi/poly/pan/omni, also identifies under the lesbian label, and is attracted to men is fine. If you're feminine-leaning and you want to make it clear to the world that you're not a straight fem and you don't want to use the term queer? You're fine with me. But the moment you have ""no men / men DNI / I hate men / etc."" and you try and hit on me, a trans MAN? Get fucked.

EDIT//
I do want to say, I hold an exception to the ""not attracted to cis men but attracted to trans men"" rule, which is if you're also trans. If you say you're not attracted to men at ALL then that's not gonna fly, but T4T specifically makes sense to me, because a lot of us trans folks have issues trusting cis people in general and feeling safe around them privately due to the rampant amount of violence against us. T4T isn't transphobic, it's a safety measure. Cis people only being attracted to trans men but not cis men, or trans women but not cis women, are transphobic and can eat shit.
Another reason why sexuality labels are very limiting and not fit for purpose most the time. It’s entirely personal your sexuality and how it interacts with your gender and others gender. I’m transmasc and my girlfriend is transfem we are both queer but our relationship feels more like a lesbian relationship more than anything else but neither of us are ‘women’ 😆
It depends.

I identify as a lesbian, because like 99 times out of 100, I am only into women.

But like, I'm not willing to fully rule out being attracted to men (or other genders for that matter) because... it happens.

I could say I'm a Abrosexual Demisexual Demiromantric demipan-lesbian and confuse people, or I can say I'm a lesbian, which gets me 99% of the way there.

If you don't like someone indentifying as a lesbian dating you because they view you as being ""Man-Lite"" that's hella understandable, because that's garbage.

But like, I'd still consider myself a lesbian if I were. And if a partner wasn't okay with that, then we're not compatible romantically, and I would not date them.
bi lesbians arent real and trans men are men you are right
Could be. but why share a marginalizing opinion. live and let live. You do you

Hey, trans femboy here, I would absolutely take offense if a lesbian were to approach me to date without immidiately changing their label or showing willigness to do so. Much less actually be in a relationship with a person who still identified as lesbian, I would absolutely not agree to that.

 I feel like most trans femboys would feel the same, most of us went through a lot of trouble to sort out our gender and our alignment with femininity, and still consider ourselves just as much a man, as any cis femboy or non-femboy cis man would. 

I personally think lesbian means attracted to females and female alinged genders. 

Sexuality is complicated of course, and I arrived at this conclusion about lesbians: Most lesbians who are attracted to butch lesbians still think of butches as fully female.And find masculinity their masculinity attractive spesifically because they are women. But there might be a smaller group that have a more complicted relationship with masculinity and their attaction to it, and might actually be closeted bi, pan etc. Leading to some less considerate or insecure ppl disripecting their partners identity in the effort to finding their own sexuality. At least that's my take on it.
Yes, but they could identify as Bi. Just because you are in a straight presenting relationship, doesn't mean you aren't bi still. 

Same with like beinf aro/ace. Still aro and/or ace even if you're in a straight presenting relationship. 

Combos of these can also exist (like biromantic lesbians, or 

The issue comes when someone identifies as purely a lesbian and nothing else, and then yet is in a relationship with someone who is a man, like trans men. Then that seems like an issue of the person not validating their partner's gender.
I believe nb is always gay
I somewhat understand but would it not be invalidating to a trans man dating a lesbian to hear them call themselves a lesbian in every way outside of their relationship? Being seen as an exception would personally make me feel not wanted or like their attraction to me was a mistake.
this is how i feel! i (AFAB) was dating a gay guy for a while. sometimes relationships transcend gender and sexuality.
So basically they just…aren’t using the right labels
lesbians like non men. being a trans masc does not necessarily mean you are a man. you cannot conflate trans mascs with only trans men because there are non-binary trans mascs and people who are trans masc with no other added label. 

just like how gay ppl can be trans femme, lesbians can be trans masc.
[deleted]
Yeah i was considering that, though wouldn't someone who specifically doesn't date only cis men still fall under the bisexual umrella?
Tbh I personally wouldn't date someone who thinks I'm super different from a cis man somehow. The only exception is people who are *specifically* only T4T. But yeah, I would certainly never date a cis person who wouldn't date cis men. I would probably assume they're transphobic, at least towards trans men.
yeah, not recognizing trans guys as guys and having problems with dating trans women is 100% a terf thing to do.
I'm glad someone said it. It seems to come down to the fact that some people don't see trans men as men and trans women as women. I think it is as simple as that.
Yeah, research into this still shows a very large majority of cisgender lesbians willing to date trans men, with only a small minority who would consider dating a trans woman.
Exactly how I see it. It never occurred to me that this would even happen, and it makes me really sad to think some self identified lesbians would consider dating trans men without changing their label. 

A good point someone else said though is that being trans masculine is a whole other deal and you can identify as trans masc without identifying as a man, although I still feel this would be a very rare exeption, you'd have to be non-binary and/or AFAB I feel to just barely still fit into the lesbian umbrella. Which I personally at least see as: attracted to female or female (Feminine?) alinged genders. 

Being attracted to trans men and women would still fall under bisexual, and in my opinion trans masculine and women also, just like non-binary and women would. Although I think there's a spesific label for being attracted to those two only as well.
you don't get to define other peoples sexuality
op isnt saying it has to include trans guys.
gatekeeping sexualities
This is a perfect take IMO. Your labels are yours, their labels are theirs, and as long as they don't project their labels onto you it literally doesn't matter.

Are you attracted to them? Do you like them? Is the same true in reverse? Life's too short to worry about anything else.

And as you say, there are lots of non-romantic reasons to have various labels and identities. Gender and sexuality are complicated 😂
Thank you for this comment. I've always been of the same opinion as OP, but your comment is making me rethink my position. You bring up a good point. How long someone has identified as a specific label and their role in activism are definitely factors I hadn't considered before
🥺 this made me happy
Yep. Many trans men and transmasculine people identify as lesbians, even though they arent women. There is a long story for the word ""lesbian"" and many texts written about how they identify as butch lesbians, but not as women. Labels are as complex as the people using them.

However I understand OP has a point, one might feel invalidated by their partner's sexuality. It's an important dialogue we should have.
So much this. Not to minimize how big a part of someone's identity being able to acknowledge their sexuality can be, but like so many thing in life, straight/gay/lesbian/bi are an attempt to put into discreet 'buckets' something that actually exists on a (or on several, really) spectrums. There's plenty of 'straight' people who aren't a perfect 0 on the Kinsley scale. At the end of the day, the only determining factor as to if one consenting adult is 'allowed' to be attracted to another is... if said adult is attracted to other adult.
 It is, and in my opinion is exactly why using the label of lesbian while in a relationship with a trans man even more inconsiderate and offensive, since there are so many different labels you could use to identify your sexuality that includes your current partners identity.
For some people, but not everyone, and if someone is attracted to only women and says as much, then they shouldnt be invalidating a trans man by trying to hook up w or date them
Lol that's kinda the point of linguistics... like let people keep labels if they want, but dont just throw out the whole dictionary rofl
I think your definition of sapphic is actually what lesbian means, at least the modern, generally accepted definition.

Sapphic is an umbrella term that includes lesbians and bi/pan/omni women/nonbinary people, of course if they want it to. A bisexual woman who is attracted to binary men may choose to id as sapphic to emphasize their attraction to women, or they may use bisexual as their main label but still feel included in sapphic spaces. I believe, historically, lesbian meant this too but over time it evolved to strictly exclude men.

I love your take on this though. I feel like people place too much importance on rigidly staying within the ""official"" definition of a label.
I personally disagree with this, as it does and could invalidate a lot of minorities identities, and also simply I feel isn't truthful. And is and could be deceiving for other people as well, leading to the erasure of other sexualities and gender identities. Especially as a bi trans man, if my attraction women was very small, and I was only attracted to trans women, AND had datedb only men, I would still consider myself bi, spesifically because I am still attracted to trans women. And I would be erasing my attraction to transwomen, and invalidating the existence and identity of transwomen. As well as possibly making people think transwomen aren't real women, among other things.

Basically the same but opposite scenario as what we're discussing.

 Labels for sexuality encompass all of our sexuality, not just parts of it or only spesific parts of it that are a minority you're comfortable invaliding because of bigorty.
“Nobody is attracted to a person’s gender” 🤨
Hey could you maybe put a tw or use a different word when talking about your sexuality. F** is a slur and has been used to hurt people, and while it is ok in private, private ly not the best idea to use it publicly with strangers
Because it’s transphobic?
But what about the trans man? She's either not seeing him as a man, because as she says, shes only attracted to women, or she is attracted to men. It's not fair to insult a trans man that way and insinuate they're a girl.  And the reason we have labels is because we have language and we wanted something to describe ourselves and use those words to navigate the world and find similar people.  It's cool if someone doesn't want to label themselves, , but we should respect the labels others have and not try to rewrite them.
but If they’re using it to imply they think your a woman and it makes you uncomfortable then that’s a dick move
>my girlfriend who is now a man

I'm sorry but that sounds very transphobic and is very invalidating to trans men, even if you are referring to their past self.
I don’t think you’re a lesbian dude
Umm. No.
>Some trans men are attractive to me since there is some feminity left.

Please don't say this to anybody, it's invalidating and offensive.

>More attracted to femme guys/trans women

Also this. Not remotely the same category. 

It might be no big deal for you but it won't hurt to be more thoughtful with what you're saying.
Hey, somewhat stereotypical dyke looking transman here. Don't ever include me under the lesbian label. I am a man, and the lesbian label spesifically exludes men. Don't be transphobic. Please and thank you.
psst your wording makes it sounds like bi people can't love trans people, and that is invalidating bi people and making them seem like bad people. You might want to rephrase so you don't hurt bi people.
I’m really confused, isn’t being a lesbian being solely attracted to women? I’m sorry if this is offensive but from what I know being bi and being lesbian are different things
Bisexual lesbians? I’m pretty sure that doesn’t make any sense does it? I’m a non man loving exclusively women but I like all genders…
Bestie what. Bisexual lesbians don’t exist 😭
Genuinely confused about this. How can someone be bisexual and a lesbian? Like I can understand aro lesbians or ace trans bisexuals, but isn’t bisexual and lesbian a mutually exclusive group? Like you can’t be a gay straight person or a cis trans person? Not trying to be offensive just confused.
BISEXUAL LESBIANS ??? loll
I think where this is an exception to things is that they may be like... say Bi romantic, but homosexual in the wlw/ wlnb way (or visa versa). This is then fine and not invalidating of a trans man's gender, because they are then still identifying as bi (romantically or sexually in this case). You don't have to be sexually attracted to someone to be in a relationship with them. Same with sexual attraction. You don't have to be romantically attracted to someone to be in a relationship with them. 

It is a rare case to see someone who isn't sexually or romantically interested in someone and don't fall somewhere on the ace/aro spectrum.... 

And I know for certain that I would be pretty upset if my partner still identified as a lesbian, and purely a lesbian, while in a relationship with me (a trans man).
This is wrong. Bisexuals are not lesbians. I am wlw, but I also like men
oh no! i meant there are sexualities specific to liking feminine traits. i wasn't saying it's acceptable for a lesbian to like a femboy. i hope that clears things up. i can also understand if that still offends you, just let me know!
Another trans femboy here, and i agree 100%!
Trans non-binary femboy lesbian here 👋 you're perfectly valid in feeling invalidated by the idea of dating lesbians, it makes sense for binary men to feel very uncomfortable with that. Especially binary trans men, who would often feel dysphoric in that situation. 

I will add that being a lesbian isn't just about loving femme aligning folks, there are plenty of masc lesbians and even transmasc lesbians as well. I'd encourage anyone confused by the idea of transmasc lesbians (I am one myself and would be happy to answer any questions) to check out r/butchlesbians . It has an amazing community of lesbians all over the gender spectrum! 

I myself am attracted to some masc folks; I'm not attracted to binary men (cis or trans,) but I am attracted to non-binary men in a very queer way, and while internally I'm much more boyish than girlish, my lesbian identity is still important to me and just...feels the most correct, really, is what it comes down to. I love in a queer and sapphic way.
Agreed. Being invalidated by your own partner would be horrible.
What?
The way I see it is that lesbians are more than welcome to be into non-men, but as a transmasc person dating someone who is lesbian-identified makes me dysphoric. That’s a me problem, not a them problem, so it is MY preference, not theirs.
Many trans men feel that way; I certainly do. But that's not an argument for not believing that someone can identify as a lesbian and also like trans men. People exist who fit that description, so saying you don't believe it's possible is kinda silly. What you can do though is:

* not date them (I don't)

* when you encounter them and it comes up, talk to them about it, and bring up what you said here. Sometimes they have more complex reasoning behind how they navigate their identity, and sometimes it's just weird invalidating crap, and sometimes you can talk them through that crap into either renavigating how they communicate their identity, or how they see trans men. Starting out the gate by telling them they aren't lesbian generally just results in defensiveness, and they're likely to just associate anyone invalidating their lesbian identity as the same homophobia all over again, even though obviously it isn't.
I'm a trans man and I literally don't care. Someone's identity does not invalidate mine.
One person identifying themselves as something cannot invalidate what another person identifies as. Also let's not get radicalized here...
I guess one question is, would a cis man feel invalidated by being the partner of a lesbian, and being their ""one exception""? Heck, a cis dude might even feel flattered by it! 

I know it is more complicated here, but I would argue that being secure in your gender is important. Hard to achieve (I haven't) but a good goal. 

Your partner in the other hand is explicitly invalidating your gender by stating that a person would *have to* be into women to want to be with you. That's a very different thing, and she is being an asshole.
I think sexuality is more fluid and imprecise than can necessarily be exclusively and immutably described by any single label, so if someone identifies with one label and they're not using it in the improper context (such as it would be improper to call a relationship with a man a lesbian relationship) I think it doesn't help much to gatekeep what people call themselves.
I disagree on that definition of lesbian. Lesbians are WLW... however I also see the complicated case where you are coming from where Enby's often times need to be lumped into one group or the other.

I personally would imagine it rather invalidating to be a masc enby, and be told that I am a lesbian if I like other enbys or women... it implies that I would still be a woman.

That being said, I very much am a woman, so I am only guessing how I would feel.
not everything is about men dude. I've never heard gay be described as 'non women loving non women'. If you wanna be a guy and call yourself a lesbian, don't be surprised if women into women are turned off by that.

Also, attraction/orientation tends to be physical. If you're an enby presenting fem, people into fem people will likely be attracted to you. Vice versa for masc enbies.
[removed]
Well sadly it sounds more opened to cis men. I’m one of those girls myself, and while i could totally fall in love with a trans guy if i bond with them and feel like our journey is similar and brings us closer… that would never happen with a cis man. So yeah finding the right term is hard, people just should make sure they don’t hurt anyone in the process
Yes
I’m not a cis person ? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yeah, I'm personally trans woman Butch lesbian and I cannot really imagine I'm dating cis guy or trans guy omg even I'm preferring females more on masculine spectrum rather than girly girls.
Believe or not, I'm living in that kind of relationship with my cis hetero wife. I'm out to her more than a year and I'm also almost a year on HRT, she doesn't see me as woman, I'm not passing at all and this is probably also one of the reasons she's still with me. If I would go high femme in presentation our relationship would not survive, that's for sure. That's it.
Could an amab trans woman who's also butch not be considered trans masc?
/i/ do not. dictionary definitions, on the other hand, have nothing to do with me labelling other people and everything to do with, you know. human language. words having meanings et cetera
I’m not saying he is.

The “no” is to his question of whether he’s gatekeeping. The explanation that follows is why he’s not.
What do you mean by “gatekeeping”?

Because lesbians are attracted to women and some non-binary people, not to men. That’s not gatekeeping.
Are you stupid?
I understand OP's position and honestly I could see myself feeling the same way. It would depend tho. 

If a heterosexual woman wanted to date me and said ""I still consider myself het, but I am attracted to you"" then I'd be fine with it. If she said ""I still consider myself het because you're a man who I'm attracted to"" then I wouldn't be.
It's possible to date someone outside what you're orientation is, or else ace and aro people couldn't date anyone.
I never said you are not free to use the label you feel the most confortable with ? The thing is that labels are, by essence, changing deping on many factors. One of them is, simply, culture. That's why you cannot say : this label means X and only X, because while that might be true for you, it might not be the same for others. Labels are fluid, so are identities.
It's the same thing with bi and pan. They may describe the exact same thing for some people, and not at all for others. But, who cares? Use the label you feel most confortable with, you can even change depending on your environment or feelings or really anything, and that's not up to anyone to force you to use something else just because ""iT doeSnT meAn tHat"".
Also, no identity invalidates others. Some identities that may seem, and may be, very similar can co-exist. Once again, it's more a matter of feeling and others things such as cultural background, and its totally valid to have two labels for the same things, and to prefer one over the other. However, that doesn't not allow anyone to say they know better, and you should use X label instead of Y because they know more than you and your are X, even if you know you are X or feel more confortable with :) be who you are, that's always better than being anyone else
Oh shit yes of course!! So sorry
Accepting identities doesn’t mean accepting transphobia. I’m saying that someone shouldn’t feel justified in having an opinion about someone else’s labels or identity. 

I don’t care if your LGBTQ+… don’t spend your time trying to gatekeep who can do what with who while identifying as whatever. Let’s get past that. 

If it wasn’t clear, fuck transphobes.
It's between those two people, not strangers judging from a distance. Are you really going to walk up to one of those peoples' trans masc partners and be like ""Hey, did you know your partner doesn't respect your gender identity?"" I mean it's absurd.

I am a trans woman. I have a long time partner who is cis female and entered into a relationship with me before I came out as myself. She identifies as straight. Shes not with me because she is a lesbian, she is with me because I am her partner and she chose not to leave me because I transitioned. She sees herself as a more or less a straight woman. If someone tried to tell her she was a lesbian in the face of her insistence to the contrary, that person and I would have a problem.

TL;DR you have no right to tell anyone else what their identity is. Thats literally the entire point of the queer rights movement.
u/gethenmostad apparently this is transphobic to state that you were my girlfriend.
I share an account with my partner. I’m AFAB but identify as NB femme.
What gives you the right to tell other people their sexuality is invalid?
I would encourage you to check out r/butchlesbians . There are plenty of transmasc, non-binary, and cis butches out there, and this extends to other ways of presentation within the lesbian community as well. 

I'm a trans non-binary lesbian myself, and I play around with all kinds of presentation, but internally I'm much more boyish than girlish. I feel best being feminine in the way that feminine men are, that's just who I am. I'm a lesbian because it best describes how I love: I love queer people who aren't binary men (cis or trans) in a queer way. 

If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer any - even if you think they could be seen as rude or insensitive, my DMs are open as well. Just want to help educate with compassion.
Oh my bad
I’m not sure what they said, but a lesbian is a non man attracted to a non man, non binary people fit into the label as well

I don't know what exactly the person you're responding to is referring to, but I know personally that I am a pansexual lesbian which, for me, means that I am attracted to any gender sexually, and attracted romantically to people who aren't exclusively men.

That does clear things up, thank you. I do think it's debatable whether or not, and how much if, feminine/masculine traits play a part in sexuality. 

Personally I think sexuality should only be used to refer to what gender/genders one is attracted to. 

Of course there probably are exeptions in everything, but since feminine men are still men, and masculine women are still women, I'd say feminine genders is more accurate than feminine traits.
Yay! Trans femboy solidarity brother! 🏳️‍⚧️🫂
I'm confused by your use of Non-binary men. If they are non-binary: they're non-binary, regardless of if they are AFAB or AMAB. Do you mean gendefluid,genderflux, and/or bigender individuals identity as men? 

Cause I think at that point that the person's gender isn't male/ strictly male, and therefore would still fall under the definition of homosexuality as a whole where it is ""genders similar aligning to or the same as one's own gender"". But if you are seeing AMAB Nonbinary folk as ""Men"", then that is kind of invalidating of their gender, even if you aren't intending to. 

I'm not trying to be offensive or anything or call you transphobic if you aren't. I'm just trying to understand, and maybe bringing to light something not considered before.
They're referring to a sentiment that a lot of nonbinary people hold which basically says ""any and every relationship with me is gay regardless of the gender of my partner.""  I'm not saying this is what your partner meant/ that they weren't being invalidating, but as a afab genderfluid enby; I would call my relationship gay even if I was dating a straight cisgendered guy. I'm a boy and a girl and neither so to me everything is gay. 

For example: If I'm dating a trans girl: it's wlw which = gay. If I'm dating a trans guy: I identify as part dude and use he/him pronouns so it's basically mlm = gay. If I'm dating an enby we are definitely going to be gay af together😁. This all applies to cis people too.

Ultimately it's up to the people in the relationship to choose how to describe their relationship and to make sure both parties feel comfortable and validated with whatever label(s) they choose to use or to not use. Sounds like your partner was uncompromising about this issue and it's perfectly fine for that to be a deal breaker. Some of us just view it differently so if I were to use the term gay to describe my relationship with a trans man, I wouldn't be doing it to invalidate him/ to imply I still saw him as a girl.

Small note I'd like to add too: if my hypothetical trans  man partner found it invalidating for me to call our relationship gay we would not only have to talk about how his identity was being invalidated, but also how his reaction can be rooted in his own prejudice towards me. (Just stay with me for a second) What I mean is we'd need to breakdown the fact that he doesn't find it appropriate/accurate for me to identify with the mlm community/use the word gay to describe out mlm-ish relationship even though I am genderfluid and identify with being a guy (kind of). Basically, there's layers to this stuff and it goes both ways.
Why would it be a you problem? If they are dating you and calling themselves a lesbian, then they are calling you a woman.. which is a them problem :/
You explained this better than I could. Thank you.
Ofc but there ARE improper uses of things, sexuality is 100% fluid but you cannot be homosexual, then have “exceptions”
I’d like to say, you can be a woman and be non-binary tho. just like trans men can be non-binary or trans women can be non-binary . 

I don’t think that you have to force masc non-binary people to be lesbians, but there ARE masc non-binary people who are lesbians. It’s not our place to decide who identifies as what.

I’m curious your definition of ‘gay’ then ?? because historically there has been a lot of amab individuals who are trans femme who are gay, and from what I’ve seen the community generally accepts them more. but if a person is afab, trans masc and a lesbian - oh no it’s a crime

because it falls under the same double standards of - ‘oh that person can be a she/her gay, but that other person can’t be a he/him lesbian’
You’re free to disagree but there are a lot of non-binary lesbians who use the term in that way
Enbys are not women-light, so I can't imagine how they are included in the term any more than men.
[deleted]
Oh yes, I absolutely wouldn't mind dating someone who doesn't date cis men, I personally don't either but i still identify as bi to include trans men. I just wish they didn't use the label lesbian since is feels pretty invalidating to me personally, but a more specific label would definitely be welcome!
mm kinda understand what you say (lik I see it more like a t4t thing, like why would someone date a cis), as long as you consider yourself at least bisexual (liking trans men is liking men, they're not less men than the cis ones) I think it's okay, excluding cises because you don't have the same experiences as them it's something normal and makes a lot of sense. the problem would be saying you're a lesbian bc of that (lesbian would include nb people and transmasc lesbians but NOT trans guys).
Didn't say you were? I was talking generally

ETA: I do think you can be transphobic without being cis though. It's pretty common for people in the trans community to believe trans women are real women, and trans men... Well, they're *trans* men.
Yikes. I am sorry you are going through that. My opinion is probably based on an experience I saw between my friend and their ex. He transitioned and his ex said that it is okay essentially because they still have the same genitalia and completely disregarded that my friend identifies as a trans man. It was definitely invalidating for my friend, that's for sure.


 I don't know. I'm a grey pan, so I could definitely be missing something. 


I hope things get better for you and that you keep following the path that allows you to be true to yourself.
Trans masc / trans fem is usually about identity rather than presentation, I think. Maybe if you label yourself according to your presentation then that makes sense. Honestly the terms trans masc / trans fem can be confusing for this reason.
I woudn't say so because her identity is a trans woman, so she would be female, but gender non-conforming.   
A trans man who likes wearing feminine things isn't trans femme, he's feminine, the difference is identity vs. presentation.
butch =/= transmasc though
I think you could, and pretty much fits perfectly to my example of an exeption.
That's more so with the problem of using transmasc/fem as an umbrella term, because not all trans men are masculine and not all trans women are feminine. 
People say transmasc/fem to mean ""something something feminine/masculine spectrum"" but it ignores gnc people who arent traditionally masc or fem, but still male or female. 

So while you're right in getting confused, transmasc usually means ""afab trans person transitioning socially and/or medically to a more male appearance""
Great example.
Those orientations have nothing to do with gender though? So they can't exlude any? It has no relation what so ever to our current topic?
I see your point in a sense, but labels do have a general meaning as to what they apply to or they wouldn't be labels. And you can make labels too, and in this case that would probably be a good solution. 

And yes I can in fact say you can't use X because it doesn't correlate to the label, and because it actively harms another minority. And I can take it personally me being apart of that minority. 

The lesbian label exludes men spesifically, and saying you're a lesbian when you're attracted to trans men or even an indivual trans man, especially if you're in a relationship with them, is transphobic. And gives yet another chance for bigots to harm us, and give innocent people are wrongful idea of the label itself, as well as transmen as a whole.
 I really appreciate your willingness to correct and apologize!  I personally am mostly ok with that word (but I do have some pretty homophobic family who use it) , but I know it can be triggering for lots of people.
Obviously I'm not going to interrogate people! But if someone identifies as a lesbian and goes up to a trans MAN and asks him out, that's invalidating to the man. Yeah she may be physically attracted to his afab traits , but if she is sexually attracted to male traits, lesbian may not be correct, and if she is treating a trans man as his agab, female, he is being invalidated. 
There are always cases of romance where there is deviation from the bounds of a term due to a partner transitioning and the other partner still feeling love for the person, but that is not a reason to  reduce a trans person to their genitals and not respect their gender.  Tldr: love is flexible, but we have words to describe what traits our bodies react to, and even if your body reacts to a person's natal genitals, it's not ok to follow up on that and invalidate their gender.
While I appreciate the attempt to defend me, my partner met me when I was still presenting female and didn’t even realize I might be trans. 

We began dating while I was still identifying as female. To them, when we began dating, I was their girlfriend, and I’m okay with that. 

That doesn’t invalidate me now, and they has never, not once since I began exploring my gender identity, seen me as anything other than a man. 

They are the most supportive, accepting person I’ve ever known, and transphobic is the absolute last thing I would ever call them. 

I think this interaction shows a huge problem within our community. We always want to jump to someone else’s defense without bothering to dig deeper or to find out if the person we’re defending even wants or needs it. 

I get that we are a marginalized community, but we’re alienating our own by invalidating each other’s desires and needs. 

My relationship is as unique as my identity. Your post was a request to help you be more inclusive and validating if there was a need for it, yet you came into your comments to attack a true ally and to invalidate my own experiences without ever stopping to think. 

Please do better. We have enough enemies from outside the community without tearing down our own and those who support us.

***Edited because I previously used “husband” which is not an accurate representation of our relationship dynamic. Because they are NB, we use husband, wife, and partner interchangeably, but partner is the most accurate to our overall situation.
If definitions can be used to mean anything, it makes them redundant. 

Fact is, a man can never be a lesbian. Wlw explicitly excludes men. Can't believe anyone would disagree with that.
People who are lesbian are attracted to women, and women only. That is THE literal definition of a lesbian.

I’m not saying trans women aren’t women-I’m trans myself. I was just confused about the labeling they used, I’m sorry if I said something offensive I really didn’t mean it but yeah fuck terfs
Cringe
All for bi lesbians, but men being lesbians? Isn't that like trans girls identifying with gay men?
you understand that you’re fucking stupid right? stop drinking the koolaid and just love who you love dude
>there's been a terf-adjacent movement in modern history to make it mean exclusively loving women

could you please give a source for there being an actual deliberate ""terf-adjacent movement"" to change the meaning of the word lesbian, rather than just.... natural changing of a word's meaning over time?
I think maybe the term sapphic encapsulates what you’re talking about.
The term lesbian originated in the 1800s, not Ancient Greece, so you may want to update your copy pasta.
[deleted]
That’s fair!
Well, you can be ace and not aro. I’m sure there are people who are _romantically_ attracted to all genders but not _sexually_. There’s def a difference between who you want to fuck and who you want to date, hence ace (but not aro) bisexual. But it’s my understanding that lesbians are attracted to women and bisexuals are attracted to men and women and nb ppl and the terms are mutually exclusive. Lesbians don’t want to fuck men and bisexuals do. Idk I’m not gonna tell anyone how to describe their sexuality I just don’t understand how someone can be bi and lesbian…like I said you can’t be gay and straight or cis and trans, they’re mutually exclusive.
“Become trans” 🚩

Trans men cannot be lesbians. I cannot believe I have to say that and it’s unbelievably transphobic to think so
No, in Sappho's era, Lesbian meant ""someone living in Lesbos""
Gay heterosexual
Ace doesn’t exclude an orientation. Ace is a status of how sexual attraction is felt or not felt. Who you can be attracted to isn’t exclusive to whether or not you don’t feel sexual attraction.
[deleted]
That’s different tho
i appreciate your feedback and pov. we all have our views in these things so it's good to talk abt these things
That's what I generally define sexuality as too. I think the whole of this comment section is the community not knowing how to define it. For me I'd say sexuality is gender preference and people can have genital preferences, but that shouldn't be how they define their sexuality because it could invalidate their partner.
My use of non-binary men refers to non-binary people who also identify with manhood; this could mean your examples, yes, and beyond that. I just mean any non-binary person who self identifies as partially a man as well, I hope that makes sense. I'm never ever ascribing this label to a person because of AGAB or presentation, it's entirely up to each individual. 

My attraction as a lesbian is as a bigender non-binary person who loves any queer person who isn't exclusively a man. I love in a queer way, and in a sapphic way, so it's the best term for me.
oh. I get that I have seen it on Tiktok but really mostly in the context of afab nbs dating cishet  men.  I always viewed it as a cheeky way to cope with gross straight men not viewing you as anything other than women to be frank.


I also think it's situation dependent and as my ex was very masc, nearly always used he/him, was not very GNC, and largely swung in MLM circles it did not feel like he was describing it in the way you are.  .


I think you articulated this well and have a fair point but I also think nb folk can't just use ""Im nb and thus it's always gay"" as some trump card to use gay always, I wouldn't use lesbian to describe our amab mtf+amab nb relationship, it's reasonable to ask he/they not use gay.  IMO. in your equivalent trans man scenario it would be more like a lesbian using the term to describe a relationship with you, whether or not you'd find that uncomfortable.


tl;dr the word y'all are looking for is queer.
As a lot of other commenters have mentioned, some people who use the lesbian label define it as not being attracted to binary men. Dictating other people’s identities is gatekeepy as hell, so I’m not here to tell them their label is wrong. They know what’s in their own heart better than I ever will.
No, they’re not. I call myself a gay man because I basically am, but every now and then I come across a woman that I find just as attractive as I find other men. That doesn’t mean I think she’s a man- she’s just an exception
There are a decent number of non-binary lesbians so being with a lesbian or being a lesbian doesn’t automatically mean “woman”. It’s non men being attracted to non men
But. They aren't calling them a women. 

They're calling themselves a lesbian.
You do realize like ….being fem doesn’t immediately mean trans-fem…
Also lesbian is a WOMAN who likes women
I do respect that, I just really dont understand it.
Sorry if i sound ignorant but what if two people like eachother but one is not comfortable dating a lesbian as the label makes them personally uncofortable? Is their discomfort invalid in that case?
[removed]
Totally agree with you. CiMET for Cisgender Man Exclusionary Transgender ? Oh hell it sounds so terfy 😄
Well if someday i fall in love with a guy, of course i won’t say I’m a lesbian. I mean where would be the logic doing this 🤷🏻‍♀️ though so far it didn’t happen and my preference is still going to femininity, even if doors aren’t closed
Perhaps you can help me parse this, because I'm thoroughly confused. I'm clearly mixed up somewhere, but I'm not sure where.

I think of presentation as an outward expression, and to me it's quite similar to style, fashion, or aesthetic. So, for example, I'm a closeted trans woman so most commonly (outside of the house) I present as a man. My clothes, mannerisms, speech patterns, etc. are all essentially window dressing, where my gender is quite a bit more feminine than my typical presentation.

So where I think I get tripped up is that I see gender as being a circle that encompasses an area over the masculine - feminine spectrum, and I see those circles overlapping. So what I mean by that is that one's gender identity is in a place on the feminine - masculine spectrum and could easily be categorized as one (or more) of multiple genders.

So I would say that, and presuming that their gender identity is accurately reflected in their gender expression, I would consider Michelle Rodriguez to be more masculine than Michale Cera. I see them as their gender identity existing (again, given the before presumption) in that overlap area.

But as a thought experiment, let's pretend a universe where nothing else changes but their natal gender, making them both trans. Michelle is now amab, but still a girl and has the same gender identity/presentation, and Michael Cera is now afab at birth with everything else the same.

So in that make-believe universe, and not to imply that she's butch, Michelle Rodriguez is a trans woman but saying she's trans feminine feels off.

(And of course I don't claim to know any of their's gender, natal gender, what anatomy they were born with, yada yada yada. Also, i'm only working off of their roles as actors, and haven't seen but 3 movies in the past decade so my conception of them is quite dated. So like, resident evil + super bad if that helps. I'm just looking for something a bit more concrete to make conversation easier)
It does sometimes, there are some transmasc butches as well as cis butches.

Edit: y'all I'm not saying that transmasc folks are equal to butches, that would be absurd and transphobic. I'm saying that SOME transmasc folks are butch and identify with that label, and it's important to remember that they exist since they are so often erased.
I don't think you understand it. Ace and aro people have to deal with the same issue that op is describing, where the partner can feel invalidated by the label used. There are multiple forms of attraction, so someone could still be attracted to a person without that person aligning with the label they use.
It doesn't harm anyone if you make a personal usage of a label. Nothing compels you to force other people in your definitions of labels. You can be a lesbian in a heterosexual relationship because your relationship statut doesn't define your orientation. Such as, when you are a bi person in a heterosexual relationship, you stay a bi person.
 Relationships ≠ orientation, and that works for any orientation and kind of relationship. Or do you mean it works for *some* orientations and *some* relationships but not all? Wouldn't that be hypocritical? Or maybe, big revelation, your personal views on how relationships should define orientations only concerns you?
 As an example that might be less controversial for you: asexuality. Asexuality is a spectrum, meaning that some asexual people will have sexual relations, and even enjoy it, while some will not. However, they are all asexual, and valid as such, because *they* know they are, while other people are not able to tell that just be observing their behaviour. Same with every other label. 
  Of you want, orientation is such a personal feeling that no word will ever be perfect to encompass all of it. We have to settle on some words to understand each other, but it will always mean something at leat a little bit different for everyone, as everyone's sensibility and experience they link to this label is different. What I put behind the labels I use is very personal and only works for me because my experience as a human being is mine and mine only, and no one will ever be able to understand the depth of my whole experience, making them unable to understand a label the way I do, at least never fully.
Ah shit I’m so sorry about your family <3 my dms are open if you ever need to vent
I'm not even sure you know what point you're trying to make.
I love you so much.

Lesbians are non-men loving non-men, the intersection of gender-queer folks and lesbians has been a huge part of lesbian culture for centuries. 

Recently, a lot of TERFs have lead to a sudden enforcement of cis-women-only lesbian spaces, but those are NOT the majority of lesbian circles - and the definition of lesbian rejects this ideology as well, trans lesbians in any shape or form (weather binary or not) have always and will continue to be welcome. 

We've had transmasc and non-binary lesbians for most of time - I highly recommend you look more into lesbian history to help understand the importance of trans and non-binary presence as lesbians. 

I know that the assertion that lesbians are only women loving women has been very prominent in the past few decades, so I understand why that would be your impression, but it's incorrect and is a definition asserted on us often by transphobic cis straight women who are trying to erase trans people from women's spaces in some strange twisted version of exclusionary feminism.
That is not the definition for lesbian, nor has it ever been. And unless if you are a lesbian, it's not up to you to decide the definition. As it is currently, in the majority of inclusive lesbian spaces, lesbians include trans women and some non-binary people, if they identify with it. Often this is because a part of them is a woman, i.e. bigender non-binary folks such as myself.

For sure, sapphic and lesbian are closely linked terms
Nobody knows about the secret island of lesbos filled with primo lesbians.

Well, the ""ace bisexual"" thing you're talking about would just be called **biromantic** normally.
[deleted]
Why is that a red flag? Some trans people experience always being trans, but most of the trans ppl I know myself included became trans later in life.

And yes, trans men can be whatever they want. Gatekeeping identities of trans people is what's transphobic.

Wouldn't that be panromantic then?
she didn't specify if it was homosexual or homoromantic though
That's... That's the point...
I think so too! And I appreciate yours. I personally super enjoy conversing about deep topics, and don't get the chance to as often as I would like. :)
Yes exactly! Same goes for fashion & body type.
Ahhhh~! Okay! That makes sense. And again, I think that would fall under Lesbianism in the same way that Homosexuality as a whole can be defined as ""being attracted to similarly aligned and same aligned genders""! Causs it is exclusively Not-Men-Only identity in which you're attracted too!
>it would be more like a lesbian using the term to describe a relationship with you, whether or not you'd find that uncomfortable.

I wouldn't find them identifying as a lesbian uncomfortable for me. It's more like, would I be able to find someone who identified as a lesbian, wanted to date me, and would also use he/him pronouns and masculine words to talk about me? To be totally fair, I don't believe that's likely, but if such a person existed, I'd be fine with their label. That's still just me though and I'm sure other people in my position would have different views.

>tl;dr the word y'all are looking for is queer.

Yes and no. Would queer fit these scenarios? Yes. Is it therefore incorrect to use gay for these scenarios? No. It really is just up to the people in a relationship to dictate what terms are comfortable for them to refer to their relationship as. I'm comfortable calling my relationships gay because for me gay is a broad term. I get your point, using queer is more ambiguous/ less likely to be misunderstood, but I don't think it's wrong to use gay if someone is more comfortable with it (given that all parties in the relationship agree to it).
Like you said,
>it's situation dependent

I honestly think that's the underlying conclusion
You're bi my dude ;)

And the lesbian with a trans-masc BF is also bi, unless they are choosing to believe their partner is a butch-lesbian instead of a guy which is pretty scummy!
That…that means you are bi or pan or Omni…
:( what about us non-binary lesbians?
If it isn’t your identity then you don’t have to understand it, you know? Please don’t speak for masc enby’s if it isn’t your place
That sounds more like a compatibility issue. You discomfort is a you problem but it should generally feel good to date someone. If you won’t/can’t work through that you shouldn’t date someone you would resent being with.
Because throwing around the r-slur is a great way to make people feel that you're sound of mind.
[deleted]
I think it sounds terfy because of the implication that you can tell. It sounds like (not saying it is) an assumption that - as GCs put it - you “always know” whether a guy is cis or trans. If you accept that you won’t always know, it’s difficult to say you’d never be attracted to a cis guy.   
Or, perhaps more importantly, it sounds like maybe you think a trans guy is “different” from a cis guy on a fundamental level (other than basic biology), which again is a GC talking point ie that a trans man is not “really” a man, they are a third gender of some kind. Out of interest, what is it about cis guys that you don’t like, that you think is ok about trans guys? If it’s genital preference then I think that’s absolutely fine (and would obv also exclude some trans girls) but otherwise I wonder if there is some internalised prejudice that makes you think trans men are in some way “different”.
It's ok, I appreciate the offer though. I've cut those family members out of my life and it's been probably 7 years since I've seen any of them!
My point is dont be like ""lol I am exclusively attracted to women! But you, trans guy, I am attracted to you!""  Because trans men are men and should be respected!
You don't need to identify with a label to still interact with that community who does identify with that label.
Absolutely not. It’s NOT about feminism. It’s about common sense. A lesbian is a woman who loves another woman. This is just ridiculous at this point. I don’t care if they’re cis or not. I trans female IS a female. They have the absolute right to call themselves a lesbian, as they are female.
I said a lesbian is a female who is interested in other females. Trans females are included??? Like idk why you mentioned that in your statement, as that heavily implies you do not see trans women as real women.
Your argument relies entirely on the idea that trans women aren’t women though, lesbians are women who like women, trans women are women, therefore lesbians can be trans women and lesbians can be attracted to trans women. The main thing that spectated terf ideology from that of a non-bigot is hatefulness and prejudice, it’s not transphobic just because you’ve heard transphobes say it. It’s a perfectly reasonable assertion, and like any reasonable assertion can be twisted by the dumb/hateful.
You spreading disinformation
It also doesn't take that much common sense to know that the label lesbian conflicts with the bi label.

The erasure is twofold and you go from saying this is backed by history to ""I actually don't know, it doesn't matter"", even though your trying to enlighten us all.
That’s fair. If someone said they were ace biromantic or ace bisexual I think I would understand what they’re talking about either way. Regardless, that only further deepens my confusion over “bisexual lesbians”. Biromantic lesbians, sure, but I’m still not understanding bisexual lesbian, unless maybe you’re a person who is sexually attracted to both genders but romantically only women? Like bisexual, femromantic, if that’s a thing? Idk like I said I’m not trying to be offensive just confused is all.
Being bigender doesn’t make you cis and trans at the same time.
Ur very rude lol
If you became trans you're genderfluid
cis itf
Yeah, that person was silly
Asexual and aromantic aren’t exclusive
OHH 💀💀 LMAOO IM SORRY 🧍
Exactly! That's how I see it for myself. 

Labels are very personal and individual, and there's no one right or wrong way to be gay, lesbian, queer, etc. Unless if someone is being blatantly transphobic, ofc, I do really feel for the trans men who have had awful experiences with lesbian TERFs trying to defend their transphobic attraction.
No, I’m not. How dare you try and dictate my sexuality to me? As a rule, I don’t see myself with a woman. I don’t think being able to see myself with a grand total of less than 5 women in my life is enough to redefine my sexuality. 

People don’t have to redefine their entire identity just because they happened to fall in love with one person that they “shouldn’t” according to their sexuality.
Yep i used to identify as a gay man until i realised im a bi man who just HEAVILY leans towards gay, then i realised im a bi woman (but now i heavily lean towards straight i guess) if you can find both genders sexually attractive yhen youre some flavour of bisexual or pansexual, if its just a romantic thing then you coukd always be homosexual biromatic?
No it doesn’t. Who are you to dictate my sexuality to me? I don’t think finding a woman once in a blue moon attractive makes me anything at all- it’s called exceptions. As a rule, I don’t see myself with a woman.
Isn’t that trixic?
Excuse me? I wasn't speaking for anyone but myself. I guessed how I would feel, I stated it is my opinion... never once did I proclaim any form of universal truth. I get that in these circles, we are often fighting hard to defend and define our identity. 

I don't want to invalidate anyone, but also I struggle myself sometimes. To me, being able to call myself Lesbian is hugely affirming. It is a key part of who I am, and when I am told, as I often get told now, that the definition I knew of the word includes masc people who are not women, it is tough for me to process. It hits at a core of my identity, and I have to try and resist the knee jerk response to gatekeep.

I have always known lesbian to mean women loving women. I do get that enby people have preferences in gender as well, and so they cross circles, it is kind of built into an identity outside of the binary that binary identities become muddled and complex.

So I do struggle with it. I don't know how well I fit in a community, one that I will add is not always the most inviting in the first place to people like me, anymore, because what I grew up understanding, what I have been a part of for so long, is being transformed at its core. This isn't a situation of more being tacked on, or nuance shifting. This is the core nature of Lesbians being reshaped. 

I am allowed to be confused. I am allowed to voice that confusion, and I am even allowed to not like it. So please, don't tell me what is my place or not. You are stepping into a circle which I am a part of, and asking me to accept a massive culture shift. I am allowed to say something. I am allowed to voice my concerns, my confusions.

There's a lot fundimentally different between trans and cis men in terms of life experience at least. As a trans guy myself, though i can find any gender attractive, I will only ever date other trans people as I feel like they are the only people who I feel can truly understand me and my stuggles.

Ofc that doesn't mean I don't find cis people attractive since I can't ever 'tell' who is trans or not, I just choose not to date them.
Oh yeah. I was waiting for that reverse comment slap. Not genital preference, i date trans girls more than cis girls. My partner is a transfem enby like me. The answer to your question is, well i already wrote it. The journey. That is the difference, and i said i would first need to know him from before even thinking about anything romantic to feel a bond and start feeling something. Because of the journey. That is the difference. Plus, i hate that «bro manly man» shitty way of thinking cis men have been educated with, and i know something about it, believe me. Masculinism, misogyny, are not things that make me fall for someone and all the cis men in my life were made of it, while i never met any trans guy like this. What’s so different between trans guys and cis guys you ask? Trans guys are rarely violent, rapists, gaslighters. But i guess it was easier to believe i was full of transphobia myself, right ?..
Yeah imo it sounds TERFy because it *is* TERFy. Or TERTy? (Transfem exclusive radical transphobe)
Ah I’m glad <3 sending lots of love & good vibes homie!
I don't even think it's accurate to say that the definition of a lesbian is ""someone who is exclusively attracted to women."" Most homosexual people I know have had some amount of heterosexual experiences. Also, you yourself had to allow that my partner is not necessarily a lesbian, so clearly there's a lot of gray area. Maybe it's best to not just idly sit on Reddit and assume you can define what the term ""lesbian"" means to the millions and millions of lesbians that exist in the world. Which, again, is my whole point. Assuming you can define other people based on your own standards is a bigoted frame of mine, no matter who holds it.
Sure, but going to lesbian bars and community events and stuff kind of has the prerequisite that you're a lesbian. And the bottom line is, if someone feels it's who they are, are you really going to tell them to go fuck themself, and that you understand their identity better than they do?
Apologies for the wrong assumption about your intent, most people who use the word female to describe women are either incels or TERFs who are trying to exclude people based off of AGAB. 

But by insisting that only binary women can be lesbians, you are actively excluding trans non-binary people and women from being lesbians. I am sorry, but it does seem as if you are willing to engage in education and understand from a point of compassion and curiosity, so I will not be engaging with you further because you seem very young and stuck in TERF rhetoric about lesbians. 

Your one incorrect outsider opinion does not change the reality of lesbian spaces. They have always been inclusive of all women of all gender identities.
If you are born female and identify as male and female... How are you not simultaneously trans and cis?

mtf transphobic
What
No problem lol
Yes, and I think that's where the biggest issue of it all comes into play. Between the Transphobia and Bi/Pan/Omniphobia, it gets really rough for people out her sometimes, and it especially hurts when if comes from within the community. 

Having these discussions is the most important thing, and it opens up the discussion for more nich sexualities to talk and explain things as well, while also making sure people can define what could cross the line for some. Safe spaces for everyone!
I mean we are literally talking about our identities, it’s how you define yourself. You’re perfectly valid being a gay man, I don’t find myself as attracted to some people as others and I don’t think gender comes into it much so I’m pansexual. My wife feels very different attraction to men and woman so she’s bisexual.
Because sexuality isn’t something you choose mate, it’s a scientific thing. You are not exclusively homosexual, bi sexual can be 1% liking the same sex, it still bisexual. 

And to everyone downvoting, science is science, you can’t just “ choose” your sexuality
Some of us use that word, yes, but I'm not exclusively attracted to women and femininity so it's not something I identify with. 

I love folks who aren't exclusively men in a very sapphic way, and that's how I experience lesbian attraction.
As soon as someone starts throwing slurs around, I immediately stop listening to their opinion on anyone else's self-identity.
It is possible. There's a difference between sexual and romantic preferences. Someone could be a lesbian in dating women but also like having sex with men, which is homoromantic bisexual. Or the other way around with dating both and having sex with women, biromantic homosexual. So yes, it is possible.
Yeah, I get what you’re saying, I just feel like we might be on dangerous ground when we accept for example the GC assumption that trans (primarily) women don’t “count” because they have been “socialised as men” or have a different lived experience to some cisgender women. The differences in lived experience between, say, super-rich women vs women who have lived on the poverty line is probably greater than the difference between men and women in each group, so I just wonder if we are creating a division that doesn’t necessarily need to be defined? Honestly not saying I’m right, just that it makes me a bit uncomfortable.
>There's a lot fundimentally different between trans and cis men in terms of life experience at least.

That may be true for you but certainly isn't universal.
Right back at ya! ♡
No and yes, I would consider myself to have a better and more accurate understanding of the label itself and who it applies to, as well as having the right to represent my minorities collective values as a trans man myself,  and informing the indivual of the harmful impact using that label incorrectly is and how it hurts me personally. 

Again, you don't NEED to be a lesbian to go to such event and participate in those communities, especialky if you already had a tight bond in those communities I would imagine they accept you with open arms. And do in subreddits as well. I'm still in the egg_irl community even though I've fully realized my gender and the community happily accepts me.
💀
Because cis isn’t defined by identifying with your agab. It’s defined by identifying with *only* your agab as it was given to you. Bigender people are not half cis anymore than bisexual people are half straight.
1) you’re not stating “facts” just your interpretation of the matter, 2) you can state facts _and_ still be an asshole, and 3) you’re not even addressing anything I said. I specifically talked about sexual vs romantic interest. Being bisexual is *not* being gay and straight. I have a bisexual wife who has been told that and takes great offense to that. She’s not half gay and half straight, she’s 100% bisexual, ya dingus.
And trans is when your gender DOESN'T change
That definitely exists lmao, my turn.   

Non binary girl.
Exactly, thank you. I just don’t think my very rare attraction to women is a notable part of my identity at all. I can count on one hand with a couple of fingers missing the number of women I’ve met and could genuinely see myself with. Maybe there’ll be more in the future, I don’t know and I’m open to it, but I’m gay
Huh that’s…hmmmm
[removed]
I can definitely see how that could be taken to some unpleasant places. For me personally it's not about sexual attraction (in that regard i am bisexual). My very strong prefrence for trans people is more emotional, since the way things are right now, I only feel truly safe and loved around them.
I suppose so but i find that dating someone I know understands what being trans is like rather than just being accepting is a lot more desirable to me, and that sort of understaning is something i could never get from any cis person.
Okay. Duly noted. 

By your logic, lesbians are unable to be attracted to nonbinary people. Because being a lesbian means only being attracted to women. And nonbinary people are not women, that's a transphobic idea that is erasing of androgynous identities.
This is splitting hairs over a common statement people make when talking about gender and transition. Saying “I became trans” isn’t accurate but it conveys a message that is easily understood and can carry the meaning intended.
Lmao WHAT.
Straight lesbian boy
I'm a non-binary transmasc lesbian and I'm a bit nervous to comment in this whole thread, because I am also attracted to some men (cis or trans.) Men who express themselves in femme ways are wonderful to me, and non-binary men especially are attractive, regardless of presentation - I do make my lesbian identity known to any partner, because I wouldn't want any man to be invalidated by my identity. 

My lesbian identity means that I'm attracted to people who aren't binary men, but even then there's a few GNC binary men who I have been attracted to and would date.
Okay, totally get your stance of how you feel about your sexuality. In many ways I refer to myself as gay, even though I'm actually demipansexual, and honestly could just fall more under being Queer in my sexuality.

I think more of what people are trying to point out is that a lot of people will have similar opinions and use this in a harmful way towards those who are Bi/Pan/Omni. 

A lot of people tend to forget that you don't have to have a strictly 50/50 attraction to binary men and women. You can be 99.99% attracted to one gender, and have a 0.01% attraction to another, and you can still be Bi/Pan/Omni. 

Because of this, I think this is why people are bringing this up, because there are a lot of individuals who have felt pressured to be strictly Straight or strictly Gay. There is a surprisingly amount of Bi, Pan, and Omniphobia, even in the Queer community itself. 

Your choice in label is something that is completely valid, but I also think it is an important thing to discuss with your partner(s), in order to determine what is right for you and your partner, especially when it comes to those who are trans and may have issues with it. That way you're all on the same page! Communicate is key to any relationship after all~!
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have to help educate with compassion! My DMs are open if you're worried about asking something that could be considered uninformed or ignorant. 

I also highly recommend you check out r/butchlesbians and r/nonbinarylesbians to hear more about transmasc, non-binary, and cis GNC lesbian experiences!
The irony of you calling some of us 'dick cutters' and throwing around slurs while posting ""Be kind to others""  https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tg8lrx/what_should_i_say_when_i_dont_believe_in_my/i10f1xz
I asked for an open and civil discussion, not for a bunch of kids to start throwing around insults just cause they don't agree with someone :/
As a ""r....."", I can assure you this is not ""r.....ed"" because most of us don't think that.

I mean, I'd have to poll the group but people with my flavor of ""r.....ation"" tend to take things very literally so lesbian means lesbian. To suggest otherwise implies lesbians can be ""converted"" by the right guy. Which is shitty.

Edit: reddit does not like asterisks.
Yes, fair enough. I don’t have a well formed view on this tbh and as you say, it’s how unpleasant people would interpret it that perhaps raised a flag for me. I can just imagine a GC picking up this thread and saying “see! Even trans people don’t think they are the same” which I know is not what you’re saying. But then GCs will twist everything so perhaps that’s not the greatest benchmark!
I love the way you think
I think there's a huge difference between being T4T and being someone who'll date anyone but a cis man. 

T4T person is interested in me and wouldn't date a cis man? Very cool, shared experiences and all that. 

Someone who'd date cis women but not cis men is interested in me? That feels icky.
No, that is not what it means. I also find it odd that you’ve claimed every person you’ve argued with in this thread is transphobic at one point or another.
Aroace het
I’m not going to pretend I understand exactly how being a transmasc lesbian works but equally I’m not going to tell you you’re wrong like some other arseholes here have done to me. It’s disgusting that other queer people (especially fellow trans people) can come in and start telling people who they are. Next they’ll be telling me I’m not really a man unless I have phalloplasty!
Hey you’re valid as hell. My personal hang ups on a word are NOT YOUR FAULT and you have every right to be yourself without fear
Well, maybe a better label you can use for general public is Queer! Since you are queer, no matter how you roll it c: 

Your choice in the more specific of labels are yours to have and know, and no one else has to know what those labels are other than those who you want to know (like say your partner!) That is an important discussion to have, and anyone else doesn't matter than.
Of course it doesn’t have to be 50/50, but I don’t identify with that because I don’t see myself ending up with anyone other than a man.

It’s not that people are bringing it up- they’re telling me what I am and that’s not on. They’re not suggesting, they’re dictating, as if I haven’t spent many years mulling it over myself. It’s ignorant, it’s disrespectful, and I don’t tolerate it.

I’ve tried various labels and up to now have identified as bi for longer than I have as gay. As I understood my gender better, I understood my sexuality better too. Once upon a time I thought I was a lesbian!

Being trans, I am very much sick to the back teeth of people telling me what I am and am not. Very hurtful and disappointing when it comes from members of your own community- you don’t expect it here.

Your identity is yours- not your partners. Hopefully you have a relationship where your partner doesn’t feel that your identity invalidates theirs and viceversa. If not, there’s some work to do. I’ve been with straight guys who totally didn’t see me as a guy- I understand what it feels like. You just have to make sure you have a partner that you trust respects your identity- that’s all that matters in the end
I haven't called anyone transphobic in this thread. You are talking out your ass. 

I didn't even say you were transphobic. You got mad and assumed that yourself.

I said a lesbian who was attracted to nonbinary people would hypothetically be transphobic because nonbinary people aren't women.
The easiest way a lot of folks understand it is to look more into butch culture. There's a lot of transmasc butches alongside cis butches, and that can extend to other gender presentations as well. Generally, I consider myself to be bigender, so I'm both a man and a woman and I love in a queer way so I prefer to keep the lesbian label because it's the most accurate descriptor of how I love. 

Thank you, labels are very personal and I've had to fight to keep this lesbian one in a way that others deem valid. But honestly, I just know it's right for me, so sometimes I can forget about what other folks think and be happy and certain with my identity. It took a lot to get here, lol. You know how that is.
Some of us don't like to use the label queer. It makes me deeply uncomfortable because it was used a slur for me in my youth.
Some of us don't like to use the label queer. It makes me deeply uncomfortable because it was used a slur for me in my youth.
I appreciate your sentiment, but I am a lesbian. Im also queer, but I love in a sapphic way. I also make sure to let any potential partner know that, so if being with a lesbian would make them feel invalidated (which makes sense for some folks) they can know that we're not compatible and make that choice.
I can understand this, as a trans man myself. Again, I think people are saying that it sounds like being bi/pan/omni to them, and that they are confused by it. 

It is annoying, very much so, that it they are telling you what your label should be: your Anger is valid. I would like to hope that they are not trying to be malicious about it though. Just concerned because of the issues of TERFS being within the LBGTQ+ Community (I'm certain you have dealt with the issue of the LGB Drop the T group). 

I think that's just where people are worried. They most certainly could and should have said it in a nicer way, or in a more open minded way, instead of dictating your sexuality for you. Just remember people likely don't know how much time you've had to think about things, and that they may be trying to be helpful for those who are closeted (even if what they say really doesn't help and just ends up being annoying).

And Yes, your identity is yours: but that also means your partner's identity is there. I think we both understand that, and understand the importance of discussing that prior to starting a relationship. 

For me, I personally can't date someone who insists on identify as straight or lesbian, even though they're dating me: because I've done that, and it ended up being very distressing, especially since the person I was dating kept trying to challenge my trans identity. I just don't want to deal with that grief and trauma, and honestly, it makes me hesitant to even date anyone who is cisgender because of that trauma. 

And you are completely right about having a partner who you can trust. Hence why is it so important to discuss with a person prior hand, and why it is okay to not continue a relationship if those ideas clash with one another. Not every relationship is going to work out. It just is also important to make an effort to talk about these things and work through them, especially in the case where someone comes out as trans during the middle of an already pre-established relationship.  Compromising where one can, and accepting when a compromise can't be made, and also accepting no one is the villian for being honest and true to themself: these are all things that are signs of a healthy and mature relationship.
You called other people’s ideas transphobic. Same difference. Also non-binary people can definitely be women.

And it is you, sir, who are mad. HOOOHAAH 🤺
Fair, it was just an idea though. For some it can be empowering to take back words that were once used in a negative fashion, or to take back current slurs. It's definitely not for everyone.
Not a problem! I just know you mentioned you were worried about it, and thought maybe just using queer in a public space would make you feel more comfortable and safe c: 

If Lesbian is what you are comfortable with, then that's what you're xomfortable with, and it is really good you talk to your partners about it before getting into things! Communication is Key, and if your partner doesn't care, then they don't care, and it doesn't matter. 

Just is a tricky of a topic, since it, well....has it's issues, and in the end, there probably isn't a good answer for a general answer. Especially with the issues that people face with discrimination both outside and inside the community.
> I think people are saying that it sounds like being bi/pan/omni to them, and that they are confused by it.

No, they're not- They're telling me that's what I am: 

""That…that means you are bi or pan or Omni…""

""You're bi my dude ;)""

>They most certainly could and should have said it in a nicer way

Said what? That they think they know who I am better than I do? 

>but that also means your partner's identity is there.

Of course, and it would be highly unreasonable for me to expect them to change how they identify on my account. If I were to have a partner say they're only attracted to women but I'm an exception and I trust they do see me as a man, I'm not going to expect them to suddenly identify as bi. It's only a problem when it feels like they don't see me as a man.

There is no compromising when it comes to identities so if your partner's identity makes you uncomfortable, then they're simply not the one for you. 

>especially in the case where someone comes out as trans during the middle of an already pre-established relationship.

This really is a difficult situation and I cannot imagine what it must be like for either party. In theory, nothing should change as the people are both still fundamentally themselves, but in practice it very much can change things.
They can be, they aren't inherently. My point still stands that it would be transphobic for lesbians to be attracted to nonbinary people, because nonbinary people are not inherently women. 

And no, I didn't. If I did please show me. 

I told one person they were inching into TERF rhetoric, and I also specified I didn't think they were transphobic. Just that terfs would use that opinion of 'lesbians only like women' to boost their own transphobia.
Okay, addressing the last bit because that's the only part I feel I can confidently express myself on it without getting aggravated myself. I don't want to make anyone angry, I'm just trying to make this a place where things can be explained non-aggressively and have some optimism over the shittiness of people. 

In practice, it very much changes things, and I have seen time and time and time again individuals who have come out to their partner, and their partner then deciding that it isn't a relationship they want to be in. I also see a lot of other trans folx who get very hurt and blame their partner for their attraction disappearing and their choice to leave that relationship. It sucks, but you can't change how people feel, and no one is to blame in those situations. I have also seen the reverse, where people have stayed with their partner, who still identifies as straight or lesbian or gay, which is then paired with the questioning and challenging of the trans folx's tranness. 

When it comes down to things, you have three options: potentially come to terms that the label you were once using might not encompass all that you thought yourself to be; decide that the labels don't matter and that all party members involved are unaffected by the labels; or choose to end the relationship because of a lack in compatibility. That's what I mean by ""Compromise"". 

Not only that, but the sad reality of things is that there are far too many people who fetishize things like being trans and take advantage of people and do some serious ass emotional harm. It is because of this fact and my own personal experience with things that I have found that I just can't hold the same sentiments as you, friend. I'm glad it works out for you, and again, I'm sorry that people have been shitty about how they spoke to you about your sexuality, but it most certainly has not worked out for me, and several others as well. It's why we are very, very cautious about such things, and why it is important for a majority of us to be cautious."	tg8jvq	trans	1016	0.95	2022-03-17 11:59:30
The issue with transphobia all ove reddit	"TW:Transphobia, plotted murder, slurs, trans suicide

I hate the fact rhat literally everywhere on reddit that isnt an lgbtq+ space itd so toxic against trans and gay people, there was a post about a load of adults plotting to kill q trans kid and someones reply to a validly concerned person was ""why are people so sensitive lately get a grip lol"" and i just feel disgusted. On a smaller scale, this morning i got a comment on some deltarune pride art I'd made basically saying ""so this game is all about sexuality now?"" And the characters i drew were all queer with just one of their identities uncomfirmed and its just mind-boggling how they describe how they are homophobic and transphobic and then say they dont want to be accused of being such just cause they dont agree with the 'lgbtq+ ideology' and i just feel horrendous."	"Yeah, it's pretty rough out there. If you want to share art/fandom stuff, then tumblr might be good. (OK, that's a queer space too, something like 60% of users). They're nice over there though
I posted a picture of Hunter Schafer and the first comment I got was ""That's a man"". I fucking hate people.
Every time when people mention a gay ship people down vote it and are like ""I don't like this ship"" or ""not my cup of tea"" and all that shit.
But they would never say shit like this with straight ships. It's so annoying.

Last time I called somebody out as homophobe and they legit told ""my cousin is gay i cant be homophobic""

Every time when I think twitter is bad, reddit wins. 

Somebody said it already but tumblr really is the best platform for this
and they invade our spaces too. i made a post on r/pronounsdressingroom and the second comment i got was someone saying “you people need some serious help.” i just told them “go home.” i’m so fucking tired
That plotted murder thing is so awful. I refused to read any comments
I’ve just come to expect people to be shitty, and act cautious accordingly.
I get the feeling that society in general has become more tolerant, but the phobic people have become a lot more hateful and nasty.
Lmfao people who are so sensitive about THE BIG BAD LGBT in deltarune is hilarious. Toby Fox literally corrected someone referring Kris as “He”. His canonically Non-Binary. 

Plus almost all of gaming is homophobic sadly. After all a gamer’s favorite mantra is “you wouldn’t survive in a MW2 lobby” wow bro, slurs and yelling, I face that in TF2 and CSGO every single day. If the only insult you can come up with are low blow personal insults, you have no right to say that phrase.
I lot of communities on Reddit are hostile to trans people, game related subreddits seem to be worse. But if it helps at all, it's certainly not the case that all non-lgbt-focused subreddits are hostile. 

In my experience a lot of hobby subreddits are pretty accepting or at least neutral. I've seen trans or queer related content in /r/unixporn, /r/conlangs, /r/vexillology, /r/baduk, /r/mechanicalkeyboards, and probably other subs as well. Typically people are generally accepting and kind, with a few bad comments that get plenty of downvotes.
This shit literally makes me depressed.
Yeah ive found that people on this platform are quite hostile towards trans people outside of spaces like these. Ive found so many hate comments against us. Reddit does nothing to stop the blatant transphobia and homophobia on this site.
they literally posted a plan for murder and nobody batted an eye? that’s fucked up.
especially r/cringetopia, that place is a shithole.
It's in some lgbt spaces too.  


TERFs regularly troll the posts in my country's subreddit. Tried bringing it up with the cis shit exclu mod but he just said ""It's not against the rules"".
Toby literally has gay characters and confirmed Kris uses they/them only (not cuz they are meant to be us- he corrected someone on Kris's pronouns before)
Reddit is nothing but transphobia.
WTF???!! a plot to kill a trans kid????!!
I'm sorry to see and hear this in many places. I do know that most pagan communities are very trans inclusive as well, and some more niche communities out there I'm sure are inclusive. But in general, yes I've seen a lot of communities are ignorant on the subject at best.
Reddit is a cesspool.
we need to become militant with the report button. bother mods incessantly (i know its a shot in the dark, you don’t need to tell me)
Bigots always have an excuse loaded why they are the victim in their choice to act openly bigoted toward marginalized peoples. In fact, to the point, it's how you identify them.

Anyone who *just* says something ignorant is likely just ignorant and not a bigot. Anyone who claps back with how actually you having an opinion about their opinion is the real bigotry. Not the discriminatory laws, not the suicide campaigns, not the beatings in the streets, not the sexual assault while yelling slurs. 

That's how you know you have a bigot and not just someone who's clueless. They are openly declaring that someone potentially murdering you is less of a problem to society than you being allowed to have an opinion about their opinion.
deltarune fans are accepting of lgbtq identities in my experience but there's always ""that guy""
To reduce a bit the negativity feel out there, remember they are a vocal minority.
When exploring nice there will be many indifferent of even sororities printed since you, loudly transphobic people barely exist and know not to give their opinion in public places like work and such ✨❤️
My TKD/Judo grandmaster used to say 'empty can rattle.'  Meaning that people with nothing intelligent or constructive to say can't seem to shut the fuck up.

I usually bark back at these folks not because it's a constructive argument but to give them the impression that starting this shit in meatspace may not go the way they hope for it to, and that at least some of us *won't* curl up into a ball and start crying but in fact may get super-duper extra with them.  I have cleansed my profile of any pictoral references to me specifically so they won't know which of us to avoid starting shit with.

I hate that the online space I've spent 30 years in, and helping cultivate access to as an IT technician and programmer, has turned into a cesspool of stupid assholes but all I can do is make the assholes uncomfortable while I'm here.
got banned from a subreddit for reporting transphobic comments to a mod. I wasn't even aggressive about it. just said 'hey as a trans guy these comments are pretty offensive because everyone's saying this trans guy is a woman because he gave birth'.
Well, there was just a few swipes upwards the question ""What is a adult problem no one prepared you for?"" (Ore so) under the r/AskReddit sub with a comment that which told something like ""that even most adults have the mind of a teen which makes it hard to argue with fact's""
Yeah it's pretty awful how many bigots there are on here, not surprised but it sucks, also I can't believe they were plotting to kill a trans Kid. That's horrible
agreed! a subreddit I used to enjoy, r/tumblrinaction has become so transphobic, like that's all they do now, and I'm genuinely confused what happened
I haven't found any transphobia or other discrimination in r/musicals, but musicals aren't for everyone and that's cool too, I on the other hand am obsessed
Yeah. I know i (a queer trans guy ) used to call myself gay and went on one gay subreddit with just a bunch of memes for gay men and made one comment on a shit post meme about it being inclusive to all men and got called homophobic by a cis gay men for being ""a woman calling herself gay to trick gay men into being straight"" . Was told to kill myself and he stalked my account and sent violent threats when i tried turning to trans spaces for emotional support until i deleted the account that i had been using for over a year. 

When the queer spaces arent even safe for queer people you know there is a problem. I literally changed my sexuality label to try to keep cis gay men from getting upset . i have enough shit going on. I dont need to be called homophobic for just existing.
I corrected a celebrities pronouns on reddit, and people downvoted me for it lol.
r/mademesmile, mademecry, and wholesome are good ones. I haven’t ever experienced any lgbtqphobic stuff on those subreddits.
Oddly enough one sub that I have found non transphobic that isnt a trans sub is r/SquaredCircle it is a wrestling sub that is pretty supportive of trans peolple.
The only non lgbt subreddit I’ve seen that’s mostly trans positive is r/196 but they often have a lot of femboy content to
I don't think I've come across any transphobia--maybe one time ever on reddit and I spend like an hour a day here.

Does anyone know how the algorithms work and why some people see so much trans hate and I've only seen the trans positive?
I'm all for murder

But why discriminate?

People make jokes about Tumblr “being a hellhole” but it’s really not that bad
tumblr was shown to be the queerest place on the internet, and you can basically bite back as hard as you want there as well
Checked their account, it seems like theyre a creep who’s obsessed with celebrity womens breasts. Theyre whole account is about celebrity boobs. Or “bags” as they call them. Definitely not worth the argument, seems like a gross perv misogynist who will never change. I hate how they get into every space its so tiring
Christ thats not great
At this level these people are just deranged psychopaths
That logic cracks me up everytime.

You can be gay and homophobic. Trans and transphobic. Black and racist. Just because you have someone related to you that identifies as a certain identity, Does not mean you can’t be biased towards hat identity
Yeah that really sucks, i didnt so much get this on my post though luckily, it was mostly people debating over whether susie is lesbian bi or ace cause i headcanoned them as lesbian in my art and eugh
There are plenty of ships that aren't my cup of tea but I'll still read them if they are written well
Yeah theres even a comment on this post from some conservative so thats fun
Every time I go to r/neopronouns, I get comments from raiders telling me to get a life and that i’m pathetic.
Out of the topic but I love your pfp lol
Yeah it was just, terrifying
Thats fair enough
That makes alot of sense really
I know right? Its just so annoying how they cant see how ridiculous they sound
I know it probably doesn't mean anything to you, but I would like to say that the Fire Emblem community is very accepting of LGBTQ+ fans, ships, and everything else. You'll find some rotten eggs like you would anywhere else, but I've found it be a very welcoming community

Edit: I would like to specify that the primary place I go to on Reddit is r/feheroes which is the sub for the mobile game, but most of the fan artists end up there anyhow
I love the ""you'd never survive in a \[INSERT FPS NAME HERE\] lobby"" meme because it speaks to how incredibly, ridiculously cushy the speaker's life is.  That's the most hardcore thing you can think of, a bunch of teenagers swearing into their headsets?  Pathetic.
Just wanna add r/ProgrammerHumor is relatively accepting as well as some of the dungeons and dragons subreddits.
what is it with transfems and linux/conlanging?
r/SubredditDrama is also pretty accepting, assuming you like dishing over petty reddit drama.
Same,,
Yeah its so just sad people should be able to be themselves
I’m literally gonna be the modern female version of Martin Luther King. Before I die I WILL change this world and how society perceives and treats us. Mark my words. I refuse to settle for that crap.
Sometimes I see posts from cringetopia from browsing popular, and it is always a cesspool. Every single time
Fun fact: it was started by some of the mods of /r/CringeAnarchy...which was banned for, among other things, transphobia and homophobia. It's no surprise that it's that way.
That sucks, its so ridiculous how people are, im sorry
I know right? And even if it wasn't confirmed i still have a right to headcanon characters? This guy just got so pissed that only when my cis friend (super supportive and nice btw) joined he finally left.
Yeah it was dreadful honestly
Yeah i used to be pagan and the religion is super accepting, im currently atheist but my mum is pagan
Yeah i love the deltarune and undertale community to bits honestly, they're such lovely well made games, i feel like most of the community is super accepting and even lgbtq themselves but like you said, there is always thay one small group in the corner who gets mad over the smallest thing lgbt in the fandom
that sub loves shitting on disabled/neurodivergent and trans people more than they hate tumblr culture as a whole
> has become so transphobic

It's been transphobic for years and years and years. One of few big subs I would completely consider to be a trans hate sub. It was almost exclusively full of non-binary hate years ago - that's the content that grew the sub to begin with.
I love musicals! Its good to know that thats a saferplace
Im so sorry that is absolutely dreadful, i hope things are going better now
Thats good!
Oh thatd nice!
And chasers
I've only been actually active for 2 days and I've seen it non-stop
Don't be for murder
You had me .. until the end. Of course you wanna “have fun” with a Trans-Woman… but if that’s ALL you want and don’t ever plan on considering bonding to that person BCUZ of their identity.. give up. All I can say is dare to be different. We have enough chasers already.
uhhhh, ok?
Honestly, you sound just like other chasers I've turned down. You'll have better luck if you treat the transwomen and non-binary transfemme as people, and not as an experience for you to check off
Thanks for generalizing us. In our own sub. In our safe place. We appreciate that you're telling us how it really is. What we’re really thinking. You're the hero we needed today. Also, we’re glad that you find our thoughts so interesting!  
  
I'm a mod for r/Trans and a couple of other subs. The amount of shit that we stop from reaching the public is mind-boggling. We're not talking about feeling slighted because of an off-color joke, or even Dave Chappell punching down. We're talking about hate in the vilest forms and the strongest language, all delivered with the expectation that it will do serious and irreparable harm to this community.  
  
Or, it will be sexual. Posts and comments reducing us to our parts. Fetishizing and sexualizing us, othering us, using us. It's sad, degrading and maddening. I know, I know; everyone gets dick picks or whatever. No, it's not just that. It's focusing on some of the very things that make us physically different, that we have privately fought for and against our entire lives.  
  
I can't get into details, though I'm sure you'd find it interesting, as it would violate our Rule 7 (No sharing hate speech), but the struggle is actually, literally real. It's not theoretical. It's not hyperbole. It's not snowflakes melting. It's systemic, it's personal, and it's extremely specific. It's a weight on our shoulders and a target on our backs for the crime of simply existing. For wanting to be able to take a shit someplace/anyplace, for having long or short hair, for smiling at the wrong person, for wanting to go on a date and to not die alone.  
  
This is only my opinion; I'm not speaking for the other mods.
I wouldn't say it's about taking a joke. Most cis people's jokes about trans people are very much rooted in transphobia. It's about people's ""jokes"" not being discriminatory. You have no idea how hard it is for us. I know a few trans people who do, in fact, joke about trans people themselves, but the thing is, *they've actually got good intentions*. I do appreciate you wanting to learn more, though. Maybe watch your words next time?

(And please, anyone else reading this, keep it civil.)
> the idea that jokes about trans people promotes violence is incredibly off the mark to me

Where’s the humor in a joke about wanting to kill trans people? Am I supposed to laugh at it?

> Straight people are not out hunting trans or gay people, at least not where I'm from. All the straight people I know honestly don't care what you do with your life, just as long as you leave them alone.

People who frame this in terms of “not caring what you do with your life” don’t recognize trans people for what they are, or they wouldn’t be framing it that way. Where I live they are out to get gay and trans people and many of my friends have learned that firsthand. And relearned it. And relearned it.

> The internet is a tough place regardless of who you are. Every walk of life gets the most horrific shit thrown their way […] but its not inclusive to any particular groups of people.

Which is why there are support groups and suicide hotlines for cisstraight people too.

> You think that you are becoming the person you were born to be, and everybody else thinks its crazy to start chopping off body parts to do that. Especially when it comes to chopping of your own penis. That is just something most straight people, including myself, will never fully rationalize. 

And we’re supposed to tolerate it when they spread this idea and claim they know better?

> It's the one thing that really bothers me about the trans community, you don't allow anybody to have their own thoughts about the matter without thinking they are a nazi who deserves death. 

Their own “thoughts” on whether we exist or not, something we literally have direct experience of and medical evidence for, is not a debate. Framing it as some subjective everybody-has-their-own-opinion matter is ridiculous as is suggesting *we’re* somehow intolerant of *them* for not having it.

> you guy's would be a lot more accepted into society if you lightened up and just started joking around with the rest of us.

Bullshit. As if that’s ever worked for any group of people. You just want license to joke about us under the guise of harmless fun.
Oh we'd all just be accepted if we'd all just join in on the jokes about murdering and abusing us. Ya know, the things that CisHets make so many of us fear happening on a daily fucking basis
The thing about murdering a trans kid was serious, and us being trans isn't your science project dude! We're real people with real lives, and of course im not gonna let someone tell me im a woman? That doesnt make them a nazi or that i think they should die? Thats me simply saying how its wrong of them to be discriminatory. And nobodys cutting off their dick that'd lead to a shit ton of medical issues. Please leave the trans subreddit because lets be real here theres like 1 trans person that'll appreciate what you have to say.
Grow up and get off the Internet
If you're against two people being in love because they're both the same gender or someone being a woman because they were born biologically male, you don't cone from reason, you come from hate
MMMMM PRAISE OUR SAVIORS PUKICHO AND GAUD
No worries bud
Hellhole (affectionate)
Now that’s just ableist to psychopaths. Psychopaths aren’t inherently evil— these “people”, these transphobes, are evil af.
Ppl that think transphobic trans ppl don’t exist need look no further then r/transmedical it’s a dumpster fire
Right? This is ridiculous. They really think it's a excuse for being rude.
Yeah I get that. Especially all the debates under a great artwork is annoying. Like, just enjoy the art with the headcanon, people!
I'll never understand why people lose their shit about neopronouns. I've got like four trans friends (I'm also trans) and they all unanimously agree with each other that ""Neopronouns are a joke and people who use them are mentally ill"".

Idk maybe I just am too tolerant or something but isn't it a matter of respect? Like if someone says politely ""hey I go by x/y, can you use that from now on"" how is that not a matter of respect? 

Like it's two words, why are we drawing the line here? Why are we being tricked into hating each other when the actual enemies are standing right in front of us? Why can't we have decency and respect for our fellow humans?

I get why people don't, but it's still so fucked up.
You'll always be valid no matter what pronouns you use, it can be hard but you're stronger and you can get by that, they're the miserable ones spending all their spare time saying things that'll never make you change in reality.
Oh that's great! I'm a fire emblem fan but I didn't know

That actually makes me very happy considering the rocky road that FE has with lgbt options
Yeah, I know not all communities are shitty. I’m on r/SSBM and any case of people being queerphobic or bigoted in general are downvoted and laughed at. The only case you’d see shitty Melee and Project + players are on twitter and it’s usually the meme tier Spaces players
Oh thats nice!
Even then all they can think of are white nerds saying the N word and homophobic slurs. Have you seen black folk roast people in Black ops 2? They’ll rip INTO YOU and the only slur they’d say is their reclaimed n word (I think that’s the PC way of referring to it right?)
I experienced like almost all FPS players are toxic. The games are somewhat intrinsicly toxic, so their players.
And somehow some games like CoD are especionally prone to this lol
The DnD ones have been getting slammed in with transphobes too, and it sucks, they just play more coy there.
Tbh I have no idea, lol. What I like about those things has nothing to do with transness inherently, although I do let my trans experience inform my conlanging (not a fan of gender-based pronouns, I like to do a generic personal pronoun or do pronouns based on level of respect or other things).

I've been using linux since 2009, a decade before I came out to myself. I like it because it's open and I can customize it and learn what it's doing under the hood. Plus microsoft is just creepy.

And I've always liked languages and grammar, and the theory of grammar. Conlanging is a great way to explore the underlying systems that human communication emerges from.

Neither of these things has anything to do with being a trans girl, but there do seem to be a lot of us in those spaces for some reason.
You go girl. The world might be shitty today but everyone has a voice and I love that you're planning to use yours in such a great way
I just got banned from there for saying “trans women exist” and “this subreddit has a transphobia problem”
Yeah like how can the homophobes be fans of the series if literally everyone important is gay except the goats and the skeleton
If anything I’ve seen a couple of very progressive post and cute couples being themselves 🥰
Dang!!!!  That's a huge bummer!!  I'm so sorry you've seen so much negativity about it! Any ideas on why some people will see so much and others don't see any of it?
[removed]
I said the same thing when I read it 😂😂😂
\^yep. I’m not averse to edgy jokes about trans people - I make them constantly - but unlike most cis people the jokes I make reflect an actual understanding of trans people and not r/onejoke shit.
I feel like its ok to make trans jokes if you have a trans friend who says its cool and you make sure the trans people you're around are comfortable with the jokes or if you are trans yourself
[removed]
Could you explain why?  


I don't mean to strike a nerve or anything; I get It's a touchy subject.
lmao
That and r/truscum 

(They're definitely aphobic too, given that I saw a poll on their subreddit claiming that asexual people don't deserve to be part of the LGBTQ+ community, when they absolutely should)
Confused on what your trying to say here, snd the community you tagged is coming up as doesn’t exist
Oh yeah transmed is dreadful
Should not have clicked that. Definitely shouldn't have clicked that. 

I'm absolutely sick of people like that, as a non-binary person who's tried for the last 3-4 years to be a ""normal"" trans person. I hated myself for so long just because I knew I wasn't a woman, but I couldn't be myself as a man no matter how much I tried. I mean seriously, I've had people try to argue I'm not trans just because I don't have voice dysphoria. Transphobic idiots are still transphobic idiots, even if they're also trans.
It all just feels really demotivating and i have to try and reply nicely cause i dont want to be a dick but i struggle with emotions and i end up feeling real messy over it nd yeah
I'm not trans, nor do I use neopronouns, but I think a lot of people are disillusioned by the more out-there neopronouns and feel like it delegitimizes their own struggle for rights. They feel that their use of ""conventional"" alternative pronouns would be more widely accepted if there weren't people out there in their same community actively feeding the transphobes more ammo for their ""made-up words/attack helicopter"" strawman argument. It's not my place to really comment on the validity or lack thereof, but I sort of see where people on both sides are coming from.
Those people are playing the optics game. As a queer person, you NEVER want to play the optics game. There's absolutely no reason, Conservatives will never take the more progressive side until ALL of their stupid, made-up talking points have been dead for a couple years and some of them never will.

They're just making a bad assessment in how valuable optics are. That's why TERFs have been claiming lately that it's a slur, because they care about their optics.
I used to be horrible to a friend of mine who used xenopronouns (i think thats what its called?) And I've always felt terrible since, but luckily I've been shown why its valid and we're still friends, im glad i changed before i ruined one of my best friendships
Thank you.
Most of the time, we just end up complaining about how half-assed the developers are with those same options. They've definitely come a long way though!
Thats so nice ill definitely join thoee subreddits!
Yeah it sucks alot, but i feel there are certain subreddits where alot of mods or lgbtq+ and that matters alot, but even then I've had a few pretty bad comments under this post, so im not exactly sure
LOL you surely had enough energy to express your sexual interest in us tho. I’m not surprised. In my head you no different than the millions of other men out there.
[deleted]
Theres is little to no reason to hate lgbtq+ people, we're just people and just want to be us without being cut up to identity politics. There's plenty of science backing us up, we just want to be people like anyone else, except some woman like woman, some guys like guys, some guys aren't guys, some woman aren't woman.
Ide like to believe it’s just a bunch of edgy teens and some mentally ill adults who don’t realize what they’re doing is genuinely wrong but idk it’s prolly a bit too hopeful
Had to edit it because transmedicalists and transmedicalist didn’t work
/r/Truscum is the sub y'all are looking for
It’s even worse than truescum imo cause atleast the ppl there have an idea that they’re assholes cause they’ve been shunned by the general community which is a pretty challenging feat
We’ve had the exact same experience! Like I can say hands down that I’m not a woman. I know that for absolute sure. Being a man isn’t exactly my cup of tea either though… I tried for a while, fully socially transitioned with some people I trusted, but eventually just had to admit that I was neither man nor woman. Just me.
That is very much an accurate take. I'll admit I have felt disappointment in neopronouns at times in the past and it did take me a bit to fully grasp the complexity and reasoning around Neopronouns, and I can certainly see why it would feel like it is delegitimizing the LGBTQ+ movement.

A lot of it does stem from the strawman that every Neopronoun user is some rage obsessed child changing their gender as often as they blink, and how that strawman reflects on the community as a whole. It's unfortunate, but I've come to the personal conclusion I would rather be supportive of than ignorant, especially when the overall concept between two is the same, whereas I am the less extreme example.
This is one of things we can learn from ethnic minorities: respectability politics never works.  It doesn't matter how you ""tone things down"" or how ""reasonable"" you try to appear, it'll always be seen as unreasonable and an affront to ""decency.""  You win by not playing the game.

I agree, there is little reason to hate your community; though, I do understand why I am considered hateful.

To be completely honest with you, I don’t believe in transgenderism; I also believe in traditional marriage.

But I sympathise with you because I get how tough it feels to have your own identity debated; because for you, it’s not just an opinion—it’s your life too.

You do you; don’t listen to people like me if it makes you truly happy.
Thanks. And Jesus that thread. My mind is blown, like doctor strange when the ancient one showed him the mystic world
Is this a good or bad sub
Oh yeah i hate truscum mainly cause i mean who cares if someones gonna use star pronouns, gender literally barely makes sense its hanging on by one mental thread and we have such small understanding of it, so people can identify however the hell they want, its not hurting anyone and its making them happier so yeah
Exactly! I remember when I first started socially transitioning, I had an incident in PE that was just caused a lightbulb go off in my head. I had just recently cut my hair to shoulder length and tried to lower my voice range, so someone I didn't know very well in that class, who's actually now my friend, assumed I was a boy, and actually brought it up in a different class later on. I guess that was the first time someone had actually unironically thought I was a boy, and it made me so *uncomfortable* I can't even explain it. It just really confused me, because I've always been fine with he/him pronouns for the most part, I just don't want to be a man. 

I guess it's exactly how you said it: I don't want to be a man or a woman, I just want to be me.
Your insults aren't even insults they're juat fractured sentences that have been put together by a child
Get out of trans safe spaces and touch some grass!
While you're one of the calmest people ive talked to and i respect that, its not transgenderism or anything, we aren't some kind of ideology or religion, we're just transgender.
Yea I don’t get how people so negatively impacted by the hate that follows them everywhere would dedicate a group to nothing but hating on subreddits and people who’s general gist is just “play nice, we deal with enough already”

It doesn’t make sense. I’ve never understand how an oppressed group can oppress someone else, or a part of themselves.
I am literally gay and a minor
Your dads under grass in a grave you sound like a drunken child
Hate has no need for logic, just a strong sense of emotion a tad bit of confusion and a complete unwavering unwillingness to consider other points of view
Survival instinct. Individuals seek the protection of groups, and sometimes that means trying to appeal to the people who hate you by throwing your comrades under the bus to show the bigots that you're ""one of the good ones"".

It never works, because hate isn't based on rationality, but that doesn't keep people from trying.

I have autism"	s5h9mk	trans	998	0.98	2022-01-16 17:53:29
i (22mtf) got de-homed by my ex (21f) for being trans	 i was with my ex for 4 years, lived with her for a year and a half, she moved in because her parents were mentally abusive to her so i didn’t charge rent for the first few months to give her time to settle in. she knew when she moved in that i was definitely not cis and was experimenting with my gender and was leaning toward trans and i was very communicative of this every step of the way and she told me at every step she loved me and supported me and would still have me no matter what, which made me feel secure in what we had. during 2021 i took time off work after saving up money to cover my half of rent for a while because my previous job had become the source of a lot of my (at the time poorly managed) anxiety, and when i took time off work we agreed i would take over the chores at home while she continued to work. my savings ran a little closer to comfort than i would’ve liked, but i found a job around the time i ran dry on funds, so that meant i would need a month for her to cover rent and i’d pay her back like we agreed. i also came out to my mom around the same time, and shortly after my ex said we should part ways since she doesn’t want to be with a girl (it’s great she validated my identity but wtf) after telling me for so long she’d love me no matter what, and since i couldn’t pay rent for 1 month i needed to leave. our relationship had definitely run dry toward the end but we respected each other up til the very end and i spent as much time as i could making sure she had a relaxing home to come back to and it seemed like nothing i could do could please her anymore. i get people change (trust me i’m changing a lot) but how could someone be so cruel? i gave her a home to move into when her parents house felt like a warzone, and this is what i get? i’m not mad at her, just upset that i feel led on for so long. idk just venting here. i’ve met someone knew but not having companionship during this tender point in my life sucks. has anyone else gone through this?	"...is your name on the rent contract? Kick her out. She can't do it to you. Kick her the fuck out.
Well my ex isn’t quite as much of a sociopath as yours but she totally kicked me out, forgetting the years i had paid for her rent and the 50k I sunk (directly and indirectly) into her Etsy business. Good luck.
I suspect there is someone else in the picture that you’re not aware of. I wouldn’t be too surprised if a dude moves in with her before too long.
Ughhh I’m so sorry your going through this. it’s seriously tough i have been in a very similar situation. around 5-6 years ago are situation was a little different from yours being I moved in with her and not her moving in with me but everything else same situation we switched who worked I worked then I stayed home and did chores while she went to work and I came out to her she was so supportive and loving but also said I can’t be with a girl what happened with us tho I ended up walking in on her having a threesome and that was the last straw for me it was coming tho are relationship like you said it went very dry she in the end was extreamly heartless to me took a lot of my childhood belongings scrapbooks things like that I made when I was a kid. I can tell you tho you don’t want any part of that it’s so stressful especially in the middle of a transition and honestly you just don’t deserve that trust me it gets much more toxic. I have personally just tryed to accept being alone for now until I reach were I want to be so I have full focus on doing the best for me! And oh god it’s been the best decision I feel like iv made so much progress after doing that. It may look bad atm and you may be going through it right now but pick yourself up do everything you can to get another job and get you another place to live and focus on yourself for awhile I promise things will get better just don’t loose hope in yourself!! I believe in you! And if you ever need anyone to talk too you can always message me iv been through 2 of these kinds of relationships so I Deffinitly understand how much it can hurt and how totally cruel it feels. Sorry my comment is so long I just saw your post and red it and it deff resonated with me since iv been through similar situations.
She used you for a place to stay until she found someone else she could use.
I'm sorry I'm missing something. It's your house. You're the one that entered into an agreement with the owner right? How does this work?
Keep fighting, you got this 👊🏼
So at a base level your ex is exhibiting some very selfish behavior. 
1. Like everyone else is saying, it's your house. Send her packing back to her parents. She used you for a home and when she felt like she hod the power in the relationship she kicked you out. If you want to take care of this in a non confrontational manner talk to your landlord and have them kick her out. And do your best to keep everything you ever got her. 
2. Toxic behavior can be remedied with therapy. You are going through a transitional time in your life and things will get back to normal. The relationship was strained but like any successful relationship between mtf and cis f they all said patience time and effort  was all they needed to make things work and nobody had to get hurt. Just like ANY other relationship. 
3. She's definitely going through things as well and she's taking it out on you. This easily stemming from her family history. Being said warzone, she doesn't have healthy examples of adults to take experience from to properly address situations in her life and that means she will always make it someone else's problem until she gets therapy. 

With all this being said I want you to know that you are a young lady and you don't need to worry about the past anymore. You have a GIGANTIC wide open future waiting for you. Take care of yourself and don't focus too hard on those bitter sweet footnotes in your life that she has left you with. There are too many ways available to you for you to have a happy life beyond taking care of a parasitic partner in your past.
If your name is on the rent contract, she can't kick you out. 

If her name is also on the rent contract, then she can remain (as can you) until the lease ends. 

If her name is NOT on the rental contract, she's a subtenant under you and you can give her 30 days' notice (in most parts of the US, at least) and SHE has to move out. If she doesn't leave at the end of 30 days, you can call the police on her on day 31 and have them remove her. You technically could call now, but she MIIIIIIGHT be able to take you to court for that - not worth the risk (unless she's been physically violent - including throwing or breaking things - or shouted at you, in which case she can be removed even if her name is also on the lease).

In terms of her changing the locks, call your landlord and say that somebody has changed your locks and you need to be let in; if your landlord does not have a copy of the new keys, they can call the police, or you can also call the police and tell them your name is on the lease and someone has changed the locks without your permission.
Honestly screw her. You let her in, paid for her rent, saved her from abusive parents and she kicks YOU out ? If i were you i'd stay and kick her out of the house, it's alright if she doesn't feel comfortable being with a woman but after 4 years of telling you she loves you ? And all of a sudden this happens ? She should go back to her parents tbh
Call the police and have them kick her out! You have every right to your home.
Don't get trolled by this post :)
it was, and i really probably should’ve explored my
options, i just didn’t want a fight as much as it hurt me to have to leave. she even changed the locks before i got my name off the contract and my stuff out which if i were the kinda person i could’ve taken it to court but again i just didn’t want it to hurt any more than it did
""forgetting""
more like she asked me to leave but there wasn’t going to be an option for me to stay because she played on my sympathy and i didn’t want her to go back to her parents. i shoulda worded all of this better it happened 2 months ago and i’m living with friends now, just looking for emotional support rather than legal, shit just hurts
She’s a thief. Fight back!
Honey, your ex lied to you then kicked you out of your own home. You *should* be angry. You *should* exert your rights *to your own home*. 

It sounds like you are internalizing all this as equally your fault. It isn't.
🥲 omg babe I'm so sorry. I do the same thing. 

I don't feel like typing it all out rn but 4 years ago I moved in with a family that kicked me out in the middle if the night with no warning and when I showed up with police in the morning all my belongings and hard drives I've ever owned disappeared into thin air. The court system turned against me. She began cyber stalking me and harassing me. Eventually I had to move out of town for a while just to beable to breathe.

 But I basically just shut down and couldn't defend myself throughout the whole process... if I didn't have my partner helping me that ordeal would've been it 😰 

Thank God I have people that care about me cause my family doesn't even care that happened.
I'm sorry. I hope youbhave somewhere to stay. She deserves to be homeless.
I think it's amazing how nice you are, but you're being too nice.

It hurts when you feel like you were nicer to your partner than they were to you, but I was god awful at setting boundaries and being mad when I should have been and that kept me hurt even longer. If you're anything like me, it almost feels wrong to stand up for myself but I try to do it anyways because not standing up for yourself is precisely why they're using you and not someone else in the first place. If it's already been two months and you let it all slide, don't beat yourself up, I did exactly that before too but I still eventually learned to just consider a lesson and the pain eventually subsides.

I hope things are better for you now than when it all happened owo!!!
This!!! You really need to do something. Breaking up with you because of your gender is one thing but causing you homelessness and denying you access to your property out of spite is another thing entirely. Please take this further. What she did is wrong.
Nobody deserves to be homeless
No one deserves to be homeless. Don't say that.
You are correct, I'm going through shit myself and I'm projecting
I disagree.  I have an asshole squatter living in a house I own for the past year and he definitely deserves to be homeless.
That is okay, don't worry.
We all go through things, I really hope you feel better soon and that everything will work out.

You got this!
Fuck I have this problem so bad aswell
Once again no. They do not.

I work with the vulnerable weekly. You would be amazed how many have been convinced that they ""deserve"" to be outside in the cold. Please don't have a hardened heart towards others.

Homes/Shelter should be a basic human right. It does not matter how much of an ""asshole"" a person is. Nobody deserves to die in the cold hungry."	sq0cf8	trans	999	0.99	2022-02-11 14:12:07
My kid told me she wants to be transgender.	"My kid is 10 and finishing up 5th grade. Will start middle school next year. She told her mom and I that she would like to transition over the summer. We are supportive of all of it and have told her so since she was two when she would say she wished she were a boy. 
My biggest concern right now is I want to make sure she is doing this because it is what she wants versus because it is a thing with her friend group right now. One of her best friends has come out as pansexual. Her other friends have spent the better part of a year discussing gender identity. I just want to be sure that she is feeling this way because of who she truly is and not because of peer pressure. 
My wife is a psychologist and I asked her if she thinks therapy with a child psychologist who specializes in gender identity would be beneficial. My wife and I want our kid to be happy and feel comfortable in their skin and with who they are. 
Does anyone in this community have any words of wisdom or advice they would like to share? Anything is appreciated. Thank you for time."	"Good on you for listening to your kid. If they’ve been saying they are/wish they were a boy from 2-10, even if intermittently, sounds like not a fad/peer pressure thing. Have you asked them if they’d like to try out using he/him pronouns? In terms of a therapist, I would explain the benefits and emphasize that it’s totally confidential, and then if they’re interested let them help pick someone if possible - you don’t want to push them into a situation that makes them even less comfortable talking about it.
Your child is 10 so transition just entails social transition, so nothing permanent or even semi permanent.  Also  this has been going on for 8 years so I don't see how this is due to peer pressure
I would allow them to socially transition. Also if someone has expressed questioning or has state their gender identity, don't continue to misgender them.
Since she is 10 (saw the comment about her being ok with she/her) you can just start socially transitioning her. Seeing if she wants a hair cut, get new clothes, see if she wants to try other pronouns. You absolutely do not have to do any medical transitions until she is ready. 

I don't have much more advice but I am happy you are a supportive and good parent. A good amount of trans kids don't have that, good luck and lots of love to you and your family!
Who cares if it's what they really want or if it's because of influence? The kid is 10. Worst outcome is that they decide they don't like the social transition-which is all that will happen until they're much further into puberty and certain parts would have to wait until age 16 at least-and ends up sticking with their AGAB. The best thing that you're doing is supporting them *experimenting*, because plenty of people experiment with their gender and presentation, and being safely allowed to do that is going to give them a healthier relationship with gender in the future.
Queer kids find each other. My hs group was completely straight laced but in college 3/4 of us were some kind of trans. I don’t think it’s peer pressure, I think it’s gaydar
let her experiment. the best test is to let her try new hair, clothing, pronouns, and name, and see what makes her the happiest. Too young for permanent stuff, but if you start social transition now, by the time puberty blockers would come into question she should be reasonably confident in her gender identity. Maybe she's trans. Maybe not. Gendefluid is an option. It might be best not to let it bee too big of a deal, if you get what I mean. Let it be a natural part of self-discovery and creative expression.
Well you said it yourself that he wanted to be a boy at 2 before he even had any friends that could peer pressure him. Have a chat with your kid and talk about him socially transitioning. Nothing is permanent with that and later down the road if your child changes their mind then you could do that easily.
Listen to your kid. You have a son. Start now. Learn and grow. [Pflag](https://pflag.org) has good literature for supportive parents. [Trans bodies, trans selves](https://bookshop.org/books/trans-bodies-trans-selves-a-resource-by-and-for-transgender-communities/9780190092726) is a great book full of real information that can be trusted.

It’s not a trend. I was Ten when I told my parents I wanted to be a girl. They said verbatim “too bad. you’re not so get over it.” I repressed for 22 years because they were authoritarian parents. I nearly killed my self when I was 16 and how I made it to 32 without walking in front of a bus I’ll never know but my life was awful. I was dissociating, depersonalizing and derealizing. I’d been in so much emotional pain for decades hiding/repressing who I was. 

I’ve been in therapy once a week for 5 years. Started hrt 4.5 years ago. I’ve been happier than ever but I could have been this happy for 27 years instead. I’ve lost most of my entire life to a hellish nightmare that doesn’t even feel real now looking back.

Listen to your kid. They know more about themselves than you do. Even this early. Be better than my parents.
Everyone in the comments is already giving good advice, but I want to recommend r/CisParentTransKid !
Respect your child's identity. Social transition, even if it's temporary, is still important. Like when someone chooses to be called a nickname or to stop being called a nickname as they mature. And if your child hasn't gone through puberty yet, you can get your kid on puberty blockers. They're not permanent like HRT, they just postpone puberty until a child can make a more secure decision.

But seriously, just use their name and pronouns. And if they tell you that they're actually not trans in a few years, than that's fine. People experiment; it's a part of life. It's just important to support your child through this.
I highly recommend seeking out a therapist specializing in gender identity or at the very least lgbt friendly. A decent therapist can help your child make sense of what they are feeling and, maybe just as importantly, provide guidance on the best ways to move forward.

 
As one who does not have supportive parents, I will say the best thing you two can do as parents is provide a safe and loving environment where your child can be who they are and have the freedom to walk on this journey.
It’s funny how we tend to gravitate to people who are like us without really realizing it.

In fact, many of the friends I used to have before I came out have all come out at queer in some way now.

I guess like attracts like.
Queer kids tend to clump together even before they come out. Having friends who are openly not cis or not straight also makes it much easier to actually talk about being trans. I knew when I was a kid and didn't tell anyone, mainly because I didn't know how my friends would react.


Food for thought. The ""social contagion"" theory of transness often comes from people with an agenda, and that agenda is usually ""fewer trans people"".
A gender identity therapist is never a bad idea. From a non related therapist of course. Not even someone friendly with any of the family to avoid any bias,either way. If this is what he wants, be supportive of the exploration and take small steps together. Use the preferred pronouns and maybe discuss names. Shop for shop clothes. If he truly isn't trans,with the proper path that will be more apparent. If he is,he knows he's got a support team in his family and THAT is everything. You seem really understanding and willing to accept whatever is true but remember, even when things get tense or esp difficult, never be disparaging even in a heated moment. That can scar forever. I wish my daughter understood better who she was when she was younger,because the earlier they know (for sure,with guidance) the better for them in the long run. Best best best wishes and love from another parent X
I mean for a start you could try to call them by he/him, and also say that they are trans rather than want to be. You need to support them as a parent, even if it’s a hard change to make, they won’t be going on hormone and they won’t be getting surgery at this point. So the most important thing is for you to support them whether they are trans or not, and support the identity that they want to present as.
The phenomena of several people in a friend group all coming out as trans/nb is a result of queer people tending to become friends with other like-minded queer people. It's a matter of feeling safer, more comfortable, and accepted amongst people who have a similar perspective, vibe, and experience to you which becomes a foundation for a supportive friend group. Then when one person starts coming out to the others and everyone sees that theyre not being ostracized or discriminated against, then the others feel safe to start coming out as well. It's social coalescence and mutual support, not a social contagion. It sounds like your kid has a great support structure around them and you should feel proud that they trust you enough to share this part of themselves. I knew I was genderqueer/trans from about the same age but didn't feel comfortable sharing it with my family and socially transitioning till I was 30. The intervening years were hell and full of self-destructive behaviour. You and your kid are doing great. Congrats!
You might want to talk to a specialist about puberty blockers. They don’t do anything harmful, all they do is delay puberty and buy some time for your child before the commit to a particularly gendered puberty. It would honestly be an amazing thing to be able to do for your child, few people get to have the option to go through the puberty of their choosing.
You cannot be influenced to ""become"" transgender. This concept was scientifically disproven in 2017, to ease your worry.

Nothing your child decides on has to be permanent, they cannot have surgeries or get on hormones until 18, so let them experiment now and potentially save them from years, or decades of suffering.
I appreciate that you’re trying to support your kid. And I can appreciate that you would have concerns about what your kid might experience as part of their transition. But I need to point out that you stated your biggest concern about it being a trend or some form of peer pressure in the sentence after you said that your kid has expressed some version of the idea that they were or wanted to be a boy since they were two years old. 

Even assuming that the friend group is a factor in your kid wanting to transition now, I would tend to think any influence is more about feeling safe enough with those friends start taking steps towards their transition, rather than being talked into something that they wouldn’t otherwise want to do. 

I’ve purposefully used they/they pronouns and not used gendered words like ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ to refer to your kid, because it sounds like either you’ve not being using the appropriate pronouns for them, or haven’t spoken to them about what they want on this. It’d be reasonable to assume that if they want to transition and present as a boy that he/him pronouns would be correct, but not every person is the same. I don’t think I’d ever recommend against speaking with a reputable, quality mental health professional, but a first step in showing support to your kid would be to talk about these sorts of simple elements. Ask them things like “what pronouns should we use for you here at home, and should we always use them for you or use something else in certain circumstances?” They might want to use he/him pronouns most of the time, but in some situations, say with certain parts of the family or officially at school with teachers, may want to stick with she/her. Likewise, whether they’ve come up with one they want to use or not, they may want to use a different name, especially if their birth name is particularly gendered. 

Let your kid take the lead on this. Be clear in listening to what they’re telling you, and back that up with your actions.
Sounds like they’ve known for as long as they’ve been able to communicate in words and concepts, so I can’t imagine you would be doing anything except being great parents by letting them transition and getting them all the best resources
since they've been saying this since they were 2, i'm pretty sure this is entirely their choice.

obviously, they're only 10, so any transitioning for the moment is purely social. there's nothing they can do permanently at this age, so there's no harm in it. in year or two, you can look at getting them puberty blockers, and that should give them a few more years to be sure about anything more permanent.

also, with the peer pressure thing - though i certainly hadn't made these friends by 10 years old, in secondary school i managed to accidentally gravitate to fellow queer people. me and a couple of close friends both started coming out at similar times, though none of us were out when we met. it's actually pretty common for queer kids to accidentally end up all friends with each other, before even knowing it.
it could be a case of one of her friends came out which made her comfortable as that happened with my friend group. i came out and then 2 of my friends (both girls) said they had been dating for a few years so maybe its that?
I’d recommend a social transition first. There are real benefits in starting hormones early so if the social transition goes well, at like 15-16 (up to you’re preference), it might make sense to start considering them.

The first step, I think, is to start calling him by his preferred pronouns. See how he reacts. For me, it feels so affirming for people to get my pronouns correct. If you mess up, just correct yourself. 

I see a therapist that specializes in the LBGTQ+ community. I’d highly recommend that too.
it’s probably not peer pressure. if i knew friends who were talking about gender identity when i was 10, i probably would’ve figured out im trans a lot sooner. there’s no harm to social transition. plus i think if a child wasn’t trans and did a social transition, they would discover quite quickly that they aren’t trans. the gender therapy and psychologist will certainly help.
Allow kids to play with gender. It's good for everyone, cis or trans. I would have lived with so much less pain if I could have. 

Also, it's possible she picked these queer friends **because** they understand her. It might have not even been conscious. I'm 33 and many of my old friends are coming out as trans. We're too OLD to follow trends. Our hearts just found someone who understood us. It took our brains a while to figure out why. 

I am so glad your kid has friends and family who support them. So many of us don't have that. Thank you
If your child hasn’t gone through puberty and isn’t already on blockers I would try to put them on it. Blockers have no side effects but Essentially just halt puberty which makes it a lot easier to medically transition later on. Because of their age I agree with everyone else and say let them socially transition first and then maybe have a discussion in a year or two about where they want to go from there. You both sound like amazing parents.
Even if this is a thing with the friend group, the worst thing that happens if you let your kid socially transition and they change their mind later is that they know you will support them in their exploration of themselves.
If they started this at two and is sticking with it all the way to ten I think its a pretty safe bet that its not just because of their friend group. I'd recommend letting them transition socially and sticking to it until they're a bit older to see how they wear it. I think hormone blockers may help too! I wish you the best of luck and send lots of love!
Let your child experiment. Nothing permanent needs to be done, but experimenting with names, pronouns, and clothing does no lasting harm. If this turns out to be a phase, then your child knows they can talk to you about things and will feel safe coming to your about how they feel. If this is who they are, then they will be glad you were supportive.
My kid said it when they were 3. Then brought it up again a few years later. Just because it wasn’t a daily occurrence at the time, doesn’t mean it wasn’t still the truth. Kids don’t always have the words to say everything they feel. Our kid sees a gender therapist and there is a diagnostic checklist for the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. They interviewed me and my child separately and before they gave a diagnosis. They also talk with my child regularly and we are monitoring for signs of puberty and when to start blockers. Support your child by letting them socially transition. They can change their hair and clothes, name and pronouns, but you don’t have to do anything permanent yet. Get a gender counselor and see what they think after talking with your child. If you child decides they don’t want to present a certain way anymore, then they can just change their hair, clothes, name and pronouns back. It really is no permanent risk at this age. Even if they start blockers, those are temporary as well. Show your child your really do support them for who they are, no matter what. Not supporting them will cause more permanent damage than anything else.
>We are supportive of all of it and have told her so since she was two when she would say she wished she were a boy.

This right here, you claim to be supportive yet your child has told you they where a boy since they where 2 and now you are thinking they are only wanting to transition due to others and peer pressure
Puberty blockers and social transition, then if she feels like it when she can medically transition later. Also therapy is always good.
There's no harm to let them socially transition. That's the great thing in young years. It's the best way to discover yourself. A (affirmative and progressive) gender therapist for children would also be great. Accept your kids identity and let them discover themselves. I wish I had that opportunity as a child.

I'm absolutely stunned that children of 10 years discuss gender identity so much. Sadly since I've seen some stories I believe that parents can be too pushy about it. It's best to just be supportive and let your kid find themselves. Don't make them some social media figure or expose them. Just let your kid be a kid. Let them be who they are. 

At the age of 10 there's usually Still some time too discover left before needing to think about puberty blockers but just have in the back of your mind that they exist and would be an option to buy more time.
Wait, if I'm reading this correctly, he wants to be a guy? If that's so, politely stop the misgendering lol

Second, as other people said. Let him socially transition and see if he wants to start hrt or if he wants to go back to their AGAB (I don't know words, that probably sounds offensive to someone lol) 

Finally, support him in other ways if you can. Something small, like clothes I guess would be a start
u/pwrof3 please do not think that having gender dysphoria is a ""trend"". This is a really dangerous right wing/terf trope. Your kid will be desperate to be who they really are.
It’s very important to note that it’s never just a fad or thing among friends.

It seems like there are so many sexualities, genders, pronouns now and as though all the influx of people coming out is some kind of fashionable trend, I can understand that perspective.

But people who come out very rarely ever go back in. This is an era of people being true to themselves, questioning what they like / feel rather than being told by the generation before them what they’re supposed to like / feel.

Just food for thought. :)
There are 110 comments at the time of me writing this, but hey it sounds like I was in a very similar situation to your child when I was their age (I came out and transitioned from female to male under similar circumstances), so here’s some context for what things were like for me back then:

1) I came out as bisexual when I was fourteen, on the same night one of my friends did. Turns out I was pansexual, actually, but that took me a couple of years to figure out (close enough, right?) Anyway, with a few LGBT+ friends in our group, we assumed we were the ‘gay friend group’ at our school, but by the time we were 18 and graduating, it had turned out that *all* of the cliques at our school were like that. 1/10 people being LGBT is now considered to be a conservative estimate by some accounts, so the odds of your child being the only queer person in their circle of friends were never high.

2) I’m 22 now. I came out to my friends as non-binary at sixteen (didn’t tell my parents for almost a year, didn’t think they’d believe me - I was right, they didn’t) and then I came out as a transgender man at seventeen. It’s been five years. My memory of being a teenager is mostly just scraps of stress and the paralysing fear that I’d never be able to access the resources to transition because my parents would never agree to help me. Your kid doesn’t understand that you genuinely don’t know how being trans works, because your kid has always had access to all the scientific and academic information they could possibly ask for because the Internet exists. It took me years to understand that my parents weren’t being wilfully ignorant - they just hadn’t done the couple of hundred hours of medical research that I’d done by the time I came out at seventeen. Your child’s friends have probably been discussing this for a long time in part because your kid will have been doing their homework about this for a *long time* to be sure about their feelings before coming to you about it. They probably even already know about the whole ‘parents of trans kids almost always assume it’s down to peer pressure for the first few years’ thing, because it’s such a common experience that it’s been a running joke for at least a decade.

3) I’d heard other people voice the same concerns that my parents voiced (and that you’re voicing now), dozens of times anecdotally online or in my research, well before my parents ever said them. Usually word-for-word. Genuinely I have no idea who’s passing this identical script around to every trans kid’s parents but just know that your kid has thought about their current feelings more carefully than you could ever ask them to, and has already seriously considered a lot of the concerns that they knew you were going to have.

4) Sometimes people come out as non-binary, realise they’re actually transgender a year later, and then stick with that second realisation for the rest of their life. That’s what I did. (Hi again.) Generally the way people identify changes in small ways over time, and there’s nothing to say that your child won’t discover a more nuanced understanding of how they feel over time that leads them to a different label, but that’s not a *problem* , because I promise you there are no negative repercussions to experimentation. There are some serious repercussions to your kid deciding they need to hide their feelings from you, though. Your child will figure it all out eventually, no matter what anyone around them says or does. The important thing is that they shouldn’t be suffering while they’re figuring it out, and god knows I was suffering being addressed as a girl for years when I’d privately figured out by fifteen years old that whatever else I was, I definitely wasn’t a girl.
At that age social transition is really the most you can do. None of that is permanent. Let him have a haircut (if they change their mind later it’s just hair it grows back). Try out he/him pronouns. Buy a few new outfits. Let your child explore their gender. It doesn’t have to be a lot just a little bit of recognition. If it doesn’t fit they’ll know and let them know it’s safe if they try something and it doesn’t fit. It’s always ok to go back or try something else

Please feel free to stop by r/transgenderhelp and ask us questions and we will guide you!!
Many have already told you great things. I do believe a childrens therapist would a good call. It certainly doesn’t harm! And yes, support him, gender him correctly, use the name he wants and get him boy clothes. If he’s still happy that way in three years consider hormones blockers, but that’s still a long way. And if he ever changes his mind at any point whatsoever, that’s also fine!
I definitely reccomend therapy sessions to help work through every thing. that said, at 10, let them transition socially. theres literally no harm in doing so and if it's a fad, they'll want to stop soon enough. this will give you and your child time to figure out if anything more is neccessary. If possible, I would get in contact with a pediatric endocrinologist if possible to begin discussing the potential(after years of living socially as the desired gender) of puberty blockers but you have a couple years still before thay'll be needed.

main thing to know is you're already doing a great job just by asking advice and not dismissing it outright. it can be scary but trans kids with accepting homes are much more likely to become happy, well adjusted adults.
First of all, don’t misgender your child respect them and their pronouns. Second of all the only type of transition they can have is social, which isn’t permanent or semi permanent it can be changed instantly and doesn’t have an effect despite letting your kid figure out who they are. If this has been a before mentioned thing since they where two then it’s almost definitely not a phase and isn’t peer pressure. If your kid hits puberty soon the only other transition would be puberty blockers which stops one of the worst experiences in a young trans person life, puberty blockers aren’t permanent either. Even if this does end up being a ‘phase’ let it be, let them explore themselves and figure out who they are in a safe environment, other wise your relationships will crumble under the restrictions of identity. 

This is coming from a trans guy who was refused the safe place to be trans and different, and has been fighting for the right of self expression since 7, just be supportive that’s all they need.
Imo, therapy never hurts. And social transition won't hurt anything, and even if you're worried about that whole social contagion thing people are putting forward, keep talking to your kid. If you're worried, you're the parent so therapy can be a safer place to raise those concerns, but don't let yourself out it in your own head without talking to your mini-person about it.
Y'all need to stop assuming that wanting to be a boy = he/him. Guys can use pronouns other than he/him, and gals can use ones other than she/her. Pronouns don't have gender.
I transitioned young. Questioning at 10, sure at 11, and began social transition at 12.

I told my parents I was trans in the hospital when everyone thought I was dying (I lived, obviously). I was tiny and 12 and sick. When they allowed me to transition, it gave me hope that drove me to get better. After I got out of the hospital months later, I began truly transitioning and getting better. 

Had my parents turned me away, I might not have made it. My parents' acceptance was EVERYTHING to me. After they accepted me as trans, I thought they'd accept me for anything, which they did. I'm open and honest with my parents. I tell them when I make a mistake. I tell them about when I break the rules and ask for forgiveness. I don't keep secrets.

In short, your acceptance means EVERYTHING to that child. Whether or not they are truly trans or if it is a phase, stand with them. If they change their mind, be there. If they decide to spend the rest of their life as a man, be there. Don't shame them. Love them either way. It could save your child's life.
Little correction, nobody ""wants"" to be transgender, however people ""are"" transgender, it is a big difference because it's never a choice to be transgender, be careful next time ^^
And for your kid I think puberty blockers would be the best, if they actually change their mind they can just stop taking them ans have a normal but late puberty
As the mom of a kid who transitioned at 14, medically at 16, just follow your kids lead, speak to an endocrinologist, follow through with the therapist, and have your own therapist so your own stuff doesn't get mixed up in everything your kid is figuring out and so you are strong enough to support them. My nb kid never verbally expressed their gender identity until age 14 but also never had iron clad notions of what has to be ""boy"" and what has to be ""girl.""
You really have nothing to worry about,  my kid came out at 11 and socially transitioned. Started on blockers at like 14 at 15 he went on T. After 2 years he decided that T wasn't really for him and is now non binary. At 19 he is going they/them/he ,has no regrets and is comfortable with how their body is.
Your kid is 10. Let me explore what's up, at 10 transition is social. Clothes, maybe hair if you feel like it, name and pronoun changes. This is nothing you need to worry about being influenced by someone else, because none of it is permanent.
people aren't trans because of being pressured into it. nobody ever is
There is NO social contagion. I repeat NO social contagion. It doesn’t happen. Not for being trans. This is a lie being told by people who don’t want trans kids (specifically trans boys/men) to exist. 

It’s called learning and trying to figure themselves out. 

They feel safe in their groups. Social transition harms no one. 

You need to find a gender supporting therapist. Work with them so your child can have independent sessions and sessions for you and whomever else in your family that needs to learn about being trans. 

IF it ever gets to the point of hormones, that takes years to get to. No doctor will just give out hormones to underage people. Doesn’t happen. 

Trans healthcare standards: WPATH.org <- read this.
Since 10 is so young, I’d say send the child to a psychologist specialised in trans people. And I guess just sit down with your child, talk to them and understand their intentions.
She has been telling you since she was *two.* It is ***clearly*** not a new thing or a peer pressure thing. I won't even argue the rest. This has been going on for eight years, you said it yourself. To consider it peer pressure is reductive at best.  
Edited for pronouns since she isn't using he/him.
I want to emphasize nobody “wants” to be transgender. Nobody wants to be misgendered and feel uncomfortable in their own skin. Nobody wants to be harassed and shamed and threatened, or worse. Nobody wants to be afraid of their rights to live being taken away. Nobody NOBODY “wants that”. 

Edit: also, if your kid is expressing that they’d like to be addressed/treated as a boy, the least you could do is respect his pronouns.
Sorry I can't offer any words of wisdom but I will say that you guys are absolutely amazing and wonderful parents for being so supportive and trying to understand the situation ❤️
let ur child socially transition and therapy as well with a trans friendly therapist will also benefit bc it’s not like at this age ur child can do anything other than socially transition. but therapy will help ur kid navigate these feelings and learn to cope with them. 

and if it turns out ur kid isn’t trans that’s okay but atleast in the end they will know no matter what their parents have their back and that can lead to a hugely healthy relationship between all of you.

right now the changes are just clothes, hair, pronouns and maybe even a name who knows this is the discovery portion nothing more.
I didn’t figure out I was transgender until I was in my late twenties. My parents were shocked, still have trouble remembering to use my pronouns.
Let them explore, maybe they'll be happier as a boy, maybe they'll decide that they would rather be a girl or neither. But what will matter will be that you supported them and gave them space to figure out who they are. 

A counselor who specalizes in children and gender wouldn't hurt. Just so they have someone to discuss this with who could provide answers that you might not have.
Probably she gravitated towards LGBT+ kids because they have similar experiences that affect how they act towards others, in the case she could be doing this to fit in it's just a matter of making sure she knows her identity is always up to her, there are no wrong answers and she can always change her mind or go back. Gender is about what makes you feel the most comfortable, and letting her experiment with how she presents socially, helping her try out pronouns and names, letting her choose her hairstyle, etc is the best way to make sure she has all the resources to know what she's most comfortable with! Thanks to you and your wife for being good parents.
Nothing permanent is involved in transition at 10. Let them socially transition if that is what they want, as nothing irreversible is happening I don’t think worrying about whether this is best for them in this situation is necessary. It could be an important part of them learning who they are whether or not they are trans.
I’m going to be honest I knew I was trans from about age 8/9.  It’s definitely not the case for everyone but I’d recommend doing basic social transitioning first for him. But also start seeking out a therapist that can help explore/ help them understand their feelings.
the journey of being transgender is not easy. you both need to do what you can to make this less stressful since gender dysphoria is categorized as a stress disorder.

1. don't call your child ""she"" or ""a girl"" anymore. that only makes the person feel like they aren't doing enough. it could lead him to not wanting a relationship with either of you in the future because he will only feel invalidated around you.

2. take him into therapy immediately. as I said before it's not easy. you shouldn't try to do it alone. also being a child experiencing that means it will be 10x more difficult.

3. start with social transition over summer as he wishes. don't let him go towards medical transition for 6 more years unless it is an urgent situation. for example, if he was going to harm himself because of his body then do let him medically transition as soon as possible.

remember it's valid for you, as the parent, to be feeling like you lost your little girl throughout the transition so care for yourself too. even if you don't feel that at this moment, you might feel like that at some point.
I applaud you as a parent. Thank you for being one of the good ones. Therapy is obviously a great idea. 

I guess that while I do understand your concern, you need to remember two things: first, queer people often find each other, even before they come out or even acknowledge their queerness to themselves. So your kid's gender identity may have led to that friend group, rather than the other way around. Second, gender isn't so important that it can't be played with. If your child thinks ""I'm a boy"" and takes on that identity for a bit, only to realize that it is kind of shitty and she'd rather be a girl, you'd accept that, right? And the child who spent a little time on the other side of the fence is going to be a better person at the end of the day anyway. Letting your kid use a different name and pronouns and dress differently isn't going to hurt anyone permanently. Even puberty blockers are meant to delay puberty. It's not like you're going to be pumping him full of testosterone.

Hope that helps.
As someone whose parents thought I was being influenced by my friends when in reality I knew before any of them, and as someone whose parents thought they were doing the right thing by waiting to support me in case I was wrong: that can be incredibly damaging to your child’s trust in you, in your relationship and in their ability to trust anyone in general. Respect the social transition, and if your kid changes his mind later, that’s okay. But he knows who he is better than anyone else. He is most likely not going to change his mind. You don’t have to medically transition him yet, not by any means. But let him socially transition and let him feel comfortable coming to you. My parents didn’t do that for years and they wished they did in the long run because of how damaging that was to me as a young kid, and though they’re better now, that trauma still affects me as an adult. Give your kid support, that’s all he wants.
okay first thing, if your kid comes out as  trans you don’t continue to misgender them and call them your daughter. also, i understand thinking kids are “pressured” to be trans or gay but 90% of the time its not. when your kid is friends with other lgbt people its not because its popular among them, but because we feel safe and respected among other people like us, not because its trending. besides, if your kid said they wanted to be a boy for YEARS, its definitely not new.
I think if he’s been expressing this since a young age, it likely has nothing to do with friends. But even if this was due to some sort of confusion, what harm could it do?
let your kid transition, try to understand. not saying you have to give them hormones right now, but just mainly, talk to your kid. socially transitioning won't do anything permanent. even then if your kid somehow decided that they changed their mind, social transitions can be reversed. please don't misgender them though. just in short, listen and talk to your kid and make them feel safe.
You kid probably just found friend like him. And feels safe expressing his wish now. Even if it turned out he is wrong he won't figure that out without trying to socially transition. Be supportive try to see and treat him as your son. Allow him to buy boy clothing if he wants. Maybe change his room to be more boy-ish.
Let them test the water and help get him(your son now basically) a therapist to talk about it.  Therapist is actually critical for future stuff IE puberty blockers and such if I remember. Otherwise more importantly they will be able to talk him through it and give him an outlet for his emotions and such.  Personally just give them space and allow them to express themselves.

Honestly I think I had ideas of being transgender maybe since I was 10 or maybe even 8?  It was 20 years ago since I was 8 so not easy to remember.  But, the point is that it common for trans people to notice when they are young.
get hormone blockers as fast as possible and then when you have all the time you want to think about transitioning because cross sex hormones arent allowed before the age of sixteen and cross sex operation arent allowed before eighteen and hormone blockers only pause the making process of your own hormones and you can always stop taking rhem if you find out you are not transgender
but please immediately sign up for a transitioning clinic or something dont go to a psychiatrist with your child or something or therapy those are all in the clinic and maybe after a year or something or a year anda half or two theyll give you hormone blockers
it seems a little long but youre kid is very young and hormone blockers at the age of twelve is like every trans person wished they had that 
it will save so much potential sadness of your kid and it will make the rest so much easier
As pretty much everyone says let them social transition, get a trans affirming psychologist that is not family and therapist to help guide them with there feelings, you usually one doesn’t question gender especially from like 2 unless they are trans but for now social transition is till it is time for puberty blockers but even those aren’t permanent they just buy your child time to start hrt when they are ready if they ever are so they dont haft to go through the wrong puberty
Even if they were being peer pressured into this, what’s the worst that can happen? They spend some time exploring their identity before realizing it doesn’t fit them? That sounds like a great growing experience that everyone should have some time during their life. I think the psychologist might be a bit much. You might come off as unsupportive if you make them start seeing a psych while they are figuring these totally natural things out. I would let it play out and if it seems like they are struggling or need help through support that you can’t provide as a parent, then I would explore the therapeutic route.
I would be careful with concerns about whether or not your kid's trans identity is a product of peer pressure. I'm not saying there are never times and places to be concerned just that I've seen people make this assumption without good evidence. Not to imply anything about you in particular, but if there was ever a time to be extremely honest with yourself about how much you know about your kid's interests and friends it would be now. I've seen people assume that their kid is trans because that's what their friends are doing without knowing anything about their kid's friends. Even if it's true it's not fair to expect someone to take you seriously if you don't actually know what's going on.

Next, write some dates down. When did they talk to you? What did they say. Time passes differently for adults. It's good to have empirical measures of time. I've been transitioning for about six years now but I know to my parents it still feels like a ""new thing"" sometimes. It's good to have some account of what happened when, how long it's been.

Therapy is not a bad idea but it is important to remember it is not designed to be a trans test. It's a very real possibility they go to therapy for a while and they still want to transition and you're still concerned that it might be because of something else and it just feels like the same position you are in now just months or years later. Therapy is just guided introspection. There is no guarantee that it goes anywhere and there is even less guarantee that a person will come out of it looking from the outside like they've put more thought into their decisions.

At least for my parents, there was a big fear that they might be letting me make a big mistake. If that's you, it's worth putting effort into routinely deciding how much of that fear is reasonable and knowing what to do if it's not. For my parents I think a lot of the unreasonable fears can from the idea that being trans was an all consuming identity, that I was giving up who I was, and that nothing would ever be the same again. Seeing me do the things that I do but as a man really helped them. There are several parts there. You have to let them to some degree (starting small is great)  be a boy, do boy things but also try to see them as a boy and you have to be present for that. If you don't let them do anything or if you only let them do things when you aren't watching them it's going to be hard to trust that it works for them because you won't know. If you never see them as a boy from time to time, even if you let them do things it can be easy to view all the things they've done as ""not really transitioning"" so anything new can look like a big step.

This is the advice I would have given my parents so it might not be for you, but good luck.
One of my favorite podcasts is Science vs. The Science of Being Transgender. Take a look at it as well so you can learn a bit more about what it entails and means: [link](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Ft9HunKBhXgRdLkdO4QLq?si=JmrmfjDGSHC8AOlBWwLwTg)
its a kid so they cant medically transition yet, but i think that letting them express themselves in a safe enviroment, and taking them to a therapist would be beneficial. at the end of the day, most of us were experimenting with our gender expression to find what feels the best for us and its common to do for kids/adolescents even if they are cis and hetero. at this age, socially transitioning and buying a lunchbox or a tshirt with a superhero instaed of a princess wont do harm to anyone, and if they decide they dont like it afterall, its all  good, if they decide it feels better to be treated as a boy, its also good
These no harm in letting them explore their identity as long as you support them and let them know that right behind them as they go forward regardless of whether they trans or not
Let them know you want the best for them and that they are the only one who truly knows how they feel 
Seeing a trans person probably just gave them the vocabulary to explain themselves 

I knew i was trans at like 4-5
I knew when I was 7, I tried coming out at 14 but was shot down due to fear, my family often thought I was gay etc due to my friendship group, and I understand just because it wasn’t the case for me doesn’t mean it is for your child, but this could be who they truly are. 

If you are worried this is for social reason maybe talk to your child and compromise, I recommend slow transition for anyone in the sense of social transition first, see how he feels using his preferred pronouns, having his preferred hair cut and clothes. You sound like you want to be supportive. Start by saying son/he/him (this isn’t a dig, genuine suggestion without hate) if he begins feeling euphoric, and happy take it from there. Definitely get him a gender specialist therapist, not to change him or convince him otherwise, just someone who can listen without judgement and understands the situation. 

You sound like you love you kid no matter who they are, which is nice to see. The world needs more supportive parents.

Sorry for the essay, others may disagree with me, this is just my opinion.
I have never understood why people find it so difficult to support a kiss in socially transitioning. it's like the lowest bar ever, to go back if he changes his mind, so are hormone blockers. Hell, even hrt is easily reversible within the first couple of weeks. The only thing I can say to you is support your son. if he says this is what he wants, it is.

Edit: also, your kid doesn't WANT to be trans, he IS trans.
Perhaps hormone blockers would be appropriate for now. They can go on T when they have confirmed their identity and decide to go ahead. To go on T in the early teens could be very harmful bc T mutilates forever with hair growth and voice changes and general masculinisation especially skeletal. So, in summary, block hormone effects until later on and sure, socially transition as a boy for now. I wish you all the very best of outcomes.
Give them the time to fully understand the aspects.
If they want to try being a boy, they can do that quite easily by adopting a more masculine name/nickname, dressing more boyish, and going by he/him pronouns for a while. If they love it, congrats, its a boy! If not, then they’re not a boy. 

Social transition is a two-way street: you can go back if you want to. Your child probably just needs a chance to try it out, to see if it’s for them. If they really are trans then allowing them to experiment now in a safe environment will save them YEARS of heartache. If they aren’t trans, then this will just be that funny year where they thought they might be a boy. No harm done.
It's definitely a good idea to get em in with a therapist to talk about it and make sure it's what they definitely want
around the same time was when i started thinking about queer identity a lot harder, along with my friends. I’m 15 atm, and we happen to be the queer group at school. Likely it turns out that your kid and their friends happen to be in a similar group, some phenomenon of queer kids not knowing they’re queer becoming friends is what I’ve noticed—theres probably not that much science backing that up, but i can tell you from experience, its not peer pressure or wanting to be like their friends. It’s a genuine feeling.
Gender therapy is always a good idea and I know you're trying to do right by your kid, but I worry about this line of thinking you're following. You said yourself that your child has been expressing this since she was 2. Plus, even if she didn't express it back then, the idea that his friends might be ""turning her trans"" is a non-starter. Nobody can turn a cis kid trans just like nobody can turn a trans kid cis. It doesn't work like that. If it did, almost none of us would be here right now. Now, sure, hearing about different gender identities might make someone wonder for a moment, but if it sticks, it means a genuine discovery has been made.

I also saw in another comment that she hadn't expressed this since she was 2 but is expressing it again now that she is around kids like him. To me, that says she now has the words to describe what she's been feeling the entire time, which is...my God, it's great. So many of us wish we had the words when we were younger and the fact that kids generally do today is amazing.

The best thing you can do is call her by whatever she wishes to be called, get her a good gender therapist who will work with her, and give her the chance to express himself through different hobbies, toys, hairstyles, age-appropriate styles of dress, and so on. Trans kids, more than anything, need love and room to breathe and be who they are, whoever that is. And I'm sure she'll be twice as delightful and happy once she realizes she can find her own way and be true to herself 😊

(For the other commenters who might see this and get concerned that I and her parent are using the wrong pronouns here, she said herself that she still wants to go by ""she/her"" for the time being.)
Socially transitioning and maybe puberty blockers when the time comes in 4-5 years. You all still have a lot of time to figure things out. Take it slow and listen to your child's feelings.
Psychiatrist first. Always.
The idea that transgender people are always actively aware that they are transgender is a dangerous myth.  While many of us can look back and see patterns of behavior and a history of recurring ideas, that does not mean that we understood the significance at the time.  Indeed one of the most common stories that trans people tell is how it is rather absurd that it took them however long it did to realize that they were transgender!  Many of us receive our first concrete signs as we approach the threshold of puberty.  Until then, boys and girls look more alike than not, and the primary difference in terms of identity is performative.

Beyond that myth is something a bit more practical:  the world gives transgender people plenty of reasons to keep their mouths shut even when they *do* figure it out.  From a very young age, little boys treat being called a little girl an insult, and little girls treat being called a little boy an insult.  Even as children, we are taught that being trans is a *bad thing to be*.  This lesson only becomes more decisive as time marches on.  We, like anyone else who might use the phrase ""in the closet"" to describe a part of their identity, did not choose to hide who we are because it seemed like a good idea, we do it because it seems like the less bad option.  Coming out is treated as an act of courage for a reason.

The questions that you are asking are good ones, and you are driven by good motivations.  You, no doubt, are aware adds difficulty, complexity, and danger to life.  You very naturally would want your child to be sure and to not do anything rash.  Something that is very important to understand is that these motivations can just as easily lead to great and terrible harm as anything good.  

And so that brings me to the first and most important thing you can do:  listen to your child, talk to them, and believe what they say.  It is important that they understand that you are a person who can be trusted without question.  The right kind of therapist can be a powerful ally for a host of reasons, but keep that first and most important thing in mind.  If your child doesn't like or trust their therapist, try to understand why and be prepared to go through a few before you find one that fits.  Finally, you need to allow them to express their identity as best they can.  At the moment this means going out into the world and presenting as a boy.  You may notice that they sometimes do or like ""girl things"".  If you do, *don't* treat them as signs that they're actually cisgender.  But even as you allow them to be themselves and support them, don't push them either as that can threaten that position of trust.  This is important because *identity is tricky*.  The second decade of human life is tumultuous and confusing for everyone, which means that it is entirely likely that your child's understanding of their identity will change over time.  If you push too strongly, you are in effect building a new closet for them to get lost in, and teaching them - however subtly - that perhaps there are some things best left unsaid for the time being.

Anything beyond that are questions for another day.  Be present, trust what they say, and let them explore their identity even if you think it might be a mistake.  Be the person in their corner and their place of safety.  Understand that wanting to keep them safe and happy is a noble thing, but that it is a thing that can lead to great harm as well.
Kids that are awkward or have a non standard identity often seek out friends with the same issues. So you might be mistaking the effect for the cause.
This is around the time I started exploring ideas I'd bender identity and being myself, transitioning with meditation and even getting to talk to a professional took a long time for me. 
In part, it's because I lived in a nowhere town. But it still takes some time to get in contact with doctors. 

For me at that time, I would talk with the school counselor a fair bit. The one I talked to help me get in touch with a doctor and organization that was willing to help me with stuff. Such as getting me to add from the doctor or professional therapist meetings and eventually the cost of meds. 

But even without seeing a doctor, therapist or even the counselor, people can explore themselves and the idea if gender identity without it. The kinds of clothes they wear and present themselves, how they want people to refer to them as and treat them. 

That's what I and a lot of others did say before seeing a doctor and starting HRT, dressing how we felt and referring to ourselves that way. Sometimes people are wrong about how they feel and there seems to be this idea transitioning happens over night, but it doesn't. Letting your kid take it slow and understand themselves while also treating them with respect should help you and then understand a lot more.
Ask her how her life would have been different if she had been born a boy. Get to the root of what she thinks gender is about. That might help clarify things.
I get that this might be a bit of a shock coming to you all at once, but I would recommend that you do your best to accept your kid as transgender and be supportive of them.
Talking with a psychologist would be good, and even if you don't as a minor they won't receive any permanent transitions so they have a long time to figure themselves out!
*nobody is trans because of peer pressure.*
if your kid came out as trans, he would probably be shamed, not celebrated.

your kid’s friends gave him the support he needed to realize he was trans, thats all!
nobody is peer pressuring anyone:)
You should do everything you can to support your child - I've seen what happens to kids when their parents try to suppress their true selves. Any ""transition"" at your child's age would be purely social, and no part of it would be permanent in the least, so I wouldn't worry about them doing it because of peer pressure - it really doesn't work like that, but even if it is the case, it won't matter because social transitions are fully reversible.

All you need to do is reassure your kid, make sure they know you love them and accept them in whatever shape or form they may come in.
at the age of 10 there isn´t much stuff to do (atleast nothing involving medicalization). A psychologist may be good, but u have to be sure that isn´t gonna hurt the kid. Respect to their friends, i think it´s completly normal to come out if the enviroment is friendly. So i wouldn´t get worry about it. U should assure ur kid that it´s gona be safe and supported no matter who they are or how they identify as.
I think talking to a counselor who specializes in gender identity is great! Talk to the therapist first to find out their approach.  There are counselors with bias in this field, like any other. Make sure they are neutral about the path your child should take. They should BP either encourage nor inhibit your child. The process should be one of discovery. Your child may be more comfortable talking to a stranger than they would be with you, so don’t feel bad about that. Being trans comes with a lot of emotional baggage, particularly the negative emotions foisted on us by society about ourselves. 

Realize that you really can’t influence what your child chooses in the long run; you can only help them feel better about themself and avoid the crippling feelings of self loathing many of us (me) have had to overcome. That you are asking these questions puts you way above most parents. Thanks for your sincere efforts on behalf of your child!
Everyone else is bringing up good points, so my bit is that if the kids have been discussing gender identity for the better part of a year, as you said, and the little one has gone thru that thinking phase and decided to bring it up to you, her parent, that she wants to maybe try socially transitioning and eventually maybe new pronouns and stuff, then doesn't that speak to a level of consideration beyond peer pressure?

Also, if you and your spouse want to bring in a psych/therapist, please do choose someone who specializes in gender/lgbtq+ issues. Therapists who aren't trained on such matters might not handle delicate issues like this as well as they could, since they may have never received training or done the proper research on the lgbtq+ community to give valid advice.
Yeah let them socially change certain things but give them room to change their mind if they want to. If they say they’re one thing one day and another thing another, just go along with it. Something will eventually stick and then support them in whatever eventual conclusion they give! Wouldn’t go down the medical route rn, things may be permanent and if they changed their mind, that wouldn’t be the best.
You should get your son on puberty blockers. They are safe and completely reversible.
At this age the best you can do to support your child is respect any new name they want to go by, pronouns and let them dress/look the way they want. Haircuts and boy clothes.
I definitely think that this is more because they feel safe to come out in their current friend group than because of peer pressure.
I don't know your kid but the best thing will probably be to let them socially transition and make it clear that you'd be accepting even if they ended up wanting to go back to their AGAB.
Gender counseling is an excellent idea.
Take your kid to a gender therapist. At his age it would only be a social transition so if it is because of peer pressure (which is extremely unlikely) he will be able to detransition whenever.
A lot of folks here have offered some really good advice. Rather than repeat what’s been said, I just want to say that I think you sound like a great parent. It’s totally understandable to feel confused/concerned, but you really seem to have your child’s best interests at heart. I wish more parents were like you💕
If she has seriously been considering this and honestly wants to transition than before puberty kicks in is probably the best time. It doesn't sound like a whim or peer pressure since she's said this since she's been a toddler. Best wishes and make sure before permanent changes are made she still feels and knows she needs to transition. Probably hormone blockers would be good for now to delay puberty than when ready she can pube as she wishes as male because that's what she wants or as female should she change her mind.
Queer kids generally group together even if subconsciously- I wouldn’t be worried about “peer pressure”. I came out before a lot of my friends and a lot of them followed suit weather it be sexuality or gender, but we’re all so much happier being able to express ourselves- especially around each other.
Gender psychiatrists are an amazing idea especially with a child so young
My 11 year old son(ftm) came to me and told me he wanted to be called Tommy and for us to use he/him pronouns. It’s really not a big deal to buy him some boy clothes and use his preferred pronouns even if he changes his mind next year because it’s just showing support. It’s not medically at his age so I don’t really see the harm and it makes him SO HAPPY. Whatever comes down the line we will be supportive then as well. I think for our kids the most important thing we can do as they grow and try to discover themselves is show them we love them no matter what and accept them for who they want to be. I’m so glad to hear your son has such great supportive parents and I wish you well for your journey together :)
something that tends to happen in friend groups, is if one person comes out, then the rest will likely come out shortly after. its less of a peer pressure thing or doing it cus its cool, it is moreso that they feel more comfortable in their small circle of friends to be themselves. most queer people tend to stick together, even before they come out.

i appreciate you taking the time to learn about this rather than immediately shut them down. its a long journey but the best you can do is to just be a support for your son and listen to their experiences and what they want from you. physically transitioning isn't something kids can do, at least depending on the state, so social transitioning is all that means, which is 100% reversible if they do realize one day that they arent trans. you got this!!
advice from a trans kid here. I would say be very open and treat her like an adult with the way you talk to her. Tell her you are willing but take it slow, that way she knows you are with her but want to make sure she is comfortable with herself. Communication is VERY important, especially at her age. :)

edit: I’d like to say the summer transition is also a good benefit for everyone. It lets the person get used to their new presentation on their own before opening up to the (usually unwanted) judgement of others. The same way that you would want to learn to hit a baseball before you join a team. Reduces the feeling of awkwardness for the person and helps them learn without stress of what others think :) 

I’d also like to thank you on behalf of your child for being very supportive and having the good mindset that you do. Keep that good relationship with your kid ❤️
I think going to a therapist or psychologist who specializes in this is a wonderful idea. To be honest, at your child’s age, the furthest they can really transition is wardrobe, name, haircut, and all that stuff. I don’t see any harm in letting your child experiment with these things. Maybe your child will end up just being cis! But it’s always good to explore. 

I will say this about friends though: queer kids often group together at a very early age. It’s just a subconscious thing (which slowly becomes conscious as they age). I met my best friends in a childrens choir. Some of us knew each other as early as 3 years old. Five of us turned out to be trans that I know of and not a single one from our main friend group is straight. These things just happen, and it can be a good thing. 💜
I would consider puberty blockers as well. Im FTM and  started it during 3rd grade… medically speaking my mother should of informed my doctor so I could go on them regardless of being trans or not, but my pediatrician didn’t know. I was expected to be taller but was stunted because of that. Also helps further down the line if they decide they want to fully physically transition in their teens… they might be able to avoid the hassle of binding, becoming curvy, and top surgery in the future.

Edit: Sorry this comment was pretty vague, and you probably dont know much about puberty blockers, but they just slow down puberty until a later time in a child’s life. Many cis kids use it because they were like me who experienced it too early. This may not be the case for your kid but it is something to consider.
My kid began letting me know at about age 3 he was trans. He's 16 now and many of his friends are gender non conforming. He's done hormone blockers and takes Testosterone. Regardless of what his friends are doing, we chose to take him at his word. He is both drawn to, and others who are non binary, trans, etc. and these kids in turn are drawn to him. They have that in common. Trust your kid. Listen to them. Be glad he has a circle of friends going through the same things as they are.  To do anything else is to risk depression, self harm, suicide, etc.  When they are older, should they decide they are cis, no harm, no foul.
If he's been saying this since he was a boy, it makes me think it's him, not a trend. But even if it is a phase, what's wrong with supporting a kid through a phase. My oldest wanted to be goth and we let them wear all black. My middle said she's a girl and we let her wear girl clothes. Same thing as far as I'm concerned. At this age it's just clothes and name. And the consequences of not supporting them are so much worse than the consequences of letting them live as a gender and changing their mind. I mean, no one's doing surgery on a 10 year old.
Hi there! It's great that you're being supportive of your kid. She's 10, the same age I was when I told my parents I wanted to transition. At that age, it's only social. Ask her how she feels about getting a haircut, clothes, using different pronouns, etc. Medical transitions don't happen until at least 16.
Please please please respect your kid's wishes! If your kid is indeed a trans male, please refer to him with he/him pronouns if that's what your kid wants.
It sounds to me like she has some excellent parents. God bless
Ok, first off good on you for trying to help your kid!

I am a trans man, 29. I started medically transitioning at 25. My parents were first made aware of my discomfort from toddler age as well. I have a lifetime of memories trying to navigate living as a trans person. But personally, I am super grateful there was not so much buzz around trans-ness while I was growing up as there is now. Coming to terms with what it means to live as a trans person is an incredibly personal experience that I think is wildly over-trivialized by the focus on the social aspects of transitioning and doing so as young as possible.

I’m definitely not anti-trans kids, I was one and I am super proud of myself for surviving what was sometimes an extremely disorienting experience (especially around and after puberty), but I know I’ll get dragged here if I say more so if you want to DM about anything I’m around
Fantastic! Im glad to see another supportive parent. First, I would make sure to confirm the pronouns they want to use, and see if they identify as nonbinary or as a man. Second, transitioning at that age mostly includes physical appearance changes and potentially hormone blockers. I would find a gender therapist to help determine what’s right for them. Other than that, just try to support them in whatever they ask, I’m sure they know what they want better than anyone else!
Having them talk to psychologist is the best thing to do, and then you, the psychologist, and your kid can kinda go from there to see what's the best thing to do
def would do trans friendly and specializing psychologist as others are recommending
get hormone blockers as soon as possible 
after that your kid has all the time to think about their gender and if they think theyre not trans they can immediately go back and continue getting their own hormones

please trust us there is nothing worth more than your kids happiness and hormone blockers will save so much because puberty will hurt your child in every way possible
OP: My child has been saying they're trans since 2 years old

Also OP: Is this peer pressure?

😑
Definitely see a therapist. All trans people have to see therapists anyway in order to obtain access to hormones and surgery, and you also want to make sure your child is doing this for the right reasons (i.e. genuine gender dysphoria) and not for superficial reasons you yourself mentioned.
How about you stop misgendering your kid then? If they want to be a boy then stop with the ""she/her"" terminology.

They haven't been forced or coerced or brainwashed - they came to you because they trusted you.

Don't ruin that trust now by questioning something they've wanted for 8 years, just love and support them however you can.
Please dont call them a her
It's he, not she, start there and helping him socially transition will be much easier for you both.
People don't just decide they ""want to be transgender"" you're born that way.

You could start by not misgendering him in every single sentence after explaining he confided in you in telling you he sees himself as a boy.
Watch out for the pansexual friend they’ll fuck anything

Try starting with using the pronouns they prefer
I'm a trans woman.  My 14 year old AFAB child just came out to me a couple weeks ago.  I'm overjoyed for them and told them that if they need any meds or whatever to ask and I'll make it happen. 

I came up in the late '80s and early '90s and didn't have that support or my life would have turned out much different.  I never want to see either of my kids live through the shit I did.  Because of this, I will walk to the ends of the earth to let them know that they are perfect and beautiful and absolutely accepted just they way they are. 

At 10, transition is strictly social.  Let them do it, there's no legitimate reason not to.  If it's a phase or an attempt to fit in, it'll pass.  Don't count on that happening though.

Being transgender is an adventure.  It more a blessing than curse, but it is challenging.  Make sure your kiddo is safe, fed and loved.  Just accept them blindly and support them in their ventures.  Kids learn more from what they see than what we tell them.  Be the person that you want your children to grow to be.  

You have a very special child.  Please treat them as such. 

Love and light to you and your family; blessed be.
Allow them to socially transition. If they have a certain preferred name or pronouns besides their deadname and AGAB pronouns call them that. I do honestly believe that taking them to a therapist that specializes in gender identity could be a good idea too, especially at this age. Best of luck to you and your kiddo!
I can tell you something. When I accepted who I am ended up in no time surrounding myself with queer people. There is a chance your kid surrounded themselves with queer people because they are queer and not the other way arround. 

I didn't get to transition as a kid and I fanstasized about growing up into a woman from at least 13 years old if not sooner. I am just 100% that I remember realising being trans then and puting a word at the feeling. However I was getting excited by femme things as long as I can remember. If your kids tells you that they probably not saying lightly and you should be honored as a parent that you made your child feel safe enough in this age to tell you such a deep desire. I manage to tell my mother at 23 and I still haven't told her my name at 27. 

I can only say support her. And something that someone did to me when I first chose a name. If your kid chooses a name try to always use it. Even if they do something that needs punishment, never ever use their dead name as a punishment (deadname: the name you gave them, I prefer to call it my artist name because dead name kinda dramatic). Make sure you are not doing it as a favor and as a reward. You are accepting your kid full time no limitations. Using the chosen name shows love and using it only when you are happy with them is situational love and it sucks. 

Everything I said doesn't mean your kid is 100% trans. There are people here who say that they are not trans. Not many, but it can happen. However the only way for your kid to be certain is to allow them to fully express and experiment with their identity. If you give them space then they will make the correct decision for sure. 

Maybe offer to discuss names with them being part of the journey could be fun for them if they haven't chosen one yet. That one is a brainstorm idea honestly, but I did ask my mother how they would have called me if was born a girl and I simply didn't like it. I wish I could straight up discussed names with her
Do social first (clothes, name, ect) then do the medical if after a year or two it still feels right
my dude let the kid explore his gender. also unless i’m reading it wrong kiddos been telling y’all he’s a boy for 8 years. additionally gender is a social construct there’s a lot more wiggle room then people like to acknowledg
You seem like a very loving and caring parent, but I think that you might be a little bit misguided in some areas. I know that it can be scary for your kid to ask about transitioning, especially at such a young age, but I can assure you that there will be no permanent procedures done at that age, even if your family does take that route in the future.

Now, about the whole peer pressure thing, I can't tell you one way or another what's happening. It could be a phase or it could be how your kid really feels, but none of that matters right now. What matters is that they are telling you what they need from you to feel comfortable and safe. A psychologist with expertise in gender identity is definitely a good idea, but you do not need the green flag to start listening to your kid.

Right now, transitioning means using a different name and pronouns, cutting their hair differently, wearing different clothes, and possibly being sorted differently for sports and bathrooms. I promise that none of that is going to hurt your kid if this turns out to be a phase.

What will hurt them is if you don't start taking their identity seriously. You need to be there to love and support your kid 100%, regardless of any personal hesitations (remember, nothing about transitioning is permanent for a kiddo so young). If this turns out to be a phase, your support will show them that it's okay to experiment and that you won't be mad if they want to go back to their old gender presentation. If they turn out to be trans after all, you will be helping to keep them out of some of the awful statistics associated with homelessness, suicide, and poor mental health statistics associated with being trans.

TLDR: I promise that ""transition"" is purely social and non-permanent at this age. Look into psychologists, but do not wait any longer to start supporting your kid in what they tell you makes them comfortable.
Just let them socially transition, and make sure you let them know that if they change their mind or find that their identity is different than what they thought it was, that it’s completely okay, and that discovering your gender identity takes a long time. Also be sure to tell them that gender is a spectrum, and that they shouldn’t be afraid to look up or study how they’re feeling in regards to their own gender. Of course, make sure they know they can ask you, but I’m assuming neither you or your wife are super involved in the trans community, so be ready to help them research their own identity as well if they need help. Wishing your kiddo the best! ❤️
I told my dad I wanted to be a boy and go by he and him at around that age (possibly twice). Clearly, it didn’t stick either time, because it didn’t feel quite right, and I went back to interacting as a girl…but as soon as I found out that flavours of nonbinary were actual gender options as a young adult, I was like ‘oh, that one, obviously’. Ftr, two gender, which for me is I’m a girl and I’m a boy, both at the same time. Which I would not have been as clear on if I hadn’t tried stuff and found out what didn’t work for me, as well as what did. 

Point is, my dad just went with it and let me figure it out on my own. If your kiddo socially transitions and then decides they don’t want to anymore, then…ok? They can socially transition again towards whatever feels righter. Figuring out who we are is a journey. It’s all good. 

Oh also: it’s actually a pretty good plan to try it out over the summer, because then they can get a sense of if it’s working for them before school starts and it has to become bureaucratic.
Www.genderdysphoria.fyi
has SO much high-quality information which you'll all benefit from.  Its author takes a lot of time to keep it updated with the latest credible medical research.

If your child has insisted since age two that she is really a He - he knows himself better than you do, and I'll bet you would be wise to respect that.  Sure, ""fads"" can and do occur - but gender dysphoria isn't one where that frequently happens. 

Why would a male wantvto be a female? They wouldn't.  Why would a girl want to be a boy?  There are a lot of valid reasons, but none are more important than one's innate sense of their own identity.

At 10, yiu will necessarily need to give immediate attention to puberty blockers - to halt any furthur physical maturation.  This is not ""hormones""; it's the opposite.  It will facilitate his social integration with others, M and F, as a male....without his breasts developing, or periods starting.  IF, at any point, this seems not to be right somehow; merely stopping the blockers will quickly allow puberty to resume, and the body will *quickly* catch up to where it should have been. In other words, there is little to nothing to lose, and a LOT to gain, for Now and especially for his future.

I really believe you will find most of the most common concerns addressed in the site above, and since you won't be the first or only parents facing this - you definitely came to the very best place for the latest reputable information.
Some points to consider, in no particular order:

* Your child might appreciate you calling them ""he"" and ""son"". This can also help trying to find out whether your child truly wants to transition, e.g. if being gendered male ends up feeling wrong after a while, they will tell you.

* Therapy with a specialist is highly recommended, just be cautious that you find one who is truly supportive of trans people.

* It is not uncommon in groups of friends that many of them turn out queer in one way or another. But people don't do this in order to fit in (to the contrary, being out as anything LGBT+ related often makes it harder to fit in outside of LGBT+ circles). Rather, it is a combination of multiple factors:

  * People who are feeling different in on way way or another, even on a subconscious level, tend to flock together, especially if they have trouble fitting in with people otherwise.

  * Being surrounded by LGBT+ friends makes it easier for someone to also step out of the closet, when in a different social group they might end up keeping it all bottled up.

  * No one has any exact numbers, but the portion of the population that is actually LGBT+ in some way or another is not as low as some people might think (I personally suspect at least 20%), especially considering that many orientations and gender identities are able to pass as cis and/or hetero if the circumstances do not allow a coming out.
So far I've been seeing Good comments talking about socially transitioning (clothes shopping hair cut etc) I'd also like to advice u to see if your kiddo can get some gender identity focused therapy. (At least where I am) the waiting lists are crazy long for that type of stuff so the earlier you're on it the better there they will explorer with her what she'd want now and or ij the future and they can help getting to the right recourses. 

I also get you might think it's a form.of wanting to fit in (and that is a possibility) but I have noticed that queer kids tend to associate with eachother even before realising or comming out as queer. I wish you and your kiddo the best!!
I suggest going for puberty blockers once their old enough, no bad side effects to them, and if they change their mind they’ll go through ‘normal’ puberty once they stopped taking them 


this is coming from a 17yr old transman who can’t socially/medically transition because of my parents 
.. I’ve wanted puberty blockers since I was 12-13ish 
, and was to afraid to ask for them…

 I regret it everyday. I hate my body. And I would do anything to have had them.. 


Of course you should ask your kid if they’d want to go on puberty blockers but truly it’s something that will help save so much discomfort in the future if they want them
Have an open conversation with your kiddo about what they would prefer to be referred as, any social changes they wish to make (changes in presentation) and be there to support them. Journal of adolescent health published a study confirming trans kids with a supportive environment have their risk of suicidal behavior cut in half. Take them to a gender therapist. Don’t worry about medical transitions, your kid is far to young for any doctor to even consider that. At this point it’s new clothes, haircuts, and using their correct pronouns.
somehow doubt is the only kind of “support” that comes to most cis peoples minds. try to beat the odds and just listen to them
A conversation with a therapist who specializes in gender identity sounds like an awesome idea. HOWEVER, there has been a disturbing rise in “therapists” painting themselves as specializing in gender identity, but they are just conversion therapists who will try to dictate your kiddo’s gender identity to them and to you. A good therapist will never tell you what was talked about in session without your kid’s consent and will help your kiddo explore their gender, not dictate it to them. Beware anyone offering to “explore the reasons for transgender feelings” (read: blame their transness on some trauma imagined or otherwise).
I asked about pronouns, she is still wanting to by she/her for now. Thanks for the advice.
My thought exactly.  
What social pressure is going on at 2 exactly, and carrying on for years afterwards?
To clarify, they said it a few times when they were 2, but this is the first time bringing it up since.
Exactly. Thanks.
Wish my parents got this advice :/
wish my parents was mature for this change, my life is 100% difficult mostly because of the place i live and who won the elections
They said their child wants to still go by she/her for now in a comment
Thank you!
Took me a second to understand ""agab"" and my first thought was ""assigned gay at birth""
Exactly. You learn to spot out the people you'll feel safe and comfortable around. As an adult my friend circles are almost exclusively some type of LGBT.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 We find eachother somehow without even realizing it. It’s not social contagion but making friends with people who feel safe and have similar lived experiences.
Yup. My best friend since kindergarten and I both came out as trans during adulthood. Queer kids gravitate toward each other. It is a real thing.
Thank you!
I second the “no big deal” approach. My daughter did the same thing a around preschool and then again in fifth grade. I recommend just letting them know you’re supportive without really getting overly involved. Let them move through this at their own pace. My daughter settled back into her cis identity by 7th grade.
as a trans man I 100% agree
You are amazing. I appreciate your input.
Parts of your life sound so familiar, but I'm still figuring things out. I started saying I wanted to be a boy at 4, and I'm now in my 30s. The feelings & thoughts never stopped, but I stopped expressing them aloud, became homophobic and transphobic as I was taught while secretly envying them in a part of myself I couldn't and wouldn't acknowledge existed. Because the rules were I was born a girl, rules are rules, and I follow the rules. I've hated myself in ways unrecognizable to most, despite being a highly functional member of society, good friend/sis/daughter, and talented employee/graduate. Because those are the rules: be productive, ignore what you can't be.

The contradictions of homophbia, sexism, and anti-science drove me out of my religious upbringing over several years. I then focused on not being repulsed by LGBT people & actions, because I had to unlearn the hate and become an ally for these people. I'm now coming up on 2 years since realizing I'm one of the people I hated, and it's a new level of sickening. 

OP, I wish my parents had been more like you. There are subtle societal rules & expectations your kid is exposed to by simply existing. We all exist within the rules that are societal norms, and for the most part, they are not malicious,  but societal expectations can feel that way when you don't naturally feel a desire to conform. If I could tell little me anything, it would be that it's ok to break the rules. As long as the broken rule doesn't hurt someone, it's just a boundary, a line that can be crossed or erased or redrawn if necessary. 

I also highly recommend therapy. I just found out that I dissociate, and no, it's not something that everyone does. I still don't/can't think of myself as a ""normal"" person with valid desires & needs. These are things I've thought my entire life. Your kid may already believe similar deeply-rooted negative understandings of themself, and it will take a long time to work through, recognize, and overcome those things. And no, I wouldn't remotely characterize this possibility as anyone's fault or worthy of blame. It just is.
Thank you. Didn’t know that existed.
Thank you! It helps to simplify things and put it in perspective.
Thank you!
Same here.  My oldest, dearest friend who I have known since first grade also turned out to be trans.  Most of my friends I made?  Queer in some fashion.  And I didn’t come out as trans until my thirties, so it’s not like one of us did it and everyone else followed.  We find each other.
Yeah. A bunch of my high school friends came out as trans in college. We went to separate schools, in different states -- for many of us it took years before we realized that half of our old friend group was trans because we were all too scared to tell each other lol. Definitely not something we influenced each other into. Unless they were putting trans juice in the bread sticks at little ceasar's, it seems pretty likely that we just found kindred spirits without fully realizing it was what we were doing.
*sorry,I should have used They,until a decision is made
Thank you!
Thank you! That’s a great way to look at it.
You are right about that. Something to think about for sure.
Thank you!
Thank you. I am thankful that the world is a somewhat safer place for all gender identities. When I was a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, any talk of this nature would have ostracized you from the community. 
I will continue to let my kid explore and figure out where they are comfortable.
Definitely! Thank you.
Exactly. Those are Terf lies.
That’s very well said. Thank you!
5) Ask your kid what they need from you right now. Odds are that if your kid feels strongly right now that they’re a boy (your phrasing was a little ambiguous, it sounds like that’s what you were saying?) then right now, being referred to as anything other than a boy probably feels a bit like having a bucket of ice water dumped over their head. That’s usually what it feels like, especially once you’ve figured out what the problem is. So, on the point of ‘they should not be suffering’, it’s a good idea to ask and be clear about which things you do that are hurting them. If they want to be referred to as ‘him’, then hearing ‘her’ or ‘them’ will hurt, every time. (Don’t do what I’m doing here. The only reason I’m using ‘they/them’ for your kid right now is because you didn’t mention whether they’d specifically asked for ‘he/him’.)

6) Certain lines of argument or questioning might also be hurtful for them, and those lines of argument might sound completely reasonable to you at the time, so you need to get into the habit of asking your kid if the question you just asked makes sense or if they feel like communication is not working right now (just, check in with how they’re feeling when you talk about this stuff), because it’s *always* going to be easier and less painful for them to just end a conversation and run away than it is to actually address the problem. Your kid is the expert here, and for their sake you do not want to get into a situation where they’re afraid of talking to you about it. So no panicking and no getting angry - you need to have your sensible, understanding adult pants on when you’re taking about this stuff. Listen, let them talk. Don’t cut them off, but don’t bottle your own feelings up either.

7) I’m kinda reflecting on this stuff from the perspective of having just mended my relationship with my parents after it broke down when I first came out as bisexual when I was your kid’s age. Let me tell you, eight years is a long time to feel like you have no family looking out for you, especially when you’re a teenager for most of it. I avoided my parents like the plague, doctors and teachers eventually stepped up and filled the gap - three of my teachers ended up filling in the parenting role during the most formative period of my life. All my memories from that period are of them, not my family. I didn’t go off the rails, I did well in school, because of my teachers. Then my grandmother found out I was transgender when I was eighteen and she didn’t ask why or if I was copying my friends (you can safely ask your kid that of course - just maybe don’t ask them the same question once every few days for months like my parents did). My grandmother just immediately started calling me her grandson, and she laughs and apologises the whenever she accidentally uses the wrong pronouns, and it blew my mind that I was allowed to have an actually comfortable relationship with a family member. You don’t have to be perfect or understand perfectly, god knows my grandmother doesn’t understand completely. You just have to try to communicate in a non-combative way, and make an effort to accommodate your kid’s needs. That’s the important part.

8) Okay I’ve been putting this one off because it’s complicated, but. Therapy. Firstly, I’m oversimplifying slightly here because there are specialists your kid can eventually consult about things like hormones and I’m sure there are other similar specialists around, but generally speaking, they don’t really make child psychologists who specialise in gender identity who can assuage all your concerns right now. My dad wanted to look into the same thing, for the reason that he wanted someone to explain what I was going through to me and to my parents, but that’s not really what happens in therapy sessions or discussions with psychologists about this kind of thing. I mentioned to a medical doctor once that my parents wanted me to see a psychologist about coming out as trans when I was seventeen, and my doctor just looked confused for a second and then asked what was wrong with my parents. (I think she actually meant to ask if they’d misunderstood the situation and my needs, which to be fair they had, and that was understandable, but the way she phrased it was kinda funny anyway.) Back to the point: therapy is good for you. Most people even without any mental health problems would benefit from therapy, provided they had a therapist they could trust. If your kid feels that they would benefit from talking to a therapist about it then that’s great because they’ve identified a need they have that you can fill: but the things they would discuss with that therapist would probably be very different from what you’re imagining; a professional who specialises in transgender people might be worse than a regular therapist in this situation (some of them have outdated training or outright hostility to the people they’re treating and you’d have no way of knowing if that was what you were throwing your kid into); and you may well never find out what your kid discusses in those sessions. I certainly never managed to discuss my experience with transitioning in-depth in front of my parents until I was a few years into adulthood and they were less flighty about it.
Thank you for this
Thank you!
The op mentioned that his child wanted to be a boy. That's why people are assuming.
Was looking for someone saying this. This! When talking about transitioning, we can say that we need or want to transition. But you are either trans or not -- wanting to be is beside the point. For a long time, I believed I couldn't be trans, but that was because I didn't want to be trans, not because I wasn't.
I don't buy that considering the ""dad"" occasionally uses they/them. I also don't buy that a child that's been expressing they're male since TWO is fine with she/her. I hope this isn't a case of ""listen kiddo I get you wanna be a boy but you're not so ill humor you with they/them""
Thank you! I was raised in a very far right Conservative and Catholic household. It took me until my 20s to begin to realize how the world actually works. Not going to put my kid through the same thing.
Thank you!
Thank you for the wonderful feedback.
Thank you! It does help to hear stuff like that. It's a lot to work through!
Thank you! I’m trying my best to figure it all out and not offend anyone, especially my kid.
Very true. Thank you for the perspective.
Thank you for this perspective. It really does help.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I did ask about pronouns, my kid said “she/her” for now.
What???
Terf alert
You were 10 once, you're fully aware that kids aren't ""innocent""

As if sexuality makes people no longer innocent, what bullshit.
[removed]
A real percentage? Yes…it’s roughly 3. Horrible advice here. I would give almost anything to have had the opportunity to transition BEFORE since hormones during puberty greatly affect how your body ends up being structured.
There is nothing harmful about social transitioning. I have known I'm transgender for years, probably when I was 5 or 6 and because I felt like I couldn't present as who I am I did get a lot of suicidal thoughts and while I still get a few suicidal thoughts it has gotten a lot better since I've started transitioning. A lot of people have misconceptions about kids transitioning. Social transitioning is just getting people to use different pronouns or trying out a new name or even just changing your hair. It's very rare for anyone under 18 to transition medically in anyway
I completely understand the desire to do it over the summer - many people who transition don’t want to have to show the whole world what they feel like is an incomplete or imperfect or messy mid-transition version. Have you asked what transitioning means to them, ie haircut, new wardrobe, and if they want to do it all at once and then show up at school the next year as a boy?
Is that because your child wants that or because they're afraid you won't refer to them by their preffered pronouns because I've seen a few comments were you're calling your child by they/them instead. 

Like I'm hoping you actually want to learn or your limit is ""I'll call you anything but he/him""
He wants to go by she her because he feels awkward and doesn’t want to push that barrier yet. You can refer to him as he online…
I never vocalized wanting to be a girl specifically (I am a trans woman). If your child has, it’s definitely some supportive evidence. 

As others have suggested, social transition is a good first step. And making sure they know you’ll support them if and when they decide to take the medical steps!
Worth pointing out like the other person, I started transitioning at 26 and wanted to be a girl from a very young age but at no point did I ever express it to anyone. I think when someone says they're trans, chances are highly likely they are trans.
queer people flock together unknowingly when young and pushed to hide ourselves, source: almost every queer person i know, including myself. the idea that peer pressure makes people gay / trans is almost always false. you surround yourself with people like you, because those are the people you relate to. you do it, i do it, and so does everyone else. its just how we as humans survive in a social environment.
Got it. Still there is corroborative support. Either way it doesn't matter now since it would just be a social transition
The thing you should consider is how many ""regular"" boys or girls tell their parents they want to live as the other gender?  They don't.  It takes a MASSIVE amount of courage to tell parents that you feel like the opposite gender so much that you want to transition.  I child has to be truly amazing to have the confidence to do this.  As others have said right now it would just be social transition, in a few years it will be hormone blockers, and a year or two after, the opposite hormones to match their desired gender.  There shouldn't be any surgeries till they are 18+.

You and your child have plenty of time to go through this process and if they decide this is wrong for them for some reason, they will be able to easily back out without permanent changes.  But its very unlikely.  People and children who realize they are they are transgender and move forward with transition almost always flourish and stick it through.  Those who decide it wasn't right for them, typically do NOT do it because they are not transgender.  They typically do it because they don't get the support they need or society around them is so harsh they feel the need to go back into the closet.

I hope you are awesome and support your child through this.  They need you more now than ever before!  I'm sure you will all figure it out, and they'll grow into an awesome delightful person!
Just see this, if he has expressed this from such a young age, please support him through correct pronouns and social transition, like I said in a previous comment I knew for sure when I was 7, but I’ve always “wanted to be a boy”.
Honestly, if she said she wants to transition at 2 and then brought it up again at 10, then it’s been there for a very long time. I highly doubt that that is the result of peer pressure, because admittedly, around a certain age (8th grade), many of my friends and I all came out. It’s not because one of the people there was queer, and therefore everyone else wanted to be too, it just prompted discussion and questioning. I don’t think many of us were aware that it was possible to be LGBTQ+ before then. 

It’s possible that your kid is going through the same thing. Maybe she has wanted to be a boy this whole time, but only recently heard that it’s actually achievable. Generally speaking, when a child tells their parents that they would like to transition, they have already put a lot of thought into it. 

And as many here have said, most forms of transition at your kid’s age are social (changing name, pronouns, and presentation), so really if she doesn’t turn out to be trans, no harm done.
I never vocalized that I was a boy until highschool. I didn't say anything cause I didn't want anyone to think I was weird and I didn't want them to hate me. 

I think letting them socially transition would be good for them and their mental health, if allowed to socially transition they might avoid some of the mental stress and depression I went through. 

Also, if they bring up puberty blockers and think they would like to have them, they're (the puberty blockers) completely reversible. It just delays puberty. 
If I knew those existed at that age I definitely would have asked to be on them. It would've saved me tons of stress and maybe I wouldn't have been so depressed. 

The most important thing is to listen to your kid, don't continue to missgender them and don't dead name them (use their old name), and let them socially transition if that's what they want.
I wish I'd vocalized how I felt more at these ages. Up until I was 10ish I didn't even understand that transitioning was a thing you could do, it took 10 more for me to face the fear of doing it. I just want to give you kudos for having the kind of relationship with your child that they can trust you like that
If this isn't what your child wants, they can easily retransition back to being a girl; but as others have said, that's not likely the case. In fact, you thought this might be peer pressure from their friend group. I'm inclined to believe your child has this friend group because they were drawn to other LGBT kids. Sometimes people can pick out who is like them even if it isn't obvious to themselves or anyone else. And if it IS just peer pressure, but you still believed and supported them, your child will learn a valuable lesson that their parents will support them no matter what.
Not sure if it’s been mentioned yet but I want to add that just because their friends have recently come out it’s not necessarily a ‘thing’ and they may have just realised that if their friends have been accepted then maybe it’s safe for them to do so as well. Let them experiment with their gender! Even if its a temporary thing it will be good for them to experiment and find out if they actually are trans, if not then they will figure that out naturally and go back to presenting as their assigned gender.
You'd be surprised how possible it is to keep those kinda thoughts secret. I've known since I was 13 (I'm an adult) and STILL haven't mentioned it to my parents once. They genuinely have no idea!

I wouldn't worry too much about it; when you're that young, you can't really do anything permanent even if you wanted to, anyway. Let alone consequences. The worst that can happen is that she tries presenting like a boy the next few months & then loses interest.
Same
oops, my mistake thanks, just looking out cause getting misgendered is reaaallly painful
If only XD
This is correct. I see no problem.
yep. when i met my friend group, we all thought we were cishet. but basically all of us ended up being queer lol
I told my parents “I’m a boy!” at about the same age your kid did. They said “No you’re not!” For my entire childhood I was taught that being queer was disgusting, wrong, that anyone who “chose that lifestyle” would go to hell for it. Meanwhile I hated my body, felt completely disconnected from it, like I was a ghost simply possessing it. Only wanted to play boy characters in pretend. Loved any time someone would accidentally refer to me as male. When I was twelve I discovered what “trans” was and immediately knew I was that. Cue seven years of self loathing and anxiety as I had to stay in the closet, hide myself, cry myself to sleep with a pillow over my head so my parents wouldn’t hear and ask too many dangerous questions. It ruined our relationship. How could I ever trust someone who hates a part of who I am?

Your kid might be trans, might not. For God’s sake, let her experiment, but most importantly, show her that no matter what you are in her corner and her safety and happiness is your priority—whether she’s your son or daughter or child. Please.
man I wish I had a supportive dad* like you are, mine is nightmare fuel and r/insaneparents material. His homophobia only a small part.
You're doing good with your kid, or it seems that way. So many of my queer peers have gone through so much stress and misery due to unsupportive parents :(


*guess based on comment history and statistical probability
I just want to add PFlag is an amazing source for parents of trans kids. My mom used to attended online zoom calls and I think it helped her a lot. She got to hear other parents stories and I think she felt seen. It also is how we found my doctor and surgeon! It truly is an amazing supportive source if you are wanting to attend I highly recommend it.
I struggled with internalized homophobia and international transphobia along with undoing how I was raised and how much hate I had been thought throughout my 32 years of existence at the point where things started to get better. 

Being labeled sick, weak of mind, an abomination in the eyes of god, by members of my family have plagued me since my coming out. 

There is so much damage left to undo and I might never be completely healed from life. 

Hiding/repressing who we are for so long is an inherently traumatic event. Self loathing stemming from what we learn from society, the transphobia/homophobia internalized and externalized, I feel like who I am, my soul has been broken so many times, life broke me in ways that had no wounds on the outside. Dissociating became one of my first traumatic stress responses. I think without feeling numb all the time I wouldn’t be here. I was also the good older child child. I did the things I was supposed to do, I got not just a good job but established a well paying career. I specialized and my talents are slight still to this day. I got married, was in a place where having children were gonna start happening. I was happily married, she was my best friend. I learned so much from her. Her family saw me as their own. 

I cannot tell you how disruptive it is to be all of that and then realize “If I were a girl I’d be happy” knowing exactly what it means, breaking open decades of repressed memories all pointing to trans all along. The loathing the envy, the confusion. It all comes back. The trauma had its was of destroying the happy person I had been and the mask I wore to keep up the facade of happiness was too heavy. 

For me, I was at the breaking point of ending everything, or a try being trans. The Hail Mary of ruining my life by staying alive. 

Therapy. Helped. I learned how to stop dissociating and stay present most of the time now. Reality gets weird but derealizing and depersonalizing is at a minimum. Undoing decades of defense mechanisms comes with a price tho. Most adults know how to handle emotions, good bad, they know how to handle stress and all of those learned skills I never did because of my defense mechanisms…I fell apart. Panic attacks, meltdowns, burnouts. Never experienced anything like that. Un numbing, being real. It’s terrifying.  Therapy helps in that it’s given me the tools I need to cope with all the feelings.

Going from “happy”, angry, numb, sarcasm..

To hrt/expressing who I am as a person and therapy unlocking what feels like every aspect of being alive and the plethora of feelings. It felt like the lights got turned on, the fog of war, of life. dissipated. Smelling a warm spring morning after it had rained that night, brought me to tears. It was the most beautiful moment I had experienced in my life up until that point. I was just walking to work after getting off the bus. It was the first day of my life and I knew no matter how bad it was or gets….this feeling. I liked it. It was worth.

I have wished more times than I can remember to have woken up a woman. I mourn and hate the lost years i could have had being myself as a teenager. I’ll never have my past life back. Those experiences will never be replaced with memories of how I wish I could have been. I’ve cried and mourned that loss as well.

I wish I had loving parents. Actual loving accepting parents. 

I wish that I could have what OP’s son will have. The right life. However hard that would be as a trans kid. It would have saved me, who I am to my soul so much sooner. I wouldn’t have had to rebuild myself from the core up, healing and accepting every broken peace of me from the inside out. 

I don’t think we’re much different at all. Peeling back the layers you sound a lot like me when the gears started turning. It’s never too late to be yourself. It’s expert levels of hard to step outside of your comfort zones to be where you are now. 

It’s never too late to unlearn what feels impossible to unlearn.

For me it was worth it to risk everything. I would have thrown it all away. I would have hurt everyone who rejected me in ways I can’t imagine. Those who are in my life, who accept me for who I am, see me as me and not who I used to be, revealed themselves long ago. They’re a small chunk of bedrock of what used to be a continent of support. But that’s all I needed to be honest. Some are family, most are friends, mostly new friends and the smallest handful of old friends.

My marriage crumbled and I asked for a divorce to stop the emotional bleeding. I married a very straight woman. It’s not her fault. 

My life is better in ways I can’t even express. I’ve found the most amazing love I never knew could exist. 

It’s worth if. 

I can’t recommend doing the hardest thing enough. 

In a sense I killed who I used to be. I’m still very much that person at my core but unrecognizable… those who are gone from my life buried the old me in their minds. I’m dead to them. But how others handle their emotions…that’s not my responsibility. I didn’t make them feel those things. They were in control of how they could have responded how they could have processed those emotions is all on them.

I chose to live. They say it’s like I died and they don’t know who I am. And yet they haven’t tried to get to know me. Oh well.

I had to learn to live for myself. I guess that is a selfish thing. Oh well.

If being happy and alive is a selfish wrong thing I’m glad those bridges are burned and smoldering. 

Anywho. My ramblings need to have stopped a long time ago. 

Choose you. Choose listening to kids(your inner child even) they know more about you than anyone else does. Hold onto and protect that little shard of innocence. It’s the key to making yourself feel whole again.
Glad I could help!
9) If your kid is up for discussing this stuff with a psychologist and you can find one who’s able to discuss this with you or your kid, great - but please remember, you making that offer might sound like you don’t trust your kid to know their own mind, and getting the impression that your parents don’t trust your sanity on some level is absolutely terrifying, so please be clear about the fact that you’re just looking for someone who can help you catch up on understanding how this works and what your kid is going through. Because my dad didn’t think to explain that part to me until four years after he unknowingly scared me half to death and it would have saved a lot of stress on everyone’s part if he’d mentioned that most of his motivation for wanting me to see a psychologist was so the psychologist could sit down with *him* and give him a basic rundown on all the current medical/psychological best practice that I’d read up on and he hadn’t.

10) Your kid’s probably not quite as far ahead of you on the research as I was because I was older when I came out, but the internet is full of obsessive radicals writing hundred-page-long anti-trans theses, and there’s also a lot of completely obsolete medical theory still circulating, so other than talking to other trans people and asking us (which you get brownie points for doing, by the way, that was really good) your options for catching up with your child’s understanding of this situation are limited. Peer pressure is kind of a buzzword but it’s rare in practice in this context, so if you see someone bring it up a lot it’s a massive red flag. *More generally though, the best way I can think of for you to find both information and an insight into your kid’s situation right now, is by looking up guides by trans people for trans people, that talk about the steps of social transition, how to pass in public, what the state of trans legal rights in your country are etc* . That should give you an idea of where your kid is at, and those kinds of guides provide a very realistic explanation of transition for people looking into it for the first time.

Most importantly though, just, keep asking for advice, from your kid and from other people: keep trying to communicate, keep trying to build trust. Be curious. Because, at first I didn’t know that I wanted to be a man - I just got kind of oddly fixated on Legolas from lord of the rings because I was shocked to realise that someone with long hair could turn out to be a guy. I didn’t start wanting to wear a binder out of the blue one day - I bought one because I wanted to dress up as a male alien from a comic for a trip to ComicCon when I was sixteen and I suddenly realised that, dressed up as an inhuman-looking horned alien, I felt more comfortable in my own body than I ever had before. There are probably lots of small moments like that, that your kid has never told you about, and gradually understanding those kinds of things about yourself is fun and exciting, and you as parents can share in that when your kid feels comfortable sharing.

Just, imagine your kid (your son, I guess?) is a terrified rabbit who is internally preparing to run away at all times, and when you’re talking about gender with them it’s important that you make it clear that They Are Allowed To Point It Out If You Say Something Dumb. A lot of potentially hurt feelings can be cleared up that way.

Anyway, best of luck to you two and your kid. Take good care of them, yeah?
But not all boys use he/him pronouns
Yes! It is going to be a lot of work, but believe me, it will all be worth it in the end. I’m really proud of you, good stranger. There will be a lot of mistakes, but just listen to what your kid needs and try to be there for him. :)
Thank you for clarifying - the confusion came from the statement of them ""wanting to be a boy"". I apologise for jumping to a conclusion.
I transitioned over the summer and you're completely right. The point is to be totally different and so people don't see the messy process.
Maybe ease off on the accusations, there. If she was asked about pronouns and expressed that she wanted she/her for the time being, then that's really all there is to it for now. Granted, the fact she's been certain of her gender identity since *two years old* and still wants she/her is kind of wild, so I *do* understand why you're skeptical about this, but OP really hasn't done anything wrong yet, and everybody is different.

If the kid starts asking for he/him and OP still sticks with she/her and they/them, *then* we've got a problem. Not now. 

EDIT: Really? You felt the need to downvote this? OP came here to a trans community and asked us for advice upon their child coming out to them. Could've just not posted at all. It's only fair to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Or maybe OP knows in their heart their kid is trans, and that’s why they switch to “they”, because referring to their child as “she” already feels disrespectful to them, and OP is trying to navigate those feelings. There’s a lot of room for nuance here.
This is probably likely, honestly, but at the end of the day, we *don't* know what's going on in this kid's head. We haven't met her. Everybody is different, and if she says she wants she/her for now, then people *need* to respect that, even if using he/him here seems obvious for us. Same reason as why the egg prime directive exists.

EDIT: OP (and especially OP's kid, if she's here), *please* don't read this thread. The contents are not what I'd call fantastic.
I vocalized wanting to be a girl exactly once in grade 1, realized no one else wanted to be a girl and thought I was weird for wanting to be one so I never mentioned it again for another 17 years
I vocalized it twice, once to my 'mom' and once to my 'friends' in grade school. Long story short I started transition thus year, in my thirties. I started with a lot of regret for waiting, but a lot of that has been aliviated by support from my mom dad and friends, not the 'mom' or 'friends' I had before.
It is incredibly common for Queer people to form groups. People start to figure themselves out in Elementary and Middle school. Having a group who supports you as a Queer person is integral. It's not like one person comes out so they all come out. It's that they're figuring themselves out together. The more space and support they have to do this the better they can figure themselves out. This avoids years of hiding and wondering. Let children be who they are.
Yea. Like one of my friends came out as trans in the 7th grade. We have a group of 8-9. He started to teach us about lgbtq so we all started exploring it and questioning ourselves, all but 2 figured ourselves out, most being pansexual, the other 2 straight. Tho i do know one person that claims to be all sorts of things. Like they change it everyday. They didn't do that until my friend told her about it. It also seems like part of it is peer pressure or she's doing it to just fit in. It is very rare but it does happen. In this case if they mentioned it at 2, than again at 10, support them, take small steps to help them slowly transition to see if they really want it. If they 100% do later on, then take it to the big step with medical
same here. my little gymnasium (german equivalent to middle/high school i suppose?) friend circle turned out to literally be 100% queer, we've been friends for years before coming out to each other lol
I hope you have support now. *hugs*
Thank you very much!
[deleted]
I mean, personally when I came out I felt really weird going by he/him pronouns until I had committed to a new name and cut my hair and I feel like that is probably the case
Nah you’re misgendering him after he said he’s a boy, you’re done.
Gosh I wish anyone would've said ""that's kinda SUS hun"" I might have actually transitioned in my youth 😂😭
You should be supportive of your friends who are still figuring themselves out, rather than assuming they’re doing it for attention :/ This stuff is difficult to figure out and many queer people continue questioning things into adulthood. It’s completely normal. And once they start getting parts of it actually figured out, the rest of it’ll be a little easier. It was impossible for me to figure stuff out until I realized I was nonbinary and aro, then the rest fell into place - I’m not a lesbian or a trans man or asexual or any of the other things I considered along the way. I’m glad that my friends stuck by me instead of assuming I’m a cishet following a “trend” (which it’s not…no one gets cool points for being queer)
Yeah I felt really weird about he/him pronouns personally until I had cut my hair and picked out a new name
It's not misgendering if you ask for pronouns and are given she/her.

What you are doing right now is *actually* misgendering.
They aren't a friend. But ik that if you met this person irl  i think you would see that they are doing it as a trend. I love the lgbtq and dont judge but if i know that its 100% a trend type a thing, it just irks me
we’ll agree to disagree. My perspective is totally different to yours on this. He only feels that way because society made him feel he can’t socially transition yet. It does no harm to say him online lmao… the moment anyone expresses they’re a different gender, especially from a young age I’m respecting that. You know how good it would feel to be called he him without asking? He’s just scared.
She might only feel that way because of social pressure (probably the case tbh), but regardless, if she's more comfortable with one set of pronouns over the other ""correct"" set for her gender identity, then that's what people should use.

> It does no harm to say him online lmao…

It does if she's not comfortable with he/him yet and finds out about this thread. Would *you* feel happy about being misgendered by strangers talking about you behind your back, assuming they know what's best for you?
Yikes, we’re never going to agree. Let’s leave it, I’m still cringing at you continuing to use she when you could say they 🤦‍♂️. They are clearly trans, stop saying she.
She asked to use she/her. Even if it's not what she ACTUALLY wants, it is what she requested and you should respect that.
> she is still wanting to by she/her for now.

Fine, we'll leave it here. All I ask in future is that you don't misgender people when you are *explicitly given pronouns* for that person.

If you think there's only one correct way to be trans, then you have *no* idea what this community is about.
I'm just stunned that someone posting in trans spaces needs to be told the importance of respecting people's pronouns, frankly. Especially the importance of respecting them even when they aren't there. Absolutely unbelievable.
You’re repeating what’s already been said, for reasons stated above I still disagree.
I’m saying there is no harm in using he or they online, she just makes me physically cringe. Adios.
Yeah, it's disgusting. I can't imagine thinking I know better than someone about their own identity.
You should still respect what she has said she wants. Even if you disagree, you're just completely ignoring what the person wants. And she's the only person in her own head.
Just goes to show how far we've still got to go as a society, I guess.
Again, you’re repeating. I still disagree. Lmao…
How disgusting, then.
Hardly disgusting when it’s clear they’re trans and shying away from he pronouns because they’re scared, but okay dramatic one
No. It is not clear. When I first came out, I used my birth pronouns because I was still figuring out what I wanted. If someone had told me I was scared and it was ""clear I was non-binary"", I'd be pissed. You're just ignoring what someone clearly asked for, and you're disrespecting someone's pronouns. You're projecting.

“You go by [DEADNAME] in this house!”	"(32 MtF/NB)

I’ve been out to my mother and stepfather for a year and a half now.  Last Friday my stepfather said the first negative thing he’s said about it.  My mother’s boss was over for drinks, and he called me by my deadname, which I understand because everyone is still getting used to it.  I calmly told him, “I go by Penny now.”  My stepfather responded by angrily saying, “You go by [DEADNAME] in this house!”  I haven’t said a word to him since, and from this point on I will no longer be calling him “Dad.”  I always thought of it like a title he earned by accepting me and my sister as his own and giving us his name by adopting us, but in one sentence he undid that.  He rejected my identity and denied me my name.  Me not calling him “Dad” isn’t meant as a retaliation, it’s that I simply don’t see him as my dad anymore.  It hurts to lose that.  When I legally change my first name, I might change my last name too.  I miss the man he used to be.  I’m considering my mother’s maiden name, but I’m not sure."	"I'm so sorry to hear that, Penny. 💔 You deserve better. ❤️
Please remember that there are people that will respect you & call not by deadname but by the name you want
It should be retaliation.  You should tell him that he either accepts you as you are, his daughter, or he no longer has a child at all.
You should call him some random ass name that isn’t his and then scream at him when he doesn’t respond
I am sorry that this happened to you. 

It's good to hear that you don't take shit from anyone!
I had to ghost my sperm+egg donors for the same basic thing, though a lot more was said in addition to the name thing. It's really, REALLY hard but you gotta surround yourself with good people and be willing to remove the ones who show you they aren't. FWIW, this gal supports your choice.
That must have been painfull Penny, sorry to hear
 (Btw cute name)
Hugs, Penny! ❤️💗❤️ That sucks!
My new name is Penny too 🥺 im sorry sister
a year and a half is long enough to get used to it. that was a choice he made. fuck him, cut him out.
You’re 32 and he talked to you like that? I’d be out of his life forever.
Just call him mom.
I hate to hear that, and I am so sorry. The last thing my father, I feel the same way about the title dad, said to me was in a horrible email. He blasted me for changing my last name to my wife’s middle name when I made it legal. 

It’s not like there was a long history. He changed his last name when he was 18. The hypocrisy knows no limits. 

I am proud of you for standing up for yourself. At the end of the day, we are the one person we are with every moment from the day we are born until the day we die. We have to do what is best for ourselves before anyone else.
You’re a good person for standing by your values Penny. I’m sorry they don’t see you as your truest self. Hugs❤️
Don’t worry about using “Dad”.  Set a boundary and plan on never seeing him again.  Toxic is toxic and you don’t have to tolerate it.
I’m so sorry Penny 😿 you’re absolutely right he has to earn the right to be called dad and he is failing in every way possible here but I understand how painful his betrayal of your relationship must be and I’m praying he eventually changes his mindset
He shouldn't dead name you at all that is freaking ridiculous as hell, all you ask for is his respect and he doesn't even give you that period 👏🏳️‍⚧️
This one made me cry. It hits hard because it's so real and so sad. There's way too many stories, just like this, in our community. I've lost almost my entire family since I started living my authentic life. So be it, but it hurts. Hugs to you.
A reminder that you don’t need him or a relationship with him anymore. Maybe that’s more appropriate than just not calling him dad.
Penny is such a beautiful name 🥰 I’m so sorry this happened to you. Sometimes people really show their true colors when under pressure :(
Your right Dad is an earned title and frankly if he won't call you by your name. I'd make one up for him evrey time ""hi Gabe, Charlie, Kyle, Joe, Jim, ect ""
I’m sorry that he betrayed you this way, you deserve better. Penny is a lovely name, and you deserve to be respected.
Don’t respond when he deadnames you
Penny is a lovely name! Stay strong. Chances are your stepfather will actually come around, even if it may take a while.
Hell yeah fuck it up sister 🤘
Terrible things should be let go.
If your mom doesn’t divorce him I am stunned
I’m really sorry you have to loose a parent like that.  I hope that at some point in the future a reconciliation will happen, and he can earn that title back.

I’ve been out of my parents house for a similar time, and I have specifically not invited my parents over to avoid a situation like that.
They should’ve already accustomed by it and be respectful but this on my opinion is disrespectful
The good news is you are allowed to change your entire name at the same time and I don’t believe it’s any bigger a charge. Best of luck Penny, and that’s a great name btw!
I'm so sorry 😞 hugs and healing vibes friend
Penny, if you can move, please move.
That's awful!  I hope you're doing ok.
I'll come fight him but also penny is such a pretty name
I love your name, Penny. If I was a girl, I think I'd like to be named that. It's beautiful and so full of personality!
I am so sorry this happened.... Can you move out??
That was a power play. He did it *because* your mom's boss was over. What kind of power exactly he wanted to demonstrate depends on the details of the situation and his psyche. Regardless, it reveals that if supporting you comes at some kind of perceived social cost, he won't do it.
For what it’s worth: it’s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of. If you find that you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again-F Scott Fitzgerald
Hi penny im really sorry to hear this you don’t deserve that. He doesn’t deserve you calling him dad. Horrific.
It’s crazy how many people, especially family members, just don’t want to change the way they think about you. Sometimes even when they don’t stop you from expressing yourself in your social life or at work, they wish for their house or family related functions to remain some sort of time bubble of the past. Maybe I’m reading too far into things, but you never have to compensate for other people’s refusal of change.
I think your reaction is totally valid. I told my biological parents that I would stop calling them mom and dad if they wouldn’t stop using my deadname.
You are Penny, and you are valid.
I’m so sorry to hear you had to deal with that crap Penny! Sending hugs
They will come around if they truly love you.
I wouldn't even talk to either of them tbh. Did your mom defend you? If she doesn't, she is just as guilty imo.
Passive aggressively dont respond to anything but Penny for awhile and see how he feels then.
People who can't abide by consent in how they treat others forego the ability to engage with those people.
I experienced something similar to that with my parents as well. They were very supportive, but when people we knew would come around or even just put in public sometimes they would refer to me as their son or use he him pronouns. I think it definitely comes from a place of their own insecurities and fears of being judged.

I don’t believe they meant to be harmful, but damn did it hurt.

Sounds like your step father is just a prick though.
i understand, Penny. you do what you need to, and it sounds like this is something you need to do. you got this, honey 💖
My mom tried telling me that. 

I told her she doesn’t own the deed.
No one else can decide what your name is. Sure, they can call you anything that they want, but only you get to say what is respectful.
""Whelp *slaps knees and stands up* looks like I'm not going to be in the house anymore *stepdouche's real name*""
My SIL tried to pull similar shit. She asked my spouse “well what’s on HIS birthday certificate?”

Wife: “F” 

Game set match. 

Get your id changed and laugh at his ass
Create your own happiness hun🏳️‍⚧️🦄

Everything is gonna be allright 💋
Hugs to you Penny. Time to move out. Be safe! This abuse will continue.
I'd respond with ""[name of the person here], You're not me to claim what I go by?""
""You've breached my trust by not respecting who I am. In this house: you're now know as 'mom's boyfriend.""
Proceed the refer to him only as that.
*hugs*I'm sorry to hear that. When I came out to my dad, he acted so supportive and understanding through the whole conversation so by the end when I had left my guard down I got hit with the ""you'll always be mum my baby boy"" line. You definitely deserve better.  And I wish for you to find all the love and support you need going forward. 💗🤍💙
I'm sorry love
Pennie is the name I gave my youngest daughter for her middle name. I love it. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Penny you deserve better.
I'm sorry you had to deal with that, Penny. I had to process my sperm donor not being my father as well (though largely for different reasons of past abuse). It's not easy, and it doesn't need to be about retaliation, it's about how you truly feel about him and working through the grief of that fact.
>I calmly told him, “I go by Penny now.” My stepfather responded by angrily saying, “You go by [DEADNAME] in this house!”

What he's telling you, whether he wants to admit it or not, is that you won't get any respect or autonomy in his house. You go by the name he wants, whether you like it or not, period. You're your own human being, and you get to decide how people address you. If they can't even respect something as small as that, it says way more about them than it does about you
I believe in you Penny ❤️ The nice thing about calling someone dad is that it's not impossible to find another father figure. If you have another person like that in your life (that's a *better* father figure and accepts you) I'd suggest talking to him* about it.

*Assuming other father figure uses he/him pronouns
I am very sorry to hear this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Be strong follow your heart and bless you for all the strength and focus you've shown so far when I was in a very similar situation I never came out and Im paying for not being true to myself now. Fight for whats right because strength in truth is bottomless.
You should give him some time to cool off before u decide for sure. 
It can take ppl alot of time to digest their on transphobia at times. 

Now i only have exprince with my.life and i am not lng in america which means my family hasnt been subjected to that much transphobia from the news. But i still think that love can win over more oftten than not.
Not all battles are worth fighting.. bide your time Tom you are out on your own
[removed]
I do agree with the ""Parents = Title"" Thing tbh. While I refer to no one as my Parents personally, I do agree with the sentiment that it is something that can & should be earned or lost. 

I am sorry you have to go through this, and I wish you the best of results in your Situation. To me, it seems a bit like he may be a bit ashamed to have an openly Trans Family member. Something my Grandma also Struggled with at first but got over relatively quick. 

Just know that *YOU* do not have anything to be ashamed of and didnt do anything wrong. 

I'd suspect He still hasnt gotten over the mindset of Bigotry and shame, thinking that your mom may now Lose her Job or something with an openly Trans family member.  

However, his line was most certainly not okay and what you now feel is justified. He messed up badly.

I feel for you Penny and you have my full Support!

So... I'm a dad. I wouldn't have a care in the world if one of my children changed their first name and/or transitioned. What DID hurt was when, for no reason (in terms of our relationship) one of my sons changed his surname without telling me, let alone consulting me beforehand.

My feeling is, first names are something your parents give you which reflect either their best guess at what will ""fit"" or some name that belongs to a (usually dead) family member. There's every chance that might not feel right as you grow older, for any number of reasons.

But a surname is an unbroken link to the past - to me, to my father (and mother, to a degree, as she took his name as was the custom then) and so on, across centuries and half the world. Repudiating that seems like spitting on the memory of those people. I know my dad, who loved my son more than anyone, would be heartbroken were he still alive.

I also know that he, like me, would have embraced a change of first name, and transition, as merely part of a journey by someone we love.

I'm really sorry your dad can't see the difference 😓
Trans guy here! I think you are in the right, but also of you believe that you should change your last name fo it. You do not deserve to bare the name of someone who will never know you simply because they choose not to, you shouldn't have to have the name of a man who became a failure to you.
Wait, he did this in front of your mom's boss? That's super problematic and he could put her time at whatever her job is at risk they don't share your father's values. Especially since you're an adult, and you are allowed to do what you want without your family's input, that was incredibly immature of your not-dad to do considering the circumstances.  


Don't call him dad, you're right to do so. Parents don't do that to their kids, not the real ones, no matter what age they are. If your mother respects you for you, your mother's maiden name can work, but if it's a whole family issue, don't be afraid to explore the wide world of names. I actually regret keeping my mother's last name, even though she's not transphobic (mostly), because if it were entirely my choice, I woulda made the whole thing fantastical.
For us, we don't consider our sperm donor that title either, for a different reason but still. Really glad to see you're on that same decision!
We don't even say ""I love you"" back because honestly he doesn't deserve it 🤷🏻‍♀️

We're honestly beginning to just start absolutely correcting tf out our sperm donor when he says our dead name. Either by just introducing ourselves by our name, or something else.

But good job!
-🗝️ Maddie
Sorry. Start calling him “Turd,” and when he asks why say, “cause it’s not your name, but it’s how I want to perceive you.”
Hunger games
Pick a name of the day for him... only ones as wildly different than his actual name as humanly possible. Bonus points if it sounds demeaning or childish. Maybe throw a ""little"" in front of it for good measure.  


""I think little Timmy is still fiddling in the garage with whatever"".
don't call him dad ever again, call him step-douche lol
Penny I'm so sorry your stepfather, is treating you like this. 

What does your mum think of what happened if you've talked to her about it.
I made myself homeless immediately after I came out to my mother and saw how she reacted. I'd rather be homeless than live with bigotry. Anyways for me it worked out, I stayed at a friends place for a month and then found an apartment and a new job...
From one stepfather to another - it’s Penny you fuck.

(You have to show him this or it doesn’t work.)

Accept your daughter for who she is, or I will fight you. 

(Mention I’m big and strong)

Help, don’t hurt. It’s not hard. Don’t lose a daughter over meaningless nonsense. 

(Note: I will 100% fight him, but I don’t like to go anywhere that’s too hot, so we might have to work out a location.)

I’m sorry this happened, Penny.
Penny: In this house you’ll go by any name I choose until you say mine! And they’ll all be very girly until you do
I’m guessing sperm+ egg donors in this case doesn’t refer to people helping you get your baby?
me too!
Or Karen.
It’s the plan once the place I’m moving to is ready
My grandmother is 98. I told her once and she's gotten it right ever since. Being old is not an excuse.
But how the hell would anyone not realize that that's disgustingly hurtful?
stay toxic
Yes
I've considered that with my uncle lol. I know what he would've been named if he were born female. (For context he's angrily forcing his whole household including my 11yo and 5yo cousins to call me my dead name/no longer legal name. The 5yo is super confused and asks my sister about her brother(ftm) and when my sis isn't there asks my mom about my sister's brother. She doesn't know who [deadname] is and doesn't seem to know my name. 11yo feels guilty for calling me my deadname but knows she'd get in trouble if she didn't)
No we use it as a way to refer to people who created our bodies but don't deserve the title of parents
I found this funnier than I probably should have.
Well that’s certainly true, it isn’t and he’s in the wrong. Still op shouldn’t do anything that she might regret. Everyone comes around eventually in time.
Old men are generally more stubborn than normal. I think he just needs more time or maybe it has to do with his religious beliefs. Deadnaming is a hurtful thing to do to a trans person. But saying someone that adopted and raised you is no longer your father just because he deadname you is a little to harsh. There are a lot worst dad than him. Like getting disowned by your dad for being trans.

I’m sorry. Ugh that must be so frustrating and terrifying for them. I’m sure they’ve all wondered whether they would be safer if they escaped him. People that bigoted often aren’t as kind in other aspects of life as they let on nor are they as gentle physically to their family. There’s gonna be a reckoning one day where we all just recognize those that are bigoted in our countries are so dangerous in other ways that the problems we face would be better without them here. Like how often it is climate deniers are various amounts of bigots or pandemic deniers. And we would have far less inertia to problem solving this all if they suddenly passed away in the middle of the night with noooooooooo previous health problems nor any sudden accidents
Yep, i guessed right :)
No they don't.

Plenty of people would rather die than ""come around"" and it's not OP's responsibility to wait around for him to respect her.
I would just call him mom if he refuses to call me what I wanted lol
You don't get to police other people's standards, nor do you get to decide who deserves not to be called 'dad'. Also, trying to force someone to identify a certain way is not just deadnaming, but straight up identity erasure. That's toxic, and a person who does that to theirchild does not deserve their child. (edited for spelling) (edited again for mistakes when editing)
> There are a lot worst dad than him. Like getting disowned by your dad for being trans.

It's not a fucking competition - just because other people have it worse doesn't mean you get to invalidate OPs problems or try and absolve her bigoted stepdad. Read the room, ffs.
Currently only because I’m waiting for my cousin to get the basement ready for me to move into their place.
Lol Fair point
I’m not policing anyone, nor am I’m deciding for them. People can do what they want. Yes he’s a toxic person sure, but there are worst things a parent can do to you than just deadnaming. It’s not like he forced her to leave unless she obeyed by his rules, or anything.
>, but there are worst things a parent can do to you than just deadnaming.

the dreaded question (school survey, I'm closeted)		"At least trans woman and trans man aren't on the list. That bugs me
But I wanna give them a LOT of credit - this is one of the first times I've ever seen this question implemented correctly. So, you know, bravo.
Thank god it doesn’t say transgender without an option for the gender or, “not interested” without the “in answering”
“Prefer to Self-Describe” and “Non-Binary” are definitely two options I remember were not present when I was in high school, to be fair. In my opinion, circumstantially, the need or want of that information should be questioned more than one’s gender.
i'm guessing it isn't anonymous then?

i guess you could say prefer not to say, and like make a joke about it if someone asks follow up questions?
Prefec no to Say is good option
“Prefer not to say” is usually the best option
This is just making me grafteful I started questioning at the end of highschool.
these options are very considerate! im glad to see this more often 

however, i do understand how its difficult to answer when youre closeted
We just had a very similar thing. I would have loved to put female (I’m transfem) but there were a ton of people sitting around me.
Where is the “Dawg I’m just as confused as you” option
If you get enough other people to answer order not to say it makes the question useless for outing people right?

Like if only a few people answered prefer not to say then the school could be like aha! Those are the closeted trans kids! But if dozens of hundreds did it then it be like finding a needle in a haystack.
I identify as Nunya. My pronouns are “nunya” and “business”. Respect the identity I outwardly project.
If its a school survey, it's either anonymous or you can plead ignorance. So pick what you want. If it comes back later on and you aren't ready to come out, just react like 'what? I didn't say that. Really? That's what they have marked down?' Ignorance is a great defiance, especially for online questionaries' where the choices are close together.
It is by far the most dreaded question ever
If it's an anonymous survey, be honest.
Arghhh they're doing so well and this is one of the best ones I've seen so far but they've made the very common and very annoying mistake of listing 'male' and 'female' as genders.
With the way things are going in the US I think everybody should answer prefer not to say. Nothing good comes from people making lists and it's even worse when you put yourself on it.
I’m bisexual female and I always say prefer not to say just so it A screws with their data, but B if they track it back to me somehow it’s hard to confirm the information I have given! ❤️ best of luck!
The streaming service, run by the biggest company in my country, that I work for has the question “are you a male or a female?” with the options: male, female, both, rather not say, other.
Well, if you're closeted, ""Prefer not to say"" is probably most accurate, right? Alternatively, if you feel the need to fly completely under the radar, pick the gender you were assigned at birth. You can always ""come out"" later, when you're ready.

Also, this is probably the best way this question can possibly be asked. Well done to your school for this.
To this day I love putting prefer not to say anytime its available, including sexuality and race, just to fuck with them :)
I have an idea for these gender questions how does this sound?

'___________________________________________________________

What is your gender?

Male

Female

Nonbinary (Then a drop down menu appears that says):
Common nonbinary identities:

Agender

Androgyne

Bigender

Demi-boy

Demi-girl

Gender fluid

Gender neutral

Gender queer

Pangender

Other (Prefer to self describe)

Prefer not to say



'___________________________________________________________


That way it normalizes and allows people to categorize and gather data on specific nonbinary identities, normalizes them, and allows people with those identities to feel more represented.
You could be me, I realized I was Transfem after I took a survey similar to this one and now I'm stuck as a male because I don't know if I can change it.
If it’s anonymous who cares?
At least they are trying 😭
Hit prefer to self describe and type in “fuck you” ❤️
Personally I prefer the form:

1
0
X
?
!
⚠️TRIGGERED WARNING. ☢️ 



but Before I knew myself I’d always get in trouble cuz I’d put.   “ makes you wander don’t it “ 
Like I always hated these I’d cry on my free time or something  what was I to put , back then tho where just 2 male or female and I didn’t feel like either at the time I normally hung out with the emo and scene kids
But why is non-binary the ""third gender""?
Aren't these surveys anonymous?

I always answered female for some reason 🤠 (I'm transfem) 

Even when I was in an ""all boys"" class
is this anonymous?
Yeah I really dislike those :) I usually just pick prefer not to say when I can
Prefer not to say!
put in prefer not to say, if they question it tell them its none of their business.
a lot of these are usually anonymous so it shouldnt be too bad at least!
Where is the, ""none of your goddamm business!"" selection?
So I work with this data daily as a program evaluator. Please tell us how to ask this question. We use a bunch of different approaches but from the comments here there seem to be issues with many that we also run into. If you aren't comfortable answering the question, don't!
I put prefer not to say or female
either you chose the gender you identify as, choose your biological gender or you choose prefer not to say 🤷‍♂️

edit: of course it’s not that easy but there’s not really anything else you could do.
Still better than my school, they only allow Male or Female.
For real
I thought this was a poll or something so wanted to awnser female. Also if your nervous just click the prefer not to awnser option
Holy... you guys get more than two options? I'm from central Florida and I've only ever seen two genders offered on these kind of surveys.
All of the above
yeah, that bugs me too. it kind of seems like theyre trying to seperate trans and cis people of the same gender
We havw this sort of school survey every year. First time i took it i noticed the lack of options. So i sent a VERY angry email, while keeping it professional and such of course. And the next term when we took it again they had changed it! I was soo happy. Since this survey was from an outside company. Aka all the high schools in my country uses it. So i felt like i actually made a positive change. Someone, somewhere, probably really appreciated the added ""Other"" option, and that made me happy c:
Yeah, I went off at my last study place..
Male / Female only. I couldn’t find a place to enter Go f…k yourselves. Only tick boxes 😠
Last time I was in school they never asked about gender. Your sex was what you were registered with and that never changed. I didn't know a single trans person, I didn't even know it was possible till so much later in life.
I’ve seen some that look like this, but wow lots are hilariously bad.  

I think I might have locked myself out of the cashew app…either ir sucks for everyone, or it’s not liking my choices and thinks I’m “lying”.
I mean, it’s de least thing they could do. We soudn’t have to be thankful for people to respect and validate our existence because it’s how things should be always for everyone but yeah, feels good to be seen :)
Oh, I'm interested in answering with not interested.
There is plenty of good reason to collect information such as this. We are in a revolution of collecting gendered data, and hopefully it will reverse alot of the damages done by building a system on systemic sexism. I learned that seatbelts were designed around the male body, meaning they are less effective at saving women!! Op said this was a school survey, and differences in rates of learning and emotional development are coming to the forefront of educational policies.
""What are you, a cop?"" is always a funny response to any personal question you don't want to answer!
That's what I did prefer not to say. Since it is visible to others I couldn't out what I really wanted but at least I didn't want to put the one I hated. My friends who are in the conservative side thought that I was making a statement and loved it 🤭so I didged all billets.
Yeahhh i had one of those recently and I only really dared to click ""prefer not to say"" because I heard a classmate say that he was clicking that option bc it's none of their business

(Not a w for him btw, he's fallen down the alt-right pipeline *bad* )
If it was anonymous I would be honest but its not lol
Most of the multiple chpice question had 5 options so I think the program restricted them to 5.
They are not anonymous
No
I'm in California so that's probably why
If ""cute girl"" was on the list, that's my identity lol
Well cis and trans people are different and I think we as trans people should appreciate that we are trans instead of trying to be mad that we are not cis gender
Good for you, making positive change in the world!
Only marginally better is male female transgender, which were the only options for a government funded research participation site. I guess if trans is gender neutral, it’s basically nb, right?
🥺
Yep. Sounds like my experience.
I am willing to entertain that perspective, given more data as to what the survey was covering specifically.
*yells that at the survey on the computer screen* 🤣
ayyyyy
My gender is baddie
Snowflake is no snowflake. This BAMF knows how to get it done."	11s6lx6	trans	957	0.99	2023-03-15 19:30:00
"How does ""Good Girl!"" make you feel?"	"This question is for all identities:

How do you react internally to being told, ""Good Girl!""? 

I know a number of MTF who shiver at the words, being internally touched in ways that they cannot express. Especially the ones who have some submissive tendencies.

For me, on one hand I like having my gender acknowledged. On the other hand, I am a grown woman and can feel infantalized by the words.

For AFAB, I could imagine some people absolutely hating the words as being dismissive of non-female parts of their identity. On the other hand... years of experience can be pretty hard to break, and the rush of brain chemistry from feeling that one has pleased parents / adults could potentially trigger complicated feelings of simultaneous reward while hating that the words leave you feeling that way?"	"Well, maybe not “girl”, but “boy” in my case…

It’s incredibly patronizing and infantilizing. Makes me feel like a stupid little kid. And I’m not. I’m a grown ass adult.

I mean I got a nice, healthy praise kink but even then my girlfriend would have to be the only one saying it. *That* would be great.

Anyone else? At any other time?

Absolutely not.
Depends on who's saying it.
As someone who is a sub, and a trans woman hearing it honestly is wonderful, but, only from my partner. If anyone else were to say it to me it comes off as gross, creepy, and yes, infantilizing.
to me it sounds patronising af 🤷🏻‍♀️
Trans guy here. ""Good girl"" is a giant dose of dysphoria in a handy package. No thank you!

I'm not fond of ""good boy"" either, fwiw. I'm 42 years old and it's very patronising.
As someone AFAB, if someone called me ""good girl"" I would projectile vomit on them and immediately ask them to leave and never come back. ""Good boy"" is less offensive but still patronizing. I am an adult. There are way better ways to praise someone.
I mean if it's from a good friend/partner and it's like a kink thing or just words of endearment, then I love it, it makes me melt and blush.

If it's from some random then it's patronizing and infantile. Just ...no

Same kinda thing when someone calls me ""mommy"". If it's a friend or partner then fuck yeah I love it cuz I'm a motherly person

If it's from some random it grossed me tf out. So I guess it just depends
I get told that by my electrolysist, it's feels like a good gesture to me. She's just trying to voice some support I don't see anything more to it. It's just appreciated.
I mean, what am I? A dog?
Trans man and no, throughout my whole life ""good girl"" has never given me any sort of positive reinforcement. Rather, it has always felt like an insult and even before I had the words to express it, it just felt wrong, insulting. My brain never connected it to any positive feedback loop. Towards my teens, the feeling of being patronizing and infantilizing were added on top of the general insulting and wrongness.

Now, if we're talking about ""good boy"" that's something different. Probably because I do have some pup tendencies. But even that depends solely on who is saying it. My partner? Fuck yeah I'm a good boy! Someone in the grocery store after I helped an old lady reach something? Hell no.

So all in all, ""good girl/boy"" should mostly always be between partners, if it has been deemed okay. It's far safer always to just opt for ""good job"" or something akin to that instead. It's a slippery slope when it comes down to it.
I think it's a combo of things that makes subbie bottom trans girls light up. There just happens to be a lot of subbie bottom trans girls
I would be absolutely disgusted
Realizing I liked being called good girl instead of good boy in audios was one of the most important things for me in realizing I was trans. It was the first time I had been called female, even if it was just from audios.
As a FTM, I’d stab them.
I'm trans masc,

it makes me feel icky and uncomfortable, it's kinda creepy and really dysphoric
As an ftm trans guy, good girl makes me upset. I like “good boy” but only when it’s from someone I trust who I don’t feel like is mocking me
From a partner, lovely, from anyone else, restraining order.
As an afab not completely binary trans man? I hate it (towards me). It's always been uncomfortable to hear even as a kid when I was still a girl. Patronizing, uncomfortable, makes me feel like I'm seen as less than an adult human - as if I'm being treated like a dog. Now, it tacks on dysphoria too.
It makes me extremely uncomfortable. I feel like I'm being talked down too. I'm not 9 years old
To me it really matter not just who is saying it but how it's being said. Just blurted out is not going to do it but softly in response to something with a praising tone makes my heart flutter
ha, i'm binary trans ftm and i would probably strangle anyone who called me a good girl :)

i accept 'girl' in the gay way, though.
trans man here. makes me skin crawl. dysphoria plus the feeling of being patronized/talked down to. ""good boy"" tho feels almost as bad to me, bc it feels infantilizing, and people really love to infantilize trans men.
Great when my girlfriend says it to me but when my dad says it then its just really creepy. I haven’t heard it from anyone else but if I do it’s probably just going to make my skin crawl.
My mother never called me ""good girl"" in any way that I would have internalized as real praise.

&#x200B;

I personally get a hell of a lot more validation out of my lover calling me a good boy - as long as he doesn't overdo it.
If you like being called a good girl that’s all that matters. I personally feel VERY happy as a trans woman with a more submissive nature, it feels warm and caring to me, and there’s nothing wrong with it. I guess it’s not for everyone giving the comments and that’s also fine. We are humans and complexity is part of our nature.
FTM here. I hate it. Even if it was “good boy” it would still cringe.
I’m a trans guy, my grandma says “good girl” whenever I do chores or something. I hate it every single time, makes my skin crawl in the worst way, but she’s never gonna understand the trans stuff lol
Uh I would hate ""Good Girl"" but ""good boy"" would be fine by me because I'm so depraved of validation lmao
I love it, haven’t had much experience with it and not really a lot of bad experiences either so for me it’s basically just a phrase that makes me feel euphoric🥰
Yeahhhhh it makes me shiver🤷🏼‍♀️
I would punch anyone random who called me a good girl or boy.

However if my boyfriend called me a good boy and we were getting it on it would make me very happy (I have a kink 🤷‍♂️)
Trans fem here, it'd have to be my partner saying it. No one else.
Depends on the situation for me I guess, in intimate situations I want to be a good girl though
Depends. If it’s on queer Reddit, then it makes me kinda happy. If someone I met on the street said it, yikes. I don’t have a partner but I suspect that I’m subby and would definitely like getting that from a girlfriend.
I love it, I may have no gender but I am still a good girl
Yeah I'm sorry but no amount of socialization can make good girl a pleasant thing to hear. I think some trans fems can get joy from it because of how a lot of trans people want those childhood experiences that align with their identities that they could never get before, however I think most people would cringe at it instantly. I'm not even completely a man, as I'm genderfluid, but even on my fem days I absolutely hate that phrase because it's so objectifying and feels disgusting. The absolute only time I'd be ok with that directed towards me would be in a more sexual atmosphere where it's clear that phrase isn't meant as a genuine ""compliment"" or statement, and is only being used as a kind of dirty talk (I just happen to be into a bit of masochistic type kinks so yeah this is definitely an exception to my normal comfort zone). I really don't think any trans masc afab people would seriously be happy with that phrase towards them unless they're going through some mental health issues and in that situation it really isn't healthy since it's someone degrading themselves.
I realized I had a praise kink because someone called me it. So…I kind of like it.
I'm a little weird about this. I'm at a point where sexually I'm ok enough with my body to have sex. So in that context being called a ""good girl"" turns me on. I'm a total sub so that's why. But outside of that I might slap someone.
'Good girl' (or 'good boy' for that matter) sounds more akin to how you might talk to your pet dog rather than a person. So suffice to say I'd feel super uncomfortable.
Transguys🤝transgals:
Feeling patronized all the time
FtM here. I think if someone called a ""good girl"" I would shrivel up and die on the spot. That's gross and dehumanizing, the only thing that you should call a good girl is a dog. I hate ""good boy"" for the same reason, but good girl especially feels insulting, like it's just another variation of ""trans men are just exotic girls who need to be taught their place.""
I'm a tran WOMAN, a whole ass adult, thanks.
Belittled
Ftm here
I hate it now and didn't like it before
AFAB here, I feel sick. Just straight up sick to my stomach lmao.
I like being called a girl way more then being called a woman... I didn't get to be a girl and I dont feel like a conplete adult yet so I dont want that put on me yet.
Obviously good girl feels amazing coming from the right person, but weird af from the wrong
A random stranger? Hell no.  


An S/O? ***please yes***
It feels sexual to me, which will kinda make me cringe if someone says it to me, but to each their own.
Like you said, i shiver from excitement but only if my best friend calls me that :3
I myself am AFAB transmasc and you seem to actually have a pretty decent understanding of how it would make us (or at least me) feel. It can kind of make my skin crawl because of the “girl” part but the positive response to being praised is hard to overcome lol.
Good girl is uncomfy for me because I'm a dude but I like good boy only when my boyfriend calls me that (i am openly into pet play and have a praise kink)
I would feel a little creeped out, honestly. I'm 38 years old.
If saud by someone I like in the right context, then I'll just melt.
Otherwise,  the person is going to remember that they shouldn't mess with me
Not a fan
as mtf I personally love it from my gf, also when gordon ramsay says it on tv it makes me feel things
To me its patronizing and uncomfortable
Context matters here I'd say a random stranger going good girl out of the blue and my hypothetical girlfriend doing it illicit entirely different reactions in my mind. On the one hand it's like yay getting gendered correctly and what a creep with the first.  I'm not going to explain my reaction to the second but it's different to the first
I love it but only in a sexual context. Otherwise It’s demeaning
No
feels amazing if its coming from someone of significance to me or it has no malicious intent. from someone i dont know or something it sounds dusgusting.
absolutely not, being transmasc. though “good boy” id enjoy, only from someone I’d be involved with though
It nakes me giddy and giggly
I'm one of those trans girls becuase it's the nuclear option for me, it just shuts down all higher brain fuction. A friend of mine found out that it's my ""kill switch"" and is merciless sometimes, though honestly I do not mind :)
I'm a cis ally AFAB, it makes me feel like a dog or like I'm being creeped up
I don't like it from anybody but my boyfriend.

He's the only person allowed to say stuff like that to me.

""Good girl"",""pretty girl"",etc

It makes me feel nice ig

But from anyone else I hate it
If anybody tells me I'm a good girl I feel kinda disgusted. But if my gf calls me good girl it takes me to a sub set of mind
I like it when it’s my girlfriend saying it
It’s lovely if it’s from a partner
I’m AFAB Genderfluid. I hate it because it sounds really condescending.
From my partner?  Yes please, literally all the time.  


From stangers on the internet in the jokey tone on r/traa or r/egg_irl? yeah sure, kinda fun and cute  


From literally anyone else? never
Given my history with the fetish scene and how I've spent the last year+ trying to distance myself from it, the words creep me out. Just... no. Please, just don't.
FtM, sick dysphoria, would stab.

Good boy might be a turn on with a trusted partner in a very specific setting, but not in any other context. I'm 31, a grown ass man.
Grown woman. I don't like it in such a casual fashion. My Dom(me) saying it would be very different, but that's the point. On the daily I'm not a submissive little patronized thing, I'm an independent woman and I don't need this sort of talk.
OMG. I RELATE TO THE BEING TOUCHED IN WAYS I CANT EXPLAIN THING. It’s in a good way. It can make me feel a bit on the horny side I’ll admit.   But god yes I love being called good girl.  I’m mtf so I guess it makes since.
not my thing
Anyone trying to call me a ""good girl"" can wash their damn mouths out with soap. I'm not a dog, or a toddler. You wouldn't call an adult cis woman ""good girl"" unless you're a) doing kink stuff or b) hoping for a sternly worded letter from HR.
i need it to be said to he me even tho i’m straight male
I love it
I like it personally UwU
if anyone told me that it would sound predatory af
AFAB nonbinary person. Feels very dismissive and sarcastic to me.
I’m cis woman and 9/10 times it makes me want to tell the person to fuck right off. The only time it’s ok is in a joking context with a loved one.
I hate it, I am not a girl and never will be and feel uncomfortable being referred to as anything remotely ""woman""
Good boy makes me happy and I'm young and also really love affirming words and just kind words I get so happy when people say nice things
I don't feel anything tbh, maybe bc english is not my 1st language so I didn't grow up hearing or seeing this around
Dehumanizing :/
being called a good girl, even girl alone makes me happy
As a trans girl I fucking love it
As a trans guy, ""good girl"" is just- no. Instant dysphoria inducer (+creepy points if it's from someone other than my parents). As for ""good boy"", I only like it when my gf says it, anyone else and it's, again, creepy as hell (not counting my parents here cause I don't think they would ever see me that way tbh)
transmasc here, i absolutely despise being called a good girl for obvious reasons lol. sucks because my mother calls me it all the time :/
good boy on the other hand? acceptable, but only when my partners use it
I don't like good girl, as I'm not a girl, but good boy is so nice for me. I did some good thing and get praised for that. I like that. It's validation plus I barely ever get praised, so combining both of these and meaning it makes me so so happy. But it really strongly depends on how it's used. I don't want people to say it in a sexual way or anything. Just... A way to praise me. Like ""well done. Good boy."" 

I don't know if any of this makes sense lol.


Edit: or also just in a ""good person"" way. ""I like you, you're a very good human, plus you're a boy. So good boy."" That's good too for me.

Edit 2: I'm also not very much of an adult. Not a child, but I'm not very old and try to catch up on my childhood, had to grow up too fast. Anything that makes me feel like a little kid makes me happy, really.
I’m 19. It’s very affirming when older people say it, and for me personally men that I respect saying it gives me butterflies.

I can see how anyone older would feel infantilized though.
If my boyfriend says it, its a warm heartouching fuzzy experience. Friends it’s fairly similar, but anyone else I don’t really wanna hear it from.
Depends on whos saying it.

Girlfriend says it to me and I love it, only good vibes.

When the old creepy cis white dude at the Starbucks I used to work at said it when I filled his coffee cup a little extra (cuz the batch was older and was about to dump it) I just about jumped out of my skin and wanted to beat his ass lmao
I'm a top, so it doesn't affect me.
For me it depends on who’s saying it. If my boyfriend said it, I’d be very happy. If anyone else said it I’d feel like I was either being sexualized or I was being treated like a child. It doesn’t help I’m autistic and constantly feel like people treat me like a kid because of it.
It's kinda patronizing but I like it cos I was not able to experience this when younger
It makes me feel amazing but in the back of my head i know it's kinda weird and patronizing
gives me the creeps so hard, I immediately distrust anyone that uses it. same goes for people that use tildes or the ~ symbol. in my experience it’s always been a flag for the kind of person they are, which isn’t usually good
It’s a mixed bag. I’ll usually get euphoric from being gendered correctly, but then get a little weirded out and uncomfortable, especially if the context is in a dominant to submissive tone which it is most of the time.
It depends on context. I've had some cringy experiences with older trans women using ""good girl"" towards in a weird tone-deaf affirmation that I never asked for (and I get really queezy around the word ""girl"" if not used as a way to punctuate a sentence ie ""girl, get over here"" since I'm 6'5"") and while well-meaning came off really bizarre.  


I always think ""atta girl"" always sounds a million times better because it's sounds more empowering. I don't care about being ""good.""
Depends on the situation, during sex fucking please but I'm also submissive with a praise kink. At work or a stranger says it they can fuck right off with that shit.
Depends how it's being used. I like it in some contexts, hate it in most.
Heavily context dependant. If some random person saying it then I can’t help but feel odd, it just comes off as weird. If it’s my partner then yea, makes me feel very nice 👍
When I came out as trans mtf one of close friends said that to me and it gave me the shivers (in a good way) it really made me happy. It really helps me especially because at the moment I really struggle to feel happy because I'm really aware of my body when I try to put on a dress.
I love being called a good girl, always make me so euphoric
I like it if someone i'm romantically involved with calls me a ""good girl"" but otherwise it feels weird or creepy.
Confused  but I'm also still in the questioning phase
Am Demi-boy but would still love it
i’m genderfluid, so i don’t mind being called good girl/boy. but only from my partner. in any other context or person it makes me laugh lmao.
I think the context and the person who says it are important to consider
It make euphoric af
It depends on the context. If you know me and know what I'm like? Dope. If you're a stranger? Die.
""Good Girl"", to me, is a good source kf euphoria

And the people who say it to me mean it in a way where it makes me happy

So yeah, it makes me feel like my gender is being acknowledged like crazy
I’m a transmasc and good boy is one of my favorite things to hear my girlfriend say to me but I could understand why it feels patronizing to some
In 99.9% of settings it makes me fucking puke. I’m an educated grown ass woman don’t belittle me like that. 

In the bedroom with a muscly, tattooed, gorgeous man caressing my face, I might just melt into a puddle right then and there.
Good girl or Good boy to me sounds creepy and it is like I'm being talked to as if a child or a dog. I wouldn't want anybody to say this to me.
Depends on how it's used. If i just got you a drink or something you asked for and you call me good girl it's good vibes i get all tingly and go home thinking about said person. If I'm hanging out with you and you gib head pats and say good girl out of the blue great vibes and i will definitely talk it you more often than most people. Getting called good girl in a condescending way is a mixed bag. For example ""you're a good girl, you'll go do ____ for me"" that's like, what if i don't want to. Am i a bad girl? I like being called a good girl as much as the next mf but i might not wanna be your good girl. 

Context matters. There's the tingly one where it's a sort of reward or just out of appreciation for something, the I'm beat red ""stop ittt"" in my head I'm like ""i wanna kiss Thai person so bad"" type good girl usage. Like when you're laying on your friends couch after doing them a favor and they pat you on the head and say ""good girl""

It really works best in the context of someone with the OO mommy thing going on. Still love being called good girl most the time. I have a good story about me getting called a good girl but this is getting really long
As a now trans masc and is a sub, I used to enjoy it, I now enjoy being called “good boy” but only by my partner.

Anyone else calling me that would feel absolutely weird.
If it's from my SO it makes me feel gooey and warm inside, but from literally anyone else it's hella creepy!

Also I'm MtF
Great
Would be weird from a stranger, but very good from a romantic partner
I love it... but only when my partner says it to me

(A Transfem)
i absolutely love it if it’s from someone i like.
a mix of contempt, with happiness emerging a few seconds later
im a trans man and i love it! id obviously change the gender around but if its anyone other than my parter, no thanks. also i only like it in sexual situations, otherwise its weird
When I hear that or “little girl”, it triggers that I wanna sucker punch you so hard rn response
Good BOY makes me so happyyyyyyyy 
-ftm
i like being called ""good girl"" if its from people i know and like. it makes me feel fuzzy inside, from a stranger it would be weird and gross

""good boy"" on the other hand feels degrading and dehumanizing no matter who says it
in a kink context i like it outside that it ain't for me.
I'm not a fan. It doesn't match with my gender identity and, even if it does, it makes me feel like a dog or a child instead of an adult. I can see how it might be really affirming or loving for some people, but I'm not interested in it!
I kinda like it a little?? I'm ftm, I don't really hate it but I don't really like it either
Please I’m beggin
It gives me the happ
It makes me feel gross and infantalized. In a consensual sexual setting, I might be okay with that, but not by anyone else or any other situation.
Queer people can say this to me and I melt into a happy, blushing puddle. Anyone else and I hate it.
Depends on the context and how in the mood I am, sometimes it can light my fire, other times it sounds lame as hell, if not creepy and gross.
I definitely prefer more dominating names such as ""mommy"" and such, but ""good girl"" is an amazing term that does also definitely help with dysphoria.
Depends

Boyfriend: HELL YEA

Anyone else: ehhhhhhh
I find it generally infantilising - it won't grind my gears as much if another trans woman says it because there is a degree of tenderness and belonging that I perceive. Anyone else and they are getting a earful.
I like it when it’s said by the right people
As an MtF, I absolutely melt when I'm called a good girl. I know I shouldn't. I know it's patronizing. My wife hates being called that. But it's so affirming for me. If someone calls me a good girl, especially in the right context, I will absolutely melt in their arms...
I get a rush of joy if someone calls me a good girl, I'm mtf btw
I am so kinky that this is only something I am comfortable hearing in the bedroom. 

However when it said to me yes butterflies I love it affirm my gender and tell me that I'm good at something I'm into both
Honestly really good
Depends on who is saying it and how, as well as what exactly the situation is.
im iffy with the comment. if it comes from my s/o it's ok but anyone else it makes physically gag.
I love it!!! 🥰🥰💕💕💕💕
Feels good, especially if it's whispered into my ear from behind.
Depends on who it is
I don’t like being told ‘Good girl’ but I love ‘Good boy’. More gender euphoria for me.
I liked it for one second for when I was experimenting, afterwards it felt infantilizing, and it makes me very uncomfortable.
i mean if someone called me good boy i’ll be weirded out. but if im horny… i might be turned on a little LMAOAOAO
I don't like it unless I have a partner & they were to tell me that. Otherwise it's really creepy. Especially if a man were to ever say it to me.
Love it.
It depends on who says it to me! If it’s a friend I freeze and laugh, if it’s my girlfriend, EJARKIEMNDHSHD, and if it’s a stranger…please don’t-
If it's not sexual or demeaning, I wouldn't mind!
in th context I hear it, I don't give a fuck it's not who I identify as. I say a lotta stuff I don't mean in that space, it's just hot
I LOVE it. It makes me red in the face and yes I’m 100% submissive too. I can’t resist almost melting every time someone says that to me.
I love it when my wife and I are making love. Any other time, it would be cringy.
Good girl always made me feel childish. While I am considered a “childish” person, I am not. I am enthusiastic and not afraid to have dumb interests or do silly things. I don’t think I’d like to be called Good Boy either, likely only by my SO but in a non-weird way just “heh good boi”. 

TLDR: Being called good girl or good boy makes me feel like I’m not being taken seriously.
Im still exploring my gender identity, but I am AMAB and plan to Chemically Transition but continue to identify as male? Im still figuring things out.

""Good girl"" were my first words actually, and to this day I melt when they are spoken in my direction. I don't find really any euphoria from She/Her pronouns, but something about ""good girl/boy"" Is very euphoric for me. The best way i can explain is that its like confirmation that I am expressing a gender correctly and its being recognized, acknowledged, and im being praised for it. I grew up dealing with emotional neglect in a very sexist house as a boy, so im usually pretty shook when im validated that way.
Depends a lot on who says it, but if it's someone very close to me, I absolutely love it
It makes me feel cute
I'm genderfluid and although I'm Intersex, I was assigned female at birth and I get told this almost daily. It gives me so much dysphoria. It hurts. I want people to stop telling me this. It also just feels wrong, especially since I'm an adult. Even my girlfriend doesn't like it unless I'm the one calling her that in a very specific setting.
I only like it in a sexual setting, but it’s platonic for some people and I get that, it’s perfectly fine to like it in different contexts that vary person to person.
fucking awesome
Depends on the context, how it’s said, and the gender that I am at that given moment
I makes me feel dysphoric and uncomfortable
Entirely depends who's saying it.

A guy, creepy as fuck and make me want to run.

Girl, well depending on how well I knew her, but I'd feel kinda nice.
Even ""good boy"" is too weird tbh. Like, I'm not a dog.
AFAB here. I always get annoyed when someone calls me a good girl mainly because that would be something you would say to a dog, and I’m not a dog ;-;
Depends who says it I guess. With my mom? Even though I don't like being called a girl it's usually used to praise me for improving with my anxiety or my social interaction which makes me feel pretty good. With anyone else? No no no- just no lol
Nothing is more euphoric than my wife calling me a good girl and patting my head...
Very contextual. It would be weird and make me really uncomfortable with any scenario I can think of outside a relationship. I’m pretty subby though, so if a guy I was with said it, it would be totally different.
I absolutely hate my birth gender(female), so being called good girl will drive me crazy, good boy however, I love that.
As a trans man damn good girl makes my skin crawl and die. Good boy I’m neutral about it due to my age.
As a trans man? Dislike. Good boy however, that gets me.
I mean I get it but it is infantilizing so idk how to feel about it
👉👈 headpats pwease.
If someone calls me good girl and I don't really know that person really well, it will come off as creepy.
I would only accept it from a S/O, not some random person.
I think it’s a little weird from random reddit people, i’d let my s.o call me it though
It very much depends on who is saying it and in what context. Said at the wrong time and/or by the wrong person it can feel patronizing and infantilizing. But said at the *right* time by the *right* person and suddenly it feels extremely nice
If it is said by a partner it makes me melt into a puddle of happiness.
Anyone else and I cringe violently.
Only from my bsf
Otherwise it makes me uncomfortable asf
As a transfem demigirl, it makes me feel all cure and fuzzy inside, though I usually prefer calling others good girls, cos they deserve it more than I do.

Edit: important sidenote: I only feel this way when I put myself In a position to be susceptible to it, and thus implicitly consent to it. To me, it lies somewhere between friendly and intimate, so being called a good girl out of nowhere buly someone I don't know does nothing for me, and is kinda infantilising
I'm an MTF Sub Bottom girly girl that loves being pampered and stuff like that, but honestly, it's a little weak. Maybe I just hear it a lot or because it's so generic but when someone says ""Good Girl"" to me, it makes me happy sure cause they complimented me but no more than someone saying ""Good Job"" or ""Thank You"".  If someone really wanted to make me light up it would need to be something more specific or direct or that sounds more honest and genuine or something.

&#x200B;

Unless it's said in a deep voice by someone attractive in a sexual way, then it make head empty no thoughts.
Please Excuse me as I get through the day with this serotonin.
In a play situation or from play partners it is absolutely tingle inducing
I like being told it by my girlfriend but if anyone else were to say it I think I would be tempted to slap them.
for me, it’s a great feeling. however i feel much the same from ‘good boy’, i’m genderfluid and both feel nice

edit: only from people i’m close with. anyone else and it’s just weird
Ftm here-
""Good girl"" would make me descend into the pits of dysphoric hell.
good boy feels kinda patronising but still gives a tiny kick of euphoria, especially on one of those really dysphoric days.
Depends on the context.

When my girlfriend or someone i'm intimate with/attracted to says its, i melt.

Some crusty old guy says it, My skin crawls.

AS with everything, its all in the context.
The phrase ""good girl"" just sounds condensending.  It's the the equivalent of calling someone, ""buddy"" or similar names.  Nobody likes being ""talked down to"".

Actually doesn't have much to do with specific genders.  All genders are victim of this
If its said by a hot guy in the bedroom then it makes me happy. Any other time I'd be pissed off.
I am a transfem enby sub that absolutely LOVES being called a good girl (by my partner and partner alone). I would also become a cat girl if I could so you know I fit the type lol.
Only with partners and only in a sexy way. In those conditions it's major turn on. Otherwise no no no no
It absolutely breaks me and i melt into a puddle
ftm- tmi, but i hate it in all situations but sex, where weirdly i like both
only okay if it’s my partner in a specific context (use your imagination), otherwise it’s patronizing
Depends on the context and who says it. Strangers saying it sounds patronizing, fetishizing, and creepy. Friends saying it is fine as a joke. Partners saying it? Hell yeah
I’m gonna go against the grain here but I like being called “good girl.” Maybe it helps that I’m in the earlier part of my transition though
I like being called a good boy ☺️. Fuck the good girl tho. Ew haha. When I identified as female I didn’t like it.
good girl is fine, but *bad girl?*
 
It makes me shiver down to my core
I like it 👌
Good girl is the most rad thing when your submissive and in a situation calling for your partner(s) to say it. Outside of that its the same as being called a girlboss, its patronizing
Transfem, hate it. I'm a teenager, not a dog
depending on how’s it’s said and who’s saying it
Massive dopamine rush.
A pit... in my stomach where I feel the bile rise in bubbles laughing at me. 

Trans man here. I hate that. So.. so much.
If my partner says it, I melt and am filled with so much warmth, joy, and excitement. 
If my friends say it, it's cute teasing. 
Anyone else, I'll take their fucking knees.
Reeeeeealy depends on context. Who's saying it? When are they saying it? 
Is my partner saying it when I do something they like, in a bedroom context? Love it. 
Is a stranger saying it because I did as they asked in a casual or professional interaction? Low-key pissed off.
Context matters.
It depends on context and who it’s from. I would likely enjoy hearing it from someone who shares a close enough bond with me. Think… hair braiding. It’s not sexual for me or anything like that, it’s just warm and tingly.

Otherwise, I would see it as somewhere from pretentious all the way to downright dehumanizing. If it was from a coworker I would take it to HR, and if it were from a stranger I would be in self defense mode.

Edit: oh… AMAB trans fem, btw.
Very very happy
For me it's a big nope. If someone else likes it then good for them, but for me it's very awkward and, as many pointed out, patronizing and infantilizing. Of course I speak from a position of very minimal experience (a friend said it once as a joke when he couldn't think of another way to respond to something I told him), but I think that if you're looking for a way to compliment someone, you have many far better options.
It either makes me blush in a euphoric or romantic happy way
I'm a trans girl, and I really just don't feel anything towards this phrase. If someone were to tell me this phrase, they'd most likely be trying to be affirming, so I would at least appreaciate the small gesture.
A dozen of my friends get to call me good girl. I love it when they do, but if anyone else does they can fuck off
Most people find it demeaning, sometimes I’ve seen it be okay to some people in specific circumstances by specific people, but most of the time it’s pretty disrespectful.
There are a few people I love hearing it from, but aside from that, it would be weird
I remember being called both good girl and good boy by a guy who found me on Roblox and proceeded to gaslight and groom me, so I don't like it. Simply looking at puppy related stuff on a human is a trigger because of him.
In addition, being called those things as an adult is infantilizing and insulting.
Not girl, but when they say boy… shivers. I personally like being super submissive, but can see how it feels infantilizing. Mabye I just like being infantalized 🤷‍♂️
I am 15 and if I heard that I would be like “fucking excuse me”
It feels dehumanizing sometimes tbh
The only person allowed to call me ""good ____"" is my partner, and it's only ""good boy"" to ease me back from a panic attack. I *hate* ""good girl"", it makes me dysphoric to be called it and it makes me feel infantilized. Sorry to yuck some people's yum, I just never want to be called a girl in any sense.
Afab here(they/ve/she/), it really depends on who’s saying it or what tone. Partners, consensually, is kind of calming and cute, sub-spacey. If anyone out of my age range says it, anyone rudely/condescendingly says it, it’s very very uncomfortable and sometimes straight up dysphoria. Like up the spine chills.  If my friends use it in any context it’s like a pat on the head, which is usually ok.   Old men sometimes use it if they asked you to do something? It’s reallllly weird and uncomfortable/dysphoric. 
It’s only sometimes dysphoric for me as my dysphoria fluctuates.
I feel as tho “good girl / good boy” should really only be used when referring to a consenting partner. Like if someone said “good boy” to me, it would piss me off to no end. Like who the hell do u think u are?? Ya know? It feels icky lol that’s like calling someone “daddy or mommy”. I hope this makes sense lol
Shrug doesn’t bother me. I’m 46 but people always refer to me as though I were in my twenties at best. I just look young, my whole family does. The way I dress and such doesn’t help. Dunno, guess I’m used to it.
i feel fucking amazing
FTM here- 

“Good girl” feels gross for dysphoria reasons, but also for infantilizing reasons. However, it’s odd, because “good boy”, when said by my partners in um… specific context, feels INCREDIBLE. Still tho, when said by anyone else? I feel the urge to start biting /neg 

No idea why it’s so different, but my brain is already funky anyway so I just roll with it
Dysphoric
As a transfemine woman no one has told me this yet 🥺so idk how to feel
it’s a sexual thing
ironically (cuz I'm transfemme) being called a good girl does way less to make me feel good than being called a good boy for some fucking reason
it gives me a bit of euphoria just because im getting called a girl but other than that its pretty weird
""Good girl"" is a phrase that I think is used mostly in kink. It should only ever be used with consent, with clear boundaries set and understanding about when and where it's ok.
Just makes me feel warm and cute
As a non-binary person, I really don't like being called either ""good girl"" or ""good boy,"" I am neither. Like if you use it I'm going to be like ""stfu you're being an ass.""

On the other hand I do enjoy using it in a consensual context either for intimately or jokingly - especially if it's going to be giving someone else euphoria. I would also accept being called a gender neutral equivalent in the same context, but I don't like being called ""enby"" so I don't really know what that would be - ""Good person"" just sounds ridiculous.
I like the idea of enjoying it.. if that makes sense. Personally I see myself as a grown woman so it feels odd to be told that even though I have a longing for the childhood I missed, its kind of too late for it now unfortunately.
as a ftm i HATE it, not only because it genders me as a girl, but also because i find it very demeaning, its like im a child being talked to by an adult, or a dog being talked to by its master, its not a good thing in my eyes, i hated it as a child even before i knew i was trans, its just a horabal phrase to be used for humans in my opinion

sorry for the rants
It depends on who says it, my relationship with them and the context. It does at times address directly the inner child which for a rejected or neglect trans girl now an adult brings a degrees of warmth. 👩🏼‍⚕️🏳️‍⚧️💕
I personally really like it, it feels congratulatory while also being gender affirming
As a afab non binary, I love it
jokingly from a friend, definitely, it's cute and feels nice, but not out of that context
Kind of happy and horny, to be honest.
It makes me melt
I’m mtf and I like it so idk
If some one I don't know, or friends/family call me that? Fuck RIGHT off. Don't patronise me. 


If my partner would call me that? Yeah I'm really into that lol. But then again I'm into BDSM and stuff so yeah.......
Wait this is a thing people say to their kids?! Pardon my non-native English but that sounds horrible if said to anyone. It sounds like something you'd say to a dog, but even that feels wrong... 

Probably just culture clash but it really feels like something you'd say because you want to complement someone but you don't know their name and then ended up jumbling a bunch of words together. 

To to answer your question, I would feel very uncomfortable and I don't know anyone who wouldn't...
Just treat me like a normal goddamn woman. In most contexts you don't go around saying that to women, so don't do it to me in most contexts. Pretty much the only person allowed to call me good girl would be my girlfriend if I had one, but I don't :'(
Patronizing at worst and affirming at best
Transgirl here ... And yeah it makes me absolutely melt (I'm also a sub)
Good girl = *I will bite you*


Good boy = *wags tail & waits on headpats &/or forehead kiss*
This really is who and when, although I do love a pat on the head and a good girl. This is not something that just anyone can say.
as a closeted trans guy, my mom calls me good girl all the time and it makes me feel so horrible, even if she did call me good boy i’d be kinda weird since i’m a human and not  a dog…
I love it lmao
I think it depends for me. If the tone and context are from my partner and we’re being very lovey-dovey, then I’m melting and holding them closer.
If it’s out in the wild from someone I don’t know and/or there’s a lot of sarcasm, I’m ready to go..
It makes me feel like a good girl. Plain and simple
I feel infantalized by it normally, but I also have certain kinks where if it’s a person I’m intimate with I’d be very very okay with it

Yes in the bedroom

No anywhere else
Probably it is because of low self-esteem (and i'm not out yet), but it makes me generally happy (i'm actually sorry and hope that noone takes offense with it). Since i wish to be some kind of very traditional housewife (without the bigotry tho), it makes me feel a little bit valuable ... As long as it isn't hostile but rather jovial.
I  hate it when they call me that , it makes me feel cheap . That is something you say to to a kid not an adult. My partner isn't even allowed to say that to me even when we are playing or having sex for me it's a mood killer
No one ever calls me girl, if they did I'd probably be kind of happy. However, although I am submissive, I've never been into the infantilization aspects of being submissive, so I'd probably feel annoyed if someone I was dating used it in that way.
i love it for gender affirmation, and for some people the submissive part comes out more
31 year old AFAB here.
From a partner I literally melt into a giant puddle of mush and feel all the good things deep in my core, literally went to subspace once from it lol.

I've had a few non partners say it, and it honestly wasn't offensive and I suppose I had very mild satisfaction at being acknowledged for whatever ""good"" thing I was doing.

I think it has been elderly people saying it when I was specifically doing something helpful that wasn't expected of me.
As an FTM I have very mixed feelings. I’m not out to most people especially teachers. On the one hand I hate it because I’m not a girl Im a boy and it feels so wrong to be acknowledged as a girl. On the other hand it’s mostly teachers that say it and it makes me feel slightly proud of myself. So I don’t completely cringe. I feel like when people say good girl it’s like more normal but when they say good boy it sounds like your talking to a child or a dog or sommat so I think I’d rather they just say well done tbh. 😅😅 don’t know if anyone can relate.
Being called “good girl” makes me want to shrivel up and die but being called “good boy” makes my heart do backflips
It makes brain chemical go brrr
*Good girl*

Nope
Gave me anxiety, ftm here LOL but I do have some nsfw instances where I’ve found this phrase to be okay, same with feminine dominant names for myself. There is a woman part of me in there somewhere
i understand that for some transfemme people ""good girl"" might feel euphoric but tbh as a trans guy the sentiment of ""maybe afab trans people like it because of socialisation"" is giving the vibes of ""let's be honest, you might say you're a guy but you are just a good girl"" and I'm sure that's not what you meant but it's giving chaser vibes lol. 
as a trans guy i would ghost anyone who calls me good girl because it feels manipulative, maybe i just have trauma lol, but no, it feels as if you're trying to forcibly feminize me 
while ""good boy"" i do like platonically, like my best friend calling me good boy for help her. But if someone called me good boy in a sexual way it would make me incredibly uncomfortable
I like compliments, but only if it is genuine. Before I learned that I'm trans, I didn't got compliments in the way that are affirming to myself. After that I get affirming once for my gender that I no longer want. So compliments feels more and more bad, because they are not genuine... So like ""Good Man"" and anything like that I dislike to hear it and bittering the taste of things like ""good girl/woman""
I moan every time
When it's from someone I like, it makes me want to rub up against them and cuddle. But, I am a kinky one.  
Anyone else and I go into defensive mode.
horrible. absolutely horrible. however since I'm not really too old to be called a boy, I do like ""good boy""
i like it because girl
I'm MTF and for me (as with many on here) it depends on who is saying it. If it's someone I don't know that I have no interest in, it annoys and creeps the hell out of me, especially if they're older than me. If it's someone I may find attractive or interesting I might be less bothered, but it's still weird and not usually welcomed. Heck I don't even really like it when my roommates say it to me all that much. I normally take on a more parental role in most of my relationships so I don't really get to have that more submissive side,  even in relationships I enjoy. 

However...

I find myself increasingly submissive with one of my best friends (whom I have a huge crush on, but that's beside the point). Which isn't very normal for me, as I said before. 

Like, there was one time I forgot my water bottle when we were hanging out and I had a dry throat. She essentially commanded me to drink hers and I caved immediately and I don't normally like sharing like that.

And it's only progressed more lately. She teases me for the fact that I wish I was shorter and I am concurrently shorter than her. And she'll be all like ""oooooh I'm Freyja, I'm soooo tiny and I'm such a smol girl,"" sort of thing, she says it in a cutesy way too as if she's replicating the way I'd be saying it. But it feels great when she does that because it validates my feelings in some specific way. Like...I'm already shorter than her so the fact she says it like I'm already short is nice.

So, yeeeeeeah, I'm pretty sure if she were to call me good girl my knees would probably buckle immediately. Despite what I should about normally being the less submissive one, I actually am a more submissive person by nature. I just need the right person for me to actually be that way I guess.

I've even admitted to her in some scenarios that if she was more commanding towards me I would break for her super fast...ahah...when I told her that she giggled like she enjoyed hearing it so, yeah.

Anyway, that's my Ted talk. Thanks for listening to my woes of wishing that my BFF, and no one else really, would call me a good girl. 😅😅😅

Oh, and don't even get me started on the time she told me that she loves my voice and how thinks thinks it's so sweet and adorable. Sorry I'm just gonna go melt in the corner thinking about that 😅
I hate it, I’m trans masc and it’s always made me feel horrid

Even good boy makes me feel infantilised and not taken seriously so I dislike that too
Yeah it gives me shivers but I’m also very subby
My wife used to tell me ""good boy"" and I would literally bark back at her (but sounding like Stitch). A week or so ago, she said it to me and I kinda stopped, and she caught herself and said ""good girl"" and, well... I found myself with the Pavlovian response that I created in sexual situations with my other partner. The internal shiver from those words. She is mourning the loss of an inside joke between us now... Ugh.
I wouldn't mind being told it by a friend in very certain contexts, but being called ""good ___"" by a random person just feels gross and patronising.
uncomfy. princess oh the other hand 🥵
Depends on the context. As long as it's not condescending, it makes me feel very very happy and affirmed. Otherwise I get quite angry.

My best guess as to why I have no middle ground is a clash between wanting to be self sufficient and wanting to be a soft uwu girl
i shit myself and my whole week is spent thinking if i pass or not
I quite like it when it's said by the right people in the right context. Unlike a lot of other people here I don't usually feel infantilized by it, since I'm young enough that I feel like I still count as a girl, but in certain situations where it does make me feel infantilized, I may even like that aspect, as I quite like feeling like a little child being comforted sometimes.
Gross and v uncomfortable. Makes me feel very patronised and just reminds me of being a teenagers online when presenting as female and got a lot of creepy messages from older cis men online that for sure had some negative effects on me personally. 

As an adult it kinda makes me feel like it reinforces the idea that trans women can't be real women, but only girls. 
As many others said think the only person I'd be ok with it is my partner with specific permission. 

Idk. Feels like fetishiation in a similar way that cis women receive from straight cis men.
I'm a trans lady and good girl from my partner makes me happy cry so it's good in small doses. Other than my partner though, even a friend I think I'd feel patronized by. I'm not submissive very much, or at all, so exciting me might have unintended consequences
Too sexualised it's weird
MTF here, I've got friends who really like it but it does nothing for me, feels a little cringey tbh
I kinda like it though
I am a furry and transfem so hearing that does things to me Owo
It makes me feel appreciated and as if nothing horrible is happening to me for several seconds. I love it.
It would make me feel weird, since I’m not a girl (or a boy). It would also feel a bit infantilizing
In a kinky way? Yes. In any other way? Who would even say that?
 Me being the Transmasc  27y/o “whatever the hell fits today  good-version ” cause I’m about to get me some head pats 🥹
One step further; I'm naturally a very ""head in the clouds"" kind of girl and It's very affirming when my wife or friends go ""You're such a bimbo!"" Or other forms of playful misogyny...

That said if someone I wasn't close to played that card I'd lose my shit and probably behave in a pretty ""unwomanly"" way, tbh.
Transfem, depending on the context in which it's said, it either gives me a warm fuzzy feeling or massive creep vibes
Weird

Don’t like being talked to as if I’m a dog

Also I have zero submissive tendencies, I’m very much not a sub

But like even then I would never say “good girl” to my partner in any context, it just seems so…weird to me
Like I’m being given a day off from school on a day where I didn’t feel well. Amazing.
only from my partner, from anyone else it feels weird and rubs me the wrong way
In my case it would be ""good boy"".
I'm not a dog who just did a trick.
I just give them a dirty look which usually does the trick.
Can't be bothered to get worked up over it.
I had someone say that to my cis female boss. I was livid. Too bad beating someone up could get me fired.
Love it in every way and melts my insides. Lol
I don't like being called good anything tbh
It really depends on who says it. From a vast majority of people, it feels patronizing and degrading. But from a select few it feels incredibly affirming and positive. Im not really sure how to describe it better tbh.
I've only heard it in an audio and it made my heart flutter and I melted.  Though I have a bit of a submissive streak >w<
Past that, depends on the context and who says it
Good girl would be awful for me in all the cases imaginable. Good boy, on the other hand, in a sex context, oof. Yes. Unf. In a non-sex context, way to make me feel like a labrador.
Nobody is allowed to call me that - ever, not even my fiancee and partner of nearly seven years. 

I'm transfeminine non-binary but my presentation and mannerisms lean very masculine most of the time - I'm hella uncomfortable being referred to as ""girl"" unless I'm in the right headspace.
I don’t like it since it feels kind of weird and demeaning 

Only my friends can day it to me but its not serious with them
Honesrly it depends on the person. Some people like very close friends are allowed to call me that and on the term of how it makes me feel? Depends on the person again. But usually it makes me shiver a little inside, and seratonin rushing through my brain. It's a nice tingly feeling for some reason...


With everyone else tho... Dont even dare. I will break your kneecaps but if I like you yes please
I get angry whenever that happens because I’m a trans male and never want to be called a woman
Only in very specific bedroom contexts- anything outside of those instances is kinda gross and patronizing
I’m FTM trans soo
“Good girl” makes me feel weird and dysphoric and uncomfortable. Never NEVER liked getting called that to be honest, not even by my parents. Not even by my girlfriend back when we both thought we were cis. 
“Good boy” is more correct but honestly? My girlfriend’s the only one who’s calling me that, because if she’s calling me that then it feels cute and flirty, yk? I don’t mind. Anyone else and I look at them funny, I feel weird just hearing “you look so masculine today” from cisgender friends. “Good boy”? Even worse. What do I even say to that?
My friends or partner? I'm putty in their hands (extreme bottom here lmao). Most random people or acquaintances it makes me feel off and weird
That's just cringe, no?
I strongly dislike it, not only because of dysphoria reasons, but because things like ""good girl"" and ""good boy"" are things we say to pets a lot, and being talked down to like I'm an animal is an absolute no-go.
I genuinely love hearing it. Every time I hear it I feel happy.
Depends who's saying it and why. Done a good job in a task and friend says Good Girl?

""Yes! This is how dogs feel! Good yes feeling, am girl who is good, yes, quite. Good job me. Wag tail.""

Someone I'm attracted to saying it ever?

""Oh, woah, oh no. This is not the time for my stomach to do evasive maneuvers. This is definitely a normal speed to be breathing. Be inconspicuous!""
MTF Here.. I love it.. I don't know why it just makes me very euphoric
I like it when my wife calls me a good girl... I love it when she calls me a bad girl.
It depends on who says it and the context in which they say it
flusters me to death I stg
One word.
Kinky
Only my partner(s) get to use this phrase without an earful. That said, I'm not really a girl/woman, I'm a feminine Non-Binary person, but would prefer the general public to acknowledge me as one. Gender is weird like that lol. 

Anyway, even though I dress in cute outfits and rock a tiny pink backpack, I would prefer to be regarded as a fully autonomous adult woman. I mean I'm 35, ffs. I have many childlike qualities, but i am a fully grown being, emotionally I am still growing and always will be, like any healthy individual should, but I am not only over the age of consent in 100% of states, I can also drink in any country, territory, state, and province that allows alcohol consumption. I can also make all of the decisions old white men allow me to, when given the necessary information. I have my own opinions and beliefs and random ass thoughts. I have had a partner and watched her die, if I'm not an adult after that, I don't know what would make me one.

So yeah..... What was I saying? Oh, yeah. Partners only.
I'm probably not supposed to say this, but it's a huge turn on for me
I find it exciting if the delivery and context/mood is right. Otherwise is can come off as condescending. I am an adult and have had to work through some abusive relationships with kink, so some people who don't really have my consent can realize that instead of a 'good girl' I can easily be a pissed off woman.
I'm a trans man so for me it would be boy

It makes me feel kinda weird, cause either I think of it in a sexual way or that someone says it to a dog, so even though I wanna be called a boy, good boy just makes me feel uncomfortable
In a sexual way it can work, otherwise it’s a no from me. I’d rather not be spoke to and just patted lmao, I when someone sorta like pets my head as you would a cat or dog I do like it icl, it makes me feel happy and safe but call me a good girl and I feel inhuman
Ftm here n' it causes so much dysphoria

""good boi"" kinda depends on person but mostly nice
I absolutely feel disgusted when called a good girl, but when called a good boy in a specific context with a partner I'm full-on melting. It's super euphoric and makes me really happy. It depends on the context tbh. I don't like being called ""good girl"" in any form, but I'll gladly take a good boy in a positive way as a compliment in a happy tone like ""You're a good boy"" as in being told I'm a good person. And for other things like being told I'm a good boy by a partner or friend I'm comfy with. Otherwise I find it kind of creepy from strangers or people who just do it out of nowhere without permission beforehand. Just depends on how it's being used.
Easily that would make me feel super awful. As an FTM, that’s self-explanatory. However, being called “good boy” would also make me feel out of place. That’s because we usually only call pets names like that, and as I’m not a dog, that wouldn’t make me feel the happiest, but it’s much better than “good girl”.
Affirmed in a way, but mostly grossed out tbh
During sex, yes 😍

After I’ve given you directions to the ikea, wtf? 🫤
I mean, im kinky so like... it was good boy before I came out, this is just the logical progression for me.
Well its depends who say it, if said by a dom partner i would turn into a puddle, if it said by some creepy dude in the street It would creep me out.
Well in what context?
Im agender. If you say good girl to me i will kill myself in front of you
Absolutely disgusted and I imagine if anyone called me that I would immediately involuntarily body slam them to the floor out of pure disgust.

Not even joking
Considering I have a praising kink it makes me feel all and warm and fuzzy on the inside, it also makes me happy that my gender gets acknowledged.
Dysphoria + Trauma + “all men are evil why would you want to be one?” + emotionally abusive parents + transphobic family + emasculated + wanna die but still have to outlive my enemies + why tho + creepy old geezer in the church vibes
I would break the fingers of anyone who said this to me.
""Good girl"" would give me dysphoria, and ""good boy"" would make me feel like a dipshit little kid.

Context is important.
I'm agender AFAB, and i really don't mind. I've always loved getting praised in any sense, so i don't mind getting called a good girl or boy, even if it is misgendering. Some days I may be in a mood where it really hurts my feelings and makes me feel like people don't see me as who i am, some days i absolutely love it because I'm in a feminine mood and want to be perceived that way. Also keep in mind that I'm aromantic, so it's not like my life partner is doing this to me or anything. Just my friends because we're big on nicknames, so i might get called a good girl/boy and bitch in the same sentence. I guess i just appreciate pet names or titles in general.
I've never understood why some folks think 'bi'
would exclude trans people.
im pretty submissive but yeah, dont like being called a girl. it also reminds me of when i was a small child and was told ""good girl"" and felt patronised. whereas ive never been called ""good boy"" (and obviously not ""good kitten"") outside of kink
i like good boy as a kink but in literally any other setting i'm gonna be weirded out and annoyed. don't like good girl. the girl ruins it
I want to throat punch people who condescend to me, and this is no exception
Idk. It entirely depends on the context. In my transmasc-nb-femme hot mess… 
In general as a whole it’s.. patronising, sexist and transphobic (my legal title is Mr/ I’m afab), a lot of face punchy feeling.. that usually translates as a simple fuck off. Haha 
There is a small window in my… inner woman. That.. idk if she/they were in love/ mentioned by lover.. it would probably and incredibly cute moment. Or affectionate tease.
So … I guess it’s subjective.
It depends on the context.

Did I just bring you clothing I spent the day washing and ironing? Get ready to be on the receiving end of a complete bitch fest. I'm not a 5 year old doing my chores for my $10 allowance. Wash your own fucking socks next time. 

Did I just do something that felt really good during sex and you want to express how good it felt? I'm about to melt in to a puddle and never fully recover. A month from now I'll remember it and swoon. 

Of course if you had used good girl on me outside of sex that day and now you want to pull that shit on me while I'm within biting distance of your crotch? Interesting choice bucko.
Honestly I don't care. I'm a guy but since that in Italy we don't use to say ""brava ragazza"" Or ""bravo ragazzo"" with the same meaning it does not affect me :/ we use to say it when we are talking to someone else like ""she's a good girl"" But more like ""she's a nice girl full of heart and altruism"" Not like ""who's a good girl? You are a good girl!"" We don't even say this to dogs😂 we just say ""good dog"" So nobody ever said to me ""good boy"" Or ""good girl"" but if someone on intenernt calls me ""good girl"" I will punch them through the screen of my phone
I know I’m still a kid and everything but being called good girl not only makes me feel like no one has respect for my gender identity and it also reminds of how I was groomed and just makes me overall uncomfortable
I like to be called good girl when its sexy time, but any other time i think it would just be awkward. I only want to hear it from my bf as well.
From a partner: love it and melt into a puddle. From a friend: could be great, it depends. From the interwebs: context dependant. Anyone else: fuck you you're the worst
💦💦💦

basically
Either annoyed/uncomfortable, horny or it just gives me the giggles. This mostly because I'm egg and those who do know are close friends, a SO or someone trust.
I love the feeling when I’m called a good girl by my partners and it just fills me with joy my serotonin is through the roof and it makes me act like I’m 5 they do it on purpose just because it amuses them lol
I’m a trans guy and I’m pretty okay with both “good girl” and “good boy” in specific kink scenario, but without prior discussion or coming from someone I’m not close to, definitely not cool.
This!
Perfect response!! Saying something like that without being in the confines of a predetermined relationship whether that's a significant other, play partner, friend or what have you can be seen as incredibly infantilizing. Just because one person is allowed to say those words to you doesn't mean anyone else is. Unless known for sure that it will be accepted or it's already been discussed as something that could potentially be said, don't say it.
I actually got gendered correctly without a mask for the first time a couple of weeks ago. But I felt bad about being uncomfortable with it, because they used ""boy"" and not ""young man"".
Yup, I think it really is more about who and when. Everyone has their boundaries, and that kind of praise is usually intimate on some level, so it can be weird if just anyone does it, especially out of nowhere.
some guy called me a good boy and i dont think ill ever be the same. however im much closer to ""stupid little kid"" than ""grown ass adult"" so that makes sense
Genderfluid with an extremely strong praise kink, but my primary partner is the only one allowed to call me a good girl. We’ve discussed it at length, he understands and respects me. I’ve been called that by coworkers/extended family and I lose my shit because 1. It’s creepy as hell in 2022 and 2. It’s extremely condescending
Same!
My partner calls me ""Good boy"" from time to time and it makes me quite happy! But if anyone else were to say it, that would be weird af for everyone involved...
I relate but it makes me feel like a dog :/ I accept it only in playful and jocking circumstances
Your flair says agender transmasc. Can you explain? If agender is essentially genderless how can you also be transmasc? You don't need to respond and I'm not trying to be offensive.
As a transfem who is also a sub, this is what I came here to say
this
samezies. I love it in an intimate context. If someone said that to me in a professional setting, they would quickly regret it.
Exactly! Context and speaker are important
Literally the same with me, except I only allow 2 people to say it.
This!
>but, only from my partner.

It's the second comment I read that includes this... How often do people who are not your partners say this??
Either from a partner or a very close friend for me
Was going to say the same thing, definitely would make me uncomfortable hearing it from anyone else except my partner.
also a sub, definitely agree with u on that
""Patronizing"" is a good word in this context.

I can think of exactly one _particular_ transwoman that a ""good girl"" would not bother me, would be within the bounds of friendship. Others, I do not feel know me well enough to use the phrase. And I can't think of any cis people I would feel comfortable with the phrase.
makes my skin crawl
This
If someone in their 90s were to ""Good boy!"" me I would be disappointed but might excuse them... anyone younger and I would probably be various degrees of pissed off.
im 14 and hate it, always have, always will, its a horable pantronising phrase that should not be used for humans, no mater the age, also dysphoria
""Not even for two Scooby Snacks?""

</ducks>
Is the treatment painful, like laser hair removal? Is she like reinforcing that you did a good job bearing the pain?
Exactly, it feels degrading.
I mean, yea that's typically the context. Being treated like not a human is kinda hot 🤷
Same! There's just something that I find so comforting about it. After years of repressing stuff it was the first positive affirmation I had about my true gender
I know that I found it too stressful to come out to ANY of my relatives (including immediate family) until after my grandmother died. I know she loved me, but I couldn't find any way of explaining.

It was internally stressful because I was aware that I was holding off more obvious transition until her death, and I didn't want her to die, but I also needed to move forward.
was it a TikTok? Cus for me it was a tiktok...
Understandable!
I know some people who were pretty involved in kink scenes, but came to realize that although there are some very good and caring people involved in scenes, that it is pretty common in larger communities for the communities to turn toxic, protecting abusers, and refusing to listen when told about problems. I am told that poly also tends to similar problems.
This cracked me up
I don't think I have heard any association with that symbol? I am from a computing background, which often uses the symbol to mean ""not"". ""If this is not true"", ""is it true that this thing is not equal to this other thing?""
_pats_
I had heard recently that Roblox had a grooming problem... I think the article I was reading said that they were being dismissive that it had anything to do with them and didn't see a need to do anything about it. It is possible that I am misremembering what I read.
Nah, lemme correct that: its a form of psycological torture.
I agree with every single word in this post :3
Please ask her out b/c she likes you and you like her and you would make great girlfriends.
[deleted]
Yeah no problem!

So, I identify with no gender - hence the agender - but I quite literally transitioned to a more masculine appearance. I’m AFAB, took testosterone, and got top surgery, so I now am usually called “sir” over “ma’am” in society.

Don’t worry, I didn’t see that as offensive, just curious.

But yeah so “agender” is just the closest label that makes me comfortable. I won’t say it fits me 100% because I would absolutely prefer masculine terms over feminine ones, but it’s the closest way to how I feel internally: not close to any gender identity.
I see it a fair bit here on reddit of people being like, ""hey I need validation today, please call me my chosen name and a good girl"" and like... I get it, but, it feels so empty and gross. And I'm sure some people use it because they think they're smooth
yeah i literally feel it being accompanied by a creepy pat on the back by an invisible hand
And This
\*valid\*
I'm not entirely sure, I guess so? Electrolysis can be sore in places. Like the upper lip especially. Tip though, Numbing cream (lidocaine) and cling film (keep wet reapply, they'll clean it off as they go) an hour before appointment on sensitive areas and it'll take the sting off slightly. Least it does for me anyway.
Yeah electrolysis is painful
lmaooo fr tho

Now that I think about it, it might have been.
I essentially noped out of the scene when I started getting messages from people who I'd previously been chatting with, suddenly demanding that I give them my home address with promises (ie, threats) of ""surprising"" me in the middle of the night. And this was after I'd made it crystal clear that I had zero sexual interest. Nowadays the phrase ""Good girl"" brings me back to that point where I felt I was getting backed into a corner and my safety even at home was at risk.
i’m glad it did but i still don’t know how i would feel
it’s usually used at the end of sentences to give the sentence a more sexual tone or connotation. for example, “hey there” vs “hey there~” gives two way different feelings. it’s essentially used as a form of punctuation that changes the intent.
Squeeeee, yay. I am the going to sleep on your lap now and I'm not moving.
Not necessarily. Some people just like it, hell my fiance calls me it all the time in a normal, non kink context. But also in one. I like being treated like property, I like being acknowledged as female, I'm typically the more submissive, even in normal context, it just works out.

My favorite is the kinky way tho, but thats me 🤷
It is a phrase that gets used by random people towards young people. For example, ""You cleaned up the campground without being asked? Good girl!""

But it gets used between parents and children a fair bit; in my culture it is one of the very most common praise phrases. So it often gets hooked into reward circuits.

There is a whole genre of ""Daddy"" and ""Dom"" culture around the phrase, so for some people it gets very tangled with sex.
Alright cool, thanks!
Just reminds me of people like my dad which is not what I need in the bedroom
predosing lidocaine makes a lot of sense. Wish I thought of that when I was doing lasers.

If you went through a physical ordeal, I think someone calling you a ""good girl"" afterwards actually makes sense. Usually I find the phrase disturbing
I'm kinky, sue me
Righttt ughhh 😩
I feel like half of us had our egg cracked by fuckin tiktok... 

""Oh its NOT normal for cis men to have constant dreams about being a woman? Damn that's crazy... ohfuckwaitidontthinkimcis.""
That must have been a very rough period to live through!

Sadly, it matches what I am told of the scenes in several larger cities 😕
Thanks, I didn't know that.
awwww 

_strokes you gently_
Yeah no prob!
Mine cracked a different way, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there was an up tick because of TikTok.
It definitely wasn't one of my better experiences. Promises of being made to ""disappear"" from my home in the trunk of a stranger's car were more than a little unnerving.

oh its 2.16am where i am
Oh it's noon where I am"	vklu2c	trans	916	0.98	2022-06-25 18:59:39
trans brother won’t respect me being trans	I’m(teens) out to my family and have been for around a year now, my brother(12) isn’t out but is obviously just now finding his identity. I’ve asked him to respect my name and pronouns as i respect his but he never does. he even said i am ‘technically a girl’. i remind him over and over that i’m trans and he never ever respects me and i don’t know what to do.	"he's twelve. flip him off (optional), roast his gamer tag and ignore him
I would just bite him but i've been informed that's assault and not socially acceptable
He is 12. That means he will have the worst opinions. Just ignore him for a few years
Airhorn when he refuses to respect
I could be very wrong but maybe he’s confused on what being trans means? Rhetoric like that seems pretty weird and telling on how he sees his own identity in way
Kids and young teen dont get these kinds of stuff a lot and have no filter give it time
Definitely would advise against retaliation in kind, as others have said there's no good in weaponizing misgendering like that and it misses the point. The point is the disrespect, hurtfulness and the projection/regurgitation of narratives he may be wrestling with.

If you can, practice boundary setting of disengaging (when possible and preferably with parental support) around this behavior, remove the benefit of your attention, resources and presence when they aren't honored. You don't need to defend or justify anything about your identity beyond that it be respected as expressed.


As this is your younger sibling, should you feel inclined to try and change this behavior from a supportive place, the positive side of rewarding respect with your attention, resources and presence and explicitly stating the cause and effect of his actions and your corresponding response can go a long way. This can also show him that he can similarly guard his own sense of self even as he's figuring it out. That said, you're the only one who can truly prioritize your own mental/emotional health and well being so please do so.
He’s 12. Not worth fighting.
Do NOT misgender him. Do not teach him to weaponize pronouns. If he won't respect yours then that's something to work on, but devaluing his identity by doing it right back teaches him that pronouns are arbitrary at best, and weapons at worst.
internalised transphobia, he's hating on you because he's hating on himself. not entirely sure how you can tackle that. it won't really be changeable by you as he needs to get over himself first before any attitude change can take place.   


so id say be selfish, do what you need to do for you and your mental health.
I’m 56 and my brother is 62. I came out to him over three years ago. It took him two years to grow up and finally respect me. I begged and pleaded with him. I nearly cut him off but then he stopped. 

Just give your annoying 12 yo brother a little time to mature. Ignore him in the meantime.
It really alarming that like a decent amount of comments are saying to misgender him. If you don't like when he does it to you why would you do it to him?  The boy is 12 like 12 year olds are usually stupid and usually try to act as how they seem tough. Ignore him you're the older sibling.
Whenever he used the wrong name or pronouns just never respond until he uses the right ones if he does it in front of people ie “yes this sister/brother (dead name)” just go “we dont have a sister/brother named (dead name)”
Mentally fuck with him, when my sister pisses me off I move stuff around in her room like I'll take her controller or the mouse for her laptop and put it in her bed so she knows she didn't put it there but there's no proof I moved it so I can't get in trouble and it really annoys her
Get an air horn to correct him every time he gets it wrong
So given they’re 12 and in middle school, they could be trying to emulate other boys in their grade in an attempt to be masculine.

Could also be internalize transphobia and by picking on you (and potentially other transpersons) could be a way he’s trying to feel “less” trans to appease that phobia or mask that he’s trans.

Could also be stuff they watch or hear, if they play online games could be in the chat.

If it’s isolated to you, it could be intermixed with not wanting to “copy” you, sibling stuff, and in an attempt to be his person is trying to make it so he’s the only trans one.

He could also just be a 12 year old younger brother wanting to pick on their older sibling and is doing it more specifically because you asked him not to.

Overall it would probably be good to have parents, someone who can diffuse the situation, to ask him why he’s misgendering you or why he feels like doing this.
I think he’s trying to cope with the fact that he might be trans. I used to do the same thing. He’s probably realizing that he might not be the person he thought he was. It’s still not ok to do that to anyone, however.
He is 12 so I think he is not really clear about what it means to be trans. Are you feminine? Probably that can be a reason too he thinks you are not trans...have you asked why he thinks you are not trans?
My brother is like this too. He’s FTM and I’m non-binary and he doesn’t see me as actually trans even though we literally transitioned the exact same way 🙄 he thinks you can only be trans on the binary
Mix hot sauce  sugar  and mints  and put it on his teeth and tooth brush  for  more/longer pain Mix in some oil
😧💕
12 years are dumb, mabey find a way to explain it to him in a way he can understand because clearly he has a terfy idea that gender is biological and set in stone
I will make no excuses for his behavior, but I would guess it comes from not respecting you in general as the core of this. Probably something like the transphobic ""little confused girls don't know their own gender 🥺"" mindset that targets transmasc people a lot online lately. It sucks that he's doing this to you. Keep your head up, we're rooting for you
air horn when he misgenders or deadnames you

Eh, he's 12. Middles schoolers are little shits, and that's just the way it is. Just start telling him (as condescendingly as you possibly can) that he's just too young to get it, and he'll understand when he's older. In addition to being completely true, it should piss him off enough to give you some compensatory satisfaction.
The number of people on this thread flat out advocating for abusing a child is making me want to not be part of this community.
I'm of the opinion that if your sibling won't respect your identity, then you shouldn't respect theirs.

I'm sure some, maybe even many, may disagree with me here, and say that it's never right to misgender no matter what the circumstances, and I'm sorry for that. It would be a harsh lesson for them when you say that they themselves are trans. Then they need to know and understand that if they wish the world to look on and respect their own identity, they **need** to respect others. It's a hypocritical lesson I know, but sometimes these things are the only way.
Some people just don’t understand, especially younger folks!
This is a rough situation to be in and I'm sorry you're having to tolerate this, even if he is only 12. With that being said, he is still old enough to know the problems with his behaviour. 

I agree with other postees in this thread that it is him projecting his own internalised transphobia. That's obviously no excuse, but you're doing very well to not respond to him with disrespect.

I'd say keep being civil and respecting his pronouns/chosen name, but make it clear he doesn't get to have a proper relationship with you until he learns to respect your identity. Just avoid as much interaction as possible.
Sounds like a dickhead 12 year old……
tell him that he is hurting you and it makes you sad. if he still doesn't budge..


try again when he isn't 12, and remind him how jerky he was back then. 12 yo boys are nightmare goblins
He's 12... it's still stupid but, well, probably in a future he'll be able to see he was this weird when he was little- maybe in just a year he'll change. Or two, who knows, but it wont last much
He'll grow out of it my brothers 12 fortunately hed slightly more mature as he has many LGBTQ friends but he still acts 12 and can be annoying as hell the younger brother us worse they grow out of it overtime
Let him be. He’s still figuring things out. Correct and explain things to him if you can.
He's 12, he doesn't know anything about that all.
At some point it's a good idea to talk to him. If he doesn't want to talk about it and continue being mean then that's on him. Misgendering him won't solve anything and defeats the purpose of him accepting you. He's going to get misgendered and dead named by others anyways at some point, no need to add onto it. 

There are other ways to spite him lol, but you can also just him a hypocrite if others ask. It might not seem like it, but trust when others say that him being 12 is what it is. In a nutshell, if you can remember being 12, then you can sorta understand why he's acting why he does. 
This doesn't excuse his actions, it explains it. An explanation is a good course to finding solutions.

Also fart in his pillow to give him pink eye, that's one way to get back at him.
Oh he wants to misgender you? Misgender him right back.
Just call him Karen
Do it back to see how he likes it
Have you tried giving him the super wedgie treatment? It’s even better if you can get the underwear band hooked around a bed post or something. Leave them hanging.
I'd say go full cod multi-player lobby and say you banged his mom, but that's incest and not socially acceptable
punt the child
No respect means no respect back. Figure out what really triggers him being disrespected by and use it as blackmail to get the respect you deserve
a little harsh but stop respecting his, let him realize how much it sucks then tell him about how it feels. or stop talking to him. pretend he doesn’t even exist. i did that when my younger sister weaponized my dead name
Ew imagine being 12?? Uhhh you could have a heart to heart with him, ask him why he sees you as ""technically a girl""
[removed]
Slap the fuck out of him and show him how much of a man you can be
If he won’t respect you don’t respect him . Taste of his own medicine
[removed]
He's 12. He's a kid, but should have enough brain capacity to know he's acting like an idiot. Sit down and talk to him and make it very clear that you won't tolerate the disrespect and hypocrisy.
Sounds like a 12 year old just being a dick because he can
my brother was super abusive mentally towards me at the same age (around 11-14?), he called me names, made fun of me on daily basis. I wasn't out then, but I was always masc presenting since childhood, so he also made fun of how I ""want to be a boy"". it started all of sudden when he went to secondary school and... ended just as suddenly. when I outed myself he started respecting my name and pronouns. never once said anything mean about it since then.

so I never figured out why he behaved that way and why he stopped just like that, but I was thinking that maybe this is the time in life of young boys - at least those who are socialised to be men in the future - when they fall into all those expectations to be strong, big, independent men, that they start harassing others because they think it's the only way to show that they are those strong men - by humiliating others, bringing them down. or maybe it's the hormones that start affecting the way they experience emotions and they become more angry and have yet to learn how to deal with this. or maybe he is insecure, maybe growing up he felt you're the ""better"", ""smarter"" sibling, and he thinks undermining your identity is the only way to show he knows something better than you. 

obviously, not all young boys are like that, but growing up I could see this pattern - they often become assholes at this age, and then they grow up. not always unfortunately.

whatever the case, I would recommend talking to your parents about it and getting them to explain why it's important that he respects you, no matter what his opinion about you is. if it won't help, maybe take him to a specialist who will explain the same - in front of a stranger who has far more knowledge than him and presents that knowledge to him, maybe he will sense he is the one who is wrong. 

either way, if it won't help, just avoid him and interactions with him for your own mental health. don't listen to the comments saying ""beat him up"" ""misgender him back"" this absolutely won't help and will only make him oppose you more.
Trans mama an sis won’t stop using gender pronouns meant for boys
If your parents aren’t doing anything about it then I don’t know what can be done
as a person who grew up amab, and now realised that im ✨trans✨. i see why this is happening. young men, especially with all that fuckin t in their body, have this fear that their lesser than everyone else. best to attack this inner desire of him, and dont just say, ""you are a narcissistic asshole"". explain to him why, show him examples, give testaments of this bigotted behavior. ive learned the hard way, name calling never works. you need to attack their deepest insecurities to make them subconsciously be like ""oh fuck. hes right."". idk arguing is a thing people do differently. because of my autism, i almost dont have the ability to yell when im mad.  if you do it in a calm, but threataning tone, itll fuck him up.
This is what the toilet was invented for.
He’s a 12 year old first and a trans person second; he’s not thinking about how deeply it cuts to misgender you, he’s thinking “i want to annoy my sibling and this really upsets them” and probably sees it as on the level of calling you an idiot or some other dumb, pre-teen insult. 

Doesn’t make it much less hurtful, of course, but as hard as it is, you just need to be patient and keep on educating him. Realistically, he’s going to grow out of it and realise how much it actually affects you

Edit: I’d thought for some reason you were MTF but realised you don’t say that at all and I’m not sure of your identity so changed to neutral language
I understand what you're going through. My brother had a hard time accepting my identity to at first. But you gotta remember they've known you as a different person for their entire life and he's well only 12 which is the beginning of puberty. Everybody gets a bit of an attitude when they get I to their teen years. Now this doesn't mean what they are doing is right, but just give it time and we'll ignore. The more attention you give it the worse it is.   If it was your parents that's a different story but your sibling is 12 so it's just a time thing.
What in the frick frackity fuck
It sounds to me like your parents, or maybe your local community are going to be a bigger problem than he is. He didn't make these transphobic ideas on his own.
If he’s twelve and acting like that, then he either doesn’t know any better or is just being plain hypocritical.
My brother is the same. Honestly I just ignore it. He wants to get a ride out of you (most likely) and eventually you’ll move out and that’s will be that
Don't worry about it too much. He carries alot of self-hatred and he's abusing you because of it. My brother called me fag for years and he came out years before I did.
At least he isn't conservative like my brother. He's 24 and I'm 22 and I've been out for almost 2 years (since I moved from home +a few months) and he still won't respect me for who I am. He didn't like me to begin with but now he won't even look at me...
I would stop calling him by his preferred name and pronouns so he can see how he’s making you feel :) good luck 👍
bruh how you gonna disrespect another trans person when you're trans yourself 💀💀
Just give the silent treatment.it always works for me
Ignore them. They 12 and have no valid opinions
Do it to him see how he likes it and he can't do anything about it since he's not out of the closet
Have you gotten to talk to him about why he doesn't respect you and what his thought process behind it is? As much as it sucks, he might be genuinely confused/misunderstand what you mean
Just correct him every time and move on. Try to process your feelings about it and let it go. He's 12 and is obviously struggling as well. That's not an excuse for how he lashes out but you won't be able to fight him about this most likely. Not until he's older and has a better understanding of his own stuff. 

I'm not saying to take his shit. Correct him steadfastly if you can. Take no shit but do no harm. I hope things get better. ❤💙❤💙
Bruh, he's not even a damm teen yet cut him some slack
I would maybe attempt asking him if he would like to go and speak to someone with you, not as a negative thing but just more so maybe he can understand. Im not defending your little bro or anything but he is 12 and sometimes its hard to understand. OR YOU COULD FIGHT THAT LITTLE SON OF A BITCH

As fun as biting sounds i will have to find another way 😩 such a shame
I ( MtF 17y ) tried it with my older brother ( cis 25 years old ) two years ago, he was 23. He used feminine insults in French but he became pretty violent. Can’t tell whether I regret that or not tho
Damn, I wish someone told me that when I was a kid. I did a lot if biting when push came to shove.

It should be obvious already, but since it clearly isn't: they don't need to be taught how to weaponize other people's identity, they're showing that they already know how to do that just fine.  
And instead, it's possible that if they receive a taste of their own medicine, they'll learn how horrible it is to weaponize other people's pronouns & identity.  
Sometimes --tons of times, sadly-- that's the only way people learn how to respect others.
But OP said that the brother is also trans :/
Yes he’s trans too
I can only imagine some of them may be children or teenagers themselves. 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️😬😥
I don’t think it’s wrong because it’s mean, I just think that weaponising somebody’s identity by misgendering them cannot possibly turn out well for me, so I would strongly advise you do not do this
it’s always wrong to misgender someone because it treats using the right pronouns as a privilege that can be taken away for bad behaviour.
I'm in the same boat as you. I even have purposely misgendered cis people over them not respecting my pronouns. It usually gets them to STFU and respect my pronouns pretty quick.
Honestly, this. If he gets mad at being misgendered, he knows how you feel then.
Um no don't do that. They're 12. They're a literal child. They have even less of an understanding of they're feelings and identity and they don't know how to process.
why are you in my made up fairytale then
Wtf is wrong with you though?
As if somethings right with you trying to insult and disrespect a 16 year old. 🤡
thank you for worrying(?) but i’ve known i’m trans since i was a wee lad, i just didn’t know it was called being transgender at that age
heres a start, to say next time he does this, (also itd be nice to know wtf yalls pronouns are in the post, i feel im fucking them up bad): ""hey, im sorry you have the inabilty to accept that you are not above everything. id like to let you know that attacking others and purposefully using language that you *know* is hurtful, does not show dominance. it shows a broken inner core of a person, attempting to redeem life as a seratonin shot. its sad to the point that makes me question if you are exibiting human traits, because you seem so scared of empathy and caring, you might as well be amazon alexa.""
I'd say sink to his level if it gets bad but honestly that isn't a great thing to do
i’ve tried to talk to him about it but he just rolls his eyes and walks away
??? the age doesn’t matter, a trans person is technically being transphobic to another trans person
Good bot
Good bot
also was going to say something along the lines of fight them
I can confirm is only fun if you are on the biting end of the deal, my younger brother bit me once and i did not enjoy the experience 😂
Do it to him see how he likes it and he can't do anything about it since he's not out of the closet
Well as unfortunate as that whole scenario sounds I really hope you found a way to turn that into some euphoria from him using those insults and avoid contact now!!
With a 12-year-old? No enemy too small, huh?
except you're not ""giving them the taste of their own medicine"", cis people don't feel the same way when misgendered as trans people. it doesn't hurt nearly as much. the only thing you're showing them that way isn't ""how horrible it is"", because they never will feel that, but that it's fine to misgender people as punishment - because that is what you're doing, you're misgendering someone as punishment. 

honestly, I have seen so many people recommending that method but actually no one who said it worked for them. and if it works once - you'll have an unrelated fight with them, who says they won't start miegendering you again, since you've shown them that correct pronouns is something you can take back when you feel like it?
I know. I often forget how youth-heavy these online communities are and running into that reality can be frustrating. I’m sure I was that shortsighted at the same age, but I lacked a Reddit account because Reddit and social media did not, um, exist.
When they complain it you link it to how you feel when they purposely do it like OP mentioned. Isn't that helping them understand the pain they cause?

Just straight throw hands.
It was only once. We just both had a bad day. He was never violent except this day because I bit him out of anger. He’s the only member of my family I still speak with because he never misgenders nor deadnames me now.
Never too small. I'd throw hands with my 1 year old nephew if needed 😂
>cis people don't feel the same way when misgendered as trans people.

""Cis people""?? Did you even read OP's post??  
And anyways, they definitely do feel the same way when misgendered, wtf are you on? Even tho most of them don't understand it, they have a gender identity too and if it gets disrespected they feel it and they get crazy mad about it, too, even more than we do because unlike us they're not used to be on the receiving end of that disrespect, they expect to be able to dish out and never ever take.  


>honestly, I have seen so many people recommending that method but actually no one who said it worked for them. and if it works once - you'll have an unrelated fight with them, who says they won't start miegendering you again, since you've shown them that correct pronouns is something you can take back when you feel like it?  


1- Idk what you saw, but even among these comments there's at least one that contradicts you.  
2- on the ""who says they won't start again"", the answer is as simple as to be obvious: because if they start to play that game, you can play that game, too. And they now know how bad it feels, so they won't wanna risk it. And if they do it anyways... well... you can play that game, too.  


At this point it's starting to feel like you're intentionally ignoring anything that contradicts your view, your view being that we should be good doormats and let people step all over us without retaliating.
I would be agreeing with you, because you’re right, it doesn’t hurt nearly as much for cis people, but OP’s brother IS NOT CIS. The whole point of the post was that the brother is also trans, and still won’t respect OP.
No that's just abusive. If someone is bullying you you don't bully them back. If someone steals from you you don't steal from them. You're just frothing a cycle of abuse. The 12 year old kid isn't going to learn anything rn. And if their older sibling just returns the behavior to will only hurt them both inevitably
Imagine how pathetic your life has to be to try and harass a kid on the internet.
okay i mean,, i already go to therapy but sure
No, queer throw hands. Bring the gays into this, they can assist you.
That’s great I’m glad the two of you have a better relationship than I assumed. Sorry for that, I’m glad he supports you!
You must be really tough. For sure no one’s gonna oppress you.
no, cis people don't feel misgendering as much as trans people. and nowhere in the post it says the brother is trans, it just says he's finding his identity, that literally could mean anything. and just because I am against misgendering people as punishment doesn't mean I think we should allow them to misgender us, I don't know why you're putting words I haven't said in my mouth.
So we're saying it's okay to misgender people if they misgender us? ESPECIALLY if the person is trans?
this isn't clear from the post.
Bro i can bring my whole platoon into this
Yep that’s great and I think on this only point I’m a lucky girl ! And no problem, I read again and I would’ve assumed the same reading this. I wrote it strangely
I'm sorry, i genuinely cannot tell if you're being serious right now or if you thought i was being serious, so i just wanna clarify that what i said was a joke.
When did I say that? All I said was that that person was talking about cis people, when OP specifically said that their brother was also trans.
what? the title of the post is “trans brother won’t respect me being trans”
Is your name actually Anya?
Oh! Sorry. With some of the people in these forums it’s honestly hard to tell.
contains: nya
no its Naomi, anya is a character
It's alright! I agree, some people say certain things and it's just like ""...am i gonna be in a crime documentary now?"" With how serious it sounds when you first read it 😂

I slip up once and BAM! Transphobia!	"So admittedly I messed up , I had ordered some bras off Amazon and they said they were supposed to come by the end of this month to September and I was pretty chill with it. What I didn't expect is for them to come early and unfortunately my grandfather got it and gave it to my mother. Now, I was just expecting my mom to pass it off and say "" be more aware next time"" or "" you know how he feels about this. Just be careful next time"" but no, she blew it out of the ballpark today ( not in a good way) she wanted to act dumb and act like she didn't know what was inside the package when she could clearly feel that it was bras. I was a little embarrassed still about this whole bra thing so I kind of just sheepishly said another article of clothing until eventually a bra. Now my mom had been very supportive of me but she had her little slip ups and I was close to calling her transphobic but I had to remind myself that me coming out as trans was pretty new and it would take some time. But it's been a year and a few months now and the thing she told me literally ruined my entire day. Well, it's still fresh in my mind as it happened a few minutes ago. I'll tell you what she said word for word ""Look Man, you got to stop ordering stuff like this online. You know how he feels about this and you are just asking for conflict"", this hurt me a bit because I thought we finally were out of understanding of my identity but she wouldn't even further and said ""There are real women who need stuff like this and it's being wasted on you"" That cut deep like it actually hurt. And now I'm just classifying my mother as a full-on transphobe. I was hesitant about cutting her off along with my grandparents but screw it, she's shit too . I guess I am going to be alone with no family when I move. I hate this shit so much"	"I’m sorry but … how do they know what clothing items you get? Do they „feel“ the bag or what? That‘s just sooo creepy. o.0  
Also, it‘s not like you‘re stealing the clothes from some homeless kid. C‘mon.     

Y‘know what, as a trans guy you can tell her next time I gave you my *bra buying licence*. Please use it, because I hate that stuff. Balance achieved! XD
wow 😕. hoping you make it out of there & find people better fit to be your family
I'm dreading coming out to my family. I only just last night came out to my wife. She knew I was questioning, but the realization hurt her. She ""married a man"" and ""wants her husband back.""

It sucks.

That said, in your case, I'm guessing you need the bra to feel complete. I know without my little tastes of gender euphoria, I probably would have off'd myself already.

Sending lots of love! ♥️♥️♥️
Theres so many people who need oxygen and your parents are wasting it
 The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water or the womb. Chosen family all the way. I wish you the best of luck finding awesome friends to surround yourself with, people worthy of your trust and care.
I’m usually ok reading posts about transphobia, but man, this one just hurt to read.

I’m so sorry, OP.  Sending you love girl 💗

Taking clothes from someone who needs it?  Is she even aware of how much shit goes in a landfill every day?  What a fucking stupid thing to say - ah yes, all those cisgender women who don’t have any bras because trans women are buying up all the stock.  Not like companies adjust their output based on demand or anything!
Actually, buying things even if you don't ""need"" them causes demand, which increases supply. You're literally supporting bra companies buy purchasing bras.


And as a trans guy, I know how important gender affirming clothes are. Clothes are a necessity. You do need them. It's not like you're going to Walmart and buying out the entire bra section.


Your mother is indeed a transphobe.
Businesses operate on supply and demand. Your purchasing of any clothing is based on a company's projected supply needs for that time and as such you are in no way depriving anyone of their bust support needs. 

Also the online market allows for a degree of anonymity and convenience that you find beneficial to you as a consumer.

You also, as a member of a 'free'  society have the ability to choose where your finances go, clothes,  boots,  motorcycles,  etc.  To deny you this denies you the basic financial autonomy that is fundamental in the operation of the economy.

Furthermore your parent may find that their ratio of poo to head is currently in a state of more poo than head. Thereby making them, by all measurable accounts, a poo head.

In all seriousness I hope you can find a degree of freedom and peace in your current situation until life opens up to you. Furthermore I hope that you recurve the respect you are due, if not now than soon.
It’s not wasted on you. You have just as much right to buy clothes as anyone else. 

You are valuable, and your desires matter.
To be fair, since the Bra Wars of '06, they have been in incredibly short supply.
Yeah screw her. There are worse things than having no contact to your family, trust me. Go away and build up your own family and surround yourself with people that have your back.
I get to come out to 4 adult children. I am dreading it. I have to wait till my daughter marries in October. She has mental issues. I have been on hrt for 11 months. It's getting more and more difficult to live a double life mentally. It sucks.
Listen, Miss, I’m sorry your day went so terribly. I hope you were still able to wear and enjoy your purchases and that you felt as beautiful as you are. Your family will come around, and if they don’t, it doesn’t change that you’re absolutely wonderful and absolutely deserving of love and acceptance. (and bras!)
uuuuuh. you are a real woman. and thats not how consumerism works so shes wrong twice. i know it can be tough for parents sometimes (nb here) but theres no excuse for saying shit like that— things that are Meant to hurt. im sorry she said that shit and hope she didnt hurt you too bad
Fuck them then you can make your own family of friends
You are a real women that’s bs
I’m sorry she’s being shitty toward you.

But also if I it helps, what she’s saying is hilariously dumb. “Women who need stuff like this?” Lmao does she know bras don’t provide any medical benefit unless you’ve got a massive bust that gives you back pain at which point you may as well just consider getting reductions instead??! Literally the only reason for bras under a DD cup (to be charitable) is societal pressure to conform to wearing bras or personal preference.

She’s definitely transphobic, but she also clearly doesn’t even understand cis women. A 30-300 dollar semi comfortable at best piece of fabric society tells women “it supports them” is what is a waste to begin with. If it eases your dysphoria, you have a more legitimate use than any cis woman your cup size.
You didn't slip up.  It's not your responsibily to control how he feels about anything.

You ordered perfectly normal clothes.  You did NOTHING wrong.

The only people making this weird are them.
Not all females even choose to wear a bra. There are plenty for you.
The “real women” who need bras are you. Bras are not purely to hold up bags of flesh; they have an emotional tie to them. They can make you feel euphoric and are very pretty to boot. If I wasn’t trans masc I would wear the heck out of them just because they can be colorful and fun! Your family sounds like a real work in progress; I’m really sorry for that. Took me a while to get my family to accept me and I’m still working on it a year later as things change. I’ve cut off lots of people so far, family, friends, friends of friends, etc. The process never gets easier, but understanding that it is for your benefit in the long run keeps me going. Why keep people around when they always make you feel like sh*t? For now, I think it’s amazing you are still willing to put up with your family. You have a big heart; must be a trans thing. Really hope your bras fit and look good!
Seems to me there are real allies that could be using that air and she's wasting it
I’m really sorry about that :( I hope things get better! 🫂
No! ….I hurt with you. This sucks.
I'm alone too. Or I will be very very soon. I'm moving out of state in the next few weeks, and I'll be going full no-contact with my parents and siblings. I'm already NC with the rest of my extended family. And if I'm being real, I've felt alone for years already despite still having a ""relationship"" (for lack of a better term) with my family. 

Family by blood is vastly overrated. 

Soon it'll be just my dog and me. Here's to hoping I figure out how to makes friends in a new place.

Sending you love, OP. <3
Ah yes, the great under-reported bra shortage. Whatever will the rEaL wOmEn do? /s
What's more important? Gramps who'll probably be dead soon (or in a home, or have dementia, etc) or your child being comfortable and able to buy their own shit? 

Seriously, there legitimately shouldn't be an issue whatsoever, Gramps doesn't need to know a damn thing, especially about you ordering stuff for yourself. More so if you're using your own money too. They have zero say what you do with your own damn money. 

To avoid this in the future, it might be worth looking into opening a PO box, since then only you can have access to your own mail. I got one and it was like, $80 for nine months I think? 

I sincerely hope you can get out of that situation though, the whole thing sounds toxic as hell, and nobody deserves that.
I’m so sorry you went through that. None of that is acceptable. You have a right to a bra just as much as any other woman, and repeatedly misgendering you on top of that was absolutely not cool. Sending love. ♥️
The real woman comment is so weird and it seems like it was said intentionally to hurt you. Like there are a shortage of bras on Amazon or in the US um what lol
I'm sorry OP, you deserve better.
I'm sorry you had to go through that :( I'm absolutely not going to try to convince you not to drop her, you don't owe her another chance but if it's important to you that she's in your life I will say this - I have a whole list of family members I'm cutting out of my life once I'm old enough to leave, what I didn't expect was my grandma to make it off of that list. She's always been very religious and against all lgbtq, when I came out she was very transphobic and refused to use the right name and pronouns and constantly made invalidating comments, it's been almost 2 years now and she doesn't use my pronouns much but she uses my name, she corrects herself when she calls me girl, she puts my preferred name and pronouns and my true identity if asked for on things such as medical forms and school stuff, she said she would buy me a giant octopus stuffed animal (smth I've always wanted bc I love octopi) when I get top surgery, she buys me clothes from the men section, she got upset when she found out my mom told me I need to be put in a mental hospital for being trans, she watches shows with lgbtq characters in it with me and she doesn't roll her eyes or make offensive comments anymore, she just sees us as people now & not some horrible sin. Overall she's come a long way and I'm very happy, I hope one day the mistakes of calling me a girl will stop and she'll start using my pronouns more, but I'm willing to be patient considering how much she's grown so far :) my point is, your mom could definitely change and grow and learn, I can't make any promises and not everyone will change like my grandma has, but there's a chance. You don't have to give her that chance if it's too much to handle, that's completely valid and understandable, but if you do I just want you to know there is hope <3


More about my transphobic family who has changed if you want to read:

my mother still hasn't used the right pronouns for me as far as I know but she called me Tyler a couple times (I don't live with her so I'm not sure if she talks about me with my real name more when I'm not around or not) and when her bfs kids were mocking me being trans she got so pissed off bc they were making me uncomfortable and she accidentally broke a bowl bc she slammed smth down, honestly it felt good to finally feel like my mom believes that I'm trans and sees how it effects me when ppl are transphobic, she also talked to her bf about how disrespectful his kids were being and said she wants me to feel safe and comfortable in her home.

My brother actually outted me, I technically didn't come out. He pretended to be supportive, he would call me brother, but when he called me he/him his tone sounded like he was mocking me, and I overheard him making fun of me and saying it's just a stupid phase (that was a little over a year ago) but now (as far as ik) he's genuinely supportive, he always calls me Tyler, he tries to use he/him for me he messes up sometimes bc he was used to using she/her around transphobic family members for a while, but he always uses the right terms around his friends, which I rlly didn't expect bc his friends seemed like they'd bully me. Turns out I was wrong, ig you can't judge someone before you get to know them. Once he was otp with a friend and he asked who he was with and my brother told him ""my brother and gf"", another time I was talking to him while he was on a game and his friend asked if that's his sister talking, he said ""no that's my brother"", I met one of his friends recently (I knew him when I was a kid), he said ""oh is that your sister?"" And my brother said ""That's Tyler"" his friend casually apologized and complimented my hair :)) I even saw his messages with his gf once (bc he was messaging her on my phone and didn't exit out of it) and he was using my correct name and pronouns, it felt good bc for a long time I thought he only used them when I was around and when I could hear and it was all performative, but that made me realize that isn't true :)


My Aunt had argued with me about whether she was transphobic or not before (she was) and how ppl just have ""different beliefs"" but later on she bought me a pride bracelet and had it sent to my house as a surprise, she added a little note that said ""I love you Simon"" (Simon was my preferred name at the time.)

My dad never rlly showed signs he'd be transphobic but also never any signs he'd be supportive so I rlly didn't know how he'd react, I'd gone by different names before when I identified as non-binary and he always smiled, hugged me, and used that name, and same with when I went by Simon (more masculine, more obvious that I'm a trans guy) I never officially told him I'm trans, but it still felt nice.


They've all come a long way (my mom's still iffy tbh, she just recently kinda started to understand) and I'm so glad I gave them the opportunity to change. Truthfully I probably wouldn't have if I had been old enough to leave.

Not all families come around, but I never in a million years thought that mine would, so hopefully this helps someone :)
Next time you buy something like that on Amazon, I suggest you download Deliveries Package Tracker by oRRs. Just input the tracking number / Amazon login details (login is needed for packages delivered by Amazon Logistics and not something like FedEx or USPS) and leave instructions saying to leave it somewhere you can find. If USPS is delivering your package, just go to the postal office holding it and get it. Taking these steps could help you transition without taking shit from anyone. Sorry you're going through this OP, I hope your family comes around and changes their minds.
It will take time. All these things change over time and consistency. Definitely clarify how you feel and how difficult it already is for you.
Id be like “Look Man, i can buy what I want. I am a woman and no matter what you say or think that will never change, so you might as well get fucking used to it” “Bitch”
Don't waste your breath on rotten people like that. They never supported you and its obvious from your quotes.
I am so sorry. And this is cold comfort I know, but now you know where they stand.

I wish there were no way for you to “mess up;” I wish it were just okay.
woman's acting like there's a bra shortage lmao what a cunt

fuck em all, you'll thank yourself for cutting them off unfortunately. this fucking sucks i hope it gets better soon
As someone who used to sell thrift clothes, this is total BS.

Literal tons of clothes get wasted everyday simply because they're 'out of style' and undergarments are definitely no exception.

People change size, personal taste, and preferred textiles by the day. There's always MORE than enough for everyone!
You are a real woman, if you use the bras they aren’t wasted on you. Don’t let her ignorance drag you down 💜
I don't tend to get super mad at transphobic stories on here, but this genuinely riled me up. ""A real woman could use it"" she can fuck right off with that sort of attitude, you are a real woman,  and she is seriously gonna be losing out big once you move out. You are worth the effort, you're an amazing woman, you are valid. It is absolutely her loss to alienate herself from such a beautiful daughter just because she can't get over herself.
This really hurt me to read and I am crying right now. Just remember, your chosen family will always support you sister.
I was going to said to you that there is not big deal until the last quote...
Wtf it's not like bra are a limited ressource... if you buy one you fuel a market and on a very small scale you incentivise someone to make one cheaper.
Stay strong op
I didn’t realize that bras were on allocation and that only some women deserved them. I guess she should donate all her bras to those in need since she is an ass of a person. Let nice people have them and she can do without.

I hope you are able to get away and be safe soon.
People say “look man” as a generic reference and isn’t something to really care about tbh lol
“There are real women who need stuff like this”

Bitch, the fuck?? That was unfathomably rude. Hope you’re okay
You should talk to your mother about it. She obviously doesn’t get it and needs a kick in the ass. Cause seriously what if you called her not a real woman? She’d be heavily offended! It’s the same shit! You can’t be sheepish about it either. I know it sucks but you need to sit your mom down with staunch intentions of telling her what she did and how it hurt you and that she owes you an apology. Furthermore you need to have more conversations about gender. Explain it literally every way you can until she gets it. If she can’t get it then just ask her to sympathize and support you. Also your mom is just dead wrong about the bras they’re not even that good for your boobs and basically every woman already has one at least.
You are a real woman. And there’s no shortage of bras. Your mom is just using everything as an excuse to be a bigot. And it will take time, but you will find a family that you choose and will love you for you.
Cut her brakes, they're for 'real drivers' only anyway. Joking aside, this sucks, sending hugs. <3
Those clothes aren't being ""wasted"" on you, you are a real woman and you do, in fact, need those clothes. Your need for them isn't any less than someone else's. I'm sorry your mom is a transphobe, but you're a wonderful, beautiful woman and nothing she has to say can change that. <3
I just… 

Okt, first, I’m so sorry your mom’s transphobic and hiding behind your grandfather. You deserve to accepted by your family. 

That said, I almost have to laugh at this, because your mom thinks you should give up being a woman because *there’s a bra shortage??*

As if capitalism doesn’t overproduce in the extreme. As if the difficulty in (some) breast-having people’s access to bras is a lack of resources, rather than the expense due to the demand for ever growing profits for business owners and shareholders.

It’s like she couldn’t think of a better argument than “there are starving children in Africa” and just tried to crossapply it to bras. 

I can’t even. That’s so ridiculous.
From one real woman to another, you deserve all the bras!!!
Well I want to guess that she didn't genuinely know but at the same time I feel like she did know. But the fact that she wanted to know was kind of out of character for her at this point. Also I've had tons of moments for my mother just straight up doesn't see me as a trans woman and still sees me as her son.
Yeah, when I buy binders I just tell whoever I’m living with (if they deem to ask) that it’s underwear. It’s not a lie and none of them have been weird enough to demand a look so it’s worked out pretty well.
What an awesome guy you are! 👏👏👏
Same I don't need my bra licence any more and my dress licence and my long hair licence and my girl shit licence
Thanks, I'm just tired at this point
[deleted]
Thank you, I got this mostly because of that and because my breast were getting bigger and I wanted to be a bit more courteous and not have my boobs Just poking out at people
Agree 100%. For the last 35 years, my circle of friends since high school has remained tight (as have all significant others and kids). We even vacation together at every opportunity ... it's almost 40 people.

They are my family. Most of my relatives do nothing but bicker and talk behind each other's backs. And I know my mother is not going to be supportive when I come out once doing so is safe.

So I'll have my daughter and my friend-family. That's all I need.
This.
Thank you so much, I had to take a nap to just sleep off all the anger I felt but I'm so glad to see messages like this
Yeah that's something that her and her father are horribly notorious for. I picked up on their gaslighting earlier on in my transition. My mother when told me I should've saved my sperm to have grandkids and tried to guilt trip and manipulate me into stopping HRT and doing a sperm collection thing.
Yeah, I'm just now starting to realize that I was pretty dumb. But I'm also starting to realize she used to excuse for a large amount of things like when she took me out the pick out clothes she would tell me to put them back because ""a real girl could use them'
...did you just make a Terminator 2 reference? :D
Thank you so much, it was starting to get to me a few hours ago too. I was so confused and hurt thinking it was wasted on me.
They should be more grateful, a lot of good people died for their country in the Bra Wars.
I feel you but I even fear for you. I can't imagine coming out to children, I've heard so many horror stories about it. I hope everything goes well, I give my best wishes
It hurt a bit because I've been trying to have a good relationship with my mother because I want her to be the last person I could depend on transwise but it hurt me so bad that I had to take a nap to really think and kind of sleep off all the anger, confusion, and hurt I had.
Exactly, and besides the reason why I'm wearing it is because I want to be more courteous and also because since my breasts are getting bigger it's kind of awkward to just have them out
Thank you, I've been getting serious lately about Gtfo of here. After I recover from  COVID, it's on!
Damn my reply is longer than the original post 😃 sorry abt that 😭
I know but some part of me wanted to give them a chance since they were family. But now I'm starting to realize that family doesn't really matter if they don't really respect you. But again I wanted to give them a chance and now I see I can and it really does hurt.
Yeah, I hate reality sometimes because it's something I can't control and sometimes that's something may hurt me. This definitely did
Nah she has very heavy emphasis on the man part, I can understand it if it was just ""look man"", ""look dude"" but nah she put too much emphasis on that one, also it was the way she looked at me while saying it is what gave it away
Funny thing is she told me she wanted me to have a license by the end of the month because I need to start driving instead of ""wasting my money""
That‘s harsh, sorry OP. :-/  
Hey maybe they‘ll change their views? Many cis folks seem to ease up once people transition (if you want that).
Ask her then why shes buying them?
Go find people who *actually* understand you. Maybe one day, your mom will come around, but if she doesn't, that *says nothing* about you as a person just because *she* chose to be transphobic.

I don't know about this concept as it pertains to being trans honestly (I'm still closeted) but some family are the people you want to keep with you through life and some are the type you need to slap an NFPA diamond on and dump only at a chemical waste processing facility 'cause they are *toxic.*

Edit: Also, *why are they opening your mail? So they have something new to baselessly gaslight and guilt-trip you over? Super cool of them.*
My wife has told me around a year mark, “hey honey you have a really breasts popping out of your shirt, you probably need some bra”. 😀 Until then I’ve not wore any bra and now I’m wearing only sports bra.
That's super fucked up.  Your reproductive decisions are none of her fucking business.
>  ""a real girl could use them'

“I agree, that’s why I picked them!”
Wow.  Yeah she doesn’t respect you.
wtf it's not like there's a clothing shortage
:D
You matter just as much as everyone else. I wish you the best of luck. 

I ran from my family when I was old enough for different reasons, and the space has helped us all get along better. 

Also: the family I have made for myself since leaving home is far more supportive than my blood family. There is hope, and you can do it. :)
honestly that's so fair and pretty good coping mechanism too. i really hope things get better and she stops being that way. no one deserves to be treated that way
You'll be OK Hun I just wouldn't respect or listen to any more of their opinions. They obviously don't respect or listen to any of yours.
Oh wow, sorry to hear that. If it makes you feel any better you have my support, maybe it's not much coming from an internet stranger but I believe in you. If you buy something with your own money it's your own business and nobody else's. Hope your mom learns to cope with you making your own choices. You're going to make it, that's for sure.
Well I've been beginning to transition, with the obvious case being my chest and then finding out about me taking my pills in secret. But yeah I think I just need to come out fully and just own it
Not so Funny thing is even before I was trans she kept saying she wanted grandbabies and everything. There was one time she made it all about grandbabies for no good reason and she kept asking me uncomfortable questions and kept telling me to ""be a man"" when I was saying how I was uncomfortable about the questions
this
Yeah I understand now. I really do
You should! I encourage every trans person to live their life as their true self as fast as possible. You do NOT want to be on your deathbed wishing you had come out earlier. Own it. You are you. All this bullshit that society tells us about ourselves is dead wrong and they do it because they’re trying to kill us! Being trans is a punk experience! Fight the power! Be yourself! And don’t ever ever ever sacrifice your own well being and your LITERAL PIPELINE TO HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT for some notion of “peace” in your family. It’s not fucking worth it. Be you. Own it. If your family can’t handle it then show them how wrong they are. You’re just a girl, sis. Ain’t nothing wrong with being a girl.
In any case I wish you good luck and strong nerves!
I really don't understand parents' entitlement over wanting grandchildren.  They had their children and raised them, let your kids make their own choices about if they want their own children or not, and respect their decisions.  Jesus Christ.
You'll be okay hun. We're all here for you 😊
Damn Sis, i love this anarchist vibe. I want to burn my bra with you...but i just bought em and i'd feel naked without them. So...how about coffee? Love the energy!
Thank you so much
Yeah I know my family is obsessed with babies like the moment I turn 17 they kept telling me how I needed to start acting like a man so that a woman would get with me because no woman would get with me with the way I was acting which wasn't anyway because I really didn't have a personality. I just mostly stayed in my room because I was afraid.

I've stopped doubting my identity	"I recently came out to my parents as trans (mtf), and it went alright, but some of the things they said made me really uncomfortable, and I started to question my feelings and whether they were ""real"". However, I put on makeup for the first time yesterday, and it was the most comfortable I've ever felt in my own body. I finally understand what people mean when they talk about gender euphoria."	"Hurray!
Keep it up, make sure it's your no d you listen to
[deleted]
I'm so proud keep it up and it's alright I accept you
I'm pleased to hear that and so happy for you. Remember that feeling the next time anyone makes you doubt yourself (including you) 💜
It takes time for them to understand and they might now and then say something that'll hurt you or make you question yourself. But to them its all new and they may think your just going through a fase.... But time and being persistent ironclad will make them see what you're going through is a real thing............... And try explaining to them how you feel when it's bad.
That’s good! My situation, my family is accepting although they make no attempt to correctly gender me, and still call me Noah
so proud of you!!!
I bet you're beautiful love :)
Listen to your heart, not what others think or say. Im glad your happy.
Never be afraid to be you, hun. Those who are meant to be in your life will stay there. You’ll experience losses, some harder than others, but just remember to keep your head up. This is a long, treacherous journey, but it’s worth every step!
Gender euphoria is an amazing feeling isn't it?
Tbh doubting yourself is normal! It sucks that society forces us to think that we have to be 100% certain. But every major decision that we make has to have doubt that’s how we think about it. An example would be marriage cis hets have doubts when they get married but it’s acceptable for them to have those doubts. It’s the same for us. I hope that makes sense I tend to just talk lol
I also came out of my hole of a lie as Non binary but I already put some make up on for 3 years so I'm a little bit experienced in this thing but 2 days ago I put some makeup on after a long time I think but I don't feel very comfortable I feel something is missing and I know what the rest of my body is missing I feel it so much
Congrats!
Your no d?
That's so pog😊
They're just ignorant to the subject, but they're making an effort to learn more, which I really appreciate. They're both definitely doing their best, and I can recognise that this is hard for them too.
Thank you 💜
Well said :)
It sure is :)
Did you just ask about my genetials?!

Oh no I made a typo, a bad one lol

What I wanted to say was.

Make sure it is you, you listen  to
Nice to hear they're making an effort, not all parents do... And I hope you will get even more Euphoria in the future <3
Of course sweetie!
That's a very nice thing to say, thank you 💜"	njwn0s	trans	897	0.99	2021-05-24 12:18:48
Help with young child questioning gender	"My son is still very young (almost 5), and every since he could talk, he's basically given every sign that he identifies as being female (I'm still using he/him pronouns because he has not requested to be referred to as she/her... I don't even know if 5 year olds understand pronouns though lol). Anyways, for as long as I can remember, he has always preferred female characters from shows and toys. Whenever he plays imaginary games he is ALWAYS the mom or the princess. He's also pointed at a female character in a book and told me that's him... the girl.

As he's gotten older, he's started requesting dresses and anything that is ordinarily deemed ""girly"". At first, he was just stealing his sister's clothes, but when I realized how much he liked her clothes, we went out and bought him his own wardrobe filled with dresses and all things pink. He's also started to grow his hair out because he wants to look more like a girl.

I really don't know if 5 is too young to know your gender, but I'm really just doing my best to follow his lead and help him be comfortable no matter which gender he aligns with, but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing which is why I'm posting.

What are good ways I can support him and what are things I should be sure not to do?

Should I let him wear dresses to school at this age or should I worry that he's not old enough yet to be able to deal with bullies? I hate that I have to worry about that, but there is no doubt that he will encounter mean people in school. Right now, he's happy with wearing his clothes at home, to stores, and around family and friends who are supportive.

Is it common for trans children this age to so strongly identify with the other gender or is that something that typically develops around puberty?

If you are trans, did your parents do things at a young age that you thought was helpful and supportive? If not, what do you wish they would have done for you? 

I'm not trans, but I did not having emotionally supportive parents. I want my own children to have a different experience and feel supported no matter what which is why I'm here asking for help.

Thank you!

Update: Thank you so much for the support, suggestions, and for sharing your own stories! I probably won't be able to respond to every comment, but I've read them all and really appreciate them. I've already ordered several of the book suggestions and am excited to share them with him.

I obviously don't know whether he will be a trans adult or not, but I think that right now, teaching him that he has our full support to explore his own identity is the most important thing. Our other kids are also learning about gender expression differences as well which I hope will help them to become better adults."	"I don’t have any experience with a situation like this, but I think the most important thing you can do (aside from doing what you’re already doing) is make sure he knows trans people exist. Maybe buy or get some picture books from the library about trans kids or look up if there are age appropriate videos or tv shows with trans kids (or adults)
I’m on this forum for my trans daughter who is 6. I only realized this year what she had been telling us since she was 3. Your story sounds very similar to ours. I don’t have any answers for you, but I’m glad we finally heard our girls voices.

I recently learned about how hard it is for kids to transition later in life, and families have told me how lucky we are to know so early. The best advice I’ve received thus far is to just “love the child you have today”. I’ve found this lowers my anxiety about the 1000 questions I have that don’t actually need answers to yet. 

Good luck to you both on your journey!
[deleted]
5 is absolutely not too young, the average age at which children begin communicating their gender is age 3
Honestly besides letting them know what being Trans is and that Transgender people exist, it sounds like you're absolutely slaying the parent thing. I wish I had parents like you at that age. 😕

You're already being extremely supportive. I think once they grasp the idea of what it means to be Trans, the answers may come quicker. Either way, props on doing what you've already done and asking questions.  Sending love
r/cisparenttranskid could be a great resource for you! It’s full of folks having these same discussions.

Some people know as young as 3 or 4, others don’t have issues with their gender until puberty or beyond. You look to be on the right track with helping your kid out, and finding community with other parents can be invaluable. Thanks for reaching out!
You might find Jeffrey Marsh’s work (@thejeffreymarsh on Instagram) helpful. They’re non-binary, knew it at a young age, and post about self-acceptance, parenting, and all things gender. Thank you for being a good parent to your kid!
My friend has a genderfluid (?) child who’s been questioning their gender since like 5? They’re 10 now. They don’t fully understand their gender yet and that’s ok because both of their parents support them. Like they told their mom “on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays I’m gonna be a girl and on Tuesdays and Thursdays a boy”. When questioned on the weekends they were just like “🤷🏼 I’m with mommy and daddy”. 

Anyways they wear dresses to school and overall they haven’t had many issues. They’re also allowed nail polish but more make up than that is for the weekend (which I think is normal for most elementary school kids?) There’s one boy who can be a bit of a bully, but everyone else seems to be ok and they worked it out so they won’t be in the same class next year.  We’re in New England in the US, so your mileage in schools can vary.

>What are good ways I can support him and what are things I should be sure not to do?

Don't read too much into it right now, a child's development is a long and messy process. They will be going through a lot of self exploration, just try your best to follow their needs where they lead. You're already doing really well in this department!

If this trend continues, find a good psychiatrist that specializes with LGBT issues in children and seek their input. Sexual differentiation happens at puberty, so you have lots of time ahead of you and you're in the right mindset to raise them right. No serious changes need to happen until then, and your child will be much better equipped to decide whether they want to transition.
It depends on the person when they realize they identify with the other gender, but your kid is definitely not too young. I know I questioned my identity as a young kid (unsupportive conservative grandparents didn’t allow me to be who I wanted to be). I’ve always leaned on the masculine side. I’m not gonna say it’s “common” but it’s certainly not impossible/super rare! Allowing him to make choices is definitely important! When/if he decides to change his pronouns and/or name the best thing would be for you to be fully supportive and allow him to make those decisions. Some things that would’ve been helpful for me personally: 1. Knowing that trans people exist. I didn’t know that till like a year before I came out. 2. HRT (hormones) are important to us (as trans people). We experience gender dysphoria and some parents are kinda jerks about hrt. Yes, I believe you should know the issues that could happen with hrt, but I think you should try to be open to the idea if he brings it up. Of course, not all trans people want hormones so that’s something to think about too. I think you’re doing the right thing :)
Reminds me of me when I was younger. Unfortunately, crippling social anxiety manifested itself at a very young age and I was very scared to ask to try girl things. I'd say the best you can do is try to follow along with the kid, and continue to support them until they know who they are
I can’t guarantee how your child will end up identifying, but what i can say is, let them figure out themselves and allow them to experiment and self-express according to what they feel. Without barring him from that opportunity or ‘putting him into a box’ that may not fit.


I know I sure wish my parents did this when I was younger, instead of pushing me into a box I didn’t even realise was wrong for me. Would have saved a lot of years of confusion and fear to be myself.
When I was 5, I would steal my sister's clothes. At that age I didn't know what being transgender was but I remember wishing I was born female. As I got older and understood what being trans was, I was very conflicted as I was raised by anti-LGBTQ parents. I would go back and forth between accepting it and even shaving my legs at 16, and denying it. I finally accepted it about a year ago and I'm 19 now. Point is, I think you're doing a good job easing your kid into their own identity! If they're showing signs that early, its likely they won't change their mind as it obviously caught up with me. I wish my parents would have taken the approach you are.
It could be a phase, it could be for life. The only way to know for sure is to give it time. So long as you support your kid and don’t try to enforce any gender norms, it’s all good.
I was a kid like this! I’m a trans man, but at his age I used to wear khaki shorts and polo shirts all the time because it’s what my dad wears to work and I wanted to look like him. I didn’t really have a concept of gender too much back then I think, it only hit me when we hit 4th/5th grade and suddenly boys and girls couldn’t be friends and play together because it was “weird” or something- that was when I started to feel out of place. Even then, I didn’t know that you *could* be trans until I was around 12/13 and Caitlyn Jenner was in the news. As another anecdote, a friend of mine is a trans woman and as early as 4 would tell her parents to call her different Disney Princess names depending on how she’s feeling and she did the same thing with her hair and clothes (her name is Belle- which is an adorable origin story).

With that in mind- I think it’s best to let your kid explore and do whatever they want, but I think it might be good to have a conversation with the school administration and maybe also your kid about how people might react to them. not telling them to assume people will be bullies, but how to respond and what to do if it happens, and how their words shouldn’t impact what they want to do and look like. r/cisparenttranskid might be good as a resource too, although there’s a lot less traffic
[deleted]
So, I didn't realize it when i was young but looking back I was showing very similar signs as your child (my earliest memory is me being obsessed with skirts (i still am but thats beside the point)) no age is too young for someone to question their gender identity and it might help prevent trauma, dysphoria and internalized transphobia to some degree if they figure it out early. (most likely wont fully go away, i am very aware) Also it will help with puberty if its figured out before hand and, although i know this is far in the future, puberty blockers are really usefull from what I've heard. Hope this helped in anyway, I'm writing this super sleep deprived at 3:30 am so I'm sorry if its not
You’re doing a great job! I’m trans, FTM, and I showed signs of it very young. My parents hated it and wouldn’t let me explore those ideas. So I suppressed it and it came out just last year. I wish they had allowed me to be myself so I wouldn’t be so confused and hurt all the time. I’m glad to see more parents like you, good job :)
5 year olds are old enough to know what does and doesn't make them feel happy. To him, dysphoria is just sad. Im of the opinion to let children express themselves how they want without much boundary. If I were you I'd let him do what makes him happy.
I knew at 4 that I was not like the other boys. I don’t know if this is common, but it is not uncommon to know that young. I think it’s particularly telling because children of that age don’t understand transgender; they just know who they are and what they like. Allowing your child to wear dresses can come with issues, like bullying. Perhaps you can talk to the school and see how supportive they are willing to be. Best of luck!
I’m not an expert at this but children that young have been able to tell they’re trans but it’s less common until they get older. You’re doing the right thing though by letting them experiment as even if they aren’t, it should instil some good qualities around gender as they get older. Hope it all goes well and wish all the best for you and your wee one! :)

Also, if you’re worried, go see a doctor. They’ll probably forward you onto some mental health specialist who can help you because it’s always hard having a potentially trans child as you aren’t really told about it beforehand. Best wishes!
if your child wants to do something, let them! gender exploration is common in children, and does not always mean that they are trans. however, if they are, it is important to let them decide. just give your son some time, and im sure answers will arise
When I was little, about this age, I knew I was a boy. I didn't want to wear the girls clothes or shoes and would only play with 'boy ' toys. 
I wanted my hair short so I refused to brush my hair or have it brushed.
Any time I needed to be dressed up and  have my hair brushed It was a full break down, I was crying, my parents were exhausted and both of our patience was running out, so we compromised.  

 Something that helped me was my dad got me my haircut, short but still girl. 
My mom got me shirts and light up shoes with dinosaurs on them. And all my dresses were replaced by overalls and pants. 
 Nothing was overly boy or girl but it was enough for me. 

I didn't know how to explain myself but I knew I was a boy and just wasn't sure how. I didn't understand why I was treated like a girl or given a name that made me so sad and angry. 

Your child may be cis or trans and grow up to decide he's a boy. Or she will be a girl. Or a they / them. 

Either way I'm sure you letting your child be a child and listening and trying to understand as they express feelings they may not understand is going to make everything so much easier. 

Wish you and your family a happy, healthy life!
I would say let him be who he is as much as possible, and take him seriously. One of my earliest memories was around 4 years old, telling my mother that I was a girl, and I was dead serious. This was the early 80s, so there was no such thing in mainstream culture or in most people's minds about trans people, so my parents really didn't know what to do or if I was just saying stuff without really knowing what I was saying.

Even as it became crystal clear, almost exactly as you've described about your own child, they were also very concerned about bullys, and my entire life growing up, there was very little that I could do that was ""for girls"" that wouldn't get me beaten up or ridiculed. Long hair? Nope. Pierced ears? Nope? ""Girl"" toys? Nope. Dresses and skirts...absolutely not. 

But my parents I think, did a decent job of balancing what I wanted to do with what was acceptable at the time. And even then, I was always getting bullied for things I liked or did or said. There was no way around it.

Times have changed a lot, though I can't speak for exactly how much or to your particular city / state / region. I do have a niece who is 12, whose best friend is a trans girl. 

It still will be rough, it's not going to be easy. Love your child and support them all the way through, whatever they decide or need to do. ❤️
My friend has a kid who seems to be leaning towards girl since they were that age. Every morning they ask if they are feeling more like a boy or girl for the day and just follow their lead. From what I can tell most of the time they go with girl and seem much happier these days Do what you need to make sure your child is happy and healthy and you wont go wrong
Your kid might not actually know that different pronouns are even an option. Have you ever asked them about pronouns? (Hey do you want me to say he or she when I’m talking about you? Maybe the next time you can ask if they want to wear dresses to school and have people call them a girl then. Is switching schools an option for you?) You control a lot about whether this is an option for your kid. Your kid can be a girl if (she) wants to and if you support her as a parent and in your /(her) communities. Don’t live in fear of the bullies. Be political about it if you live in texas (or if you live elsewhere in the US), build a better world about it.

It’s really easy for everyone in an elementary school to accept that this kid who looks like a girl, acts like a girl, whose parents say she’s a girl… is a girl. You know? There might not actually be more bullying if she socially transitions, there might even be less; maybe this helps her make social bonds as she goes through school. 

No, I don’t think your kid is too young to be trans. Sounds like it’s pretty instinctual for them. A lot of people do know when they’re young. Sometimes people don’t have the autonomy/opportunity/safety to express those things. If you and your family, etc support her everything will probably feel very normal. And your kid is young enough that they could have more control over their own puberty if they they want to later on. Just because a lot of people realize they want to transition after having been through a puberty that ended up giving them dysphoria doesn’t mean that’s the only way people have to be trans.
I think you’re doing great. You’re not pushing anything, the kid has the lead and I think that’s important, you’re being the most supportive you can.

About the other questions, well, we all experience gender in different ways, so yeah, even though puberty is when for most people it hits, kids can realize it early (Kim Petras is a trans musician that transitioned I think at 7)

And no, my parents were definitely not supportive when I was a kid. I wish they would just listen to me and not completely ignore what I was saying, even though I couldn’t articulate like an adult
First off, you're doing great already! You're allowing and encouraging your kid to affirm their gender, and you've come here to ask questions! 

I'd ask your kid if they want you to call them a girl, use she/her, or pick a new name. Explain what gender is, and that they can change it if they want. You don't need to go deep into it (and probably shouldn't) but it's good to teach them the basics. Also make sure to say that they don't need to make a decision right away, they can think about it and come back later, and it's their choice no matter what. If your kid wants to be a girl, congratulations! You have a daughter! If your kid wants to be a boy, then you just have a son who likes girly things, which is great too! 

If you want to minimize bullying, one option could be to wait until the next school year. Coordinate with the school to make sure your daughter is introduced as a girl and the teachers know what to do. The other kids will probably just think she's another girl they haven't met before, and they won't even know! 

If your kid turns out to be a girl, I'd suggest preparing your insurance, medical care, etc for anything she may need down the line. She may want/need to start puberty blockers or hormones in less than 10 years, so make sure your insurance both promises to cover for that and is known to follow through with that promise.

Also keep in mind that I'm not a parent or an expert, just a trans girl on the internet describing what I wish my parents had done. Hope this helps!
Speaking from experience I identified as female probably since I was 3 years old, or at least as early as I could remember; but I grew up in a really conservative household and even indicating something like that was extremely discouraged, but yeah I knew what gender I was long before puberty, and puberty sucked.
Be my mom please
This is such a sweet post- I wish more parents were like this.

While I don’t have any advice, I think what you’re doing is awesome! Keep up the good work :)
I always messed around with femme things at a really young age and liked them, but was turned away and yelled at a lot of the time due to it. Just support them and do what you are. Sounds like you are doing your best and that’s what matters! Wish my parents were like you <3
Just support him or her. And if he says he's trans try to see a doctor in a gender clinic.
The best advice I could try to give is to be supportive, listen to your kid's feelings and make sure you take his opinion into consideration- evenif he's young. These seem like pretty obvious things but a lot of parents can worry or stress about certain decisions that'll affect their kid and accidentally overlook what their kids might want

While I certainly didn't know this early, I started questioning around puberty. My parents weren't supportive, and my mum is still a firm believer that I'll thank her for what shes done when I'm her age (""if I support this and your not trans you'll hate me for it, but if I don't support this and you really are trans you'll hate me for that, too"" type of thought process)
My mum loved me- still loves me- but she tends to overlook me or my brother's opinions on our own lives because we're seen as children in her eyes.

You're already doing miles by asking for advice and listening to your kid's needs. I salute you, and hope that you're able to figure things out along the way
[deleted]
I just wanna say as a young(ish) adult who wasn’t supported right away and didn’t come out until middle school im crying happy tears right now to hear parents are actually paying attention to these kinds of things i can’t even imagine what my life would have been like if my parents had supported me like that and that young even tho i was still lucky to start transitioning in middle school. so from all the trans kids who would’ve done anything to have parents like you thank you for giving your child that support
I don't have kids so can't really give good advice but in case no one else has recommended it so far I just found an amazing podcast last week called 'how to be a girl'
It is a mother of a trans girl documenting parts of their experience. It started in 2016 when the girl was 6 and she apparently told her mother as young as 3 that she was a girl.
The women also apparently has a blog though I haven't seen that yet as I still have more episodes to get through.
I think it might be really good for you to listen to as it is a women who has done this and seems very open to giving advice.
The fact that you have come here asking shows you are willing to go the distance for your kid so yeah just please keep being the awesome parent you are!!!
speaking from similar experience - I knew I was not a boy at an early age as well, but this was back during the Reagan administration and Thatcher governments, so that was quickly kiboshed. It absolutely wrecked my sense of self for the better part of three decades.

Let your child explore who they are. Nothing will destroy a child's self-esteem and self worth faster than forcing them into an artificial mould.

Let them know they will be heard! If they come to you and say ""I'm a girl"", you better believe it and act like it.

Let your school know what's going on. depending on where you are living, they may be chill or not, but at least it won't be a surprise. At the absolute minimum, let your child be themselves at home. Tell them you love them and give them all the affirmation you can and then some.

it **may** come to pass that this leads nowhere - yes, it happens - and they **might** grow out of it, but if and until that happens, support them no matter what.
I don’t have expirience in this, so just know i’m no professional.

I would just say to roll with it. Support them in whatever way they request support. If they want dresses and dolls, give them dresses and dolls. Let them explore it on their own and just let them know you support them no matter how they feel genderwise. If it comes to the point in a decade or so when puberty would start and they still feel this way, maybe consult a doctor in good time to see if hormones are an option. They’re still young enough that no big decisions need to be made, so just foster whatever they like and who ever they say they are
If I had been given the knowledge and been treated with openness and kindness and love as you have been doing already, I would have been expressing such things as early as your kid. You’re doing amazing and I deeply appreciate the love and care you have for your kid. 💜
>I really don't know if 5 is too young to know your gender

It's not. I was wishing I were a girl as young as 3-4 years old. It never stopped.

>Should I let him wear dresses to school at this age or should I worry that he's not old enough yet to be able to deal with bullies?

Yes absolutely. In fact if you let him present as a girl bullies might not even know your child is trans. You having your kid's back (and your kid confident in your support) will mean so much more than the hurt a bully could possibly inflict. Trust me on this. I would have killed to have a parent as supportive as you are.

>Is it common for trans children this age to so strongly identify with the other gender

It's not unheard of

>If you are trans, did your parents do things at a young age that you thought was helpful and supportive? 

No. I learned very early on that I should hide my inclinations toward anything feminine. I didn't want to be seen as ""gay"" and thus ""lesser""

>If not, what do you wish they would have done for you?

They could have started by not being homophobic. My family laughed so hard at the ""man in a dress"" joke that was on media so often. Stuff like that made me so afraid to be myself.

>I'm not trans, but I did not having emotionally supportive parents. I want my own children to have a different experience and feel supported no matter what which is why I'm here asking for help.

From a trans mom to another mom - who was also raised by emotionally unsupportive/unavailable parents - you're doing awesome. Parents like you give me hope for our future.
A woman I work with, her granddaughter is 7 and one of her friends in class is a trans girl and everyone is accepting of it. The kids just get on with school and there’s no bullying. I have found tho that Scotland is very much a progressive part of the uk for the most part. Like where I live I’ve only had a couple of issues with hate. I think being supportive as you are now is really important and letting your child discover who they are while making sure they’re ok and happy is hugely important. I never had that support and hid who I was until I was 42 which caused a lot of hurt over the years
Luckily if your kid is that young they have years and years to figure out their identity before they have to make any tough decisions.  Probably a good idea to talk to the school about whether or not it is a good idea to wear dresses.  I think you're probably right to be concerned about bullying but you also have to take into account whether or not they are uncomfortable with wearing boy clothes to school.
Depends honestly. They seem pretty clear about their identity but if its a hostile enviroment id try and get some consultation from a therapist.
My little boy wears dresses! He’s only 3 and doesn’t really care about gender, but he has a good mix of masculine and feminine things, shirts with Spider-Man are his favorite though. My plan is to continue to let him lead in what he wants to wear including his feminine things. All we can do as parents is grow with them and let them know their feelings and choices are valid. I’m so glad you’re so supportive of your kiddo as a trans person.
My daughter came out at just over 3 years. She's gender fluid and has an incredible grasp of gender and related topics. She had been wearing dresses and growing her hair out for about a year before that. She had just turned three when she used the words ""I'm a girl"". Now, being gender fluid, she does also have boy days and non-binary days. But she has a very sophisticated sense of her gender and what it means to her. 

One thing we wanted to do very early was mitigate unnecessary gender dysmorphia. So we really spent some effort normalizing the concept of a girl penis. We wanted her to know that lots of girls have them and they are totally normal. She was very disappointed to learn about the fact that as it currently stands that she could not carry a baby. So we spent some time showing her ways in which trans women can be mothers. She is very happy with that idea and is confident that she is destined for motherhood. 

Regarding bullying -- depends where you live. It's not a problem here, but I'm told that we are the exception (upper-middle class west coast Canada). I'm sure there could be some here... She's not in school yet. But my elder daughter had a trans teacher, so I'm pretty sure we're all relatively woke (fingers crossed at least). I'd make sure to have lots of talks (maybe therapy) to make sure that they are confident before bringing it to school. Make sure to show them all of the options. They could be non-binary and not see the ""girl"" lable as a perfect fit. Maybe they have a superficial concern holding them back? Or maybe they are a boy who is just a little fabulous? 

It's clear that you are already on the right path. Just remember that it's awesome to be trans. So if that's what your child is, don't just ""deal"" with it. Celebrate it.
Wdym strongly identify?? We trans people are trans from the day we are born
hey, so first of all, you're amazing, i know so many people who would just force their kid to wear male clothing, accepting parents are amazing.

oh btw imma use they/them pronouns for your kid in this post. but i think you should have a talk with your kid about if they want to be called a girl and about pronouns and stuff, at that age the best way to ask kids about pronouns is ask if they want to be called a her/him/them and then use the pronouns that your kid wants, and ask the school to use them to, it will help your kid a lot if their freinds and teachers call them a girl.

 i would do the same thing with names, ask your kid if they want to be called a difrent name, and if they do help them pick one if they havnt already, and then use it. it is possible that your kid might not want to change their name now, but might ask to later, and thats ok too! you really nead to follow your kid's lead on this one

if your kid wants to wear dresses and stuff to school, let them, i would talk to the school about it first, make sure the teachers are cool about it, and wouldnt treat them any difrent bc of it, but i honestly wouldnt worry about other kids, at that age they're pretty accepting, they probs will encounter bullies later on, but i think they're preaty safe at this age, you might want to encorage an open diyologe with your kid about school and stuff, make them know that its all right for them to talk to you about anything, and also have an open diologe with the school, make sure they tell you if there are any problems

and as for the relising your trans thing, most kids eather relise they're trans around the ages of 3-7 (even if they dont know what trans means then) or round the start of puberty, so i would trust your kid about it.

i think the thing i most wish my parents had done for me as a kid is buy me the clothes i was comfortable  in, they didnt, my parents are very transphobic, but i wish every day that they would. (its very hard to pretend your a guy when your parents forse you into pink, frilly dresses)

this is longer than i espected it to be, oh well. good luck, i think its great that you're suporting your kid like this

(i apologise for the spelling i'm dyslexic and auto corect usuly corects words to something horobul so i just dont use it and hope ppl understand me)
Never ever too young! My mum isn’t supportive now an I’m nearly 40. 
Trans kids have high rates of suicide the main cause is unsupported parents. 
The best thing you can do is keep a open mind and create a safe space for your child to explore their gender identity without judgment. It won’t be easy and it maybe a phase but you’re child will definitely be grateful for you as that get older if you have their back. 
Most children between the age of 3 and 5 know that their sex is different from their gender. 
Do some research, there’s tons of books out there. Join some online and irl groups. Keep asking questions here and just keep loving your kid unconditionally! As a community we need parents like that 🥰
Def knew when I was little, had it bullied out of me... was not good for my mental health. I would say just let them be gets my vote, accept them as they grow into their own experience of gender etc.. idk... The podcast ""How to be a girl"" documents the experience from someone in your situation, might be helpful because she asks obvious and hard questions so it's not just fluff.
By that age I once used the feminine form of ""thank you"" (in my language there's a small difference whether you're male or female) and I was ridiculed by it by an aunt. I'm sure it was ""all in good fun"" and they didn't think much about it. But I did and to this day I'm sour about. I'm now 26 and my family has no idea I'm trans, I've gone NC for about a year now.

I'm sorry, I have no advice and just wanted to vent. You're already being great and I wish I've had *you* growing up
I'm so glad you reached out here. I was the same. But my parents didn't care. I didn't even know trans people existed when I was little. Now I have to go through multiple surgries and such to become fem. I wish I came out a young age. I wish U would have had the guts to. I wish my family was accepting. I'm proud that you reached out and it warms my heart. You are an amazing parent. 

For advice, tell them about trans people, let them know if they want to be a girl, they can be a girl. If they say that they want to be a girl, then now you have a daughter. It's pretty simple. Kids know a lot more about themselves than you think.


If you are worried about it being to soon, one of my really good friends is transmasc and came out at 3. 

There are some negatives though. Being trans in today's world is really fucking hard, you will get hate. I get death threats ~3-5 times a day, and a lot of people will refuse to speak to me, including my coworkers and even a couple of the managers at my job. It will be your job as a parent to try and shield the hate as much as possible if they do decide that they are a girl. You will have to be an expert on literally all things trans to defend their existence. 

However, the positives will massively outweigh the negitives. Gender euphoria is amazing, and I actually feel happy for once after realizing I am a girl. Living trapped in the wrong body is a nightmare, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I hope your child can feel the same. 

In all, let them chose, and thank you for reaching out and being an ally.
what you're doing now is amazing. your kid is so lucky to have a parent like you!! some of the suggestions i've seen here are also really great and can help a lot. my mom is currently part of a facebook group that i believe is called the Mama Bears, it's a support group for parents of trans children where everyone can share their experiences, support each other, and find ways to better support their children.

there are a lot of groups out there just like this one. i would recommend looking around and seeing what your community has to offer. good luck :)
I agree with the comment that stated you should let your little child know that trans people exist. When I was a little kid I always pretended to be a boy when I played, and have always identified more with male characters. I didn’t know that trans people existed until I was 13, at which point I asked my parents if I might be trans and they flat out stated “No, you’re not.” It was only this year that I fully realized that I AM because that’s how I FEEL. Educating your child so they can describe how they feel and feel safe talking to you is HUGE. You’re absolutely killing it as a parent, this gives me so much hope.
do they* want to wear dresses to school? ask directly if they’d be more comfortable doing that
talk to your child’s teachers if you do decide to let them wear dresses to school, make sure your child knows you support them and they can come to you if anyone does bully them

talk to them about what being trans is in child friendly ways (picture books, simplified explanations, just outright ask if they feel like theyre a boy or girl (or something else))

the best option is to let your kid be comfortable and be themselves, i know from personal experience suppressing that was more harmful than any bullying or transphobia ive faced
First off, thank you! All children need the sort of love you’re showing, especially trans kids! 

I definitely think talking to the teacher, and gauging where the school is at, would be a good idea. I would also talk through it with your child, they may not even want to wear dresses to school. I know I would have been scared of that as a kid, but I come from a very conservative community. If you are doing your best to support and know teachers will do the same. That will do a lot to help withstand bullying. We all go through very difficult things in life and it goes miles to know someone has your back. The  mistreatment I get from strangers is far less hurtful than what I get from family. You can’t avoid the world being tough, especially if you’re trans. But as a parent you can do your best to give the tools to cope with that difficulty. 

You’re doing an excellent job! It’s really great how you’ve let him decide what to wear. Sometimes it’s hard to let your kids take the lead. It’s really important they know you’ll love no matter what!
i wanted to be a girl since i can remember, but i was uneducated on my rights as a person and i thought i was 'a glitch in the matrix' for wanting to be a girl. i'm 20 next month and highly regret not following myself at a younger age, you can absolutely be trans at any age. please, just hold his hand for the ride. and there's NOTHING wrong with asking him if he wants to be a girl. my advice is just to make him aware that he's allowed to be who he wants to be, and maybe educate him on select things down the road. like don't have a talk about genitals right yet but you can at least tell him he has a choice as to what his pronouns are, and ask him if he's comfortable being addressed as a girl or boy. also, idk like can you be my mom🥺, i'm kidding but genuinely we need more mothers like you. anyways back to talks, when it comes time to educate him on genital related things, just know even if he's comfortable with his current genitalia but decides to be a woman that he's still valid. 

 note: i used (he/him) because from the sounds of it with my limited context, he's at least handling being referred to with those pronouns well. if he turns out to still go by those pronouns after being asked, then me using (they/them) would be seen as rude towards him, so i'm trying to be respectful from my limited context.
I knew around that age, it's definitely not too young, I would just let them be how they want and fully support them in pursuing that, including letting them wear the clothing they feel most comfortable in

As for bullies... like... if I'm being completely honest, speaking from experience, the whole bullying thing is really overblown, unless you're, like, in some really backwards and conservative area, I'm guessing it won't really be a problem, although you should of course still watch out for any signs that there might be problems with other children

I would also try to educate them on what being trans is and the fact that they can be a girl; you said they haven't requested to be referred to using she/her pronouns, but are they aware that that's an option? It's probably good to make sure they know it is and that you'll completely support their pronoun choice regardless

**Also, I know that this is a while away given that they're only five, but I cannot possibly emphasize how important it is that you get them proper hormones literally the second puberty starts for them if they turn out to really be trans**

(Btw I wanna say that you're an amazing mother for accommodating your child and taking the effort to ask for advice like this, I'd probably be in a much better place right now if I'd had parents like you)
You are doing everything right, as far as I can tell.

The main thing is how much you love this little kid, and are allowing them to actuate their internal identity.

Your little one is NOT a boy. They've  been socializing as a girl since they were very young. They don't know what being a boy is all about. They don feel like a boy, and is very happy being who they actually are--a little female.

I don't know where you live, or what your community is like. But really, if you start socializing them in school as a girl, their classmates won't know the difference--or much care.

Unfortunately, being the temporary owner of a penis might cause some issues---but if their friends are all used to them presenting as a female, it really shouldn't be much of a problem.

Love is always the answer to raising trans kids; if they feel supported and affirmed and NEVER marginalized, then there really isn't much wrong you can do.

You seem to be doing a great job!!!

This kid is REALLY fortunate to have you guys are parents...
So I have some resources that might be able to help like books and other posts!!!

Please feel free to stop by r/transgenderhelp and ask us questions and we will guide you!!
All the other comments are great, also you've been doing your part perfectly. I will add that it is possible that your kid ""wants to be a boy"" again in their teens. Children's brain are very complicated, just let them know they can still go back if they need to. In the meantime, continue to support them the way you are and they're gonna grow happy and healthy!
Hey OP theres a book called Melissa by Alex gino and i think showing your child it will make them feel understood! Its about how the world sees Melissa as a boy called george and how she managed to get a female role in a play at her school and starts to be herself. I personally havent read the book fully but i did a small study on it in my college  and im pretty sure your childs too young to read it but im sure if you read it to them theyd love it!. Thankyou for being an awesome accepting parent OP the world needs more of you.
It sounds like you are already on a great path and honoring what your child wants as he takes the journey. As I look back, my trans son wanted a boy bedroom at 4-5.  I gave him one. His interactions with Barbies were to ride on say dinosaurs. He stopped hair bows early. I had no clue about it being a possibility.  Looking back he looked mad or miserable in the girly clothes I had him stuffed in and right at home in boyish tees and shirts that were house clothes. I very much so think they know. I’ve just allowed my son’s journey to go as he directed. He is handsome and confident in his true form. 

You sound amazing as a parent.

Edited:  when my son hit high school. The hair became shorter and clothes masculine and even without HRT yet, he is very happy to be called he and have his chosen name used.  I think they guide you.
You're letting your kid lead the way, that's all you can do. He'll tell you who he is, with time. Being open about things is the best thing you can do - and you're doing it.
From my personal experience, I started showing signs around age 3.  My mother told me what ""transsexuals"" were at age 8 and when I said that's how I feel she didn't take it well.  Ended up with me being horrifically bullied for years more because I could never fit in with the boys, things only got worse for me when puberty hit resulting in a deep depression and pushed me into suppressing myself until I was 27, I talked myself out of coming out again until I was nearly 31 because I was convinced it was too late to start transitioning.  I'm so much happier and healthier since coming out and starting my transition, I still wish I had supportive parents like you while I was growing up.

Seems like you're doing a good job so far, I feel like it's best to let your child explore their identity like you're currently doing, only they can know how they truly feel.  I let my son play with whatever toys he wanted and he did go through a time where he was enjoying ""girly"" things.  Shortly after I came out he said to me ""I thought about if I'd like to be a girl, I don't think I'd like it, I'm happy being a boy"".  I'm really glad he's able to think about these things and speak to me without being embarrassed or self-conscious.  Thanks for being a supportive parent.
Im trans and showed signs at around that age athough i didnt transition till later in my teens. and growing up in my home, my parents always made it clear to me and my siblings that you can be who ever you want. They never questioned and asked what i wanted as it was obvious. They allowed me to dress in different clothes explore different play and hobbies. My childhood as i remeber wasnt confusing as i just did my own thing. It wasn't till later on in my early teens where they started asking me more about my thoughts around gender. I think the best thing is to love and support them and answer the questions they ask you about gender. Also teaching them they dont have to be a certain gender to do certain things.
Seriously take him to a specialist, they will know what to do.
> I don't even know if 5 year olds understand pronouns though lol

A great first step would be explaining them and asking your child if they have preferences, if they would maybe like to try different pronouns in an environment they feel safe (e.g. within the home) but prefer you continue to use birth pronouns when in more public spaces. Does your child want to communicate their preferences themselves? When would they feel comfortable with you being a proxy communicator for their preferences?

Best of luck to you!
I love how supportive you are, just make sure that you make an appointment with a doctor, so you will know for sure what is going on, and if it turns out that he is a she, and it's legal there he/she can go on puberty blockers.

&#x200B;

I wish I had parents like you :/
I think you are already doing what you should. Sounds like you actively listen to the child and try to give them what they seem to want. But you also seem to have many questions and I think it is good for you to get answers early, because that will likely help later on, and if not, at the very least you’ll have awareness that will make you a great ally to the community.
I think it is important first to understand that there is a difference between gender role, gender expression and gender identity. While the first two are social constructs that will vary with culture and era, the third one is very real and very individual, and is what makes people feel at home in their bodies if they are cis, or dissonant if they are trans. There’s always a possibility that your kid might just like a female role and expression and be fine with their body, but I definitely wouldn’t count on that because those social constructs can often help us express this dissonance and/or cope with it, or even be a part of it. There is no age to be trans. Some of us understand very late in life how we feel while others feel it very young. Keep doing what you’re doing, being open to hearing your child’s needs and doing your best to meet them. I think for the potential bullying part, it should be your kid’s decision too if they want to risk it or not, and if it’s a concern, weather to fight it and be out and proud or transition in stealth. I second people suggesting to expose the kid to trans representation. Growing up, I knew about transfems, but I didn’t know about transmascs and that would probably have helped me come out much sooner and that would have saved me years spent living at the wrong frequency... Make sure they know about non binary folks as well. If your kid is indeed trans, their first step is going to be puberty blockers so that they don’t go through the wrong puberty. Those also can give a cis kid time to figure out if their natural puberty is the one they need. I’d make sure to know where and how to obtain those so that if it turns out to be needed, you and your kid won’t be stuck in wait times that could defeat the purpose of it...
For you right now, and maybe for your kid later, I want to recommend [Dr. Z’s channel](https://youtube.com/c/DRZPHD). She’s a specialized clinical psychologist and she answered a lot of my questions when I came out. 
In the meantime, I think you’re doing a great job! Thank you for being such a good parent to probably one of us ❤️
I didn't have supportive parents when I was young, but I would definitely wear girly clothes back then. I wasn't allowed to grow my hair until was like 12. So to answer your question it's perfectly normal for trans kids to do this things. My tip to you it's to make sure they know you love them regardless of their gender. You are great person, you made me smile 🥰
kids have an understanding of gender very very early, five definitely is not too young. As for advice, a lot of the other commentors have said enough so I'd only be repeating things xD
You sound like such a wonderful parent! This sounds so much like what I went through as a child, except I'm FtM. I would self identify as a boy, describe myself as one, I found generic feminine things offensive, etc. My parents didn't understand at all though. I'm not a parent, but what I would recommend is to continue providing them what they ask for (buying them dresses was so sweet!) Personally I would let them pick their outfits out for school (so long as it's functional and appropriate clothes for school, nothing that will get in the way of learning), and be ready to support your child if they're bullied. Bullying will happen, it happened to me all throughout my academic years, but YOUR support as the parent is what's most important to them. Encourage them to express themself, be themself, explore their identity at their own pace. Try to introduce some transgender characters or role models into their life, that's how I was able to communicate to my parents I was transgender and bisexual. There were queer characters in the shows me and my mother watched, and I pointed them out and told her that I was like them, and she was able to understand that. As far as hormone blockers go, that's a brand new concept to me, so I've got no advice on those, but if I were you, I would expect gender & sexual dysphoria to start when they start going through puberty. Do research into what you can do medically for your child to help them with that. When I started puberty and my hips widened and boobs started growing I did NOT like it one bit. I was growing further away from who I believed myself to be. I was told I was becoming a woman, but I just felt like people were no longer seeing me for me. I hope this helps.
I think you're doing very well. There are researches that show that we already start to develop the perception of our gender from 3/5 years old. You can buy children's books about being transgender, it might help. 

In my childhood, my parents weren't as supportive as you are. I asked for boys's clothes and they never gave it to me. And I admit I wish I had what you're giving your child. You are a great parent :)
Don't have any real pointers for you but just want to say that if my parents had been as open and accepting as you are, I wouldn't have waited 31 uears to come out! Keep doing what you're doing! Props for beimg a great parent! 💗💗
I recommend the book ""Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story"". I'm sure parts of it are inappropriate for your child's age so read it to them with a parental filter on... But I think it could be great for them as it was for me.
My mom used the Fggt word on me a lot. You sound like you are doing a perfect job. Love your kids so they will love you back.
Gay NB here. Your son reminds me of myself in my childhood. I pretty much did everything your son did when I was his age. And I didn’t explore my sexuality and gender identity until I was in college - mainly out of fear because I grew up with extremely conservative parents who forced me to be “male”. 

And by then, I was suffering from severe depression, social anxiety, and a painkiller addiction.

The point I’m trying to make is - you being there to support during his formative years will determine how healthy he will be MENTALLY as an adult. Do not force your child into a box because of YOUR feelings or fears. It’ll do more harm than good.
Well first of all, wow you are an awesome parent and we appreciate you for doing this. Yes you can know when you are that’s young. Some people do, some people don’t. My best friend when he was that young was very feminine and wore dresses and expressed all those signs. His parents took him to a gender therapist to see, and he realized he wasn’t trans. Take your child to a gender therapist (obviously a supportive one, like that’s just trying to support your child and see if they are trans)
Leave young children alone. You do not need to tell every single 6 year old they can be a girl.
It is very well possible that he just likes to appear feminine without actually being trans. It’s common and it’s okay. When I was about your sons age, I was super into tomboyish things and well, here I am now as a trans man. I didn’t know anything about being trans at five. It’s a complicated situation so I recommend you slow your son to present how he wants. If he learns about being trans in the future and makes that connection for himself, then that will seal the deal. Do not make this decision for him unless he is 110% sure.
Please tell him what puberty is and how it might conflict with his interests if left untreated before it starts. Watching your body become something you hate is a nightmare that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
See if the behavior continues into early teens
I can only think of 2 things about this post:

1. The boy is almost 5 and cannot make serious life altering decisions. So you ignore it, let the kid be a kid and he’ll eventually grow out of it. 

2. The person who posted this is either looking for Reddit clout, or is more likely a psychopath who doesn’t care about the long term psychological abuse the child (who is ALMOST 5!) is going to endure.

You seem like an amazing parent. I wish I had parents who were supportive at that age and seeing kids these days having supportive parents brings me hope. 

I’m sure there are some childrens books on gender identity you can find. Not quite related but there is a really cute picture book about a drag queen for children and in my opinion it explores feeling like a girl and a boy and that’s okay.

As someone who was a trans child (ftm) it depends on the person, but I remember feeling that way as a child but I couldn’t really “explain” or “know” how I felt until I was older. In the long run I found out it was gender dysphoria because I wanted to be like all the other little boys etc.

As for what I wish my parents did when I was younger- I wish they would have been supportive and let me play with and dress how I wish. There’s no rush to figuring out gender identity as it is very wide spectrum. 

It personally took me a long confusing time because my parents were conservative and I wasn’t allowed to “know about things like that” to figure out I was transgender. So I think you are doing everything right so far. 

As for worrying about bullies as a young child there should not be that much kids angry or bullying your child, they might be confused but you could give him some examples of what to tell them. 

As your child gets older it does pose a concern in bullying in school but I found that changing my name helps a lot. I was fairly “good” at passing at school and wasn’t bullied much but it does pose a concern especially for transgender women. 

As they get older you could bring them to a gender therapist, that helped me a-lot in figuring out who I was.

Your an amazing parent and I wish you and your child luck on your journey.
That's a great idea! I'm not sure why I haven't already thought of that. Thank you!
Thank you! Have you found any support locally? I have no idea how to find support at this young of an age. I would love to join a group of parents with young gender non-conforming kids, but I'm not sure where to look. 

Does your daughter wear ""girl"" clothes to school? How have other kids treated her at this age?
[removed]
You're definitely right about it being difficult having a little boy wearing girls clothing. I have a friend whose daughter prefers boy clothes and everyone tells her that she's being cute, but people definitely think it's different when my son wants to wear dresses.

That's a good idea to check with the school first. I'm really unsure how other 5 year olds would treat him, but I'm sure some older kids would be more likely to bully him.
5 is too young. I don’t know when the last time you’ve socialized with a 5 year old was, but I’ve spoken to multiple 5 year olds relatively recently. They are too young for this.
[removed]
I haven't really explained what trans is to him yet, but I'm going to look for some age appropriate books. I think he will be so excited to learn about it.

I'm sorry you didn't have more supportive parents. I'm not trans, but I've had a lot of other issues that my parents didn't understand and were not supportive of in any way. I honestly don't think I really know how to parent, but I'm just doing my best to make sure he feels loved and supported no matter which gender he ends up being.
I was trying to find a subreddit like that, thank you so much!
I'll check it out, thank you!
That's really good to hear that they've had an overall good experience in school! I think the area I live in has a good mix of people who would be supportive and those who wouldn't, but it really only takes one person to make a kid's life miserable in school unfortunately. I'm just hoping he will make a bunch of friends who love his dresses.
I will definitely do my best to listen to him.  I'm not really sure what the ""gender critical"" groups try to push, but I'm really only interested in following my son's lead about who he is. I just want to try support him while also preparing him for people who might not be nice and understanding... which he will inevitably encounter.
Yes, I definitely want to allow him to figure it out. I don't even want to label him as ""transgender"" or anything at all until he tells me what he feels is right for him. I just know that he's most definitely showing a lot of signs that he's happiest presenting as a girl so I'm just trying to figure out how to support him with that as best that I can.
He was always stealing her dresses until we finally bought him his own. I don't think he technically knows what transgender means yet either, but he's showed me over and over again that he feels like he's a girl.

I hope your parents have become more supportive, and if not, I hope you've been able to find better people to surround yourself with!
Thanks! I will probably speak to the school if he wants to start wearing his dresses. He does know that people might be mean sometimes, and we will definitely try and work on ways to handle bullies although I'm really dreading that as he starts kindergarten soon.
Yeah, we will probably look into this. Thanks!
It is, thank you!
Yeah, we are definitely trying our best to support him.    Thanks!
Thank you! Your experience sounds very similar to my son's but in reverse! I'm glad you and your parents were able to find a good compromise!
I can't imagine trying to raise him in the 80's! I can't imagine how awful the bullying must have been.

I feel fortunate that more people are accepting of gender differences than ever before. We have many friends who are 100% supportive no matter if he wears dresses and identifies as a boy or a girl. It's so nice to be able to find other like-minded people.
We haven't really explained trans people to him yet so I think we are going to try and introduce it with books or something. I think he feels a lot of frustration that most people see him as a boy when he very much feels like a girl. I think letting him know that he has options in regards to pronouns and such might help to relieve some of his frustration.
This is very helpful, thank you! I have a feeling he will be very excited when I explain that he can be a girl. It's a small town so he already knows a lot of kids, but I will just see what he wants and if changing pronouns is something that he would like to try.
[removed]
I'm so glad to hear that some kids are able to go to school without issues! I'm in the US and there's certainly a decent amount of people in the area who would not be nice, but I'm doing my best to only be around supportive people.

I'm also sorry you didn't have support. I struggled with having support as a child too (for different issues) so I'm doing my best to try and be supportive of my kids. I just want them to feel OK with who they are.
Yeah, the bullying is really the biggest concern at this age. He would LOVE to show off his dresses, but I think he already knows that kids can be mean. He's still been ok with wearing boy clothes to school for now so we will just try and follow his lead.
Yeah, we will definitely seek out a therapist if he struggles in school.
meant to add

you’re not wrong for continuing to use he/him for your child! i just default to neutral until i have confirmation on someone’s pronouns just to be safe, that’s why i put the asterisk next to they
[removed]
>Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story

Loved that book, but it's really for someone much older; a lot of it takes place in college.
We definitely don't plan to push him to label himself as ""trans"" or anything else he's not comfortable with. Right now, he's just a boy who loves dresses and all things ""girly"". That being said, he will still likely face bullies at this age for not being gender-conforming. 

It's a little hard trying to find a support group due to his age and because I don't want to give him a label yet since he's not old enough to identify it himself. I just know that right now, he very strongly relates to being a female, and I just want to support him with that as best that I can... even if it might eventually change.
Ah yes, the life-altering decisions of... wearing feminine clothes and maybe being called a different name and pronouns. I can't possibly think how these could be reversed, they'll truly be permanent changes that they can never go back on /s
Stop drinking the Kool-Aid and actually learn something. Absolutely NOTHING that the parent(s) mentioned is life-altering. NOTHING. They're just letting the kid roll how he wants to.
Nobody is claiming they're trans because nobody except them can know for sure. All anyone can do is listen to their child and let them explore, like you're saying. If they turn out to be trans then that's fine, and likewise if they don't. But you have to let them explore as much as they need for them to discover that.
Tell us some more how you’ve never talked to trans people or done research
I don't think being trans is something you ""allow"". I don't know if he will be a trans adult, but he's old enough to know how he feels and what he likes to wear. He's also old enough to understand whether or not I support him as he is. His understanding of himself will be a process, but at age five, he feels happiest presenting himself as a girl so I'm going to support him with it. If it changes in the future, then that's fine too.
Thank you so much. It makes me so sad to hear how many have not had supportive parents. My parents were not supportive of a lot of things that I struggled with (not gender issues) so I learned the hard way how important it is to have support from your family.

We're definitely trying our best to support him no matter which gender he eventually decides is best. I think he should feel comfortable exploring his identity, and I'm trying my best to help him with that. It really sucks when society isn't always supportive, but I hope it's getting better.

Thank you so much for your response!
While this book isn't specifically about being trans, it definitely ticks a lot of the boxes. It's about a blue crayon that was accidentally given a red wrapper, and how hard it is when everyone else refuses to look past your labeling.

Hey, trans parent of a probably trans child here! Good books we got for our kids included: 

It Feels Good to be Yourself

Red - A Crayons Tale

My Princess Boy

When Aiden Became a Brother 

Introducing Teddy

I Am Jazz

And for my husband and I we read The Transgender Child. The thought these days is that gender identity has three distinct developmental milestones. Roughly 4-6 years, 11-13 years, and 17-19 years. It's definitely possible that your child is trans, but even if they aren't supporting them now is still the most important thing you can do. They'll always remember how you helped them, regardless of where they end up in the end.
It's probably above the kid's reading level, but I'm a big fan of Were I Not a Girl.
PFLAG often has local groups and lots of information online. The Trevor Project is also a great resource for parents looking for information. You might try a web search to see if there is an LGBTQ inclusion center in your area, they often have various types of meetings/activities and can likely help you find other resources in your area. You’re on the right track already, your child is lucky to have you!
We joined Transforming Families. I don’t know if it’s a regional thing. We recently found a psychologist who does group sessions for parents and kids, but haven’t started yet. I think we go next month for our first appt. Childrens Hospital has a program with a two year waitlist, so we’re on that. I think it’s important to sign up early and get a doctor in case you decide to she needs puberty blockers at some point. But this is also going to depend on where you live I think. I’ll DM you more details.

I’m terms of clothes, my wife recently started providing more options in the dresser. These were girl cloths towards the gender neutral side. She immediately started wearing them. She’s also fond of stealing her older sisters clothes. So we’ve been adding more and more “girl” clothes. She likes anything and everything with girl style; a frill, sparkle, tapered cut, whatever. She has some dresses too. We recently found undies that for boys but have a style more like panties. 

My daughter has a twin brother and they share a dresser. My son picks out all the “boy” clothes to wear. My daughter picks out the “girl” clothes; Even though it’s all mixed. They each have their own style and it reflects their gender identities.
Username checks out.
honestly it's better to explain the situation to him and the teacher (and most likely face some bullying) instead of restricting expression to prevent that. a great home environment can make a WORLD of a difference despite anything that happens outside. wether or not he's trans it definitely can't hurt, he'll be so thankful when he's older. you're doing incredible!!
Statically, 3 is the age at which someone is able to effectively communicate their own gender.
You start to learn what your gender is at about 2 and then learn to communicate or even express it at 3
A newborn doesn't understand what hunger is and is still able to comunicate when it needs to eat. Comunication doesn't mean they need to be able to give a presentation on the subject, only that they are able to convey their feelings. 

A 3yo can absolutely start to complain about the color of their clothes, or the length of their hair or being grouped with the boys at school and not the girls. That's precisely what happened in op's case.
I work with kids of all ages (kids TV), and kids this young definitely have an idea of gender. Spend a day in a kindergarten and you'll hear enough boy/girl talk.     
     
They might not have a full understanding of gender, but I'd wager most kids know that girls wear dresses and boys don't (according to society).
Funny, you seem to not understand what hypocrisy is, yet you're perfectly able to communicate your ability to use it.
Where did you get this information?
They link to articles that have been found to use fraudulent data or coercion to ""prove"" that letting trans people transition (even socially) makes them unhappy and is dangerous. Make sure you look into sources by doctors and academics if you get sent an article or study that seems concerning and alarming to you to see if the study isn't a fraudulent study from the 80s.
The important thing is to let him know that trans people exist and what the deal is (In an age appropriate way) without leading him to any conclusions, don't ask leading questions or anything.

(You might find this site useful for your own reading https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en I put off reading it until just now and it seems very good so far.)

I didn't know what a trans person even was until I was 18 or 19. And even then the explanation was bad... If I knew then what I know now I'd have known I was trans whe. I was about 12, instead of coming out to myself at 25 and then talking myself out of it until I turned 32. I feel like I've wasted so much of my life because of a simple lack of knowledge...
Glad i could help, best of luck to you and to your child
How is having a supportive parent scary lol?
This is the best thing you can do and you are doing an amazing job. Supporting who your child is really does help. I know things are bad in some places in the US and I feel sorry for all the trans people who are going through awful times atm
[deleted]
Your welcome! I hope you figure everything out! :)
Oh that's a good one! I'm going to add it to my list of books to buy him.  Thanks!
Thank you for all the suggestions! I think he's going to be really excited to read about kids like him.
Another one to look into is George by Alex Gino.

Edit: They changed the name to Melissa to reflect the main characters identity.
I might have his older brother read it or we can all read it together. Thanks!
Thank you, I will check those out!
By her 6th birthday she was insistent that she was a girl and it became clear that using she/her pronouns were very important. She sees herself as a girl/daughter/sister, and corrects any misgendering. I only recently became aware that this was an issue at school. Her teacher is on board now, but like the rest of us, was slow to catch up. I think all the kids are adjusting. So far, no major issues with other kids. But the kids are also adjusting. I wish I had figured this out BEFORE kindergarten started, but oh well, here we are.
Thank you for the information! Your daughter's experience does sound a lot like my son's. Did she start asking you to change pronouns or did you guys just start using them? My son hasn't asked for me to switch pronouns or to stop referring to him as my ""son"" yet so I'm just following his lead for now. If he feels like that's what he needs, then we will use whatever he's most comfortable with.

Have you had any issues with other people being rude to you or your daughter?
Statistically, a dog is as intelligent as a 3 year old, and dogs are VERY dumb. 3 year olds don’t understand enough about anything to make such a big decision. It’s very easy for a 3 year old boy to say “I’m a boy” when the only things they have to compare themselves too is probably girls. They can understand the difference between the 2 because 3 year old boys have always been referred to as boys their entire life, and understand their physical characteristics match other boys and not other girls.

Sorry off topic but OHMYGODDESS we're Avatar twins!
I think the thought of a decent parent is scary to them…
Yeah, I'm definitely not in the most progressive area, but there's still some good people around.
And if the 5 year old consistently tells you don’t you think they should be able to make nonpermanent decisions regarding how they look and identify
Absolutely! And I think you're right. The thing that messed me up the most as a kid was never seeing anyone like me represented anywhere. Feeling invisible made it seem like what I was was just so bad that it couldn't even be talked about. Representation is incredibly important.
I am certain no matter what, it would be nice to ask your child whatever pronouns they'd like to use. Kids around this age are not familiar with how refering to them makes an impact.

Simply I'd go and ask your child ""how would you like me to refer to you? as my son, or a daughter?"" nothing too complicated. If your child chooses the daughter option or is very hesitant, i'd recommend calling them a gender neutral version of their name.

I am a trans person myself, in my 15s. I have not known what 'pronouns, gender identity' and such were until i got bullied for liking women before coming out as a male in 4th grade. I had no idea people would have issues with either who i find attractive nor how i'd like to identify.
I think it's important to try to talk to your child about this and explain it. I personally have not had supportive parents and got disowned, so i'm really glad you are willing to help your child out, finding out their identity together.

It's completely normal to know at such young age. I knew too. But it's important to find a psychologist to talk to, maybe contact sexuological department and see. No pressure, as long as your child enjoys life and is happy right now. take it slow.
It's not about intelligence

It's about the ability to speak.

Gender IS NOT BASED ON PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Gender is an internal function of the brain and the brain is **VERY** good at recognizing its own gender.

Recognition and communication of one's own gender doesn't require intellect, it requires sapience. Please stop being ableist.

Your argument is completely demolished by the last 30 years of science. On the one hand, you may want to stop to save yourself embarrassment.

On the other hand, please continue so I can continue giving you shovels to help you continue digging that hole of yours.
Cultural anthropology student here! Current research indicates that children are able to categorize cultural depictions of masculine and feminine by 18-24 months. They typically are able to categorize their own gender identity and presentation desires by age 3, despite having only a limited ability to communicate such complex topics. Having the verbiage to express something does not necessarily dictate your conceptualization of it.
Literally every adult is constantly talking to children about gender, all day every day. Princesses and tonka trucks and all this shit that probably shouldn't be gendered, but absolutely is. You seem to have a very unhealthy misunderstanding of the fact that children are whole people from *very* young and are far more insightful than you say here. Read some things, any things, about child psychology.
Ah yes, because lacking an understanding of sexual reproduction means you can't have any idea of your own gender. Let's assume you're right, then shouldn't we raise all children as gender neutral until they're old enough to understand? If not, why does letting them wear whatever clothes they like and calling them what they want to be called make a difference? Surely treating them as any gender would be equally incorrect if they don't know yet? How do children know to use male or female pronouns for other people is they don't understand gender at all? Why do some children bully boys who wear dresses if they don't understand what a boy is? Honestly, I think you're underestimating the intelligence of young children, and certainly their ability to express parts of their identity, even if they don't understand it fully. It's really not much different at that age from expressing a preference for food or clothing, and I'm sure you can't disagree that 3 year olds can have those preferences.
Well maybe you were just slower than other kids. Have you since learned that your asshole is not the same thing as a hole in the ground?

Dude, kids are not as dumb as you think. Looking back, at the time I didn’t know that trans people existed but I knew I was a girl by 3

By about 4 I knew what pregnancy was, but that is knowledge to be taught not self awareness or brain development. It’s a proven fact that a child’s brain is developing its gender and identity at 2 and typically conveying that to others by 3. 

What is wrong with you? Do you think all children are dumb? Or are just assuming because you were dumb as a child and still are?
Oh for sure and hopefully with each new generation there’ll be more and more people accepting of people like me. Who just want to live our lives in peace. I’m lucky in that I can do that now. Mostly. I get abuse online now and again. Always from men. I have found a beauty group on Facebook and they have been so supportive and helpful with makeup tips and general skincare. And even just to chat about life in general. Their attitude is that all women are valid and supported. It really helps me ☺️
[deleted]
That's so sad. I had OCD as a kid, and I remember feeling completely alone and didn't know there were other people like me. I think it would have made a huge difference in my life had I known, and I hope it will be the same for him in regards to his gender.
Yes! Ok kind of a vent but whatever. When I was about 17 I saw an episode of ""Der Lehrer"" (the teacher) on tv and the episode was about a transboy, coming to terms that he's trans, and I bawled my eyes out for like 2 hours and I wrote with a friend about how happy I was seeing some trans representation on tv.
I hope it keeps getting better for you! Even if my son doesn't end up being trans, we are teaching all three of our children about differences in gender expression so hopefully there will at least be 3 more supportive people in the future!
There’s nothing wrong with letting someone that age express themselves. Nobody’s sending them off to get surgery.
I'm sure it will be helpful for you kiddo. You're doing every right here
That’s amazing 🥰 the world needs more people like you. It’s one step closer to acceptance for all. We’re all human and we all have our own place in the world 💜 and thank you"	tlkdhl	trans	892	0.97	2022-03-23 23:16:18
Going to Trans Clinic Today!! #Trans Man	"Hello to anyone who will see this! This might be all over the place since I'm simply writing what first comes to mind so hopefully it will make sense. I think this is my first post on Reddit which is really exciting for some reason... 

Anyways, the day has finally come for my appointment at a trans clinic near me! This past year has been one hell of a journey; from the fear of coming out, poor mental health, seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, starting meds (prozac and focalin if anyone has experience with those and can relate), having my unsupportive family, covid-19, lack of in person school, etc... 

At this point I just have to say how grateful I am that my health care providers are actually listening to me and support me even though I'm 17 and not 18. It's been so tough trying to understand my rights without parent consent. Hell, my parents didn't even consent to me leaving school today for the appointment. Sucks to suck though because I'm going anyways!  >:)

It's just a consultation, but I'm extremely excited to get meet more people who will support me and educate me, as well as getting new resources and to having new opportunities. I went to my primary in February and have been waiting patiently since.   


Being a trans athlete has been one hell of an experience. I tried to play men's club volleyball in the fall of 2020 to 2021 but the closest location made it extremely difficult for me to even apply since my parents weren't supportive and because I had to pay in full by the first week. I ended up playing my dream position with an amazing women's team there so if I ignore the chest dysphoria I experienced for months it was a great time\^\^

I'm starting boys high school volleyball this upcoming spring season and I'm so grateful most of my coaches are supportive. I did swim in the winter which was a bit difficult to manage suit wise however I made it work. (Bless up to tech suits!) It was a unique time because our meets were always at home because of covid so I swam with both men and women to speed up the meet. Surprisingly enough, I kept beating a fellow teammate of mine (cis man who was quite in shape) at my primary event. It definitely affirmed my belief that I can compete with men even though some of my coaches at the time told me I wouldn't be able to. 

Anyways to wrap this up (since I'm writing it in class instead of paying attention...) I just wanted to put this out there. I probably could have written it better but that's alright! It's a learning process. I'm proud of my identity regardless of what other people tell me. I can't wait to become an educator and coach and hopefully meet more trans identifying students in the future.

Thanks for reading this if you got to this point! I might come back and write an update after I go. To new adventures and better days to come! <3

\-Mack,"	"Hey Mack ! Not every day an easy adventure but a very good adventure anyway ! Well done ! Can't wait to read from you ! ♡
It’s great to hear you have support, Mack. I hope it keeps getting better for you!
Good luck my dude 💕
Hey dude, I'm MtF, but also have ADHD and am working out how to maintain my athleticism now that I've started T-blockers (and E to come :3). I know we're going in the opposite directions, but HMU if you have any questions you think I might be able to help you with. 

If nothing else, congrats dude! It sounds like you've already put a lot of effort into this, it should be a bit easier going now that you have external support in your transition - I know I felt that way :)
I’m so proud of you Mack! We are both starting to transition pretty young—I’m only a year older! I can’t imagine how difficult it must be at 17 in (I assume) high school. You sound tough as steel and I wish you the best of luck!
I am glad you have support, Mack! You've got this!
So proud of you Mack! Good luck today and forward, your brothers are cheering for you!
Good luck, Mack! 💖
Waddup Mack let's fuckin get it!
That’s quite a journey! Congratulations for all the progress you’ve made, and good luck for the progress still to come!
Thank you <3
Thank youu :) I hope so too!
Thank you! :)
Ayee that's so cool!! I'd love to talk to you about it! I've been really wanting to meet more trans athletes so I'll do that soon ! :))
Thank you so much! It has been a bit odd, but surprisingly my classmates haven't said anything negative yet! It's only been older peeps so I just try to stick with my chosen fam and ignore that ""haters"" lmao
Thank you so much <333
So fustian of thee mack! valorous luck the present day and fia, thy brothers art cheering f'r thee!

Can we talk about racism in trans/queer spaces?	"Hi, I’m a transgender Asian woman and have just reached six months of HRT. I haven’t been out as long as some of you, who have been out for years and years; however, in my short amount of time in the trans community, I have:

• Had a selfie of me deleted from a prominent trans selfie subreddit. Upon further inspection, I found that this particular sub is extremely selective with their POC representation but will let white trans people post freely. 

• I’ve been harassed, bullied, and witch hunted over my relationship/breakup with a white trans woman. 

• Been treated with blatant disrespect for asking trans-related questions in trans-positive spaces. 

The culprits, have all been white queer women masquerading as leftist allies that supposedly support trans rights, BLM, and stop Asian hate. 

Now before you get upset with me, I want to make it known that I’m not saying that all white queer people have been terrible to me. I have met some very loving, kind, welcoming white people from all identities that have supported me in my journey. 

However, it’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to see a pattern in the harassment I receive from other queer folx.

Edit: the sub in question is /r/transpassing. I have now found out that the sub will remove POC trans people but will allow white cis people to post freely."	"that's fucking disgusting. I literally don't understand how you can be part of a minority group and hate another minority group. Like honestly. Trans spaces are meant to be safe spaces for everyone. I'm really sorry you have to deal with that, and I honestly wish there was more I could do to help. Even though I've never been the target of any racist attacks, since I am white, I have experienced a lot of bigotry in the short amount of time I've been out. I just can't even fathom it. Idk if this counts as brigading or not, but do you mind telling me what that sub is? I want to unsub from it if I am subbed. sorry to the mods if that counts as brigading, and I understand if you delete this comment for it. I just don't want to provide any support to a sub that pretends to be accepting but isn't
As an Asian non-binary trans-femme person myself I've definitely seen this play out in some of the offline support groups and other queer spaces too many times to count. The worst part about it is the dynamic where sometimes even having the temerity to bring the issue up ends up branding you as ""the difficult one"" and expelled from these spaces that are supposed to be for everyone.

It is so infuriating and confusing - why do some of us in marginalized communities end up punching down along other axes of oppression? The only thing I can come up with is that it's an incredibly misdirected coping strategy for some folks. The idea being, ""I've had shit coming to me all my life, but at least I'm not X, Y, or Z other marginalized community"". That may be, but it's absolutely no excuse to contribute to the oppression of anybody else.

It's despicable, but being embedded in the (post-?) colonial West, it's literally coded into our cultural DNA. Hell, the United States was founded on the economic exploitation of both stolen African enslaved peoples and the poor white people who were mollified with the notion that ""I may be poor, but at least I'm white.""

These are powerful forces we're pushing back against, and it's going to take a lot of work for both the community and for individuals to make any headway. Naive though it may sound, I really do believe in being the change you want to see in the world (that's literally what we do when we come out!), and I want to thank you again for your strength and bravery for speaking up. It will get better. It has to.

Solidarity, sister!
Oh absolutely I’m a indigenous trans woman and I feel the same way when it comes to the kind of posts certain subreddits allow . I just wanted some opinions on my transition so far and I got no noise at all . Very white space if you ask me
First of all I'm so sorry that you have gone through this. Out of everyone, trans people know what it feels like to be discriminated against and should do better than this. 

I'm white (trans man) and have found that many trans spaces are mainly white people. White trans people need to include intersectionality into activism and just because someone is trans doesn't give them a ""pass"" on not educating themselves about racism, especially in their own community.

I'm sorry that what was supposed to be a safe place has not been one for you.
I've had a similar experience, except in real life. I joined a support group and heard snarky comments about how it's ""unfair that skinny Asian boys can transition so easily because of their girly genetics"". Uhm what??? Why does it matter if I'm Asian and trans?? Asian people can't be trans? Anyway yeah I'd like to think they're just jealous.
My non-binary asian partner has experienced the same as you and he also feels that there is a racism issue in the trans community. I’m so sorry that you have to experience bigotry in a space of what is thought to be open minded people. There is 100% a blatant racism problem on the FTM side too as the token “transmasc” is a white skinny boy with a hoodie.

Thank you for speaking up on your experiences. We will stand strong with you. You are not alone!
We can't have liberation without intersectionality. The fact you've faced this level of racism in trans communities is disgusting and tragic.

Unfortunately it's also not surprising. So much of online trans culture and our notions of ""passing"" are based on white supremacist beauty standards, and so because ""passing"" is treated as a requirement for validity, by extension whiteness becomes a requirement for validity. Failing to talk about this issue in trans spaces betrays and harms our whole community.

OP I'm sorry you've had these experiences. I wish I could say they're atypical or ""not real trans culture"", but that would be a lie. Our community has major issues with racial equality and they need to be addressed.
I’m sorry you are going through this. Not much of a gesture but I went on your page and liked a bunch of your posts. Hopefully the little karma boost will add a smile 😊  

You are valid and beautiful!
I've noticed this too and it sucks, makes it hard to be a part of a lot of spaces. The white fragility I see sometimes when I bring it up is insane too. We need to be able to have more open conversations about being BIPOC in trans and queer spaces.
I'm half Turkish, and muslim and I have been harassed in queer spaces as well. That was also all by white queer women, who for example insisted I couldn't be muslim and ""had to choose"" or I was not really trans. 
I have been told I am faking being trans and gay for attention, because of my ethnicity and religion. I have also been called terrorist by queer people.
its very bad and I agree with you. That's why I stay away from certain spaces. We are not all welcome and we have to be 1000% extra careful than everyone else. I'm so sorry this happened. This is terrible. A lot in this community think yt are they leaders and they are the only ones that can be in it. Specially Op, like us we are afraid and receive extra hate from our communities( culture/nationality) we get it here too.
im so sorry. people still see white people as the norm, even in trans spaces and it’s frustrating. and honestly the past couple years i haven’t even seen any POC trans people in online lgbt spaces. i cant imagine how it must be to feel so excluded from our spaces and i apologize on behalf of other white people that we haven’t been doing better when we should. just know that you do have allies and you are loved.
I am so sorry you've been though that, it doesn't matter if your Asian your trans and should be able to find a safe place here and that you was unable upsets me. I am a trans female waiting to go on HRT but I dated a trans African American before and they felt the same issue. I wish everyone was able to get along as everyone not matter the skin color, gender or sexuality all need a safe place where they can feel safe and loved.

Bet you look great keep it going and never let anyone get you down
As a white minor, (14, American, FtM) I want to be the change in the world. I am the future, and I want to learn as much as possible about POC and other cultures and what is appropriate, so I can create a better, safer world for everyone when I'm an adult. I am so, so sorry this happened to you. It is not right, and I will make sure to never go to that sub. Know that we love you!! <3
Yes, we sure can. I'm not someone who has really experienced racism but you see it all the time both online and irl. It's a problem that things like these happen and we need to call out when we see it
I’m sorry that this has happened to you.

There absolutely is a racism issue in the queer community, and it’s fucking disgusting - we all know what it’s like to be discriminated against and bullied because of some aspect of who we are, the fact that we’ll turn around and pull this shit on others is just unbelievable. We should fucking well *know better.*

And the unwillingness of some to address this, sufficiently that you need to apologize for even bringing this up, is just as bad; silence is complicity, and defending bigotry is also complicity.

We all need to work much harder on more than just passive lack of racism, but on being actively anti-racist.
As a fellow queer asian: lemme jus send u a whole beam of positive energy. I cant do much for you, but i gotchu
Thank you for sticking your neck out and going through the effort it took to write this post.  There's really no way that spaces like this can be truly valid if problematic behavior like you've faced isn't called out for what it is.
I’m so sorry you had to endure any of that babes. It honestly breaks my heart. I may be Caucasian but I definitely agree with you that generally within the queer spectrum, that it’s always white people who are the most racist and bigoted people. I’ve seen it in gay spaces and in trans spaces. It’s honestly disgusting. Again, I’m sooo sooo sorry you had to experience any of that 😞😞😞
im rrally sorry :( thatsounds bad. im white transmasc and i feel really bad ab the other peopel in the community im so sorry but ik my apology doesnt do much. /gen :) ❤️
Working as a bouncer at a gay club I quickly lost my naive thought of ""Queer people are definitely more accepting and less prejudiced."". Nope. Watched asian men non stop either be fetishized or being disregarded as being attractive at all.  Some of the most transphobic people apparently are cis gay white dudes (especially towards transwomen) and the fact that the culture in the club has the common place of just touching people intimately without consent or just straight up having sex on the dance floor is beyond shitty. Had my friend who is black be either treated like he was a sketchy urchin or the ""chocolate to the cream cookie"" as one gross guy had brazenly opened with. Being trans i had to deal with chasers, transphobes, lesbians that would not accept that i am not a lesbian or woman and people groping me to see what genitals i have. One man shook my breasts out of my binder and I absolutely lost my shit on him, he laughed it off as ""being funny"".

I think the problem is the same problem with the general human population. There are shitty people in every community. As much.as the empathy and translation of struggle should resonate with these shameful examples of queer persons it clearly lacks entirely. I have seen some very odd things and any which way its cut it just reminds me that its best being selective with who you surround yourself with instead of just being friends because you fit into a sub culture together.

I am truly sorry for what you and anyone else goes through. You will find your crowd and the trash (racist garbage) will filter themselves out.
There's a lot of pressure in society that wants to tell me being trans is wrong, and something to be ashamed of. But honestly, the thing that embarrasses and disgusts me the most about being a white trans woman is the prevalence of people like me who are so clearly racist to other trans women, trans men, and enbies, or the people like me who want to shut down and invalidate trans men and enbies. Then, when someone is brave enough to speak out about this treatment, to open people's eyes to this kind of behaviour; these same people try to defend themselves, justify their actions, or double down on the same hateful ideas.

I've never felt responsibility for the bigotry of some white people, always feeling that I'm not the same, and just need to focus on my own ingrained beliefs. But I identify so strongly with other trans women, that their bigotry feels like part of myself. It's mortifying to me, and I don't understand how these people are so unaware of the hostility they're showing to their trans siblings, when we should all be united
racism is not acceptable in any form, especially in LGBT groups.
Yeeeesh
Your right. 
Unfortunately just like every where else in America being pretty and white is considered “best”…
Which is lame. 
Cops have NEVER given me a speeding ticket or any others besides drug offenses.
My friends on the other hand have it worse off :/
I would like to think that you only encounter that sort of stuff online but obviously I know that that's probably not true. I don't know why your posts may have been removed but I would be willing to bet that maybe there is a moderator or two out there abusing their power. Some people just need to touch grass. I would stay away from transpassing anyway, it's just an excuse for CIS people to hate on you.
r/transpassing I've never heard a good word about; only toxic bullshit. Sorry you've had to deal with this 🫂🫂🫂🫂
This is unfair and outright gross. I see that most trans-only spaces are majority white, and I know from what I have read/seen/heard elsewhere that there are problems around “passing” and who gets to pass/who meets the expectation of passing. I am white, so I will not preach or paraphrase to you what you already know to be true from your own experience(s) in our community about the need for intersectionality, but I do want to build a better community.
Has happened to me as well. Not openly racist but it is subtle and microaggressive unless you consider truscum who are just openly racist and problematic on all levels. But yes, I agree with you.

I have also seen people not ready to accept different cultures that play a role in the lives of many trans people. Not all ideas are western and people can often learn from different cultures. But it is just brushed under.
I'm incredibly sorry, and disappointed, that that's been your experience. it's unacceptable and anyone who has treated you that way should feel significantly ashamed.
There is definitely a racism problem and a xenophobia problem. I'm so sorry you were treated this way.
That’s such bullshit. I really hope social media and this awful policing of trans and POC and trans POC comes to an end. It happens way too often on every site. Fb, IG, TT, here.
The deleted post in particular is mystifying. Why go through all that extra work to delete posts from POC but keep some when you could just let any trans person post and save yourself lots of time and effort. Racists just love wasting their time on the dumbest stuff I tell ya.
I'm sorry you have had to go through this and have to put up with nasty people.
As far as I'm and many others in this post are concerned, you're more than welcome no matter your background/heritage.
for some reason i will never understand sometrans spaces have a technically small but ever present problem with people being assholes to ftms and minorities, it fucking sucks
I'm sorry you're being treated that way. These people could also be jealous of how gorgeous you are. You look so much like your mom and aunt. 

As a black man, I'm aware that some people who claim to support these movements aren't all as they seem, and just want to hide their racism. Most of the people I've interacted with who follow BLM treated me like crap either over my race or trans identity. It really sucks. 

There are also quite a few subs that block my posts for no reason at all. I never guessed it was over me being a POC

Makes sense. I did notice white people generate more likes for the same picture concepts that I post. 

We deserve more representation
It’s f*cking ridiculous to not support your entire community. Especially as leftists, we can’t achieve freedom till everyone is free. And I’m sorry you have been harassed. I have have literally n@zis at my school, so if you ever need help on how to bash the fash I’m here.
Thats atrocious, i will report that subreddit asap, this stuff shouldnt be tolerated in trans community its all about being respectful about each other dont matter about their religion, sexuality or race. All races are equal in everything just some stupid idiots dont feel that way, they shouldnt be part of this community, you have my full support.
Thank you so much for speaking out, it's really important to hear about things like this and hopefully this gets enough visibility to make an impact.
I’m so sorry for this and I definitely agree. Unfortunaly racism is very rampid in both the overall queer community and also trans community. It makes me so sad and angry. I’m on your side. More of us need to take a stand and stand up for what’s right and wrong. You’re brave for writing this.
ya agreed. the extremely online contingent of the trans community is mostly toxic 4chan girls with a “nazi phase”
This is why we need better queer POC representation. I'm sorry you had to go through this ordeal. I strongly believe we all need to elevate the voices of those that are oppressed within our community. We should all boycot r/transpassing in solidarity.
I have noticed a disgusting trend among minority groups to attempt to appeal to the majority ones by throwing other minorities under the bus. People like Blaire White and Caitlyn Jenner do this by advocating for the Republican party and being horribly racist. David Chappelle did it too, throwing trans people under the bus. My latina roommate has talked about how Hispanic communities apparently tend to be racist against other groups.

Ultimately it seems to be an idea that hurting others and bringing them down will help one be higher up. Being an oppressor means having less oppression. But it just ends up being harmful. It's bullying in a hierarchical society, trying to make an even lesser class so they're not the lowest anymore. Instead of uniting to bring everybody up. It's disgusting.
It's unacceptable, antithetical, and awfully lacking in self-awareness.  We'd be nowhere without the sweat and toil of our BIPOC trans family.  To hell with bigots.  You are welcome here and you are loved.
Semi related question... Would it be ok for me to make a different sub called transpassingpoc? Like if the og sub is mostly white women could i make one specifically for poc people? Or would that be to rude?
It’s awful when things like this happen to people. I’m sorry that this is happening and you obviously don’t deserve it. I definitely won’t be visiting that subreddit that you described any time soon. I don’t really have any thing else to say, but I just wish racism was less frequent. There’s really no reason to be racist at all, and I’m not some kind of expert, but white people who are racist aren’t just hurting POC, they’re hurting everyone / even their own race in return.
i’m so sorry you have had to experience these things, it’s absolutely not what you should be dealing with when posting or existing in spaces meant for you too. 
i’m a white trans guy and i’ve seen a lot of trans poc talk about how they’ve experienced racism in queer and trans spaces which should be safe for everyone. 

is there anything that i and other white queer and trans people can be doing to make these spaces safer for poc?
As a mixed race woman who can pass for white because I'm a borderline albino, I can sadly agree that being teans does not by default mean that white trans girls are immune to being racist. When diet racists think you too are white, you get to hear all the lovely things they'd never say out loud around non white folks. And I have encountered it from WAY more white trans women than I care to count.
Wow, that sub is fucked up. So sorry that happened to you.

Is there anything we can do to call them out on their obvious racism?
I feel really bad for you hun, and you’re not alone. I’m a Pacific Islander trans femme and I feel like there’s very little, if any representation for us in the LGBT community, and I often feel marginalized and left out as such. We all need to stand up and look out for each other, regardless of race, gender, or orientation, and especially uplift the most marginalized groups: trans people of color who have to battle both racism and transphobia.
That’s disgusting and awful. I won’t be visiting that sub ever now, even though I am white cause I’m not supporting a bunch of racists
Good to know about that sub, I’m newly active on reddit so I’m still finding my way around. Thought it would be good, but from the rest of these comments I’ll definitely stay away
Wtf why do they do that, thats dogshit
It was /r/transpassing
Nothing's more frustrating than being branded ""the difficult one"" for simply trying to exist and be heard.
(you’re adorable btw!! 😊)

It could very well be the jealousy thing. Before HRT, my height was 5’6” (168cm), little body hair, and I have small feet—US 7 mens (UK 6). Even some cis girls were mad about some of those things.
I hope this doesnt sound too ignorant, but is it difficult to be muslim and gay/trans? Abrahamic religions can be very tough on LGBT.
wtf man, you should never be forced to pick between two things in that way. Whenever people tell you to pick one or the other it always sounds manipulative and in this case is also derogatory, invalidating and narrow minded. Wish people would just let you be two things at once

edit: I'm so sorry I just defaulted cause of the sub but I changed it for you
You will be SHOCKED at the racism in the lgbt community if you think that.
Geez I checked it all out and they’re literally all white
ive heard some say you could post a picture of a cis woman on that sub and some members would say you dont pass

also yeah theyre literally all white wtf
I've stopped following that subreddit, blatant racism sometimes, only white people, and there's even cis people posting on it. that subreddit is a hellhole in my eyes.
thank you <3
not a big surprise, they're the blaire white of trans reddit
I don't like that place anyway. Chaser hell and people critique every little thing about your face and body. They judge you like you're supposed to be the perfect embodiment of a cis woman, when in reality, hardly any women fit their perfect standards.
Oooh, good, now I feel even better for leaving that sub. It's always seemed very distorted when I've posted things there. People are always way to not picky but what have experienced is absolutely terrible. 

imo edit this into your main post so more people see it and hopefully leave it in the dust.
I just left, there is no room for bigotry in our community.
There's people who troll that one just to put people down or to put false ideas about yourself in your head. I never have a super positive experience when I go there.
That sucks and I hope things change in the community ❤️
I understand why passing is important to some in the trans community but I will always see problems with the hyper focus. Passing is for the comfort of cis people not the transgender community and completely disregarded non-binary individuals. It reinforces harmful beauty standards on people that not ever cis person can meet. The event of cisgender women being called transgender because they are considered less then beautiful is harmful to cisgender and transgender people alike.

I'm so sorry you experienced these problems. People find it hard to understand that the most unforgiving and explicit racism and sexism I've ever experienced has been in queer spaces. It's unforgivable and will always encourage me to do better myself.
<nods> Huggles sorry you've had this happen as I've quiet enjoyed your posts.  I don't support or participate with r/transpassing for many reasons people mention here.  I also feel the thread is toxic and highly polluted with chasers.  

I will note that your own account u/pacific-oh at a VERY light glance looks like it might be onlyfans related.  But if someone uses more than 2 braincells they realize you're actually a game or regular streamer.

Its highly unfortunate but in the post ban-removal vs onlyfan/porn accounts there has almost certainly been a racial bias.  I really hate seeing it but I've noticed it as well.  

Hopefully some of the better reddit areas are causing less problems in this area.
The shoe envy is definitely real
It's not ignorant :) 
I think it's hard. Not because of the religion (to me) I have many muslim friends and teachers who couldn't care less about your sexual orientation or gender identity. But then there are the very traditional conservative muslims who have just decided that it's wrong and won't get their heads out of their asses to just listen for once. Thankfully I have a lot of support and love. It's strange because my family is split in three: 

1. The people who have a very hard time with it and are transphobic:
My dad and my oldest sister 

2. People who have a hard time with it and don't understand, can't adjust, but accept me: 
My mom and my other sister 

3. People who accepted me without question, respect my new name and pronouns and just support me so much: 
My two brothers 

Thanks for asking :)
Thank you i agree, but I'm a trans man, not a girl.
I think they noticed this thread because there's now precisely one post from a BlPoC at the very end of the ""Top Posts"" list and one from an Asian woman in the main feed. Edit: It still paints a horrible picture reminding me of the age old racist tactic of the ""token friend"". Edit 2: forgot a word boogaloo.
completely agreed. Even responding or asking the questions as OP.
yea took a look it's a white wash I think only one POC selfie was approved and tbh they could also have been white but just tanned.  


this is disgusting, racism is disgusting, racism hurts everyone, but as well places like that feed into the word narrative terfs want to spin that trans is a white middle-class thing.
Oh god, yeah. I just scrolled through that sub to see the cis white people others mentioned and lo and behold, I saw some. It’s incredible. They’re only selective with POC trans people but will allow cis white people.
Oh so it’s only for trans women?
Hmm, I never thought about it like that. What makes my post history appear like it might be OF-related, even if it’s very slight? I’m asking so I’ll know for future reference
Thank you for answering :]
It should be changed now, I apologise for that
I was talking about OP's experience specifically.
Its as basic as seeing many photos with you in a headset and some in cosplay.  These are obviously NOT reasons people should think you're doing OF-related content.  

But I'm quite certain this is happening with some of the gaming ladies in trans-threads.  They post their gamer photo, have no OF-related content, but the chasers come out of the woodwork (sometimes even in healthy trans spaces) and the thread owner is viewed as being partially responsible for occurred.  

Mind you I would have to be and admin and collect analysis on this problem to 100% identify this is occurring (and which of the reddit spaces it is and isn't occurring in).  But I think as an active person in many of these trans spaces, I've definitely observed problems around behavior with women who stream.  In current American culture too many men quickly assume a young woman with a headset/streaming is eye candy for them and open for direct sexual approach/comment.    Its a problem for women that goes beyond just trans-spaces.
That's totally fine :)"	rd0vih	trans	885	0.98	2021-12-10 05:05:10
Saw this quote on an article about the difference of gender desire and gender identity, and i just wanted to share it		"Full article: https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5
omgg thank u!!! mind linking the article? I’d like to read it!
that egg moment when I've read this article like 3 times b4 cracking but was so deep in denial that I was forgetting about it after reading each sentence
Hmm… I might need to experiment a little
This is so true for me. When i was a child i always wanted to be a girl, but it wasn’t strong enough so that I couldn’t ignore it most of the time. But when i hit puberty and stuff started to change i couldn’t ignore it anymore. The unfortunate thing tho is i was terrified to come out in case people thought it was sexual and that i was a pervert. Therefore i hid it and now at the age of 18 i have only come out to a few people
Well excuse me, I didn't expect to be stripped naked like a plucked chicken when I moseyed on down to Reddit today.
 This is such an accurate quote. You don't know how you're going to feel until you take the leap.
I mean, if you want to be a woman but haven't gone through female puberty via HRT, then you haven't gone through the changes that make a girl into a woman, therefore you're a girl. >:3
Wow I’m always amazed by how much I relate to others people’s experiences. It helps with the feelings of isolation I normally feel. Thank you for sharing.
This full article was amazing. I really hope more take the time to read it. It is impactful.
Oh thanks, i forgot to put de link lmao, i've put it in another comment
awesome thank u!!!!

#1tasteoftherainbowdidthistome	My good friend made a little meme out of my recent transition photo and it's too hilarious not to share with the rest of the internet, so enjoy 😅😂🤣	"you become better looking *and* get a bigger cleaner porker? That's a great deal!
Did the 🐷 get bigger?
Hah!! Love it. Is it the same piggy as well?? So cute.
***give me the drink***
😂
Damn you bud light!!! Damn you..
I love your nails!

Also, we need this as a meme template I think.
What?!?!😳

That's what happens when you drink Bud???😍

Dammit, I shoulda been chugging that garbage all these years.☹️😭
Inshallah
Can I let the piggie?
the Rainbow doesn't come from budlight it comes from Skittles
I need this in they/them flavor please
The hot girl beverage 💯. & aww cute 🐷
Works? 🥹
Wait, but I don’t want a bigger porker.
I was in it for the booby and better looking softer skin 🥰 the rest was unexpected but also pleasantly surprising lol
I love that emoji lol 🐷🐷 lil cute piggy wiggy :3
Well as with everything else trans, your mileage may vary, as they often say 😂🤣😂🤣
Thanks ! The pictures are actually about 5 years apart and I'm about 1 and a half years on hormones as of the 2nd pic 😁. I've been raising pigs a bit over 5 years now and i thought it would make a great transition before and after! And them all this bud light drama happened and my friend made this meme from my before and after post 😂🤣😂🤣
The swine kinda porker not the bad kind.

Recently made a promise to myself to stop feeling guilty for being butch. Embracing my identity and hopefully nailing it :D		"I'm getting some dark academia vibes here, you look fabulous, you're nailing it!
That's a brave, and very worthwhile promise. And you're nailing your look, so hopefully you nailed your promise for today too!!
Nailed it.
female version of david bowie
You look like Jesse from Pokémon
You look great hun! Yeah, I'd say you're rocking it!
You look amazing! I love your hair color!
I really like your hair! You go rock that butch look, shirt and vests are the fucking best!
im getting grelle suttcliffe vibes
Hi you look absolutely stunning and I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime.
you be you, girl, looking good ;-)
You look amazing!
Honestly when I realized that I didn't have to prove to anyone that I'm ""feminine enough"" to be trans, my life got WAAAAAY less stressful. Now I just wear skinny jeans and a flannel and I'm still a girl :)
That's a seriously cute look I like it!
This is stunning, you're nailing this. Huge inspiration for me to do the same
Awesome. You look amazing. I hope I can manage the same.
Fucking.

Brilliant.
just finished a very long shift and opened my phone to see everyones comments. Thanks for the kind words, it's honestly helped a ton :3
You look amazing girl! Keep rocking it!
This picture gave me gender envy, I hadn't even realized what board I was on.

You are so damn beautiful.
I love it! You're nailing it, and it's what I want to aim for, too. 

Recently realized we don't have to be girly girls just because I'm we're a girl now. We can be soft butch lesbians, that's totally an option. 😊🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
Butch ? Perhaps you are, but here you just look fire. Love everything ! The outfit, the hair, the glasses !!! omggg
Where’d you get those glasses!! They’re perfect!
Oh hey gf, fancy seeing u here xD 🥺✨
aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh
Gorgeous love the hair and all
transition goals!!! 😻
That lipstick color is perfect for your skin tone
I realize this is probably referring to academia in the sense of anime and not, y'know, academia - but 

Isn't all of academia dark and soul crushingly evil?
Except way hotter than Bowie
Omg heeeeey xD
I view it as more about discovering a love of learning in a darker clothing aesthetic that ties to Harry Potter, supernatural on college campuses, forbidden knowledge and secret societies. It was meant to be a compliment, I'm sorry if you didn't see it that way. I switch between light and dark academia (mostly clothing color aesthetic (but I do have a degree in Anthropology and a sizeable book collection)) depending on my mood. I really like the old school put together look.
yes
https://youtu.be/_inuS6Kcwq4 this video explains it pretty well. It's about the origins and inspirations. I'm more about the look overall, but it's very informative."	nwifzo	trans	866	0.99	2021-06-10 08:21:08
My sister is transphobic	"so me and my sister come from a toxic family environment, and she has been my support system for a year now

and today we got into the topic of lgbt and she told me that shes bi, and i was like yeah im in the community too but i couldn't find the right label and i cant really explain it so i just go by queer

wich she says that it cant be that complicated because i can eighter like none both or one of the genders

and i was like waht about enby ppl? aaaannd i shouldnt have said that, because then she says that all non binary people should find a therapist because the only reason they are enby is because they want to detach themselves from the world because of their problems 

or that they didnt like the gender norms and didnt follow them so they thought that they were enby and she also said that trans ppl should find a therapist too to make sure they're actually trans

WICH IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
she also said that only mentally ill people will not feel like a man or a woman and that ""a lot of statistics say that trans people are mentally ill"" (because yeah because people like you dismiss their identity)  and obv i dont go around looking for reasons to not beileve stuff thats basic common sense to me , so i had no back argument so i just said that it doesn't hurt anybody and its just respecting peoples boundaries

wich she said that its actually harmful to say that cuz its like when people say that they dont need to vaccinate themselves because other people get vaccinated( even tho thats a completely different thing) but then she says that it doesn't hurt anybody else but it hurts them cuz they're separating themselves from the world wich is also ridiculous 

but i am enby myself and it hurt so much i was crying while looking at my only support system fucking destroying me in the dms it hurt so much that the only person i could trust from my family invalidating me and my identity saying that im mentally ill and i should seek a therapist

and it hurt so much... and it still hurts, and i just... idk? i just feel like shit. so i thought maybe this subreddit could help me get some sympathy so uh yea here i am.

edit: thank you so much for the support here it really made my day better"	"I'm sorry to hear this has happened to you, big hug from me
So is my brother. I haven’t told him yet that I’m 99.9% certain his wife is a closeted trans man.
I am gender fluid myself and my partner is non-binary but personally I would recommend that everyone get a therapist, especially trans people. Obviously not to ""convert"" you but to help you through the difficult prosses of internal being someone most of the world won't accept by looking at you. I hope you find some more support systems and I hope your sister comes around.
Maybe she's just uneducated and would understand better if learned more about what being trans actually means, doesn't excuse her behavior but maybe she has a chance to become better, it's not our job to educate people on this but maybe it could help to give her some trustworthy recourses to learn
Cis community: abuse and gaslight us

Also the cis community: why are so many of you trans people crazy?
You hate to see it :/ sorry you gotta go through all that, no one deserves it
Everyone should see a therapist because mental health is important. Wtf. No one but you should confirm your gender. And if you are a certain gender because of trauma then that's completely valid too. Wtf. I feel this deep in my soul
Every time I see a post like this, I’m more and more glad I never relied on my family w/ LGBT+ support. They’ve literally NEVER been ok with it, and I’ve been out for almost 8 years now. They’re part of the reason I tried stuffing it down for nearly all that time. Mom, dad, and sister. I was lucky enough to have very supportive friends. I hope you do/will have some of your own soon! Sending good vibes 💛
I know it sucks to lose your support system, but the greatest support system you have is yourself.  Especially when you're feeling destroyed or alone, please remember you are not alone, however you feel is valid and as long as you love yourself and are kind to others you'll find good supportive people.
I’m sorry to have read about your situation. It’s difficult at times to find a real support person. Someone you can trust and be there for you. Tell your sister there are therapist out there for her too. Anyway love yourself first and stay safe.
I’ve been down this road as well…it’s rough and takes years of doubling down on yourself and setting things up for you to really move past it…

Best of luck (work) with it! In my experience family issues tied with this stuff is more complex and difficult than many other types of social interactions…

My advice is similar to some others…double down on you and find a way to build your life in such a way that props you up and holds you together.
Hey.  She might not understand it, she may even have a harmful view of it right now.  As you said, you both come from a toxic background, so you will both be carrying emotional and behavioral baggage from that.  I know she hurt you, but let go of it and when you have relaxed and healed a little, try calmly explaining to her how you love her, trust her, but because of that something she said hurt you very deeply.  Explain that you are hoping for her to support you without judgment and that you would like her to learn about you as you go through your journey, but that her current perspective is harmful, hurtful and painful to you.

I am sure she loves you as well.  I think this is your strongest approach to heal the divide between you before it grows too much.

Good luck.

My brother is the same way and it’s really a shame cause you get to know your siblings so well and they seem like good people until the ol’ boomer transphobic/homophobic side shows up. It’s the worst. 💕**hugs** 💕
Oof, that's a lot OP. Hugs for you. Your sister's take is nuts.
How would she be the expert if she is had never experienced it, or a part of the community. Same goes for any minority. Definitely uneducated or led down wrong thinking. My older sister is also bi but she’s so cool and accepting,y biggest transition supporter, so I’m sad to hear that :( it may take a lot of time and hard efforts to go through a process together so she can come to terms with not only your identity and thoughts, but of real people who exist that are non-binary. I would feel they are kind of rude no matter who they are if I heard that, I’m not non-binary so who am I to have opinions on whether they exist or are some mythological unicorns?!? But they definitely do.
I mean being trans and getting a therapist to figure things out isn't the worst idea-- but yeah she crazy xD
Oh, I'm so sorry for you, I hope you are getting over it! Much love ❤️ from me 🥰
Plenty of enby people have therapists........ and will always be enby because that's who they are
Coming from a genderfluid individual who hates being in therapy: Therapists are good for your mental health in general, it has nothing to do with “conversion” or whatever tf.

Also, I’m non-binary *and* mentally ill but they necessarily connected. So your entire family is absolutely ridiculous. (My mom is queerphobic, so I get it. It really sucks.)
I’m your sister now not her
""You didn't say they were from the undercity!""

""What difference does that make?""

""??? They're dangerous!""

""*I'm* from the undercity.""
For starters, I'm really sorry to hear about this. I hope things get better in your relationship with your sister, and or I hope you can find a new healthy supporter. 

Otherwise, there's a lot going on here, but the only thing I would like to say is this. I believe all people who are questioning themselves should find a therapist or counselor. But absolutely make sure they're knowledgeable and have dealt with others in the LGBTQ+ community first. You have no idea how greatly it can impact you. You will learn more about yourself, why you feel certain things, etc. 

When I came out to my dad, he politely asked me to seek a therapist or counselor, which I already wanted to do. I haven't talked with her a crazy amount, but the handful of sessions we have had really helped me a lot.
Oml I will be a support system if you need it bro I hate it when that happens and if you’re comfortable you could talk to me (sorry if it seems creepy, I just don’t want anyone to not have someone to support them or someone to listen)
I want to drop-kick her a$$
My dad is like that, super homophobic and, this was when I was still exploring my gender, when I tentatively breached the topic of me being trans he was like ""so you think you're a boy, huh?"" and I pretty much had to abort mission. So I can definitely relate, and I'm sorry your sister is Like That. Sending massive amounts of support your way!!
Absolutely ridiculous that she's bi and doesn't realize how stupid that is. There are still people who say that about anyone in the lgbtq community. Really childish.
>or that they didnt like the gender norms and didnt follow them so they thought that they were enby

😬... Yeah that one hurts because I used to actually think that. Kinda embarrassing, really.

I'm sorry to hear your sister is transphobic op. I hope she grows out of it for your sake.
🫂
TW: Curse words

Please, go to your bitchy sister and tell her that the only person that needs a therapist here is her and that she's cis so she should shut the fuck up, and mind her own fucking business. Tell her that being non-binary is valid and it's not up for debate. She should do a deep dive and think ,,Hmm, I wonder why trans people have mental issues"" and actually do her research and maybe start thinking critically about her actions and mindset.

If you don't feel comfortable confronting her, then that's fine. It's not your job nor responsibility to educate anyone. I'm enby too and my family is pretty fucked up so think I can understand the frustration and sadness that you might feel. I am really sorry that this has happened to you. I hope that your situation will get better soon.

And remember, this community is a safe space and you can tell us about your struggles. We can be an internet support system for you. I hope I helped. Have a nice day <3
Send this to her: https://youtu.be/N89SAwXVK7Y

When she asks if you're nonbinary, ask her if she's an ally. Don't answer her question until she answers yours. She's not entitled to your coming out if she's going to be an asshole about it.
Kiddo, I am your new sibling now. Fuck her, she ain’t worth it.
thank you so much really needed this today haha!
Really?!?!?
I'm sorry, I'm probably misreading your post, but it sounds like if you were 100% sure they were a closeted transman, you're saying you would tell your brother, who is a transphobe, that in fact his wife is a closeted transman?
Have you ever seen signs of him being bi-curious?
yea your right ngl if everyone got a therapist the world whould be a better place haha!
I'm currently going to see someone so I can get a diagnosis for my dysphoria. Like, I've self diagnosed it long ago, but I can't get in to see an Endocrinologist for hrt without the diagnosis and I think it will just be easier going forward if I have it to point to like ""yes I'm trans AND I'm medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria"" in case the US healthcare system tries to fuck me over for medical treatments in the future.
In germany it's mandatory for a trans person to get a therapeutic assessment
yeah i get your point but i tried to explain it i her but she didnt listen and then saidthat people who are genderfluid are just attention seeker's so i stopped trying to explain it to her after that haha
cis ally here, those types of people are making it harder for me to do what I want, which is make people happy

c'mon people, just let trans people live their lives
THATS WHAT IM SAYING LIKE-
its okay , thank you tho! i was really upset about this you (and the people who liked/commented this post) really cheered me up so i thank you fro that haha!
fucking exactly
thank you
thank you
yeah i guess youre right its just funny to me that me at 13 needs to be the mature one in an argument with a 23 y.o. but yea thank you
thanks for the support srs im getting overwhelmed by everyone being so kind to me haha-
ok hello big sis haha!
thats kinda how that went (i mean i didn't tell her that i was non binary cuz she would go nuts but yea)
No dont worry not creepy at all! thank you so much i would appreciate some support haha- so when you have time just dm' me and we could talk if you want to [:
No problem, glad to help
No. Just that he wife is probably a trans man and separately that they hadn’t told him
What I meant: he's openly transphobic but at the same time he's married to a closeted trans person. And no  I won't tell him. I don't want to mess with his life the way he messes with mine. Plus none of this is his wife's fault. I just hope he doesn't make transphobic comments to her as well.
Not really, no tbh
That would be awesome but could you imagine how many people would have to be therapists
pretty sure its the same in the uk, you need to see a therapist in order to get hormones

pretty sure its just so someone doesnt start hormones and then regret it
Not for ""conversion"" right? Because that would be pretty fucked up
Sometimes people don't back down in an argument even if they are losing a lot. But some people think about it afterwards and can change opinion after that and some research. I may be projecting but i used to be a little like that. I was mostly influenced by bigoted people and if your sister is a good person which she probably is, she may be influenced as well. Or not. You surely know better than me. I hope the best!
Honestly, I've found people like this change most readily when they know they are hurting you. I don't mean to say you should come out to her or anything, but she has no reason to consider any other views now because she had learned somewhere that the testimony of enby folks is untrustworthy. Hearing from a trusted source hits very different.

I guess I'm just being hopeful, it seems hard to believe that someone who has been so supportive and is also LGBT won't at least keep an open mind when their reality conflicts with their bigotry.
That sucks, hope you're doing alright though <3
You're absolutely welcome!
Welcome to being gender non-conforming.  We always have to be the adults in the room.
Cool, I’m glad I could help a little
Gotcha! Thanks for clarifying, I appreciate it. Well all the best to them, and you :)
Especially cause most therapists need therapy themselves
yeahhhh that whouldnt work that much whould it? also like what whould the therapists do like therapise themselves or just go to other therapists? its kinda the: great in theory bad in reality (ik thats probably not the saying but i forgot it lmao)
No, definitely not. That would be even more fucked up if you think about that the therapists would have to be in on it, which now that I write this seems kinda obvious
No, but they get to decide whether to give you an indication for HRT or not, which is almost the only way to get hormones in Germany.
i mean i think shes a good person but also there was probably a reason why i always felt uncomfortable around her so i don't really know
ig yea haha
Thank you
A surprising number of people go into psychology to figure out what’s wrong with themselves, so yeah….
They would go to other therapists. Like how physicians should also be seen by other physicians. Everyone needs medical help sometimes, including the doctors themselves
Good, I had figured Germany was pretty accepting but whenever I hear the phrase ""trans people are required too..."" I immediately assume the worst
A thing that is not recommended by specialists as far as I know
AI can bé therapists.

Confidence after transitioning! 📈⬆️⏫🔝	"My confidence has gone really high since being myself, it's wowowow. Beforehand I was a shy 'boy' stuck behind the computer, now I'm a really confident woman that has done things I wouldn't have seen myself doing a couple years ago. Making new friends, love, heartbreak, new experiences, social being, sense of direction, self development.

It has really helped to find my identity, without it I was lost.

Idk why I'm writing this I'm just proud of myself and want others to know that transitioning is so worth all the struggles you go through."	"You go girl!!! Live your best authentic life!
I'm proud of you! And I feel the same way. By living authentically, I actually feel in control of my life. I have a life I actually *want*. It's a wonderful feeling and I'm so glad your enjoying your journey!!
That so great to read!

I totally get you. I was a shy boy, right now transitionning into a relatively confident woman. I felt confident enough to ask to be trained to take on responsability at work that I didn't think I was ready for not that long ago. 

I had been gaining confidence at my job even before my coming out last fall, but being truer to myself has certainly given me a boost.
I can’t wait until I feel like that! I’m currently known as the quiet “girl” at school and it has been really wearing me down. I don’t mind being the quiet kid but just the fact everyone (except for my friends) sees me as a girl hurts.
Woohoo!!!

So happy for you!
🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
Congrats!
Im feeling this more and more each day, everytime I see myself in the mirror and see that I'm a little closer to the real me I get excited and want to go out and kinda ""show off"". 

Kinda like a kid who found something cool and wants to show their friends.
When you on that true gender high and a relationship that's actually sexually satisfying drops 👸
That is amazing! I’m so glad you found you.
I'm so happy for you! Wish I had that confidence.
You go girl ❤️ congrats!!
Thank you for sharing this. <3
You go girl!!
I’m happy that you get to be yourself and that your confidence went up as well! It gives me hope that maybe one day I could be that confident
I'm happy
You go girl !!!
Proud of you, fam. You deserve the best.
I'm so happy for you girl!
You go girl!!!!!!!1
I feel you
I nearly teared up in a meeting reading this. You go girl, live it all up! 💜💜 

You’re charging all of us up with energy! I’m just happy I can browse the make-up and womens’ aisles like I own the place now. So looking forward to reaching your level!
I feel the same way
You go girl! Live the good life!
Hopefully I can do the same someday
Aaaaa good for you!!! It's absolutely amazing that you're living a life you want, and I hope it continues to get better. Stay strong, girl!🏳️‍⚧️
Good for you
Felt im finally feeling stronger and more confident im glad youre feeling this way
God i hope your right, it’s funny how I’m reading this now. Earlier today I was sad because I thought I wasn’t going to pass and it really bummed me out. I want to start going full time in girl mode on the 18th of May I really want that confidence instilled in me when I walk out those doors next week. My friends will be with me the whole day but I think what’s important is comfort. Which is what I feel on the inside, I just need it to come out.
I relate to this! Transition made me feel tougher and a lot more comfortable almost overnight :D
Thank you so much!! I will!!
Yes! Life is no means perfect, but it's wonderful to actually feel that I have an identity and am myself now. I'm proud of you too! Is your name from The Expanse? 🥰
That's really amazing, keep going!!! I'm starting Uni soon and hope I'll keep the confidence for there!
I'm sorry that is happening to you. I can't even imagine what it must be like to be trans at school. I'm sure soon you'll be able to feel like this soon! Sending lots of love!
Thank you! 🥰🥰
Definitely!! Do show off! Be proud of yourself 🥰
I'm sure you'll gain new confidence! ❤️
Aww really? 🥺
Thank you so much!! Yesss, you'll get more and more confident for sure. I may not seem that confident when people see me, but compared to the past, I'm miles ahead.
I hope the 18th will go great!! I still have days of really bad dysphoria, things aren't at all near perfect, I don't feel I pass, but, I have still gained new confidence as I am becoming more myself with each passing day. I hope it'll go well for you! 🥰
Thank you. It’s been tough, I won’t lie, but I feel it’s gonna benefit me in the long run.
Thank you for the words of support, my friends told me yesterday that I’ll be fine. I think I think I just hyped myself up to much."	ukzced	trans	855	0.99	2022-05-08 11:00:55
"""Is it transphobic to not want trans people in 'women/men only' spaces?"""	"Like what the actual fuck do you think ""transphobic"" means?! YES. Yes it is transphobic. Yes it does mean invalidating the identity of trans people. Yes it does mean that you want to treat trans people as second class citizens, unable to use facilities provided to every other member of our species. Are trans people not allowed to use the bathroom? Are bearded trans men supposed to strip down to their underwear in front of cis women? What. The. FUCK.  
  
I saw this on my front page. People suck.  
  
/rant"	"I mean it’s just another way to invalidate trans people for sure.
Why are you excluding trans people from those spaces? A trans woman is a woman, the trans man is a man.

So unless you are suggesting that they're going to do something, I don't see why you would go out of your way to exclude them from those spaces.

So indulge me, what are trans people going to do in those spaces that you're so afraid that they're going to do? And those things are things that apparently cis person would never do in those spaces? 

How about this we just ban all bigots who have narrow point of views from fucking politics. 

After all those spaces are meant for people who aren't dumbasses.
I’m so tired of being discussed. Of being a topic of conversation instead of a person. Seeing those kinds of posts everywhere all the time is fucking exhausting.
I’m so tired of these bad faith political posts being featured by Reddit, hiding behind the thin veneer of “just asking questions”.
Any time the topic comes up i just tell them ""replace the words""trans people "" with ""black people "" and ask if it sounds racist""
Cis person: ""Is it transphobic to be transphobic?""

100 other cis people: ""No, of course not!""
It fucking sucks. Trans people just want to live their lives
I feel like no matter how hard I try to avoid dehumanizing takes on Trans people, I can't seem to avoid it. It's so tiring to even wanna argue it anymore, I just wish cis people would get a fucking life and stick their nose somewhere that actually mattered. 

And I laughed at all the responses in the threads advocating for gender neutral bathrooms. Like all this could be avoided if a bunch of bigots were just ignored and shunned from the rest of society. Instead we have to do this weird roundabout solution just to avoid the ire of a bunch of cousin fuckers.
I saw the question on the original sub reddit and thought the same thing. Plus the comments were like ""No you're not because trans people are delusional"" I almost got into a argument with half the comment section but stopped myself. I was so mad and I hope the page gets deleted.
Sounds to me like cis people want to define what is and is not transphobic. Rather than the trans people, who you'd expect to know best lol
I keeping seeing ‘discussions’ like this EVERYWHERE and I’m so done with it all. My existence, OUR existence, should not be for debate. We are real people who just want to live our lives peacefully. Someone’s religion should not get to decide whether we live or not. It’s absolutely ridiculous (understatement of the century). 

Trans women are women. Trans men are men. This isn’t a new thing for fuck’s sake. Trans people have existed for AGES.
I saw it but scrolled past quickly because I was in no type of headspace to be reading the comments on that post.

I’m afraid to ask but….was the general attitude in the comments positive or negative towards trans people?
IT IS TERF RHEOTORIC!  terf's are so annoying
""Is it racist to not want colored people to drink from our water fountains ?""

People see ""phobia"" and think it's like being afraid of spiders smh my head
I love how the OP of that thread just posted it and left, never replying to any comments. It's almost like it wasn't a legitimate question but a way to get people to argue with each other. I'm so tired.
It's fucking segregation and it's disgusting
Cis people just let trans people live our goddamn lives in peace and quiet and not turn our entire existence and fight for basic civil and human rights into a fucking debate topic Challenge (LEVEL: IMPOSSIBLE)
Yes, people don’t realize that the definition of transphobia is the disbelief that trans people are actually the gender they say they are and not wanting to treat them like any other member of their gender.
I saw this on my front page too, and luckily most of the top comments seemed to agree with us here. Still a stupid question, but I’m glad OP (who was married to an incredibly transphobic dude iirc) decided to ask at all instead of blindly accepting her (?) husband’s (?) opinion
Or to rephrase their question, ""is putting trans people into a position where they're likely to get the shit kicked out of them for the comfort of bigots transphobic?""

Seriously, it's a fucking safety issue. People are either too stupid to realize that, or their goal is to make other people unsafe for cruelty's sake.
Yep. Transphobic.
definitely transphobic
Trans ppl are just not allowed in public according to those people lmao
Short answer: yes.

Long answer: yeeeeeees.
WE ARE PEOPLE NOT POLITICS
If you’re referring to the r/nostupidquestions post I would 1) remind you of the sub name and 2) suggest you actually read the post. It was a good faith question. People should be able to ask good faith questions and it’s a damn good thing that person asked the question that I suspect has annoyed you so much because they were asking it after listening to transphobic rhetoric from people they know. They wanted to avoid being transphobic.
I think the only case where it’s okay to exclude trans people is in a case where someone has severe PTSD or trauma and have people who look/sound masculine or feminine as a trigger for it. Other than that, excluding trans people from single gender spaces is absolute BS
It's also just pro rape. Sa against cis women doesn't change with trans bathroom protections, but it sure as fuck goes up for trans people without those protections.
I saw this too and was going to chime in before it got locked. So frustrating. I shouldn’t have to wave my “proof of genetically grown vagina” card before I take a dump at a restaurant, I just want to be a normal woman doing normal things. 

I feel like most people that are worried about this have probably taken a shit next to trans people many times without even knowing. The only reason they’re scared is because someone tells them they should be. Personally I’m going to keep using the bathroom like any other normal person, without making eye contact or saying anything, and I bet nobody will ever notice.
Wow. That’s crazy and infuriating
Ppl are absolutely stupid sometimes
Yes PLS, lets Just have the genital inspector in the bathrooms, or Just create a third bathroom, for creating much more feel of akwardness beetween female and male trans people, OR Just do 4 bathrooms, why not eh? Transphobia Is Just a freaking mess and they don't want to realize that.
I feel this so hard.  I didn't know how bad the problem was until my partner started transitioning and had to determine while were out of the house - wtaf she was supposed to go to the restroom?  And due to anxiety not going wasn't an option!

Feck people who are afraid for no reason.  I'm all for unisex bathrooms if it solves the damn problem.  Or you know - individual stalls that you can't see into. 
And who the heck thought peepable stalls were a good idea in the first place?! That's what I want to know! I just love making eye contact with a human I don't know when I'm sitting on the porcelain throne.
r/okaybuddysneedhon
Ik I see so many cishet AND queer people being like ""I'm not transphobic but...... \*something transphobic*""
omfg i saw that same post on my home page

i cannot tell you how much these garbage takes infuriate me... what, out of everything they pick on, they decide ""OH, you know whats a big problem in society??? trans people using public bathrooms that are meant for their gender."" literally stfu
If you don't allow trans people in their preferred spaces, you are telling them they aren't what they are. You are invalidating them. Segregating them is just another form of harm.
I think I read somewhere that the ""women's"" restroom came because when women started getting rights and were alowed to work, the men felt uncomfortable going to the same toilet as them as if they were equal or somthing. So really I dont know if the restrooms should still be gendered in the first place.
I wish we could make everyone feel comfortable without getting angry at eachother. Maybe further educating the public on trans matters might really help everyone.
Segregation 2.0.
Makes me think of a girl who makes girl only parties but allows trans men to come in.

I get that our experience in life is different from some cis men but it still hurts in my opinion.
Not really biology is still in place and trans women will stay trans women and biological women will stay biological women. It’s just how it is but why not love ourselves for being trans instead of trying to compare ourselves to biological women and their feelings.
It's always been a basic way of segregating second class citizens. Black women weren't allowed in female restrooms because they were ""more violent and dangerous to the poor weak white women"" and in the UK, when the church reformed, catholic women weren't allowed in the female restrooms because they might ""corrupt the poor, easily influenced protestant women""

In both cases, and now with trans women, two things hold true:

1) Socially acceptable women are weak and can't defend themselves physically or mentally

2) Not socially acceptable women are not only stronger, but also aggressive and violent. 

Funny how bigots tend to repeat history without even realizing it.
I FULLY AGREE WITH THIS POINT. It's happened so many times to deny trans people exist.
There would be no GOP then lol (which I’m fine with)
I don't even *really* get why gendered bathrooms are still a thing anyway.

Like...all people do is go in, privately do their business, wash their hands (hopefully), maybe touch up makeup a bit in the mirror, and leave.
Idk man me pissing in the stall instead of the urinal has got to be fucking *terrifying* for the cis dudes in the bathroom, I'm sure of it.
The only argument that I’ve heard that seems valid is that if sexually assaulted, (especially in a state that now bans abortion), a woman could get stuck with a rape pregnancy. 

Personally, I believe that the number of trans women out there who would rape is extremely small, but it is still a danger, and still happens. To ignore the issue and demonize people who bring it up is only going to hurt us -and more importantly, victims of said abuse- in the long run
you’re voicing my exact thoughts. it’s kind of surreal sometimes
I call it JAQing off
Literally did that and the person said that's fine too. Is it bad or good that they're going full mask off? 😮‍💨
which... is what they said about black people back then. That black men are dangerous subhumans who will rape white women. Same playbook.
could not be more accurate
Well actually as a nb with restroom panic I like gender neutral bathrooms.
Mainly positive. And heck i think they were quoting there mother bc they weren’t sure bc her mom was never called on her bull.  Not great but a lot better than i thought.

Edit: although maybe i looked at a different post. The one I saw was 2X chromosomes
I am allowed to be frustrated by general transphobia. Did I attack the person who asked the question? No, I expressed my frustration at the lack of general understanding for such a simple concept. I am allowed to be frustrated, and I am allowed to vent. I don't need someone telling me it's not okay to be upset by being potentially thought of as subhuman.
No, we don't punish innocent people for someone's trauma.
Yeah that's pretty invalidating
“White feminism” which reinforces the patriarchy versus true, intersectional feminism.
Lmao I love your username
Hell I don't even do that, public bathrooms are the bane of my existence.

I don't even know how people can comfortably poop, with strangers all around them.
""BREAKING NEWS: Trans men and closeted trans women terrorize men's bathrooms with urinal boycott! THE END OF SOCIETY???""
Do you know how much More likely it would be for that person to pretend to be a janitor, or just run in when no one's looking?

It's not like there's an invisible barrier on the door that can prevent anyone from walking in.

It's just a lame excuse to exclude and attack trans people.

And then you get your next problem once they succeed there they're going to start banning gay people from being able to enter the bathroom, for the same exact reason.

Let's face it we're going back to the same excuses that they used for segregation. And they're too ignorant and blind to freaking see what's happening.
I think this will be different for everyone. I don’t even feel just one way about it myself. 

I was talking with an (ex)friend about Lia Thomas and he kept misgendering her. I told him “look, we can continue talking about trans athletes but you WILL gender Lia correctly or you ARE a bigot and we are done.” He responded “oh, if I want to talk to you about schizophrenia, does that mean I also have to put on a tinfoil hat?”

On the one hand, I appreciate him taking off the mask because i immediately understood that I shouldn’t waste any more of my life on him. On the other, I can’t actually avoid him because he and I are in some of the same social circles. And there have been plenty of times when just worrying that he would be at an event was enough to ruin my mood for that event. 

So, my conclusive answer is: “it’s complicated” 

This part is more of a vent than actually relevant but I still can’t get that response out of my head. In the conversation, I had already told him that intentionally misgendering a person he knew was trans was no different than using a racist or queer-phobic slur. So for him to then respond to my ultimatum by not only affirming his commitment to his bigotry but by introducing a fourth way for him to be shitty that I hadn’t even considered…it just blew my mind. Like, you’re not only sticking to the transphobia but you’re also going to, unprompted, tell me that you’re an asshole about mental health as well.
At least you know to avoid them now 🗿
I'm down for gender neutral bathrooms in addition to what we already have.
I think the same person might have posted on multiple subs. I saw it on NoStupidQuestions, but it was basically the same poat you're describing. 

Response on NoStupidQuestions was overwhelmingly positive too, tbf. The top comments all seemed to be some variation of ""yes of course it's transphobix sorry your mum sucks"" and ""I don't understand why public bathrooms are gendered anyway, just make full floor-to-ceiling stalls and have em all be gender neutral""
Yes, even your very first sentence sounds like an attack. “What the actual fuck do you think “transphobic” means?” Well they don’t know, hence why they asked the question. “I saw this on my front page. People suck” definitely doesn’t sound like you’re saying “I have no problem with people asking questions like this” to me
Of course not, but that doesn’t negate that person’s right to a safe space
Mine?  Ty, it’s not very clever but is accurate lol
>just make full floor-to-ceiling stalls and have em all be gender neutral""

Amen
Thats a relief
I posted it here, not on the actual post. I'm fucking *venting* for fucks sake. I'm not talking to that person at all. Give it a rest.
Why should that safe space disregard people who are also allowed to be there?

If a cis woman passes as a man should she be pushed out of a safe space because of someone else's trauma? 
Accommodations should be made but never at the expense of someone else's safety. 

Every woman has a right to a safe space and no one has the right to push them out over something like that.
Exactly. I wouldn’t want to trigger anyone’s trauma, because that makes me feel horrible. Especially because solitary confinement is horrible and would only cause more trauma. I don’t like that this is even something we have to grapple with, but it is.
I just think it's funny, maybe because I suddenly realized that I was a girl all along in 2022"	11pzjid	trans	846	0.98	2023-03-13 04:03:24
My 5 year old says they’re a girl	"For context, I am a cis woman myself and may accidentally get some things wrong. Please feel free to correct me, and just know that I am still learning. 

My child is five years old, AMAB. They are also on the spectrum, and sometimes have difficulty with pronouns (typically using he/she for the incorrect gender, but will switch them if corrected).

Because of that, my partner thinks they may not understand gender and believes I’m overthinking this for their current age. 

But hear me out - my child has referred to themselves as a girl for as long as they could talk. If you call them a boy, they will correct you and say “No, I’m a girl.” They love video games and will choose a girl avatar every time. A few day ago, they told me they have started using the girl’s bathroom at school (which my partner and I are both supportive of) and have asked their friends to call them a girl. They said it makes them feel sad when some of their classmates say “no, you’re a boy.”

To me, this all sounds like something that has been consistent for the entirety of their life so far. But I have people in my circle (who are cis themselves) who think it’s ridiculous that a five year old would have any concept of gender identity and will potentially grow out of this, and that I should just ignore it for now. I don’t think it’s a phase, but have just been trying to respect my child’s wishes for pronouns, bathrooms, etc. and don’t want to put any pressure on them either way. 

I guess the reason I’m posting this is because I was wondering if anyone here knew they were assigned the wrong gender at a young age, or if any of these things were relatable to you when you were a child. Also, are there any questions I should be asking them? Trying to help this child have as little trauma as possible lol

Edit: First off, I am overwhelmed with gratitude to everyone who decided to comment and share their experiences. One thing I remembered that wasn’t in my original post is how if you ask my child what they want to be when they grow up, their answer is always “a girl.” I do believe they are probably trans, but am going to encourage them to be themselves regardless of gender identity. Love the suggestions for a child therapist, am going to pursue that route as well. Luckily, we live in a very liberal/lgbtq-affirming city and I know that whatever decisions they make about their body will be met with love and support."	"Yes, I knew at a super young age. Not everyone does, but many do.

My personal recommendation is to find them a child therapist to help them work through things and figure out what they want & ensure they understand. You can figure out next actions based on that.
Yes, I had it in a young age but not that strong and my parents are transphobic. Now I am 20 years old and suffer from not being a girl (No Hormones yet etc.)
Autistic trans masc here:

1 out of 6 autistic people are trans. We're more common then most people think. Best thing to do is to just call her a girl. If she stays like this, congratulations, you have a trans daughter. If she doesn't stay like this, congratulations, you have a cis son. Kids should have a safe place to experiment with gender expression and pronouns. It would've changed a lot in my life if my parents had done this.
I have very spotty memory of my earlier childhood but i do remember wanting to be thumbelina and being sad when i was told i couldn't cause she was a girl.  I also remember wanting to skip and being told boys don't do that. Also being really interested in braiding hair. If i was given the freedom to choose then i would've figured it out, but since i was told i couldn't by people i had no reason not to trust i just accepted that.


Children can know their gender at a very young age. If they can understand the concept there is no reason to believe they couldn't know how it applies to themselves. 


I think you're doing the right thing. There is no harm that comes from respecting her wishes now, and if she feels the same way when she begins puberty then she can take measures to avoid the wrong puberty and avoid an enormous load of trauma and a lifetime of pain that comes with that.  I wish my parents had let me have that freedom.
Children as young as two can understand gender, so don't listen to the people saying your child is too young to know! Just listen to your child, support your child in their choice to use whatever pronouns and name and clothes are affirming, and if they are trans they will feel affirmed and figure out it's right for them. You should also find them a child therapist who is experienced in dealing with trans kids in an affirming way.
I just want to say I think it’s amazing that you’ve come online to try and find people with experience and ask questions, that’s an amazing step so many people would never take and I think it shows how much you love your child. 

I think you know your kid better than anyone, if this has been something so consistent, from such a young age, I would trust your instinct and keep listening to what they’re telling you. 

Because I’m 110% sure, they will thank you so so much for it when they’re older! I definitely don’t think it’s a ridiculous idea that someone who’s five can have a grasp of those concepts, I think in many ways they’re innate, I just hope it goes well for you all and I want you to know you’re a great mum!
studies show that children have a concept of their gender identity as young as the age of 3. I’ve also heard (haven’t researched thought) that people on the spectrum often experience gender differently then neurotypical people. You are doing everything right respecting your child’s identity.
At the age of 10, with my first mobile phone, I worked up the courage to call up a sex ed helpline to ask about getting a sex change (terminology of 10yo me). I didn't have the courage to actually finish my question without hanging up but...yeah.
>But I have people in my circle (who are cis themselves) who think it’s ridiculous that a five year old would have any concept of gender identity and will potentially grow out of this

For all we know, she might! But is there any harm in humoring it, if it makes her happy? 

A lot of times people act like transitioning is this huge, completely-life-derailing decision that can never ever be undone, but in truth I don't think you have too much to worry about. Your kid won't be taking any medication or anything until she hits puberty at the earliest, and even if she starts taking hormones, she can always go off them if she decides otherwise. So as for now it's really just a matter of how she wants to present herself to the world in dress and presentation and things like that :)

That said if she's been insisting on this for as long as you can remember, it does sound like a lot of trans kids i've heard of that knew at a young age. But, either way, I just want to reassure you that letting your kid experiment is probably not doing irreparable damage.
I didn't think ""I'm a girl"" at a young age, but I did wish I was a girl a lot. But I think it's such a personal experience, that it may be difficult to judge how your child will develop based on how other people did.
I first knew around that time. And then was closeted for years since my family wasn't quite as cool as you seem.

You're amazing parents btw!
So the whole ‘they’re too young to know’ thing is only ever applied to children who declare as anything other than entirely cis. It’s an invalid argument from the get-go, because if children really were ‘too young to know’ then we would not be treating them as girls or boys based on their body parts to begin with. 

Also, even if your kid was ‘too young’ and they determined later that they actually did want to go by agab pronouns, then … so? Even if this lasted a week, so? (I don’t think it will in this case ftr). Kids exploring gender and figuring out where they fit and who they are is normal. And gender identity evolves as well. Gender can change and our understanding of our gender can (and should) evolve. 

Basically, your kid is sad when someone calls her a boy and happy when someone calls her a girl. So people should call her a girl. If that ever changes, even to the extent of her wanting to be fully identified as a boy, then just do this again and ask people and institutions to use the pronouns they prefer at the time. It’s totally fine to do that more than once. 

Anyway, you are right and your husband is wrong. Also, I’d ask him what’s going on underneath his ‘too young’ argument. It might be that his resistance is less about having a trans child and more about fear of what might happen to his openly trans child in a world  that often doesn’t like trans people, and that’s getting in the way of him understanding the reality of the harm that also comes from kids  being forced to pretend to be someone they aren’t because who they are ‘isn’t ok’.

I’m nonbinary by the way, and have always been aware on some level that I was both boy and girl, although for a lot of my life I did not know that this was a valid and possible identity, only that o wasn’t comfortable being only a girl, but I wasn’t only a boy either. If that makes sense.
At about 4 years old, when I understood that I wasn't going to wake up some morning as a girl. I felt like there was a mistake somewhere. So if I'm not an aberration then yes some of us do have that sense. I was forced into dropping that feeling or else. Thank you for being a concerned parent.
Sociologists generally accept that it’s between the ages of 4 and 6 that we begin to identify and become connected to our social expressions of gender, so no: I don’t think 5 is too young to understand the concept. That being said, I’m not an expert - just a transfemme with a few sociology and anthropology courses under my belt.

As a person who’s on the spectrum and wishes people took me seriously when I was a kid, I’ll just recommend you take their desires to heart and let them express themselves how they see fit. Other people might think it’s not okay, but if you know what makes your kid happy and what makes them miserable, then do what makes them happy.
25 years ahead of me
  
As painful as it might be for them and you, believe me it's better they don't spend the next 25 years as a boy if they aren't.  I did a lot of cool shit in my 20s as a boy NGL but still. 
  
They'll either grow out of it on their own like my tomboy cister did when she reached puberty, or they won't.
If they've been like that they're whole life then it's likely they know they're a girl. Maybe try finding a therapist and then figure out the next actions. I wish I knew from a young age, I'm 19 and now have all the emotional baggage that came along with living falsely. You've got this and its amazing your trying your best as a parent!
The cool thing about being trans at a young age is there's a lot of time before puberty really has a chance to do its thing. As others have said, going to a gender therapist regularly may help sort things out, and allow your child some time to explore who they are, and give you a moment to understand the world you may get more exposed to :)

I want to take a moment to express appreciation for your word choice, especially considering how new you say you are to this. You said ""my child says"" instead of ""my child thinks,"" and used AMAB rather tastefully as well, I think (acknowledged that that was the assignment at birth, which may or may not be correct). Kudos, in my opinion!
Well, I also had suspicions from 5 years old, I remember ask to my mom “how does it feel to be a girl” while she was making se dinner. Anyway I guess you should seek for a child therapist.
As extra sometimes people forget this rule: “if they were able to know that they were boy/girls at 5 years old so do your *son*”
This makes me so happy to read 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 you’re so awesome for reaching out. I knew from a very young age, much before I knew what transgender or transitioning meant. I just knew that I didn’t feel comfortable with the body I had.
If your child is being taught gender roles (which society pushes at that age) then they understand enough to know if it fits them or not. My earliest memories in life are of being confused about why people were pushing me into the gender roles that felt wrong to me. A therapist is definitely a great idea.
Support them unconditionally. Worst case scenario, they grow out of it. Best case, they feel accepted and never have to experience  transphobia from their parents.
I wish I knew when I was that young, before I had any sense of embarrassment or fear or what people would think. Sadly I started to realise much later and at that point I was so nervous to disappoint my parents or worry them in any way I just couldn't do it
At 3 I was forced a ""nice little boy haircut"" by my grandma.  I hated it.  I didn't know why I couldn't have long hair like my mom.  At 4, I was screamed at by my dad for having my nails painted.  I was confused why I couldn't paint my nails, but mom could.  I always HATED being called ""handsome"".  I wanted to be pretty.

I never thought ""I'm a girl"" as a kid, because I didn't understand the difference.  I thought everyone had a penis.  I had no idea I would for certain go through male puberty.  I thought it was random how you developed.  At 9, I said I wished it was possible to change sex.  I thought every boy wished they were girls.

I wasn't great at understanding things, or advocating for myself, or really explaining myself, but I knew on some level I was a girl my whole life.  Once male puberty happened, I died inside.  I couldn't function.  Couldn't date, couldn't hold work, couldn't make lasting friends.  I was miserable until I came out at 33.  When I went for an HRT letter, I was diagnosed with autism.  So much stuff finally made sense.

If I knew as a kid what I know now, I would've been adamant.  But I was born in 86.  Nobody talked about trans kids, or knew what autism was.  I went through life suffering, with no answers and no help.

I wish you luck.  Support them no matter what.
Hey OP, this may ease the doubts your husband may have about it potentially just bwing the autism:
https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/amp

There's a correlation between being on the spectrum and being non-cisgender. In other words, an autistic person is more likely to be trans than a non-autistic person, and vice versa. It's therefor important to be extra observant in these cases and to not discount one for the other
As someone who is on the autism spectrum, a lot of autistic people don't understand the concept of gender which is why a lot of trans and non-binary people are also autistic. We tend to play around with gender more and figure out we're not cis more than neurotypical people.    
     
If your child says they're a girl believe them.
Being autistic makes them more likely to be trans, it's statistically significant comorbidity. I say this as an autistic trans woman.
In kindergarten (around age 4-5) I would always gravitate forwards the boys and things deemed “for the boys”. For example, when asked to divide into lines based on gender, I would always go to the back of the boy’s line before being redirected to the “correct” one. I would claim “the boys are more like me” or “I’m more like a boy inside” when this happened. Luckily, I had great teachers who generally let us do whatever we wanted, so I was usually able to experience kinder in a non-conforming way, which I loved. My tendency to prefer to be grouped with boys and even perceived as one continued all throughout my childhood. When my egg finally cracked, I realised that some part of me had known the truth all along. I recommend finding a trans-friendly therapist for your child and preferably one who can also offer family sessions to you and your husband as well. Also, encourage your child to be their true self. As others have said, the worst that could happen is you let your child be happy and fulfilled during a phase of experimentation. Nobody loses here. You’re doing great.
Get them a child therapist. Kids that age do go through a lot of phases, however assuming this is one will be catastrophic if you're wrong. Take them to a professional who can help them sort out their feelings and decide if they want to go on puberty blockers when they turn ten.

Also, just talk about it with them every step of the way and make sure rhey know they're loved and they're valid no matter what choice they make.
Personally I knew something was ""wrong"" about me, and that I wanted and would be happier as a girl since I was like... 6. So yes it's entirely possible to know at a super young age. I'm 19 now and only accepted the fact I'm trans now, so trust me, starting early can certainly be extremely helpful for someone's happiness and mental health. I'd say that finding a psychologist who specialises in working with children would be a good idea. Either way, even if they grow out of it, being supportive is certainly great and I'm glad you're doing your best to help them discover themselves.
As soon as I knew what gender was, I wanted to be like my sister. I knew that ""boy"" didn't fit. It wasn't until puberty permanently changed my body that I really grasped that my assigned gender was wrong.

I because of how my parents/family reacted to my experimentations with gender, I've only fully accepted myself this very year. I need expensive laser hair treatments, difficult voice feminization therapy, invasive and painful surgeries, and extensive hormone therapy to get me where I want to be.

I don't regret much in life, but I do regret not advocating for myself and getting the treatments earlier. I'm currently grappling with existential dysphoria, and I'm lamenting my lost childhood/teenage years.

I'm not saying dive in headfirst with transitioning, but honor what your kid is telling you. Encourage her, support her, and maybe talk to a doctor or gender specialist about first steps you could take.
I can't really answer your specific questions, but I just wanted to let you know that it is very common for autistic people to be queer in some way. I'm a trans autistic person and I understand the concept of gender, but have decided that it doesn't apply to me. 

Just because your child messes up pronouns verbally doesn't mean they don't understand it internally. Autistic people are often misjudged based on our speech or external behavior and imo your husband shouldn't discount your daughter's understanding purely because of her speech.

I agree with people saying to let her be herself. If she changes her mind later, there is no problem with that, no harm done.
I wonder if your friends would say the same thing about gender to the cis kids. “Ugh my AMAB son Michael thinks he’s a boy. Ridiculous because how can they have any concept of gender?!” Only the trans kids are not capable of conceiving of gender 🤣

This might be a phase or might not, but what are the real consequences of not-ignoring this? In a year they tell you they’re a boy? 😁 seems like there is no consequence at all and that your kid is happy and that I’m jealous she gets you as a parent ♥️
There is a higher percentage of people who are on the Autism Spectrum who are LGBTQ
Just let them be them and be there to support ur son / daughter no matter
what. It does sound like  they maybe either transgender or non-binary.

https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/autism-lgbtq-identity/

Now I am on the autism spectrum  and I am Transgender now I am transitioning later
In life but I wish I had of been able to transition at ur son / daughters age.
There wasn't the support back then I am in my late 40s.

My family doesn't support me being Transgender and don't understand 
Being Transgender.

Just be there and always support your son or daughter
Been saying this their whole life? Your husband is in denial. You need to sort this out with your husband before your kid hits puberty to make sure they can get puberty blockers/anything else they will need.
I can't say I ""knew"" at a young age, just that I kept gravitating to feminine things. I'm also autistic and ADHD, and I grew up in the 80s and 90s in a very conservative community, so I was forced to try and present as neurotypical and masculine. 

As for the people who keep trying to tell you it's a ""phase"", the answer is that allowing your child to present how they want is the fastest way for them to go through it. If it's not a phase, then allowing them to present as their true self will allow them to grow up much happier.
Hello, I am autistic myself.

While it would be possible for a child, especially an autistic child, to misuse pronouns. It does not appear to be the case here, because they are /also/ asking to be allowed to fulfill female roles. Misuse would also be random, not consistent.

It's clear that the child views themself as female.

Transgender identity is very common among autistic individuals, so it is not surprising. Some people attribute it to the different way we view ourselves and society. In any case, these feelings are completely real and valid for the child and should be treated as such.

It sounds like you're doing everything you can to help your child, and that you and your child are both happy. :) Good job!
Likely autistic, and definitely trans person here. I knew from my earliest memories, which was somewhere around 4 years old. I didn’t know I was “transgender”. I knew I wanted desperately to be a girl, and that it wasn’t okay for me to want that because of my parents. Your child is so lucky to be allowed to be themselves.
I wished I was born a girl since I was 4 and it’s never changed or wavered in intensity. People who say kids don’t have a concept of gender are dead wrong.
Everyone else has given valid input so I'll just pop in for a quick comment about:

""Other cis people say i should ignore it and that a 5yo can't possibly understand gender""

But does that matter in this situation though? Using feminine pronouns and doing other traditionally fem things makes your child happy. At the base level, it's really just that simple.

If they do understand gender, good, they already figured out something that can sometimes take an entire lifetime to work through. If they don't understand gender, oh well, worst case scenario this makes them happy for now and they'll be able to figure themselves out in the future, whether they are a girl or not, with no repercussions.

If it doesn't harm anyone, why not make the child happy?
i didn’t think “i’m a girl” at that young of an age, but i did think “im not a boy” so I kinda understand. so my parents thinks me being trans is teen questioning and i couldn’t wish more for someone like you as a parent. It’s difficult and i don’t know how to help you understand this and what to do but just always be utmost accepting of your kid (not saying you aren’t just don’t forget k?) and allow them/her to come to you for anything and be open to change. Again this is just what i would want as a trans child so i hope my rambling is useful in some way sorry i’m out of control and kinda lost and i just needed to fantasize about what kind of parents i wish I had every night when i’m in bed
Hello. To set things first, no one here is a psychologist unless absolutely proven, so we really recommend getting in touch with a pediatrics psychologist with experience and training in early gender dysphoria. The (hopefully good) psychologist will be thorough in helping your child understand their feelings and identity, they will also help confirm your child's identity, not medically, but just making sure that your child IS trans. It's different in children than adults, but valid nonetheless. If and when the time comes, your child will go on puberty blockers to prevent any male puberty from taking place, and when decided by medical professionals, they will go on HRT.

To help your child at home, buy them some girl clothes and other girl stuff you'd think they'd like. Also, talk with your partner, let them know that it is not their decision to choose your childrens gender, and anyone else who pulls that ""they're too young"" crap. Best wishes.
Your child is lucky to know who she is from such a young age. I am 20 and unhappy largely because when I was younger I didn't understand what being trans was and I didn't know who I was.
> I was wondering if anyone here knew they were assigned the wrong gender at a young age  
  
Always. I have *always* known that I am trans. I'm also autistic, by the way. It took me some 26 years to actually transition because whenever I mentioned my female gender, I would receive a ""no you're not"" in response and it made me a miserable child and a miserable adult.  
With that said, don't push anything on your child, but leave the option always open and ensure you inform them of their options as they grow up. The goal is to help them find themselves before they experience puberty, using puberty blockers if they desire to give them more time to decide. Despite sensationalism from the media, puberty blockers are essentially harmless and merely *delay* puberty if the child later decides to commit to their AGAB.  
  
Bless you for coming here for advice, and I wish you and your child all the best! You're doing great so far.
Even if it IS a phase (high it very well could not be) why wouldn’t you invest in it if you can? You won’t ever know if it’s “just a phase” until you’ve missed the beautiful opportunity to be invested in something that will truly shape their life. For some reason it is ok for parents to go with their children on all their other “phases” but not this possible one. Jump in, do the things, buy the clothes, experiment with makeup. Your child will tell you if it’s not them, and you’ll know really quickly if it is.
Thank goodness you live in an lgbt friendly area. I saw the part about a child therapist before reading that part and got scared, thinking a therapist would only try to tell your child to stop. I'm glad to see you so supportive!
I knew before 5. I wish I had a supportive environment. It is really important to listen to them now, it would be better to accept and address this now and throughout childhood than to finally coming up with enough guys to do something about it when 40.
It is messed up to say that someone experience is not valid it doesn't matter the age
I knew it extremely early also and I know a trans man who was exactly like your child. He is still mad that he couldn't start earlier and had to wait till he was 17 to get hormones. I'm extremely mad that I got mine with 21 years, because you know...our life could have been so incredibly much better with far less dysphoria....I actually can't write more right now or else I will spend the rest of the day crying..

I'm so happy to hear that you are supportive, please keep being supportive and for me it sounds like your child is trans. I wish you all the best for the future
Lots of kids know at five. Don't listen to people who don't know what they are talking about.

There is a higher than average rate of autism amongst transgender people. something like 20% in trans people as opposed to 1-3% in general.

Good thing is that you have time to find out, children grow in a very similar way until they hit puberty. You can always get them some girly stuff and some boyish stuff and see whhat they gravitate towards.

School clothes might be a problem if they want to live as their affirmed gender at school so I would suggest gender therapy to get this all figured out sooner rather than later.
I was three and told people I was born a boy but became. A girl, I am afab. Anyways I'm trans queer gender. So... Idk. I think you should allow your child to explore their gender and figure out what they feel is best. They'll know what fits them best.
I second the child therapist route. Maybe it is a phase. Maybe it's not. It certainly doesn't hurt to have someone help your child explore their feelings. I may have turned out completly different had I: A. Been brave enough to even tell my parents about my feelings when I was that age. B. Had someone to help guide me through how I felt about girl vs boy, male or female, or some variety between. Took me 30+ years to break down the conditioning and social pressure that placed me soul searching before cracking my egg.
Even if they does end up ""growing out of it"" that is no reason to not let them identify this way now. People act like gender is such a permanent and important thing. I see no point in it.

Edit: Also I knew there was something different about me before I even knew what gender identity was, but because the fact that ""I was male"" was constantly shoved down my throat, I didn't really realize that I might be trans until very recently in my life.
Yes I knew, was too afraid to tell anyone.
I wish to god I knew I was trans that early in my life. I was to busy dealing with another big life issue during my childhood which was coming to grips with my disability. I’m visually impaired. I don’t think it’s crazy, impossible or wrong to discover that for yourself that early in fact I commend her she sounds like she’s really in tune with her gender identity. If I had known that early things would probably be massively better for me right now and I’d be much better off than I am right now. I’m still young relative to most people but still. You should encourage and empower your child they may be on the spectrum but she really sounds like she knows what she’s talking about. Please feel free to dm me.
I always knew but I never corrected anyone, your daughter has guts, buy her a dress or something
I’ve been saying I wanted to be a boy sine I was 4. I was made to repress that and now I’m 19 and a trans guy. I’m glad you are so supportive of your child. That is going to make a big difference for them growing up.
I definitely knew from the time I was YOUNG. Everyone around me knew and noticed, too. No one supported it, so I hid it for years. But I had been standing to pee from the time I was young, like the boys. I dressed like them, talked like them, did “boyish” activities. It was obvious. You can know young.
There’s a trans woman TikToker Veondre who definitely knew as young as like 6 or 8 and went on blockers when puberty started and is now 17. I think you can definitely know as young as that, and right now you won’t have to think about blockers or other things until she’s a little older. When you do get to that place please listen to her, I know as a trans person younger trans people who went on blockers and got socialized as the gender they identify as are a lot happier. I have a few friends that transitioned early and it makes all the difference.
I think a therapist might be a good idea if you find a good one, but first and foremost I think it's AWESOME that you are so supportive. I'd say let your child be who she is, and if it's a phase, then it's a phase, but the most important thing is to make sure she knows that regardless of what the world says, it's ok to be her (or him, they or whatever she chooses) and that she have your support. All children should have their parents love and support. Noone should have to be afraid to be true to themselves with their parents. You're amazing. All the loves to you and yours <3
At that age, my son, that is on the spectrum too, will say that they was agender, and will inform me in the morning if they was a girl or a boy or neither that day. As a teenager, he said he feels now that he is a guy, but a very androginous one - he enjoys things that society consider feminine, he wear clothing that he consider pretty without any concern about it been masculine or feminine clothing, etc.

Giving him space to experiment in such young age made him comfortable on his own skin, and generally speaking a person that has a sense of self worth and that faced bullying and assholery from peers with a strength that is admirable. 

So, no matter if will be a phase or not. Give them space to experiment, and things will go well.
I knew at age 4, but didn’t start hormones until I was 33. Your child definitely knows the only thing you can do is give them love and support and when they’re old to go onto blockers so they don’t go through puberty then eventually start hormone treatment. I honestly wish I did when I was younger the mental dysphoria gets so much worse as you get older it doesn’t really hit until puberty kicks in it’s just felt wrong.
I knew I was trans when I was 5 or younger. I never verbalised it so clearly because my father and brother are always very critical when I was young which made me play everything close to the chest (whether related to gender or not), not even telling my mom anything I deemed personal despite her being unwaveringly supportive. Then when I got older I realised what telling anyone would mean (child of the 90s when ""that's gay"" was synonymous with ""that's bad""). I definitely knew though. I used to cry at bath time, and ask my mom when my parts would look right. I knew there was something wrong with my body before I ever knew that girls had something else between their legs. I asked when I'd grow boobs and was constantly disappointed to learn I wouldn't. I used to dream every night about waking up in the right body and having everyone just be happy for me. When I got slightly older, maybe 6-7, I used to feel the spot where a vagina should be and look desperately for signs that something was forming there. This despite not knowing what should have been there yet.

I never outwardly expressed it for fear of ridicule, but I definitely knew. If someone had supported me it would have made likely had a happy childhood and well adjusted adulthood vs 30 years of pain, ducking cameras and mirrors, every photo that was taken of me looking like I wanted to commit multiple homicide, not caring about my appearance, throwing myself into dangerous situations hoping someone would end my existence.

You're doing right by your child. By your daughter. Don't let someone who's had no experience with something convince you they're an expert.
I would just do your best to support them. Pronouns, name, clothing, hair, etc is all stuff that if they find out they aren't trans later down the line can be reversed. Even puberty blockers are temporary, but I don't think you have to worry about those right now.
From a transgender woman When i was a child I honestly didn’t play with either especially when you take your vcr apart at 2-4 years old id always prefer to dissect stuff an try an put it bac together lol if i did play with children’s toys it would be both my barbie prefers a 4x4 off-road lol are i would paint my monster trucs blue are pink are a light girlish colors………I always knew i was different from the beginning………it was no phase i tell you……….when i hit 6 I discovered the word transgender from my moms babysitter she was good to share secrets with ………….i regret not transitioning there because thanks to male puberty i look stupid lol an lets be honest male puberty is no where near cute
People are aaaaaaall over this already it seems, so I just want to say you're doing a great job. :) Listening to them and letting them decide for themselves is absolutely the right way to go, ignoring it and forcing them to pretend to be a boy is conversion therapy and causes a lot of damage for a trans person.
I was four when I went around the house pretending my dad’s baggy shirts were dresses, talking/acting as “feminine” as my young brain could process, even saying “I’m a girl” to my parents. This never did go away, though I became more and more scared to express it as time went on. If my parents noticed the way you have, maybe I would be less messed up in the head. This doesn’t mean that the kid is trans, but it’s definitely a possibility
I felt out of place by 10, but there were hints before that.
You should check out r/CisParentTransKid. There’s lots of good advice from lots of parents as well as trans people at various different points along similar roads to yours. I second the advice for a child therapist. Just make sure that your child is comfortable talking to you about things and that they know they can always go to you with anything they every want to discuss even if they don’t feel they have to words yet or don’t think you’ll understand. Show that you’re always willing to try. And make sure that they know that if they don’t like their therapist or don’t feel comfortable for any reason, they don’t need to stay with that therapist for the rest of their life. Sometimes therapists don’t work out because they’re bad, but sometimes personalities just don’t work well together or a therapists techniques that are usually incredibly successful don’t work with how your child learns and thinks. It happens and it’s okay to seek out someone else when that happens.
Strongly trans
Your sense of gender is inherent to your sense of self. The claim that a five year old wouldn’t know or that someone is too young is wrong. I knew really early but wasn’t given the space to experiment, and it hurt me later on. Let her be herself and if she is trans, great, if she isn’t, great. But, most people have an idea of their gender as early as they know who they are in relation to other people. This could be just fun and play, but these experiences are very similar to me and I had the feeling of wanting to be a girl really early on. It is great that she has the confidence and the words to express who she is, wether that be trans or not.
At first I thought 5 is a very early age to know your gender, but then I remembered my past self,and wow. Even from a young age I acted like and liked  girl stuff, the only reason why I realised I am trans much later in life, was because I had no concept of trans people untill a few years back. It is definetely possible that your kid is trans, and you should find a kid therapist that works with lgbtq youth to see what you can do from here
Btw many kids would wish they had a mother like you, keep it up!
I knew at a young age but my family convinced me it was the devil through some very aggressive means... I had always loved singing, and princesses, and wanted to try on my mom's dresses and shoes, but they made me repress all of that. I wasn't able to start feeling normal until my 20s, and it meant having a depressing high school life where I felt disgusted by how I was treated. In PE I would always wait to change, seeing guys changing felt so dirty, and even more importantly, seeing me change was out of the question, they were these big hairy things pushing eachother into lockers, and breaking things, and I was just so overwhelmed by all of that. Regardless of the trauma, it meant I missed a lot. I never went to a dance or event, or met with people outside a small friend group. You seem far more supportive and willing to accept their choices, but the point being, let them make them, let them explore, help them to discover who they want to be, then you can both say that neither of you missed out on the beautiful experience you both have to share. They are going to need you, and the love of a child who feels seen and heard can be a magnificent thing.
Even if it were to just be a phase, where’s the harm in referring to them as a girl for now? If they, a few years down the line, come to the conclusion that they aren’t a girl afterall there won’t be much harm done. Imo, and I’m not a parent so I might be totally wrong on this, it would make no sense not to support your child in how they identify. It seems like there would be way more damage done if you don’t support them, no matter how you look at it.
I've been going through something similar with my 6 year old. I've put in the time and effort to research extensively and have found that most paediatricians recommend allowing your child to express themselves. They are still learning the concept of gender and they might grow out of it, they might not. But allowed them to explore who they are now is much better for their health both now and in the future. If you want someone to talk to about this, feel free to message me. I can also drop some links to sources if you're interested in the articles but I'm on mobile rn so I'll have to do it when I'm on my pc.
Children tend to understand the concept of gender at a young age. They’re exposed to it very young (blue is for boys, pink is for girls. Trucks are for boys, dolls are for girls) so they do understand gender, and if she’s saying that she’s a girl, I would believe her. Even if she changes her mind some day, then that’s okay. I don’t think there’s any harm in letting children socially transition, if you think that it will improve their life. Also, this can prevent them from going through years on internalized transphobia, and taking years to feel comfortable in their skin. Plus, they can go on puberty blockers in their teens, and start estrogen/testosterone, and have a fairly normal puberty, instead of having to go through extra steps. (This is all optional though, and depends on your state) I would mainly just focus on letting her socially transition, and see if she continues to feel this way throughout her entire childhood.
i knew since i was 5 because that’s when i started having gender being enforced on me at school which gave me a clear understanding of gender and where i fit in pretty young and i transitioned socially at age 7 and have been very happy living as a trans masculine person at the age of 18 now :) transitioning young helped me find myself as a person instead of having to constantly stress over being called and treated like someone i’m not. i cut my hair and moved schools and dressed like a boy and was mostly accepted as one and defended by my peers. i strongly urge you to watch videos on trans people and consider starting them on hormone blockers before puberty, id say 11 and then on female hormones by 14 would give them a smooth transition without having to experience the pain of physical and often irreversible in trans girls dysphoria caused by male puberty and postponing it until they’re sure won’t hurt them if monitored by a doctor :) i would’ve been so much happier if i had been on hormone blockers and wouldn’t need top surgery now, and their face will go masculinization they’d be very unhappy with if you don’t step in and really talk it through with them in maybe a couple years when they’ve explored a bit more?
I mean I subconsciously knew since I was 7 but was forced to repress it until I finally decided to confront these feelings a year or two ago
You're in the right here, and thank you for listening to your child.

The idea that kids can be ""too young"" to understand their own gender is just a collective guess from cis people who frankly have probably never intentionally interacted with a trans person ever.

The science does not back that idea at all, and shows we can be certain of our present and future trans identity at least at six, often at four, some even earlier. Even before speech, kids are sometimes observed distressed about their body's sexual characteristics, who then later transition.

As long as you keep listening, you will do okay. It's better for their health and wellbeing to have supporting parents than anxious gatekeepers.
People who claim that kids don't know what they want are people who don't respect kids. Kids aren't dumb, they know what they want and they know what they like. If she's saying she's a girl then that's what she is. And you know what? If she changes her mind, that's ok too. If that happens could be she's actually non binary. Respect what she feels and don't tell her how she feels is wrong.
I’m so glad you’re so supportive! You’re awesome.
I am a trans woman. 

I knew at 3 but was not met with support. I spent my entire childhood looking at the girls at school wishing I could be like them. 

Told my parents at 14 that I was a girl and wanted to transition and they put me in therapy with a conversion therapist who claimed to be trans friendly. I backed out of the decision after that and it took me another 10 painful years to finally accept myself. I absolutely agree with the advice to find a therapist, just make sure to vet them. 

I can assure you your child knows their feelings on this and they are genuine. Not saying they can't change with time and develop but they are likely not going away and not a phase. 

You are an amazing parent and I am so proud of you for supporting your child. The world needs parents like you 💜
Honestly you seem like a very caring and supportive mother I wish my mother was like that. I'd recommend sending them to a child therapist or a gender therapist who specializes in trans children.
this post may have been settled but I want to say my piece. Please note I'm a bit forgetful and I may get information wrong and mean no harm, please correct me if I seem wrong or kind of rude.

I personally think the child is correct in her beliefs. Around her age I also believed I was meant to be a girl, as I would flick my hair a lot like you'd see in media, and sometimes lick my lips a lot to pretend it was lipstick. My hair was always shoulder length, and quite thick, so I just naturally felt feminine, despite that everyone still seen me as a boy. The thing is, I never expressed to anyone how I felt feminine, at least nothing obvious, and nor did I verbally express it. I too always have played as a woman when I could make a character in games, as part of my identity, but I am always acceptive playing as a man in a game if there isn't a choice, gender has never ""concrete strong"" on my beliefs. 

At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) like your daughter seems to have been, except for the age I was diagnosed at, but I believe I am high functioning, I don't know if your daughter is too, but if she is she may truly grasp an understanding just as good as anyone else in LGBTQ when she is older. If your SO believes autism hinders her understanding, he should try to find more information and contact professionals, if he didn't already, about this situation, you should get involved too.

My feelings towards being a girl got weaker as I grew older, but they never fully gone away. I genuinely have always felt like I'd become a woman within a heartbeat if I ever got the chance. The reason my feelings got weaker is simply because I tried to become more acceptive of being an AMAB over time. I'm glad I gave into more of a feminine identity though. 

Although I wholeheartedly think you should encourage your child, just make sure she's healthy and safe in her transition!
I remember on the first day of pre-school having to wear a frilly shirt (I'm AFAB) and crying and saying that I hated how I looked. My mother had always let me wear boy clothes before I had to go to school and it was awful when I was forced to wear feminine things. If your child is showing even more blatant signs, I wouldn't be surprised if they really were trans.
Right now, it doesn't matter if it's a phase or not.

Right now, your child says they're a girl, they want to be a girl, so they are a girl.

Things might or might not change as they grow up, maybe it stays the same and they live their life as a girl, maybe they find a more specific label under the NB umbrella, as I said, it doesn't matter

You do what makes your child happy right now, five years old isn't too young for cis kids to know they're cis, so it shouldn't be too early for trans kids to know their gender either. Your kid has all the time in the world to figure themselves out and explore, but right now, I'd say they're pretty sure they're your daughter :D
Id say to let ur kiddo express themself however they like, just remind them that they’re not tied down to a single gender and can always end up being something else (not always the case but it’s good for them to know)
Keep I mind even if it is just a phase your child still deserves to be respected! If they change their mind later on, so be it! Just let them know you'll always support them!! <3
Five is not too young to be that aware in my opinion. My egg cracked only recently, at around 28, but thinking back I realise that even as a child I wished that I was a boy with a tremendous intensity. I rejected femininity for a long time, then I went through a phase of hyperfemininity around 26 and now I'm back to my old goblinous ways. 

Five is not too young to identify oneself. If anything, I'd say that your girl is very mature about herself.
i just want to remind you that if they decide they're not trans at this age, then there are absolutely no consequences. you can take them for a haircut the same day, you can get them new clothes, you can switch to using he/him and a masculine name and it will all be over. 

exploring their gender by letting them be whatever they want to be will only teach them that their parents listen to them and support them. you're making the right choice by giving them the support to be themself, whoever they may turn out to be.
When I told my mother I was trans, she recounted a story from when I was three years old and called it her ""first clue"". For additional context, I am AMAB and have ADHD, a similar variance in executive function to some types of autism.

While not everyone does, some us for sure know we are our gender at litterally as young of an age as we are capable of expressing ourselves. Others not so much, others didn't realize they were trans until they were much older, and capable of fully unpacking the idea consciously, 

&#x200B;

For sure just support who they are. Some kids do have sudden shifts in their gender identification between like, 5 and 10. If they say they are a girl, call them a girl. But don't PUSH them to be a girl. They are still figuring out their gender at such a young age, and their relationship to it might suddenly change as they approach puberty. 

Also yeah, a therapist is a good idea. Being (possibly?) trans is confusing, it needs talking out.
If 5 year olds don't understand gender, then why do they know words like boy, girl, man, woman, mommy, daddy?
I absolutely knew by four, and only wish I had supportive parents like you. It was 20 years later that I was able to start transitioning.
I would recommend you to support them and just see how it goes.
Your child is more than meets the eye.
apparently gender dysphoria and stuff like that is common with people on the spectrum
I definitely knew how I felt around 3 or 4 (preschool age).  I also understood that it wasn’t acceptable where I grew up.  It seems great to me that you’re a parent who is willing to listen and better yet that your kid trusts you enough to share all of themselves.  I never had that growing up and it definitely hurt me a lot, especially by my teen years.

(32yo trans woman)
when i was 5 i remember i wanted to wear skirts and such. even dreamed and daydreamed about it. your kid probably known who they are by now. good news is that you dont need to medically intervene until like idk 12 or so years old minimum? so for now all you gotta do is but her correct clothes and use right name/pronouns etc
I knew since I was 2 trust me listening to your kid now can save them a lot of anguish down the road
Therapist is the right way to go

But I also want to add that to your friends who are saying this is ridiculous and they can't know their gender identity at 5

Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of not assigning one to children. Gender is in everything
You can't raise them without impacting their gender identity. As far as I am concerned it is far better as a parent to validate them in something they might change their mind about later than it is to dismiss this now. 

If you teach them that you will value their perception of their gender identity now they are gonna have no issue telling you of that changes. If you unwittingly teach them that you don't by dismissing it and telling them to wait until they are older then they might feel like they can't tall to you about it even when they are older. 

So you're doing the right thing
I knew when I was very young. I am not sure quite how long I knew but I am certain that I knew by the age of 6, because at 6 I met another trans kid who also knew they were trans, and managed to fall in love even at such a young age. We are also both autistic. I am sure I must have known when I was a bit younger than that as well. We ended up getting married last year.

As for what you should do with your kid. 

I think every kid should be taught about trans people, because trans people are people who exist and deserve understanding. If that happened, then trans kids would as a side effect of this, learn what the name and context is for what they’re feeling, and thus have the ability to ask for help. They would also learn that their parents are positive and supportive of trans people, and thus that it’s safe to ask.

A lot of children end up feeling like it’s not safe to talk to their parents about being trans, even if their parents have not expressed any hostility towards trans people. I don’t know for sure as it would be hard to study but I think it might have to do with the fact that they view the parents as the primary source of the incorrect and hurtful gender role being forced on them, and therefore see the parents as unsafe to ask for help from. I’m not saying this is necessarily the case, but it’s something to be aware of because it’s pretty common. So talking positively about trans people can really help with that.

If you create the right environment your child can develop their sense of gender without pressure in any direction, and feel safe to come to you and ask for help if needed.
Ok well at that age, absolutely no medical stuff will happen. So just do the things that make them happy now and if that changes, it changes. But it will make it easier for them to discover themselves if people do what makes them comfortable now.
I came out at the age of four for the first time and my parents just rolled with it. They asked everyone in family and kindergarden to use my preferred pronouns and it went good. I even got into school as a boy (I'm a transman) officially. But due to bullying in school I got in the closet again and my parents thought the whole thing was just a phase and that it would be alright. Due to trauma i even convinced myself over time that it was just a phase. I'm currently working on pulling myself out of the closet and my misery again. 
I would recommend a therapist, so your child can talk about their experiences and get the help they need and in the case that they get bullied or something, they have someone to help them through that so they won't  feel the need to give up their reality.
The fact that your 5 year old has a concept of gender should clearly show to your sceptic cis persons that gender has nothing to do with a concept that first has to be learned.
Everybody has a gender, regardless if they are educated about that or not.

I'm happy that you are so supportive to your girl. Great Mum! ❤️
I knew i was male from my earliest memories (around age 5)
I new pretty young that I wanted to try girl things and always wondered/thought it would be cool/better to be a girl. That was all suppressed by religious beliefs from fam and school. I'm 22 now and just starting to transition and looking back can't help but feel without those influences my life woukd be alot better now and I could've been better educated and transitioned YEARS ago. 

It is honestly just so great that you are supportive of your child and open to things and willing to help. As for stuff to do like many said a gender therapist woukd be great. Also just directly asking your kid about how they feel, ask if they know difference between boys and girls and what they liked to be called etc
I'm pretty sure the only reason i didn't know at age 6 was because of my transphobic dad constantly forcing toxic masculinity onto me. I loved wearing pink skirts, and I always wanted to have long hair.

I figured it out at 13 instead, when I made a tumblr account and found out that trans ppl existed and was like ""so you mean I *can* be a girl?""
Yes you are doing everything right by respecting their pronouns and wanting to use the bathroom. Obviously children that age won’t know what being trans is so a lot of the time it’s confusing and we aren’t sure why we feel the way we do but I can say that from around 5 I would be happy anytime I was included in with the boys/told I looked like my dad and that I used to try to pee standing up (I’m a trans man ftm for context) so yes it’s completely normal and valid for your child to know how she’s feeling and if anything she’s being really brave for correcting people when she feels uncomfortable because that takes a lot of courage even when you’re well into your 20’s.
Some children know they're not their agab as soon as they can make the slightest difference between boys and girls, and I think your child's lucky to have you as their mother. You might want to reach for a LGBTQ-friendly therapist. 
In the meantime, keep affirming your child's identity, if they say they're a girl, they might probably be one. Especially if they refer to themselves as a girl for as long as they can talk.
I'm not a parent myself, but I see absolutely nothing wrong about social transitioning at the young age. Even if she ""grows out of it"", literally nothing has been done and she can just continue living as male.

The ""talk"" about it ig I would do somewhere around the start of puberty, since if she's trans, she's gonna want puberty blockers and later HRT because holy hell puberty is already super hard, but us trans kids had to go through a wrong one. I'm glad your child knows about trans people and feels free enough to express herself, I didn't even know about the concept, and simple knowledge would've saved me hours of agony spent on the floor wondering what's wrong with me until I found out about I could be trans.

Just love your child, let them express herself however she wants, it's absolutely harmless at this young age
Yes, I knew. I wasn’t adamant about sharing it, though I wish I had been. Society wasn’t as accepting in the 80’s. Instead I buried it where it festered and almost killed me.

Mad love to you fir being such a powerful advocate for your child!
I knew I was a girl from as far as I can remember, just never thought it was possible, realistic, or even had terminology for it until a few years back now.
I knew something wasn't right at a young age but didn't know how to explain it. Now I'm almost 22 trying to figure things out lmao. Its a struggle but I'm sure your kid will do great with your help
I’m FTM for context. I didn’t know until I was 15. But I often played as a boy in video games when I was very young. I would say once I came out the best support for me was my father just accepting it and asking if there was nothing I needed. I went to a children’s hospital where they have a gender identity program. And they are lovely and helped with everything so much. I suggest them because they can lead you to good a gender therapist as well as if you ever want to take the next steps.
Gender is more fluid than people often acknowledge, and while it is entirely possible that your child will “grow out of it” you should support them as they are, and if they “grow out of it” it has to be on their terms. Gender is already established by that age and from what you are describing I’m pretty sure they would get the clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
A child therapist is a great idea. Thanks!
I second this. 5 is such a young age and a crazy time for development. 5 year olds are only starting to have a basic understanding of complex emotions and feelings. They go through phases constantly. (I have a 7y/o so I speak from experience). That's not to say your kid isn't valid in how they identify but having a professional who can help them through these feelings is really your best bet. And for the love of god, talk to your kid every step of the way, be supportive and make sure they know that no matter who they are, they are loved (which it sounds like you're already doing so good job there!)
Do you have a source for the claim that 1 in 6 autistic folks are trans? I know a lot of us are trans, but I've never seen anyone claim the rate was that high
This is the best advice. I was thinking the same.
Any research into this and you pretty much just find that cis people don't question or desire to be the other gender, which falls into the DSM-5 designation for gender dysphoria as well. Here is more about that https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria
Make absolutely certain that they're a trans friendly therapist. This is more important than I think some would realize.
Just be careful to check for a therapist that works with lgbtq people, that is open minded.
> doesn't stay like this, congratulations, you have a cis son. Kids should have a safe place to experiment with

I see it all over the place, but I haven't seen any sources. 

Actually... there was a big meta study result people were linking to, on [https://www.spectrumnews.org/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/) I think but I can't find it in 5 secs of searching.
I too would be interested. That seems very high.
A seminar at the Radboud hospital/university about Autism Spectrum Disorder that I went to 2 years ago.
I believe it’s because autistic people are generally more internal so are thinking about stuff a lot more, like being trans.
Yes, absolutely...
It says 6 times higher. Not one in six, but that's still /huge/.

[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/)

I will caution anyone reading, that the empathy score measures ""neurotypical expression of empathy"". Empathy is autistic people may be similar or higher than neurotypicals depending on the individual.

I guess I'm not trans and just hate myself according to my mom.	Apparently I'm still not old enough to decide I'm if I'm trans or not, also I ran out of liquid eyeliner. It's been a shitty morning overall. The ironic thing about her statement is I actually quite like myself now that I'm not second guessing my identity anymore.	"It’s amazing that people are just “too young to know” unless they’re cis/straight. The double standard is deafening
She's equating your gender with trendiness, like you're trying on a new set of clothes- which.. from what she's being told by outside media is totally a thing that's happening to ""kids these days.""

I had a moment with my (trans) son when he first came to me where I was like ""Are you sure? You haven't even kissed anyone yet."" ... which is super ignorant because a) gender and sexuality are NOT the same and b) I didn't need to ever kiss anyone to know whether or not the body I was in was the right one OR who I \~wanted\~ to kiss. Not my proudest moment, and I figured my shit out, but it's definitely a thing that goes through parents minds. I just blurted it out because I'm dumb sometimes.. once I had a little time to think about it, I apologized and we got through it. I hope your mom does the same.

&#x200B;

ETA- Cleaned up the statement because I had a squirrel moment.
According to my mom, I'm not trans, I'm just going through a mid-life crisis. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
im having that same issue with my mom. she thinks im like running away from everything that made me happy but im the happiest ive ever been now 💀
You were trans the minute you entered the world and you are BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
I just want to ask, how old are you? Because if she said that, you're probably under 18
From a (trans) parent, you are more than old enough and I’m sorry your mom is behaving so badly about this. 

As a side note, I love my [gel liners ](https://www.morphe.com/collections/gel-liner) from Morphe.
Eeeey my parents say the same thing and I'm 24. They will never think you are old enough. Never let other people dictate who you are
Why can't it be both?
if you’re old enough to be cis, you’re old enough to be trans. your mom is awful
My favorite cheap eyeliner is Maybelline's Hyper Easy Liquid Liner and they sell it at most drug stores.

Beyond that, I'm sorry about your mom. That sucks.
""Just because you were born trans doesn't mean you can't be too young to be trans"" - some crazy gatekeeping mom somewhere
My mom would say: ""yeah, keep telling yourself that.""

So apparently I was just lying to myself to get attention.

Glad she's dead.
According to my mom, I'm not trans. I'm just a feminist who thinks that the grass is greener on the other side :)
Fuck what she says. She's not the one who gets to decide that.
“Okay mother- Then when does your supposes phycology degree going to tell me sense you seem to have ALL the worlds answers right up your self-projection?? Do please educate me, make sure to provide facts & links in your argument, Thank you.”


Just a personal reaction of how id reply to her. You are valid sweetie, don’t let her take that from you. Shes more confused then you are right now lets be honest.
[deleted]
Dam, I mean kids find out pretty soon, your mom is just dumb
She could be right... but, if you've already considered it, and crossed it off the list, she might just be up her own ass about how sure she is that she knows you better than you know yourself. My parents though they knew a lot of stuff about me, but what they actually knew was a mask I'd wear to protect myself.

Ask her what age she was when she knew she was a heterosexual lmao.
Update: I also need a therapist to validate my transness as opposed to me, who's living in this body doing it myself. It's remarkable how little either of my parents understand, just because they went to school with trans and intersex people means they don't have to learn perspective apparently.
You don't decide if your trans do you?
I didn't have a choice.
Sorry that you hate yourself. 😞
*hugs*
I hate when my parents say that ""I (15) don't have enough life experience)
Its funny how everyone will be like you can’t possibly decide your [insert any lgbtq topic] at such a young age, as they proceed to pressure young kids to choose their future career path as they are shoved into universities.
Aka my life:

15: oh you’re too young to decide! You have to wait! 

18: oh you’re too young to decide! You have to wait! 

21: oh you’re too young to decide! You have to wait!

26: oh you’re too old to transition, too late you should have done it when you’re younger! 🤗

Lesson: Don’t think you’re too young to transition, and don’t think you’re too old to transition. And most of the people that tell you to wait just don’t want to tell you not to do it, and those people that tell you to wait can go fuck themselves
Well spoken
THIS 🤩😍🥰
She tried saying ""Maybe you just prefer men."" Equating gender with sexuality, but judging by how I was gaslighted by both my parents the first time I came out as trans, it's gonna happen again, but this time I'm not budging.
That fucking sucks too, fuckin' yikes.
Im 36.  Fuck telling my parents.  I'm just going to show up one day femmed up and be like ""what?""
Being 34/35 I've actually asked myself ""what if I'm just having a midlife crisis""
She didn't believe me when I said I'm happier now and hate myself less than before. I've tried coming out to both my parents and was met with a denial response and a ""you're too young to know"" response each time.
I'm nearly twenty.
😔
That actually made me laugh, I don't buy eyeliner, I ""borrow"" it.
Pffft, is she using feminist as an insult or...?
I hope yours gets better too, it's a bit late in the day for me, but seriously nobody deserves a shitty day for being themselves.
When it comes to LGBT stuff abso-fucking-loutly.
I'm literally almost 20, I've been repressed this for most of my life and was gaslighted by my own parents for presenting myself in a feminine way and was told ""What you say you are, you're not, it's a phase."" by my own father, definitely not right.
Oh no, I didn't decide, I was using her wording.
I don't though?
I do appreciate hugs. Thank you.
Most people know something's up by the time they hit 11 or so, for me it was about 8, then repression happened.
""You're too young to know if you're trans! Anyway you need to decide what you want to do with your life for the next 60 years.""

I'm disappointed in your parents. It mystifies me that some parents can't get out of their own way and love their kids in the way that most of them swore they would. I mean this in the best not patronizing way, but I'm proud that you're standing up for yourself, just stay safe.
No matter the age, people always find an excuse as to why you’re not who you say you are.

"I'm a trans boy, but I like wearing ""girly"" clothes (he/him)"	"Saying that I'm a boy feels natural. I see myself as a boy. I feel sick when people address me as a girl, because that's not me. But as a kid, I did enjoy ""girly"" clothes or accessories. My sister keeps questioning why I liked wearing them if I'm a boy. I never thought about why. I just liked it. I didn't only wear clothes from the girls aisle though. I think even cisgender boys should be able to wear feminine clothing. But why does my sister keep acting like it was unnatural? Is it unnatural? Should I act like a stereotypical boy in order to say I'm trans? That doesn't feel natural either. I just am who I am. Did any of you also like things that are typically for your assigned sex?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments! I feel much more comfortable in my identity now. I will definitely show some of them to my sister the next time she says something about it. I love you all, and remember that you're appreciated. <33 Have a great day."	"That’s totally okay! Gender isn’t a hard line! You can be a boy who like girly things or clothes! That doesn’t make you any less of a man!
you don’t owe anybody to dress a certain way except yourself. who cares if you like traditionally feminine clothing? sometimes that stuff looks really nice and can make you feel comfortable about yourself because YOU look good in it. i’m also afab trans man and i still like wearing some traditionally female clothing because it makes me feel good to look good. at the end of the day, your own happiness and comfort is more important than you pleasing others. :) be you and be true
Clothes don’t have genders and you can wear what you want
r/ftmfemininity
I FEEL THE SAME like i hate being feminine as a girl BUT BEING FEMININE AS A BOY?? BEST FEELING EVER
hey man - when i first got my binder I started just putting on random shirts & hoodies to see how they looked, i at one point put on a dress & MAN did it feel good to be flat & look fairly masc in a dress. you might enjoy the sub r/FTMfemininity .

also dont beat yourself up over not showing many signs as a kid, not everyone does, i didnt really, anything I did was so minimal im not even sure it was a sign of transness.
I was in a relationship with a trans man years ago who was also a drag queen.

You being you is important, nothing else matters.
Bro it is totally fine, no different than girls who like wearing ""boy"" clothes. People dont think twice when a Cis women wears jeans and a boysih tea shirt, so dont let them tell you twice when you wanna wear ""girly"" items, do what makes you happy king!
Cis guys can be femboys, so trans guys can too.
It may be difficult to explain to people but who cares? It's your life and there's nothing wrong with a trans man wearing feminine clothes.

Edit: I'm transfeminine and I enjoy several masculine things. One thing I'm sure you already know is that gender is very largely a social construct and thus it may feel more natural and appealing to not always conform to said construct.
The problem is that a cis person who enjoys wearing clothes of any gender, or doing activities typically done by any gender, is just going to be seen as a cis person wearing clothes and doing activities. A trans person who does that, apparently, is opening themselves up to having their identity questioned. I fucking hate it, and it's revolting. But I keep seeing it happen. And like, being honest, I do want to wear nail polish. Lots of cis guys are wearing nail polish lately. But if I did it? Honestly I'm kind of worried someone would be like, oh, you changed your mind? Like, no, I didn't. I'm just who I am, I'm me, and who I am is a guy who likes to do stuff, and that sometimes includes wearing nail polish. Like why the fuck not? I don't owe conformity, predictability, masculinity or femininity to anyone. Fuck them. Wish I could brush it off that easy though lmao. I hope you're able to move on without having so much of my own hang ups, my dude. You're a guy, that's all there is to it. :) And the kind of guy you are is entirely up to you. :)
That is totally fine and you are very valid.
Fuck gender roles. Be who you want to be. It’s a free world, explore it.
I thought it wasn’t normal for me too cause I’m also a trans boy but I really love wear dresses! Gender doesn’t equate to clothing! It’s perfectly fine to wear whats considered girly as a man
Down with gender norms!!
I understand the feeling you have and it isn't unnatural to want to wear feminie clothes,  but clothes dont have a gender, but in the end be you and if you wear feminie clothes but want to be known as a guy is perfectly fine.

Also you dont need anyone's permission to wear the clothes you want :)
 (Sorry if this seems conviluding)
bro for the longest time when i was “a girl” i only wore shorts and graphic tees and jeans and sneakers. now that i’m identifying as a boy i want to wear a skirt so bad! honestly. if it makes you happy it doesn’t need to make sense to anyone else
i think there are cis people who easily understand transition in the context of stereotypical gender roles but have a harder time with people who transition and dont stick to a gender binary.
I’m a trans woman who likes boy things, life is weird that way
Transitioning was the thing that made me embrace my ""feminine"" side, although I don't like to call it that, lol. It was only after I started presenting masc that I got earrings for example. If anything, my feminine habits/accessories/... are an expression of my masculinity, at least to me. The conviction that whatever I do, I'll still be my gender, is extremely freeing
That's awesome and valid as fuck!

You can be a hugely manly man and wear a sundress if ya want!
It’s not unnatural at all! You don’t have to be a stereotypical boy to say that you’re trans, sure some people fall into those stereotypes (I myself fall into several transfem ones) but there are also people that don’t, and that’s okay. There are even plenty of cis boys that enjoy wearing fem clothes. r/feminineboys is a very accepting place with likeminded individuals if you’re interested in exploring more.
i am also a very feminine trans guy!! and no matter what anyone tells you, youre totally valid. enjoy yourself! who will if not you?
I'm a trans girl who plays Magic the Gathering. Trust me gender stereotypes don't matter.
I've struggled with the inverse of this, am I a trans woman? Or do I just think gender norms are stupid.

You do you boo, if it makes you happy go after it.
Nothing wrong with wearing what you wana wear. Gender is a spectrum and fuck traditional gendered clothes
Clothing doesn't have gender! You can be a man and still wear stereotypically women's clothing, and vice versa. The concept of gendered clothing has changed back and fourth a fair few times over the years.
Clothes don't have gender, dress however you like! I change between femme presenting and masc presenting depending on my mood on any given day and I'm AFAB transmasc non-binary (they/he)
When I was first coming out to myself, I took a lot of inspiration from feminine guys. I felt exactly the same as you.
You can be femboy, does your sister know 'bout that? Y'know, 'bout femboys?
/r/FTMFemininity is calling your name.
Same here. I love skirts(especially the spiny ones) and I love doing my make up and shopping and most other “girly things” it’s not unnatural at all! Sadly tho a lot of people(including other trans ppl sometimes) feel the same as your sister. Just do your best to ignore them and wear whatever you want <3333
Rain: You're sister is being close minded tbh, ohh and if you want to talk to some kindred spirits in that regard check out r/FTMfeminity.
there's no such things as girlsh and boyish, wear whatever makes you feel happy!!:) hope you have  a great dayyy
I as a demiboy (he/they)can definitely relate! I can’t wear dresses because it makes me want to scream but I like wearing thigh highs, makeup, and skirts. If I’m being honest when I lose words I’ll talk through songs. You should definitely listen to “gender is boring” by she/her/hers. I know it’s on the other side of things mtf instead of ftm but I feel like you’ll relate. At least I could. :) gender is a construct anyway! Dress how you want man! Be you! <3
r/FTMfemininity come join us! We're all like you and want to dress feminine sometimes but want to be perceived as either male or non-binary.
I’m a boy who loves “girly” things too!! You are who you are and that’s totally okay. You can like/dislike whatever you want, no one can decide who you are but you!! 💗
Gender isn't a binary thing,

It's ok to sit in the middle,

Or even just enjoy certain clothes, Styles, activities, Even if people will try to gender them

I'm a cis dude (Here so I can understand my surprising number of trans friends better)
And I got me a women's jumper just yesterday lmao. (and I love wearing it)
Same here! Nothing wrong with you. Gender expression isn't the same as gender identity. Gender expression is whatever you want it to be and it doesn't invalidate your Gender identity
Femboy moment
I used to when I was little because shiny sparkle=me likey haha
I like pew pews an fishin.. doesn't mean my tiddie growin any less
From age 3 I knew I was a boy. And yet I didn’t need to stop wearing girls clothes or liking pink or playing with Barbies. I knew even then that none of those things suddenly changed my gender. Unfortunately, because I kept all of this to myself and just lived my toddler life liking girly things, my mom refuses to accept my transition and assumes something traumatized me when I was younger and set me on this path.
I wear men’s clothes as a trans girl sometimes, but I don’t like half of them

Clothes aren’t really part of the internal sense of gender that gender identity is, that’s the big socially constructed part of gender
Honestly, I was the same as you. It took me a few years to finally take my friends' advice to 'screw the transphobes and wear feminine things if you want'. 

I would take my time with feeling comfortable around people like you have described. 

I hope this helps! 
:]
Next time your sister asks you this, why don't you ask her why she wears trousers?
My boyfriend is very much the same. He enjoys both masc and fem clothing. Sometimes he’ll show up in a dress and the other times in pants and suit. As someone who is also trans, I enjoy masc clothes too like suits and stuff those stuff are just hot and charismatic and even though my internalized conservative doesn’t like wearing it bc its a traditionally male clothing, I still love how it looks. So, as others mentioned, dont worry about it! You can wear whatever you want and it doesn’t make you any less valid!
Clothes have no gender. Anyone can where whatever they want.
i relate to this. i favor masculine terms and pronouns used on me but i also like st femme clothes coz a) pretty and b) stylish and a wider variety of aesthetics. you are 100% allowed to like wearing anything you want and it shouldn't affect who you truly are, if you wanna wear something femme, go for it!
I'm a trans girl and one working on cars, yet I'm still all girl
I think clothing both can and shouldn’t be associated with gender. Yes, it’s okay to associate it with gender if you’re like wearing gender-affirming attire, but a lot of other times it’s a little oppressive to gender clothing. I’m not accusing you of this though! You are a boy, no matter what it is you decide to wear. Hell, I’m a cisgender guy and I really love wearing skirts! Do what makes you happy ❤️
Just like many of us transfems are tomboys, a part of you can be a femboy.
sammmmeee. I feel like a boy, Iv always seen myself as a boy, but I like masc and fem things, and my mom things its a faze cause of that. Im upsett because Girly things was the only thing I was ever tought to love when I was little. I just existed.
Clothes dont equal your gender! one of my classmates is a cis guy and he wears skirts a lot to school yet he says he still feels like a boy. Im like that too, im non binary and i like feminine clothes more than gender neutral or masculine clothes.
Same, I still imagine myself dancing in pretty dresses and don’t have a problem with feminine clothes, but I know I am a man.
Yeahhh society can be annoying. It's *generally* fine these days for girls to do masculine things, but boys doing feminine stuff is still regularly ridiculed.

Being trans only makes things worse
Clothes don’t really have a gender, people just decided they did at some point. It used to be the norm to dress boys up in, well, dresses, up until they were nearly teens iirc just a few generations back. Not sure why the trend died out. We can see a similar trend with names. Like my uncle, a cis man, was named Candy, as that was a man’s (or at least more gender neutral) name when his parents picked it.
Don’t feel pressured to fit into a binary you don’t vibe with, just wear what you like and are comfortable with!
There is no clothing requirement to be trans!

The clothes you’re wearing are *your* clothes, so they’re boy’s clothes.

My son is a trans boy and likes wearing dresses from time to time.

I’m a trans woman and I don’t wear makeup, nor do I dress very fem
I was just think about this I'm ftm who loves to wear dresses the thing is I want to be seen as a boy in a dress rather than a girl in a dress. I'm glad I'm not the only one. :)
It's absolutely okay and valid to be transmasc and want to connect with your femininity in a way that makes sense to you & your identity. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
I get it I am mtf and im still a tomboy. I like cool pants and more masc vibes alot
I'm a trans girl and I like wearing ""boyish"" clothes. Lots of cis men wear dresses or makeup or jewelry, lots of cis girls wear baggy jeans, short hair, and t-shirts. All valid. You're fine.
Fuck gender roles my guy
Gender is stupid, do whatever you want.
I think your head is on straight and your sister is just looking for some reason you're not trans. Plenty of boys enjoy pretending to be girls when they're kids--before society teaches them that they have to fulfill rigid gender standards or lose status. How are you any different?
Cis boys can like fem things.

Trans boys can like fem things.

My trans guy self likes fem things.

Boys can like fem things.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk
You are a boy, what you wear is your decision. You don’t have to stick to any stereotypes, just be yourself :)
Wearing clothes that you like, no matter what gender you are, is all that matters
Hey that's totally fine, even better its cool! I'm the same way but I'm preT so I have the natural fear that I'll be misgendered. That's subreddit is very helpful! Lots of love to you!!! 💙

BTW I plan to get Testosterone
If you like this kind of clothing, then you just like it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with expressing yourself how you see fit.
You've got more courage than most guys. It's not uncommon that a thread will pop up in something like AskReddit about guys wearing skirts and pretty much everyone wishes they would, but the reality is that, while guys wish they could, no one wants to be the first to do it.

Plus, it's not like feminine men don't exist. If there can be tomboys, then it only makes sense that the opposite would be true as well. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
You're a boy. They're your clothes. They're boy clothes by default
You're not alone there.  I had a huge arguement with myself about my dress shoes, some part of me convinced that if I was to be a man, they had to go.  But I love them!  Eventually I realised that I was being a bit silly, especially since I already knew that boys wear flats and heels sometimes and other ""women's"" clothes, too, and that it's perfectly okay.  The moment I gave myself permission to keep my ""girly"" shoes, was the moment that I accepted my identity as a trans man.  Give yourself permission to wear what makes you happy.
Im in the same situation and sometimes it gets annoying cause someone will make a comment like ""pick a department to shop"" or something about confusing them, the best I can explain it is I really enjoy feeling masculine but I still like to feel pretty and for me pretty means dresses and skirts and crop tops.
This is coming from a non-binary person that has been confused for a girl since they like girly things



gender is a social construct, you are a boy, A boy who likes girly things. Everyone can like the things they like and still be who they are. I sometimes wear skirts but I’m still non-binary. You don’t owe anyone masculinity, and if anyone feels like you do then f them!
I'm a trans man reaching my late twenties and I still feel exactly the same as you. Just try your best to explain to her the difference between gender and gender expression, and that both are inherent to you. What you put on your body or touch with your body, doesn't change what gender you want your body to be. It is like asking why the peel of an orange is different than the inside of an orange. They're both part of the orange, but the outside peel doesn't mean the inside has to be more peel. Terrible analogy, but I hope that helps. If she doesn't understand, no matter how you try to explain, it is best to just leave it be and to look for acceptance elsewhere. Hopefully she will come around when she sees you living your best life, but some people don't want to understand, so there is no point in forcing it. I know it is difficult and I am sorry. ❤
BIG SAME. literally me. i love dresses and makeup and the colour pink but it just worsens the misgendering.
Clothing isn’t natural so you wearing “girly” clothes isn’t natural but neither are the clothes she’s wearing or the clothes I’m wearing. Clothing choices are cultural and that means whether something is masculine or feminine is a matter of opinion and not any kind of natural law.
Cute 🥰
Gender is literally not real it can be whatever you want it to be
So you’re a boy, who presents fem… I feel like there could be a term for this… boyfem perhaps?
thank you, max <3
Facts!
Ehh they kinda do, but I totally get what you’re saying lol 

Anyone should be able to wear anything
I was about to link this subreddit too!
I was making sure someone linked the sub and misread your name as anticapitalismfetish
Rain: Same, except this system is all trans tomboys. 😄
This right here. ^^🙌
... I have to try this now.
You took the words out my mouth. fuck gender norms.
this is exactly how i feel. i think my sister questions if I'm actually trans because I was pretty feminine as a child. Now that I'm out, I tend to not wear girly things as much. Just because I'm afraid of being misgendered or told it's a phase. Like one time I bought earrings, and my sister decided to say ""But aren't those kind of girly?"" Just let me live, bro 😭
Well take for example a skirt. If a man wears one say in Italy there’s probably gonna be some old fashioned people shaking their heads. But if you wear a skirt with a nice pattern in Scotland it’s called a kilt and it’s absolutely fine. Clothes don’t have genders it’s just traditions and what people make them.
Yes but that’s determined by culture and not any kind of natural order of the world. So whether someone likes a frilly dress or jeans and a t-shirt isn’t based on any kind of internal concept of identity but it may be based on a desire to “pass” as a specific gender in public.
It's been helpful to me when I feel especially dysphoric or ""not trans enough!"" Thought it might be useful to share
I mean if the shoe fits, lol
But that’s a kilt
It’s skirt shaped I’m not good at making sense

Hey you look great in black why not!

I really need to get used to other colors besides black, grey, and dark colors in general 🙄
😂your title is so relatable 😆
Big same, fr
Looking great! 

I often do the same now, even though before transitioning I'd always wear very colorful (still matching!) outfits whenever I could. 

Perhaps because I'm able to express my femininity in other ways I feel less need to now. Or maybe unconsciously I want to look smaller and blend in to the shadows... 🤔 ...no, it must be me channeling my inner goth girl again <adds heart choker to cart> 😋
Lol hey you do you! But at least the option of variety is there. I hate guy clothes, the options are basically
Tshirt & jeans,
Golf tee and slacks,
Formal.
Sometimes we're even allowed to wear shorts! But then you get mocked for being an adult in shorts because apparently having exposed calves is only for children or swimtrunks

No, Trans Women Do NOT Have an Advantage Over Other Women, Caitlyn Jenner!	"Sorry if this is a rant, everyone, but what truly pisses me off is how the media loves to talk down on the transgender community. Like for what? It's mostly the same recycled crap that was fed to gay people. I'll be glad when we get the recognition we deserve too, because I feel like it divides the LGBT community. If I simply type in ""transgender,"" I see nothing but article after article attacking some woman who was just achieving her dreams. Seriously, she's not hurting anyone and is most likely on estrogen. She's my age. I'm not sure how long Lia's been on E, but I've been on T for over 3 years. 3 years! If she's transitioned as long as I have, there is no way she has a disadvantage over other women. HRT alters muscle and bones if you start early enough. I know because it changed my body permanently, and my upper body is waaaaayyyy stronger now. Trans women shouldn't be berated over who they are just because they won a championship. Seriously, I don't get it. Media fabricates it to look like she's just intruding, misgendering her, like trans women don't deserve a role model, or like cisgender women always lose. 

The fact that Caitlyn Jenner is so willing to advocate against transgender women havung the freedom to do what she couldn't do just isn't fair and selfish to me. There are many of us on the fence, who would love to be on a team as who we truly are, but are discouraged by this. IT's obvious and appalling that she's working for terfs and right-wing liberals who hate transgender people for any accomplishment they have, especially transgender women—just to give herself a pedestal. If she truly believes the crap she spews, that trans women are in it to ""destroy women"" and need to be grouped with the male division, maybe she should just speak for *herself*. How can a trans woman be so naive about her own identity? Not to mention all of the other things out there about her seemingly misgendering herself to a blind transphobic eye and announcing that she allows her kids to, calling her ""dad,"" so some terf will expect every trans person to want the same. 

Psssh. Me personally, my kids won't even be allowed to call me ""Mr. Mom"" let alone ""mom."" Some of us take our identity and lives more seriously, taking precaution when sharing so much stuff that can be misconstrued by the transphobic media that she gladly shares with. Cis people don't get that she does not speak for every trans person, but really just herself. I get she's non-dysphoric, and that is fine, but why publically announce these things if you're so in touch with people's OPINIONS on trans people? She's the reason why there's so many terf novels, and people refusing to understand or take us seriously. She's a true ""transtrender,"" since she's also sadly the most known trans individual for her reputation. It's a shame *she's* taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back — when she doesn't realize terfs hate her too, whether she sides with them or not. She should cut that out. Someone her age should know better than to bully so many young women and out of jealousy since she had to compete with men. Some ""trans mom."" SMFH"	"As a trans woman who is also a competition fighter this gets brought up all the time by even organisers, I represent our clubs mixed team so I fight in the mixed gender category so its not an issue luckily, however at our last tournament the organisers came over and told the team that if I wanted to fight in the women's category I would have to fight in the weight class above my own cause of my biological advantage so its fair, I am at the bottom of my current weight class as the lightest fighter in that class for them mixed in the whole tournament. When on of my female team mates asked if she could fight in the male fights for the weight class below hers as that should be the same they told her she couldn't cause it would be dangerous to have people from different weight classes fighting. Anyway I got second in the mixed category after getting my head kicked in by this incredibly talented woman. So my ""advantage"" didn't help me there.
Yep in terms of sports, the science/data backs you up, at least for trans people that have been on HRT/Hormones for certain amount of years. If anyone says that trans women/men have any advantage in sports then they are quite literally denying science and data.

In other aspects of life nah, Trans people do not have any sort of advantage and anyone who says so is just a transphobe
Caitlyn Jenner has advantages over other women.

She’s cartoonishly rich.
Sports is just the go-to weapon of choice for transphobes right now. A lot of people are passionate about sports and trans women beating cis women in sports might seem more believable to the uneducated than trans people being pedohiles or invading bathrooms to assault people.
It’s very frustrating, science doesn’t seem to matter at all nor be desired on this topic.
Have you seen this post? https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/seoodq/at_the_risk_of_getting_hate_responses_but_the_lia/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

OP of it is basically being a transphobe and disagreeing with science, its sad to read through the post and some of the comments. How people can deny science and think they're being a good ally to trans people is beyond me.

Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports
Too many people take sports more seriously than human rights.
I'm 100% with you on the issue of sports - transgender women should compete in woman's sports. All the data and science backs that up. I also agree how incredibly frustrating it is that Caitlyn Jenner, to a lot of people, is seen as the main ""voice of trans woman"" - I'm absolutely not a fan of hers and her views that she proudly shares with the world are deeply problematic for trans people.

I did want to talk about her kids calling her ""dad"" and that general concept. I'm a binary trans woman whose son calls her ""daddy"". I started my transition after he could talk and already was referring to me as daddy and I didn't want to give that name up. We tried some different ones and nothing felt right; I realized I was trying to force another name just to match typical gender norms and so I said ""screw it"". The way he excitedly exclaims ""Daddy!"" just melts my heart, I clearly formed a strong emotional connection to the name my son calls me. I tear up at the thought of giving that up and I don't feel like I'm taking my identity or my life less seriously because of that.

Now of course it's completely valid for trans people to feel uncomfortable being referred to as their AGAB's typical parent name and want to go with the one that matches their actual gender (in my case that would be going with ""mom"" or ""mommy""). I am very strict with everyone else in my life about using correct pronouns (she/her) and my chosen feminine name. What I'm trying to say is it is all valid. I would be cautious of starting down the road of referring to certain trans people as less serious about their gender identity and less valid for simply not conforming to the restrictive gender norms society expects.
Yes thank you for writing that. I'm endlessly annoyed seeing people that don't understand anything about the science and biology around trans people try to argue about this. It's almost always bad faith arguments that come from purposeful ignorance and bigotry. It also comes from defining and seeing trans women as ""biological males"" which in most people's minds means biologically the exact same as cis men.

If someone was truly arguing about it in good faith and evidence based science then we could actually make sure things are fair, safe, inclusive and equal. Based on the science it is fair for little kids that are prepuberty to play and compete against each other regardless of gender. Then once puberty starts it is acknowledged that people with CAIS (biologically male but androgen insensitive) can fairly compete against women. So there should not be any argument against teens on puberty blockers and hormones competing as their gender. If someone cannot accept even this, which is completely fair biologically and well understood then the problem is not about biological advantages and unfairness and it's about transphobia only.

There is some uncertainty about the performance of trans people that went through their first puberty before transitioning and how that compares to the difference between cis men and cis women. There is a massive lack of scientific research here and that's what's being exploited by transphobes. There's a lot to say about the current research and it does look in favor of trans people competing fairly but there is still not much data. If there are provable and demonstrable unfair advantages or disadvantages that go beyond what performance enhancing polymorphisms provide then maybe we could look into how to help trans athletes compete fairly by researching the differences between trans and cis performance and what can be done about it.
Every time someone pulls the 'trans women have an advantage in sports because of tEsToStErOnE' card all I can think of is how the last few times I've gotten bloodwork done my testosterone levels have been lower than those of an average cis woman because of HRT.
Scientific evidence has shown that if anything, transitioning actually gives trans women a disadvantage. I don't know whether that's true from a biological perspective but collected data reports that the vast majority of trans women that compete in sports come in the middle of the pack. If this narrative were true we'd be regularly dominating the women's sports scene. We're not. The trans women that do rank in first or near it work damn hard to get there.
Caitlyn Jenner really needs to get her head out of her ass.  She may have an advantage over others because she’s super fucking wealthy.  Not your average trans woman who might face much more hardships and disadvantages compared to cis people.  People like her do not make it better or easier for trans people to gain more tolerance and acceptance.
Caitlyn Jenner does NOT represent the entire transgender community. She doesn’t even represent all transgender women. She and many cisgender people only think she does, but in reality Caitlyn Jenner only represents herself.
I think the current NCAA qualification rules are a fair solution that should be a model to follow in schools. At least 1 year continuous on HRT (and remaining on HRT) for athletic eligibility. At that point natural advantages are mostly reversed.  I see it as a good compromise between fairness and inclusitivity.
I avoid being taken in by anti trans athlete arguments because I honestly know little about sports or athletics. Like, anti-trans people expect us to be experts in everything. To answer all their questions, I would need a deep knowledge of sports history, biology, sociology. And I don't really think facts would change their mind because transphobes aren't gonna be asking any of this in good faith. 

Instead of playing their game, I would ask transphobes why they suddenly give a damn about women's sports. Where were they when women were being paid pennies on the dollar compared to their male counterparts? Where were they when coaches faced repeated sexual assault and rape claims? And most importantly, where is their evidence that transgender women are dominating in sports? 

The nonsensical arguments of talking heads is ultimately just hot air. I would try not to get worked up over it
I agree with you. They should be treated equally. Just because trans women want to be who they want, doesn't mean others should judge them for it
Reasons why I don't reveal my trans status to any of the physical activities I participate in. People crap on Lia now they crapped on Fallon Fox, Chloe Jonnson had to sue crossfit to compete because they disqualified her for being trans. Like it's a nightmare and in it were told we can't participate in sports, we are told we shouldn't participate in fashion after the outrage for Valentina Sampaio becoming a VS model.

Like no one wants us anywhere and it's sad.
""It's a shame she's taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back"". good word choice.
Reminder that Caitlyn Jenner transitioned when she did to avoid being charged with vehicular manslaughter. That said, she's just an awful mouthpiece for cishets and the right wing to use however they desire, they know she doesn't give a shit about the queer community and will happily generalize every trans person's experience to her disconnected richest 1% daydream.
This is why I wouldn’t want to be any kind of famous or well-known, being trans. There’s just too much stigma. 

And I think “society” will always be transphobic, unfortunately. I think it only gets worse from here as the cis-het conservative backlash moves on. We’re their new bogeyman, the way gay people were in the 90s and atheists were in the 00s.
I have nothing positive to say about Caitlin and hate that she has somehow become a person that represents the trans community because she is rich and I'm a firm believer in allowing athletes to compete as their gender but I completely disagree with you on allowing her kids to call her dad.  I transitioned later when my youngest was 15 and the oldest 24.  I am and always will be their dad and I am proud for them to refer to me as dad.  I also realize that not everyone would feel the same way and would want to be called something else and if that is what you want then that is perfectly fine and you should do what feels right to you but don't start criticizing other with a different take as it easily comes off as we are not ""trans enough"" unless we conform to your ideals.
It's intersectional. All else being equal Cis men have advantage over cis women but cis women have advantage over trans women. Because trans women may (MAY) spend time as presenting as a cis man, it becomes intersectional.

Caitlyn is such a cunt.  Can someone please take her crown?
Goofy.

HRT can add, but it cannot take away.  It can give you boobs, but it can’t take away your boobs.  It can give you strength, but it can’t take away your strength.

Your experience taking testosterone is not the same as a male’s experience taking estrogen.
I'm a trans woman and grad student and regularly do women's intramural sports as something to do just so I'm active and not completely socially isolated doing dissertation research all the time.

I absolutely \*suck\* at said women's sports. I actually \*like\* basketball, but even then, last time I played in the women's basketball tournament, my team lost in the first round 15-2.

And then there was me playing women's volleyball when I couldn't hit the ball over the net the entire game.... and the fact that my 5k run times are actually in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket...

I do these sports because I like doing it and being physically active, but if you watch me perform it's damn obvious that I am not \*remotely\* at an advantage to other girls and am low average at best. It's clear that the people saying they think trans women have an advantage have never actually seen a trans woman perform athletically.
[deleted]
Actually there's a bit of nuance here. Those who took puberty blockers and hrt see no significant benifit. Unathletic trans women who became athletic after transition likewise saw no significant benifit.

The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

And even where there was an advantage, such as with power lifting, there was a noticeable loss in said advantage over time. So basically trans women DO have an advantage, but only in a vanishingly small number of events, only when they were near professional athlete level pre-transition, only when they never stop training after transition, and seemingly only for a temporary amount of time.

Edit: I want to make something clear: I'm steelmanning the opposing arguement. There's very little research into this topic and what little does exist is lacking in a lot of ways. Once you weed out the terrible studies (ill elaborate down below), what little does exist finds no advantage outside of a few studies that specifically looked at high level athletes who transitioned. 

In generally, mildly or non-athletic folks who transition will see no advantage besides maybe height. I didn't see much good evidence asserting blood oxygen levels are higher in trans athletes, which is a common right wing talking point. I also didn't see evidence that trans women have an advantage in sports of endurance or technique. There is evidence that trans women have a disadvantage in swimming, though again there's not much research.

As for the study i referenced, the researcher measured thigh circumference and made the assumption that sush a measurement is correlative to overall strength. On top of small sample sizes, she failed to isolate a bunch of variables such as height, body fat composition, weight, and more. That's all on top of the fact that said researcher in question was a TERF

shit I was in a women's basketball tournament in December as a trans woman.... our team lost 15-2 in the first round and I fell flat on my back halfway through the match. And that's not counting the women's volleyball game where I couldn't hit the ball over the net. Some advantage I have lol...

Also I've been a distance runner since high school and my run times have \*dropped\* like 10 minutes on HRT, and are now in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket.

Been on HRT for almost 4 years.

What about Lia Thomas whose swim times literally blow cis women's olympic winning times to pieces? This conversation is not cut and dry.
There is no advantage, hence why we are constantly seeing biological women competing in mens leagues, oh wait….
Hot take: rich people aren't people and what they think doesn't matter.
[deleted]
i guess they'll keep changing the story to fit their narrative
which is so stupid too because if you've ever seen trans women compete in women's sports you'd see how silly the idea of a ""biological advantage"" is. 

Like... if we had so much of an advantage, how come I can't hit the ball over the net in women's volleyball? And how come my basketball team got knocked out of the women's basketball tournament last month in the first round with a 15-2 loss?  And how come my 5k run times are low average for women in my age bracket?
[removed]
Its Because for the conservative it's not really about science, sports or fairness, it's about hate, it's about marginalizing us. They never cared about women's sports and they still don't, it's just a useful tool at this moment
right, and they say *we* ignore science

>Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports

Source: trust me bro
It's so dumb... I actually \*like\* sports... but I like \*playing\* them, and love the social bonding experience and keeping fit. That's all I'm in it for. 

I really don't understand the obsession with competition that so many people have surrounding it, like their entire self worth and identity is riding on winning.
Yeah, but she's telling terfs/transphobic media outlets something that is personal, that can easily be misconstrued out of proportion to the point where they believe we all would feel this way, or that feeling this way means gives them a right to misgender us. It's different if she shared that in a transfriendly forum like you did. She shouldn't tell people who could care less about us about her life like that. 

The problem is her hypocrisy though; it just doesn't make herself look bright doing what she's doing.

It fuels the transphobia we face, and cis people who can't even wrap their heads around why someone would need to transition just won't get it. They can't even get something as self-defining as gender dysphoria. All of her actions now tell me that maybe she feels insecure about herself. Even if she's projecting hate towards other trans women, it speaks volumes for how she must feel about herself, being unable to emphathize with transgender people to the degree that she is for cis people who are unoppressed (unless racially, culturally or religously). I don't think I've ever seen her come up and say something that advocates for us, shutting down the hate we receive rather than to turn a blind eye to it. I'm glad she didn't become governor, and fear if she did. I would hate to see her try and take away medical access — knowing her, she probably would support anything that is against us and our wellbeing
very lesbian of you to be a woman who likes being called daddy
Didn't the NCAA change that a couple days ago? Basically abdicated the responsibility and threw it to individual sport's ruling bodies?
Exactly! If trans people and youths were given rights and equality, and were made to be safe in their family and homes then many trans youths wouldnt have gone through the wrong puberty.

Many trans youth have to live in hiding until they can move out of their family home because they are in an unsafe family and cant speak out or get medical help for their transitioning and identity until well after puberty.

I had to go through the male puberty despite knowing i was trans since I was a young child, and i couldnt speak up about myself because I was in a very religious family, that i often got physically and verbally abused in. So i stayed quiet until i was in a more supportive and safe environment. I had no other option but to go through the wrong puberty
Nope, just the transphobes and terfs don't. Let's not scatter and allow them to decimate our representation. Gay people dealt with the same thing until people realized gay people weren't going anywhere because it was never a choice. Same for us. Sadly, terfs will probably try to discourage us for another decade or two, since it was only the late 90's when clinical trials became available. That's why that stupid crossdresser stereotype is out there, cementing the hard past that the trans generations that came before us endured before HRT..
Caitlyn Jenner is a TRANSGENDER TERF. That's clowning herself, since I never knew you could be BOTH transgender and a terf. I can't see how she can give a greenlight to gatekeep trans women from competing where they belong, and invalidating like that WHILE telling her that it is ""good for her to be playing as her authentic self."" Seriously contradicting herself, and she is a seen as the one transgender with a voice out of all of us, just because of her children's careers. I mean who doesn't know the Kardashians.

If she was cis, she's just be a terf. There is undeniable internalized transphobia going on even if she is just allowing transphobic people to use her as a commanding voice for them. Idk how she's just taking charge of women's leagues. I get she is a retired Olympic gold medalist, but she shouldn't take advantage of an opportunity to do something right for her community for a change rather than trying to speak for all of us in a negative light. She should either defend this girl who is *50 years younger than her*, old enough to be her grand child, or decline to comment since they're probably not going to listen to her if she says something to validate us. 

I'm just imagining myself as Lia or any other trans woman who is excluded based off of a stereotype that has NO EVIDENCE to back it up, stringing this rumor along like she could care less. That's fucked up. If that isn't clowning around, idk what is. She calls herself an advocate for the transgender community, when she is a transgender terf, pushing the very transphobic rhetoric that is getting especially trans women killed. 

If she's not in it for the money terfs will pay her so that her reputation among the transgender community is destroyed, and greenlighting conversion therapy to scare particularly women and girls who are trans from following their dreams, then what is she doing? Why would she want people of this generation to live like the people in the 70s-90s (when she was forced to compete with men) to go through what she did? That was conversion therapy if you really think about it since clinical trials for HRT to help trans people (when it was around for 60 years) only become available for us about 25 years ago, so that's how the ""crossdressing"" confusion came about since we were gatekept. I would HATE for things to go  back to that, but I guess she's envious of the new opportunities this generation of trans people have. I'm a bit envious of those who got peri instead of DI and hormonal blockers to skip that first puberty, but you don't see me advocating to gatekeep
that is true. i think the only reason why she's the mouthpiece is because it's like she's following a transphobic script based off of stereotypes
... transitioning doesn't improve your odds in the justice system, ever. Being rich enough to afford great lawyers does. She's bad enough without making stuff up
I'm sorry. I updated the sentence.
seriously. Why do people associate her with being a spokesperson for the trans community? Literally the entire community hates her ass, and there's so many other prominent trans figures you \*could\* be using instead, like Rachel Levine, Sarah McBride, Nicole Maines, or Laverne Cox.
Man I went from being able to lift over 100 pounds+ easy to having issues with 50+. Also sports are literally about who's genetically better in the first place but no one admits it. Basketball? Be tall... cycling? Endurance... hell Michael Phelps has double jointed ankles which give him better kicking range so get this ""born genetically different"" out of here if you won't call out all of it. Cause it just sounds like whining.
regularly**
**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you ignore this post like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. With her logic, I'd go to jail for trespassing on women's sports since I have normal male Testosterone levels and am larger than most of the dudes in my family, towering at 6'2 (5 inches taller than my pops) As long as I take my weekly stomach shots, work out and eat right, I will always have the advantage Lia is accused of having with baseless claims made by people who don't know her and are exploiting her for money**

I clearly stated in the first paragraph that HRT alters bones and muscle if you start early enough. I didn't have significant bone changes from the first puberty at all. If you counter in science, the bones don't reach the peak mass until the age of 30, declining within every decade to follow. Lia is 22, and likely is on estrogen, and has been for a while (don't know her personally). This will be just a guess. Everyone's body is different. 

The argument *is* scientific because it's not an opinion, not guesses like those made about Lia without even seeing her play or looking at her league's stats. 

I'll use myself as an example since I'm the same age as her and transgender as well. 

I started T at the age of 18, shortly before my 19th birthday. Despite trying to adapt to the lifestyle of a cis woman, I've always been clocked as a man, so estrogen's effect on me was subtle. Just before I started T, I noticed the hip bones begin to widen, after gathering so much fat that I was unaware that it wasn't. Jumbo thighs and huge butts run in my family, for both the men and the women. The only thing estrogen really did was inhibit my ability to lose the weight in my lower body and gain upper body weight. 

My facial structure and bones are something I'm happy about since it's apparent just how the testosterone my body produced had the upper hand when it came to these characteristic gems. Even my height is around the 90th male percentile, because starting T resumed the growth presumed to of been stunted from the age of 14 up until 19. I grow around 0.15-0.5cm a month on average, so subtly it tastes months to notice. I'm someone who revolves my diet and my supplemental intake on my transition, not just take testosterone. I do this because I am not on E-blockers and haven't had an easy way of accessing it, like many transgender individuals. Due to my genetic makeup: inherited growth spurts, delayed puberty (i noticed it all began when I was 8, with breast development, but noticed stuff still happening 10 years later) Luckily, the women on my mom's side particularly have higher T levels than average, and can grow small beards or facial hair in general; this was a genetic lottery for me, since pretty much all the guys in my immediate family have facial hair that connects.

T squared out my jaw. I'd be more than happy to share pictures comparing my facial changes. Some are muscle, some are bone. I had an alien-like, long egg head before, with a skinny pixie chin. Now my face is wide and boxy. Rather than recede like I naturally appeared to without T's influence, my hairline grew IN, back to the original strong widow's peak that I was born with.

I take stem cells and do clay masks regarly, so I notice evolution to a higher degree. The general life of the cells in your body is 7 years, sometimes up to 10. This is usually around the time (6-12 yrs) when trans people feel the most content. Their changes depend heavily on the receptors in the body, responsible for regulating the body's individual response.

I am a body builder so my cells are always rejuvenating. Estrogenized cells that may be still present 3 years in, given the lifespan of cells, are killed and replaced by cells that responded more heavily to testosterone before and after HRT.

This doesn't mean that testosterone is stronger or better, just that my own genetic makeup responded more to it. 

Estrogen and female are seen as the default settings in development, so the face, arms, feet and voice don't grow or develop nearly as much — and will remain almost prepubescent-like only if the estrogenic receptors are weaker. Testosterone has a heavy influence on bones, not just estrogen. We can't forget, estrogen does too. Trans women who start soon enough may notice permanent hip changes, and a ceize in the widening of the shoulders and back.

That being said, if Lia is just as far as me in this, she does not have an advantage. Caitlyn Jenner is either full of sh*t, or she really wants the world to go back to pretending that trnsgender people is a 20th century phdnomenon that cannot be debunked in anyway with facts and science. Do your own research before you decide to have a debate. I gave my facts, and you have to give yours if you are worthy of a response from me, or I take it you have none because such an article contradicting doctors and science do not exist. 

Why should men join women's leagues and not women? I'm a real man, who needs testosterone to have a normal day to day life, or else something would be missing from my life that a man shouldn't be robbed of. I will never go off of T or fulfill the dreams of hypocrite, uneduacated terfs or be indoctrinated into the puppetry Caitlyn Jenner is in, to fill the needs of other people's lives just because *they're insecure that I exist.*

Instead, I'll keep existing along with different species of transgender animals out there. God even made transgender people who can develop a penis at the age of 12. Mine is developing much later, despite the micro dimensions it retains so far, I'd rather it than a vagina. I can jerk it, unsheathe it, and penetrate — before going under any knife (sorry if TMI) but men can't help but value our penises like women value their breasts. A phallus is homologous, meaning shared among almost every living thing of any gender preference, so saying someone is dickless like many of you presumably transphobic or naive people do is way more unscientific sounding to me. Women just don't want to call it a penis and estrogen keeps the development of the penis in people who are AFAB in limbo just to keep your precious heterosexuality alive. That doesn't mean that facts care about your feelings over mine. 

**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you decide to ignore this like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. If you're a dude who's heterosexual, it's kinda gay to think we could end up in the bed together over the ambiguity of genetalia of chromosomes alone, and that you'd kiss my hairy face and stroke my swollen 100% masculinized muscles, don't you think?**
This is definitely something I have thought about. People's perception of sports is skewed by only watching elite athletes where every little advantage helps. They don't consider that most people (who play for fun or compete at amateur level) have only average talent/athleticism in sports and half of people are worse than that.



THEN consider that a lot of trans people (not all, of course) would shy away from sports as a kid because of their dysphoria or social reasons, but might be willing to try post transition/later in life. Not that late starters can't be talented or anything, but obviously people who train from childhood have an advantage.
I mean this is like saying all black people are better athletes.  Strength and height are only one equation into being a great athlete, however there is a reason why there are sayings like, you can't teach height.    


I don't understand why Lia Thomas whether she is Ledecky good or just good for her weak division matters. From my perspective I think people want to make this a trans right issue but from my small mind I see the division the same reason we have men and women's sports. Again people will constantly point out how Thomas would be considered a high school star but no where near Olympic level, thus poses no real danger to cis women's sports, but that not the issue since in men's baseball not everyone who takes steroids automatically becomes Mark McGuire or Sammy Sosa and hits 70 homeruns a season, just like not ever trans athlete will come close to Ledecky, but the point is Thomas in my eyes has a pure edge since since was able to cultivate a men's body for the majority of her life and only recently transitioned. It be one thing if while transitioning she loss most of her mass and shrunk 3"" but as she stands she is 6'1"" and 210lbs of muscle.
The kicker is that's not the trans person's fault, either. If society would get the fuck over itself, trans women wouldn't have had to go through the wrong puberty in the first place.
As a sort of side question branching off this: Since a person’s body is undergoing changes, particularly those early dates, is exercise or competition potentially more dangerous?
Its small and not always true, several studies have been done that have been peer reviewed and upheld have been able to show that there is no significant link between trans people and having an advantage against their cis counter part, and most transgender people had a negative experience with sports due.

So again, the difference/advantage seems to be insignificant for the majority of trans folk. 

A lot of the studies that have tried to come out showing that there is, have been pretty much all discredited and proven wrong due to various reasons. People have tried and failed at finding any significant or major advantage.
>The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

Quick question: can you please link me to the study/studies with these findings?  In researching this topic, I'm only locating sources that claim the opposite. Thank you!
Wouldn't there be a lingering advantage in events where height is helpful? For those women who transition later of course. Basketball, volleyball, high jump etc.
This argument is total bs. The fact that you are not a competent athlete doesn't mean that all the scientific date is invalid.
Heres one of the many studies that have disproven the lie that trans people have advantages in sports, when they dont. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/

But also do you're own research lmao, the burden of proof isnt on me, it's transphobes like OP and those who agree to disprove what I and science have claimed.

And just look up the many video essayists, and left leaning people on YouTube that fight for trans peoples rights lmao, many of them have made videos going over the research, and studies that have been done as well as debating transphobes over it as well.

I love how whenever transphobes say anything they always make the other person do the research for them, regardless of if they are right or wrong, transphobes and their supporters always do the minimal amount of research before saying their dumb shit
No, her swim times are record-setting **for her school**, which is far from the best in the sport. 

she's nowhere near the women's swimming version of Michael Phelps. And she did quite well pretransition relative to men.

God, I wish trans women were all Wonder Woman. That would be awesome. Unfortunately it's not the case.
She doesn't though.. She was beaten recently by 3 cis women and a pre-transition trans man.  


https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/01/10/lia-thomas-university-pennsylvania-iszac-henig-yale-trans/
dan, do your research, dude. don't be a follower of fake news. lia's swim teammates who want to exclude her from the team, and blame her identity the moment she wins a medal are transphobic.
Yes it is, lmao anyone saying differently is just simply transphobic, when science overwhelmingly agrees that trans people have no athletic advantage over their cis counter parts.

Pretty much every single study that has come out against trans people in sports has been debunked and discredited.

Whereas pretty much every study thats for trans people in sports and proves that there is no advantage has pretty much been shown and upheld their findings.

So again, love how transphobes like you try to deny science whenever it doesnt back you up, but the moment you think science does you dont. Always funny how transphobes will turn their back to science whenever it doesnt agree, but any moment science does support something you say, you hold it near and dear as if you've ""always"" believed in science
No, we hate her because she’s a shitty person
No, it’s not her money, it’s the fact that she’s a massive hypocrite. I was merely poking fun at her hypocrisy and using her words against her.
She also killed someone and got off scott free because of a lack of evidence to convict her on manslaughter.
Right back at ya
🤣🤣🤣🤣 here, you naive baby. convinced this is Caitlyn now

The rest seem to be stupid journalists, or news trying to keep up with the trend withour actually doing an investigation because they aren't biology experts, nor do they specialize in HRT, psychology, or bloodwork of any kind of labwork NOR do they have a statistic of the truth of trans women since like you, many just go by opinion to quickly get their story out there when expected. It's kind of like working on radio. If you're unsure, you'd hate to admit.

Federal law is against discrimination in workplace/school settings against sex and gender identity, so this will never be an abroad thing - EVER LOL, unless Trump returned.

There it is folx, from the *experts*!!!

Fuck your feelings, buddy. If you want to fight for women's equality, WTF are you waiting for now?


Because this is the stupicy you're fighting for, men and women competing, downright contradicting yourself. Women would not feel protected at all with men who will never detransition like me. I'm so obviously male that month 2 on T, I started getting horrified looks when I went into women's restrooms. One picked up her daughter and left as soon as she came in and saw me, so I've used public men's rooms no problem ever since, even while it's packed. If this happened in CA, I'd join a sport just to screw with this unscientific transphobic craze (since conversion therapy is proven to be ineffective) and I have no reason to want to be off of Testosterone > https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/golf-archives/2022/01/25/luc-esquivel-trans-sports-ban-boys-and-mens-teams-daily-cover
For the conservatives, yes. I'm talking more broadly than that, because this issue in particular splits our allies, who listen to science about other things like Climate. (people who are allies on other trans issues)
It's pretty irrelevant tho. If science says that trans women have an unfair advantage, then that's it. Why bring politics into this?
Literally the same! 😂 Sben shporkbo, his transphobic ass has so many hilarious names and i love the meme. Ben Shaboobo
Ikr! I could just see their YouTube search history in my mind... ben Shabeebo, blaire white and other transphobes.

The thing that really showed me they were being bad faith was that anytime science was brought up they would blindly turn an eye to it and ignore anything to do with science, because they full on knew that science proved them wrong so they didnt want to acknowledge those comments.

And whenever called out for being transphobic they'd just turn around and act like a victim.. like at one point they tried to act victimized by saying ""well you havent been sexually assault and dealt with transphobes like i have"" 

Yet i had to go over the SA i've been through, and that i've dealt with transphobes IRL and one of them was even an ex who almost took my life over my trans based identity.

I just dont get how someone like him can be so transphobic but then turn around and say ""nuh uh! Im trans myself therefor Its impossible for me to be transphobic"" like.. have they never heard about ""self hating trans people"" such as Blaire White.

Like... How can you be so misled by the lies spread by transphobes to go into a trans community and be blatantly transphobic and make yourself out to be the victim by saying ""boo hoo ya'll are a hive mind and attacking me for being transphobic when im trans""
No, its called look things up for yourself? There are plenty of studies that have come out that have proven and shown that trans people do not have any significant advantage over their cis counter parts.

The funny thing is pretty much every study that has come out saying that ""they do have a significant advantage"" has been discredited and disproven.

I love when transphobes and people like you expect the other person to provide you with all the evidence and proof, but you're side never has to show any evidence or proof. 

Its almost like ya'll transphobes deny science when it doesnt benefit you, but will take the side of science if it does benefit you 🤔 weird how that happens isnt it, ya',ll never have to show any proof for your claims yet you expect the other side to show proof of their claims.

You're the one who has to show the burden of proof, since you're the ones trying to refute the claim that science overwhelmingly agrees with
trust me bro is not a source🤣🤣🤣
Totally - context is important! And there's a way to responsibly share details like the above. For instance, if I somehow ended up with a big platform and what my kids call me comes up I'd be honest but explain why and end with a ""Keep in mind though not every trans person will be comfortable with it like I am. Make sure you check and respect what each person wants!"" And I doubt she did that - I'm really not trying to defend Caitlyn Jenner. 

Just addressing the notion that trans women whose kids call them ""dad""(or vice versa with trans men) or do other gender non-conforming things are taking this all less seriously and are hurting trans people. 

If 'society' see's a trans woman whose kids call her ""dad"" and runs with it saying ""See! Even they see themselves as men!"" that's societies problem and ignorance. Not the trans woman who's just living her life and doing what's comfortable. She shouldn't have to cover up details like that and conform to society's gender norms for the sake of having cis people take us seriously.
she's talking about her kids
Exactly. Like the antiwork Fox interview in a lot of ways, she's cherry picked to be a scapegoat, to selectively define a movement to an audience. AND to confirm the right's ""truths"" without being accused of speaking over the movement.

When you're a celebrity, a big ""scandal"" about your private life, like transitioning, can draw media attention away from you being a shitty human being and help you dodge the consequences.

Edit: also when you have that much money and clout you could absolutely say you're going through something difficult and life-changing to avoid prison time. Doesn't work if you're poor though.
Thank you!  I understand your preference is different than mine and tbh if I had transitioned when I was younger I would probably be more in line with your preference.  I'm just at a different point now with different perspective and we need to realize that both of our views are valid for us and all the other perspectives that others have are also valid.
She transitioned started E in 1986. She was among the first famous trans people to do it, and kept it under the radar for 30 years
That, but I also think cis people are presuming trans women are bio identical to cis guys and we just...arent. 

So many cis people don't even know that HRT is a thing, let alone what it does to you.
It's not that simple though. Children shouldn't make life changing decisions at that age.
I'm not an athlete by any stretch but I would do some fitness activities from time to time. I remember that I nearly passed out from trying to keep up with my coworkers about six months into HRT. I used to be about as or more fit than them, and never had problems managing energy before that.
Not aware of any science on this, but kids still play sports during puberty, so if it's more dangerous, it might only be marginally so, perhaps with a few specific pains, but probably no major counter-indication.
 I'll tell you during the next few months/years though :P (competitive badminton player here)
let's ban tall cis women too. The tallest cis woman on record was 7'7 (lol what a man! Sports cheater!) which seems pretty OP to me.
[deleted]
Except that the scientific data *does* point to trans women not having an advantage.

You lose any male athletic advantage when you lose testosterone.

It's anti science to pretend otherwise.

Also ask yourself why is it that the only trans women to even *qualify*  for the Olympics...placed last in their events? How would that be possible if there were such a huge advantage ? 

Hint: it's because we don't actually have one.
""Transphobes like OP"" What? Who said I was transphobic? That's a first 🤦‍♂️
All of the journalists on this story should be fired/sued for harassment and defamation, even if she wasn't a celeb.

I hope Lia is doing alright.

because… the science doesn’t…
Ben Shabooboo🤣🤣🤣
omg you are so right. it wouldn't surprise me if Ben Shapiro trolls this place. He refused to look at the facts I provided, and shyed away from any opportunity to explain how any of his claims were logical. ""it just is because i want it to be"" and explaining why cis people are cis isn't plausible enough for me. Caitlyn Jenner and Blair White like most terfs/trabsphobes are puppets, who feel insecure in some way about themselves about the existence of trans people and everyone else's stance. you'd expect cis people who know nothing to just stay out of the mix, but what surprises me more is when trans people betray their own.

Like how can they want this shit to continue happening to us, and bail on us the moment that they doubt themselves? I guess it's to appeal to the terfs/transphobes who aren't gonna change for us just like we aren't for them. Sometimes i wonder if they even are trans to think being transphobic is in anyway productive. To me, it just makes things worse — making us look bad. I think the only reason why Caitlyn Jenner is as popular as she is for making us look like deceivers. I don't want to say it's bad enough she transitioned at the age of around 65, after ""knowing for decades,"" but that doesn't help her look any better doing this crap.
""transphobes like me""!? how fucking DARE you!? you don't know what my views are, stop insulting people that go against your opinions!?
exactly what I'm saying.
i didn't mean it in that context lmao, just pointing out that that's what a butch lesbian might do
well, she should probably start declining to comment. It's not like she's desperate for money, and this really isn't doing her reputation well. Due to her being so easily-puppeteered to speak such nonsense that goes against facts, she didn't get my vote as governor.
What precisely do you think I was saying in my comment?

As I was apparently unclear, let me clarify: 

1. Caitlyn Jenner didn't transition to dodge manslaughter charges. Being trans doesn't make prosecutors go easy on you. 

2. Yes, she's utterly and irresponsibly wrong about trans women's bodies. No, trans women don't have ""unfair advantages.""
... no, you get the charges dropped via your expensive lawyer finding a plausible pretext. :p ""I was trans the whole time"" is not a get out of jail free card, even if it might distract a tabloid or ten.
That's def true. When I was younger, like an actual child, I'm pretty sure I just thought it was surgery and that's it. I never thought.about hormones or heard anything about it until I was much older and seeking out that information specifically
And that's exactly what puberty blockers are for. Buy time to speak with qualified therapists before your body does something miserable and irreversible to you.
Kids can play sports but they should not be extraneously training (such as for Olympic levels) as it can negatively impact their natural growth
Well, it we take 5'5"" as average for AFAB and 5'9"" for AMAB. Lose two inches (more than average?) for HRT shortening. Then it's 2 inches of advantage on average. So it's 2 inches of ""advantage"" on average.

I don't think that's cause to exclude trans women at all. But let's be realistic about the facts.
[removed]
I think they meant the person asking for the data citation, no OP of this thread. I certainly didn't think you were being transphobic
She’s given hate by the trans community for being racist and transphobic, not for being trans
It’s not a “personal narrative,” it’s an actual thing that actually happened. She rear ended a car, pushing it into oncoming traffic and killing the driver, and the DA did not press charges against her. [Here’s](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-manslaughter-charge-caitlyn-jenner-20150820-story.html) an article from when the crash happened. Someone is dead, it’s her fault, and she faced no repercussions for it.
Did you see the comments where he basically said ""sure trans people are a minority but so are CIS people"" I about died from that. How can you say that cis people, the people who are actively working against us (not all but the broad group i mean) and whom we often fear.. are a fucking minority group, when cis people or rather cis white people dont have to live in fear of losing all their rights.

Also the fact that he tried to call me a ""gatekeeper"" yet also responded to me by saying ""we'll ive been trans longer then most of you, in fact i was trans before it was popular and ive got more karma then you "" like.. as if thats not an attempt at gatekeeping the conversation, also.. like no duh? My accounts only 2 days old lol so ofcourse you'll have more karma then me.

It might be mean to say this, but i doubt that he/the op of that post was even a legit trans person. Like I just dont believe that someone who is trans and has experienced the struggle that we go through... To willingly defend transphobic lies, and disinformation and try to make the trans communities the aggressors and cis people to be the victims... Thats just so.. anti trans that i dont think an actual trans person would do such a thing.

Like after so much science denial, and made up bullshit that one can spout before it becomes obvious they dont actually know what being trans is like. 

Someone even pointed out to them that hormones take a huge toll on a persons body, and explained to them that ""estrogen is just as powerful as testosterone"" because the OP said that of the two hormones estrogen is the weaker one.

Nobody will be able to convince me that he wasnt just a bad faith actor who came here to cause drama and be harm, like how anyone could look at that post and their comments and think they were in good faith is beyond me
The reason is simple. Rather than help us stop the trains to the death camps, they want to make sure they are the absolute last ones put on them. Fuck Jenner and those like her.
Lmao you're the one denyong science here, and sorry anyone who can deny the science of this subject is just a transphobe. Also you're the one going ""trust me bro"" which is a transphobic persons favorite thing to day when the left make claims about subjects regarding trans people
does women with PCOS have an advantage too? they can grow beards after all. your logic:😬
It actually really just depends on several evidence based factors. I didn't think I had to dumb it down for you.

Someone who is still T-dominant, whether male or female, has normal or high male hormonal levels, and completed puberty shouldn't compete with women and girls just like cis women on steroids can't. That's why it's laughable that so many ""wannabe experts"" overlook this detail: Testosterone is a steroid when preferring to put women against transgender MALES (female to male).

This is a fact any level-headed trans person like me cannot argue with. Vice versa for E-dominance and competing with men. 

That creates the advantage, so I guess we're not as dumb as previously just assumed. 

If society does what the terfs want, trans men will probably be not allowed to compete at all since many of us are even stronger than the cis men in our age division and trans women wouldn't be able to overpower the upper body strength of men. I'm explaining to you what I already did a hour ago. You ignored it because it was too long, scientific, and technical.

Lia looks like she is within her first 5 years of estrogen. Don't let the bone changes of T-poisoning confuse you. Her muscle mass looks female to me, compaired to my veiny, bulging ones. Her face looks soft and estrogenic too so I have no doubt she's on Estrogen.

If she's been on hormonal blockers since she was a  pre-teen, or has been on estrogen for years, again — NO proven advantages unless she has Eddie Hall's rare condition. He's the world's strongest man, whose muscles do not atrophy or have a stopping point, which his daughter also inherited — giving them hulk-like physiques with little effort due to the rare condition, causing what I described: myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. That or steroids would be the only advantage against cisgender women, NOT estrogen you dunce. 🤣🤣🥵

I hope Eddie Hall's cisgender daughter isn't disqualified over her ""advantage""
Haha thank you for clarifying. I was 50/50 on which way you meant it and so decided to just not respond.

I'm not butch but in regards to the lesbian stereotype... if the Doc Martens fits 🤷‍♀️
my bad i thought you were taking up for Caitlyn
Delay puberty till you're 18 years old? Seems unlikely.
Yeah, I'm only speaking of competition at, say, regional level ? I was not speaking about people who specifically train to be world-class in their sport - sorry for the misunderstanding

""Tower over the girls"" LMAO!!! 

Dude..im 5'7"" and a trans woman, and not even the tallest woman on my basketball team.

Shit, I've had a cis woman teammate who is like twice my size. I'm a really *tiny* skinny little thing. Despite what you seem to think, we don't all look like she hulk, and it is more than possible for cis women to be bigger and taller than us.

Shit, Michelle Obama, Melania Trump, and Sigourney weaver are all 4 inches taller than me. They are all cis.

And yeah you actually *do* lose all male athletic ability. Shit, my boyfriend can pin me to the ground just by laying his foot on top of me, and I can't open jars anymore without help. 

And again, if there was such a magic 15% difference how is it possible that I am in the *lower* average for my run times for women in my age bracket? Shouldn't it be higher than that? 

And what records? Cite your sources here. Not a single trans woman has ever so much as medaled at the Olympics despite being eligible for 20 years now.

And YouTube propaganda videos are not a credible source imo.
I didn't. he deleted literally everything after refusing to read the facts we gave him, just like something ben shapiro would do.

i found pics of him ""pre."" Even ""pre"" dude looks like a cis guy to me who grew out a patchy beard for the past 8 years. it wouldn't surprise me if he is, since part of the post seemed like a massive slap in the face  of any real trans person. I'm surprised I haven't seen the guy troll r/ftm, if he's even heard of that sub.

he didn't care about the argument i had that supports him either, so if he's truly trans, this guy either has a screw loose or hates himself like the other trans transphobes. 

He couldn't even give me an unbiased, science based source that proves ""no matter how long"" we take HRT since it's been clinically proven.
First of all this conversation is finished, Secondly you misunderstood  completely the ""trust me bro"". I wasn't telling them to trust me, it was an ironic way of saying that the redditor I was answering had no proof of whatever he was trying to say.
I don't know, do PCOS women grow significantly taller than other women and have significantly more muscle mass? If so, yes they would have advantage. Your logic: ""I want to bend reality because I can't accept biology""
Nah, I'm a trans woman who transitioned a couple years before Caitlyn did, I hate her guts :p I was just pushing back on the idea that being trans is a way to get out of legal trouble
Sometimes puberty delays itself. Your unscientific beliefs probably ignore intersex people altogether, doesn't it? Often times, transgender people are. This could mean the chromosomes are indecisive, mixmatched, they exhibit deemed ""male"" and ""female"" genitals, or the brain fully developed as another gender. Delayed puberty is usually how people find out that they are intersex. More studies may find being trans begins as an intersexuality, since people assigned so at birth have to have the same types of procedures as transgender people, for the same cause — gender dysphoria and various gender identities. The only one who knows them best is God and themselves. Not you. Not some other trans person. Just God and them. People calling Lia a man is sickening for this reason, when she's well aware that she's a woman. Don't like it? Cry and get over it. Why worry? She isn't hurting you is she? :)
Eighteen isn't a magic number, people aren't finished developing until 25 anyway. The point is that the adults can, with more experience than a child, guide that child to ask questions that will make clear what choice is right for them. People don't ""suddenly change"" when they hit 18, all the adults in their lives just failed to properly listen to them until they finally had the autonomy to be themselves.
Yeah that kind of sport is usually fine

Serious injuries at a young age can heal wrong quite easily (I guess apart of healing fast) and they’ve not got the durability of adults

And contact sports that hit the damage can cause micro fissures and lead to brain damage - especially on a brain that’s not finished developing 

Dumb that high school kids play American football
Is the average trans woman taller than the average cis woman? Yes.

Should that difference disqualify them from competition? No.

It's important for us to be honest with ourselves and everyone else. Not deny facts. But still assert that trans women should have every right to participate in these and other sports as women.

I'm worried when people say things like you're saying, where you're trying to say something unrelated ""genetic lottery has far more to do with it"" without addressing head on that sometimes 2 inches difference is what makes the difference between being 5'11"" and uncompetitive and 6'1"" and competitive.

I think a better way to say this is ... women with better early childhood nutrition are on average taller as well. Would you block women with better early childhood nutrition from competition as well? No, you wouldn't, all women should be able to participate.
Don't waste time arguing with transphobes, it'll only drag down your mental health. If they were going to be receptive to facts and science, they wouldn't be here.
Your being a mediocre athlete is irrelevant and brings nothing to the table.
The only ""science"" based thing he tried to use against me was that trans women are ""taller"" then cis women, and that they would weigh differently then cis women... As if thats at all science and reasonable.

Like at that point with those idiotic suggestions, you'd also be saying then cis people who are over 6 ft tall cant compete with people who are less then 6ft tall, or people who weigh 250 pounds couldnt compete with people who weighed 200 pounds because the weight/height difference would be some sort of major advantage... Like height and weight isnt a ""trans"" thing, its a human thing everyone of any gender will come in different heights and weights.. like there are cis women who are legit 7ft tall, and cis men who are only 4ft tall .
Except you're the one who was making claims that trans people have an significant advantage when it comes to sports.. when they scientifically dont and have been shown to actually have a disadvantage. 

And no you werent being ironic, denying science isnt ""being ironic"" it's being a science denying transphobe as you're spouting anti trans dialogue by saying that trans people have an advantage in sports when science doesnt agree with that and actually states the latter.

Sorry, but anyone who denies science and spouts right leaning, disinformation lies like ""trans people having an advantage in sports"" is a transphobe in my book.
can you tell me facts, not stereotypes? the average man is 5'9, I bet most of Lia's team are somewhere around there. Idk, she doesn't look drastically taller or more muscular to me. Maybe in the thighs since women carry their strength there on estrogen. Can't you read? I said this already. I'm gonna block you if I have to keep repeating myself. I gave you experts' debunking. What else do you want?

Statistics? Ok, women can be any height, dude. the tallest is cisgender and 7'7. the tallest trans woman is like a  FOOT shorter (6'8) hahaha. Both are gorgeous feminine looking women who would astonish anyone looking for a model. This is from genetics, not testosterone. 

I may not have had efficient T at birth, but I am taller than 90% of the cis guys I encounter since I am talker than 5'9. I was 5'9 at the age of 14. My mom is 5'6, 2"" over 5'4 and she's cis. Some just are taller. There is only a 5"" size gap between male and female so where I am 6'1.5 to be exact, is the height I'm supposed to be.

Some women can have more muscle mass than some men and not be trans, just athletic with a high metabolism. Some may be hormonally imbalanced (PCOS) like I said, or have other conditions like thyroid conditions or the Eddie Hall one I mentioned. Anyways, like I said, I don't like repeating myself so I am going to block you now. Maybe in the next life, you'll figure it out when you find God gave you the same brain and the default (rather than female) body. Would you fake a smile and learn to accept that, which only ever ends up causing regret, depression, eating disorders, anxiety, anger, frustration, and jealousy like Cait's probably feeling for faking being a guy for quite a while mainly due to society holding her back at the time, way post the effects of testosterone on her peak bone mass and her voice (it's never too late, but it gets harder to see yourself and for others to see you and take you seriously)

Living in the closet, you'll have everyone telling tou how to be that gender assigned at birth, but you fail for years at feeling content, not looking awkward around others, or hiding the obvious fact that you'd be wearing a mask — like someone trying to learn a language.


Even if you're good looking either way, you can be trans. It's not about looks or insecurity about looks or how you sound. It's a subconscious preference you'd hate yourself for ever ignoring, like your sexuality - whether asexual, hetero, homo or bi

And bi rhymes with bye now😘👍😬
[removed]
oh, but it does, because it disproves that we have an inherent advantage. If we did, how would it be \*possible\* for me to be a mediocre athlete by women's standards?

The fact that I exist, disproves your basic premise.
Didn't you read me saying that this conversation was over? byeeee
I'm glad we can agree on one thing. Intersexuality isn't a sexuality, just like the terms used for trans and cis ending in -sexuality. It's just the state of someone's sex rather than gender; these are two different things, which can be used interchangibly. People who wish to undergo a full sex change may identify as ""transsexual"" and since not all transgender people do, many do not use this term and may even find it offensive when labelled that. 

Many people still think trans = gay.
Just no.
It's basic math, man. ON AVARAGE men are stronger. That doesn't mean that ALL men are stronger than ALL of women. The real, dramatic difference in power is most evident when people are trying to optimize themselves to be the best athlete they can, and they dedicate their life for it. Starting with even a 10/15% advantage in that context is HUGE.
Ah yes the famous, transphobe runs away when they've been proven wrong lmao
key word there is \*men\*. Men perform that way because of \*testosterone\*, you know, the exact thing we make a point of getting rid of, and replacing with estrogen.

Fact of the matter is we are \*not\* men, and our bodies do not \*perform\* like men's bodies, because we make a \*point\* of feminizing our bodies. That's kind of what transition \*is\*.

You're trying to cite a group of people that we are not, that have athletic enhancing hormones we don't have, to argue that we can do athletically what they can. In what universe is that remotely a logical argument?

Moreover, since when is having a biological advantage a disqualification for sports anyways? You don't see people banning tall people from the NBA for having an advantage or Michael Phelps being banned from swimming despite having several genetic abnormalities that make him better suited for swimming.

the reality is the entire \*concept\* of sports revolves around biological advantages, and there's no real way around that.

Even if we \*did\* have an advantage (which we don't), people get ahead in sports because of biological advantages all the time and nobody cares. So why do they care with us? Because it's all about being transphobic.

Nobody gives a flying fuck if a cis woman happens to be a she hulk of a woman that what were your words ""towers above the other girls"", but suddenly if we are it's a huge issue? Come on man, just admit it you're transphobic, and the \*only\* reason you're making this argument is because of anti trans bigotry. If a cis woman had the \*exact same\* advantages you're bitching about I guarantee I wouldn't hear a peep out of you.
Girl, are you really thay oblivious? I'm not gonna talk with someone that offends me repeatedly,  tf, get lost."	seopja	trans	734	0.96	2022-01-28 11:29:40
My mum doesn't understand trans people and refuses to try	"Ok so, my mum seems to be under the impression that just because I'm her child that I have to be exactly what she expects me to be, testosterone ridden, manly, muscular strong dude. She also expects me to believe in everything that she believes in for some reason. Many people, TV shows she's watched and my school have tried to make her understand what I'm going through and how she's making me feel and what being trans is and it went in one year and straight out the other.

She has admitted to me that she hasn't even attempted to understand because she thinks it's ""bullshit"" and that ""she doesn't want me to make a mistake"" however she words it in a way where it sounds like she doesn't want me to make a mistake, but rather that I AM making a mistake and it's so frustrating. She makes no attempt at even fucking trying to understand what being trans is and is now convinced that I am a straight cisgender male, because in her little bubble world me being anything else is disastrous and that I need to have everything about it taken out of me. Because apparently she seems to be under the impression that we still live in the 1980's where trans people were not accepted. And she is also very good at emotional manipulation and it is utterly disgusting, she is constantly saying ""stay strong for your sisters"" referring to my two sisters, one of which is 6 months old, one of which is 21. Why would I need to be strong for a grown ass woman? And she has also said that she ""doesn't want to lose her son"" and whenever I lied about my identity she said ""good, I want my son back"" it's honestly vile. I could go on forever about this but talking about it pisses me off so I'm gonna stop, thanks for reading this if you did, I really appreciate it.
TLDR; My mum is a huge religious zealot, happens to think that I'm supposed to believe in what she believes in and refuses to accept who I am and is constantly trying to ""pray the gay away""."	"Have you talked to your older sis?
I'm with you.

my mom does similiar shit, just in a more passive aggressive way.

constantly trying to get me to go to church with her etc. ""mom, my ways are frowned upon in a christian church, ya know the whole sacrificing 9 of different animals, tho I might beable to find a few willing participants there..."" te he he
I'd do what your sister did tbh. She's going to lose another child if she isn't careful. Oh well her problem
I've not seen my mum in over 8 years. It hurts a lot but not nearly as much as it hurts being around her abuse.
It took me a while to figure out that the only person who's really got your back is going to be you. Facts: You owe your patents nothing.  You did not ask to come into this world, and because you did not, it is their responsibility to see you to adulthood. They owe you only that. That said, if you do not have their support, it's time to go. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, but I owe them nothing. Gratitude is not in the equation for reasons I stated above: I did not ask to be here. Are we to feel guilt because we will not be manipulated into making them feel a certain way yet denying our own happiness? 

You deserve the right to be happy in your own skin; however way you feel or wish to express yourself. Love you more! Take care of you first! If you do this first, there will be an abu dance of love and riches to share with family and friends if you desire.

I love you!🤗❤
Some parents treat their children as mini-me's versus human beings that are different than their parents.
It seems she's manipulating you and claiming ""its for your own good!"" Or something similar.

My mom threatened to remove me from lgbtq friends if I didn't quit ""convincing myself"" I was trans. Supportive parents can feel awesome, but the sad truth is that they are rare.
Aggressively forcing someone to wear clothes that make them dysphoric is an instance of parents traumatizing their trans children by forcing them to do something they aren't comfortable with or actively protest against, based on my research. I apologize if she's ever done this to you.

I'm sorry your mother is being like this, it isn't fair. Parents like her do exist and it can be mortifying.
Perhaps it’s a mistake, but it’s yours to make. She had her chance and probably mede some herself. Parents are supposed to set an example but it’s up to you to follow it or not. So live your life. She is living her’s.
If you can leave, leave. If you can’t, wait.
I’d cut contact with my family, the same time I came out to them, but I’ve known their transphobia for years, just one of the reasons I cut contact.  I’d been no contact for about two and half years, still receiving emails months apart as they tried to get me to talk to them. I’d give short responses that I didn’t want to talk, but in all of them I noticed first they deadnamed me and then after I called them on it they stopped using names at all.

I’d told them my preferred name, signed all my emails with it. Early last year my dad said he was “reading a book on transgender people.” I guess I had some hope there’d be some progress, some change, but I knew how conservative he was and what sources he usually researched from, so it was a fool’s hope.

Then last fall, I got another email, which didn’t use any name.  And I snapped, demanding that if they wanted to address me, they had to use my name.  Their response?

“What is your legal name?”

Damn, I lost all hope in them ever changing.  Any amount of research not from a TERF or fundamentalist’s ass would have deadnaming and preferred names as almost first topic. So I could conclude they were staying in their bigoted rut or they lied to me about trying to understand.

So I gave up on them. I tossed all their emails into the junk folder to flag anything from them there.  And then I mourned the nostalgia of my parents which wrecked my holidays. It hurt and still hurts, but I couldn’t keep running my heart through a wood chipper, hoping they’d change.  I had to do what was healthy for me, and that was letting them go entirely.
So you're saying we have the same mom...
I'm in a similar situation, and it sucks. Just please take care of yourself. You can get through this 💖
It's nice that she doesn't want to lose her son but you should tell her that she's gonna lose him now or later and if she loses him now, she'll get a daughter in return. If she loses him later, she'll lose him. Period. She's selfish and isn't helping anyone.
You’re going to have to find a way to leave hon, asap.

I’m so sorry, but the sooner you begin to take steps and make plans, the better. She will hurt you, and poison you, and you deserve to be who you are without that toxicity.

She sounds like a woman who puts you on a pedestal because she’s had her problems with men. The thing is, you are not her ‘man’, (obviously) or her property in any fucking way. She owes you, for bringing you into a cycle of suffering. You don’t owe her Jack.

Reach out to your older sis asap, and be honest with her. Don’t beat around the bush, say you aren’t getting support and you need some supportive family now more than ever. 

Even if you don’t get out of the house for a few years, I don’t know your age or situation in life, working toward that goal will make it bearable. It would be dangerous for you not to make something of a plan.
I know the exact feeling, my dad is the same
Ask her if she wants a relationship with you. If she says yes then tell her she better sort her shit out and you will come back when she does. I’m sure she will sort it out pretty fast.
Honestly it was less offensive to me when I thought it went both ways, that they would at least want to meet the expectations of what a good parent is the way they want you to meet expectations. But that doesn't even occur to them its just pure narcissism
I can't fix your mom, but I can tell you that you're valid whether the people around you understand it or accept it!
It sounds like we have pretty similar experiences when it comes to mothers. Mine has told me verbatim a lot of what your mother said to you. However, even though it took me over two years, every few months breaking down crying after my mother continued to refuse to accept me. A few months ago I finally got her to crack by asking if she could just call me her kid, refer to me neutrally and try to use my choosen name. And while she still doesn't want me being a girl to be the truth, but when I asked if she'd think I'd change my mind, for the first time ever I hear her say ""probably not"". And since we've built a strong and healthy relationship.
Now, I can't not and will not say that your mother will turn the corner like mine did. But, I want you to know that there are people like your mom that do change. If you wanna try to accelerate that change, I recommend, only if you feel comfortable and safe of course, asking your mom what it means to be loved unconditionally, without involving gender at first. Then ask her if she loves you unconditionally, and if she says yes ask her why she can't love you as her daughter, or something to that effect. When I had this sort of conversation with my mom, and I very calmly and logically said that she didn't always love me unconditionally, cause she spent >2 years being unloving towards a condition of me. And once I did, I saw her world shatter. She raised me telling me she'd love me no matter what, she'd always be there, believing that that's what a good mom does, and reality came and slapped the fact that she hadn't been the mother she promised she would be across her face. And it sounds fucked up, but I felt retribution for how she hurt me. She made the desicion to refuse to listen, to refuse to try to understand, and now she has to live the rest of her life knowing that she failed at being the mom she wanted to be. Which is truely terriblysad, but we all must live with our actions, and pledge to never repeat them. And now, I want to leave you with two things that you may or may not struggle with now or in the future. 
1) If you can become happy with yourself, you will NEVER need your mother's approval to be happy. Instead of focusing on the pain of having an unsupportive mom, put that pain/energy to focus on learning to accept yourself, to love yourself. Which sounds cliché, I know, but the only person who will always be there for you is you. Think of yourself like you're someone you really care about that's going through a really tough time. Anything you would do for that person, start doing it to yourself. Whether it be talking deep with them, or getting them water to keep them hydrated, or saying that everythings gonna be alright, start doing it for yourself. 
2) Life is always worth the struggle. Never give up. No matter what happens, no matter where you are. The only thing worse than the worst of life is not having one. (mild trigger warning ahead) If you can't look the person you care about most in their eyes, tell them that you love them, that you care for them, and end their life while everyone's around you watches, feeling no regret in the process. You can't ever end your own.
With those in mind, I wish you the best of luck in becoming the person you are! And that goes for anybody else reading this aswell!

TL:DR- people can change, love yourself like you love others, and never give up, no matter what
I'm in this same position right now babes 🥲 I'm 4 months on estrogen (unbeknownst to my transphobic mom and grandma I live with) and I'm not sure what to do about them. 

I've made the conscious decision to not treat my mom like a person anymore and instead it's like I'm just surviving a video game about mental abuse when I get home. Like litterally abusing my ptsd for a slightly more entertaining cry session today 😂 

I have a con this weekend and I hope that's gonna be a good one 😋
I would leave religion out of the conversation. Focus on the issue that it is a medical necessity. You're right to be hurt, frustrated,  angry, and basically misunderstood. She's experiencing fear as well as a type of mourning. What you need are allies and support. You really have no time to sell your situation but should concentrate on yourself and what you are experiencing. Don't miss out on the joy of new discoveries about yourself and your journey. Best wishes ❤
i agree with people saying you need to leave. i’m so sorry this is happening to you. it hurts, it does, but making a plan is the best thing to do. to leave you need money, so please try and get a job if you don’t have one already. you also should hide your money safely if your mother controls that too, take out increments and put it aside if you have no way to save properly without her knowing. i sincerely hope you have a support system aside from your family - if so, lean on them, tell them your plan, get their support so you don’t go through this move and big change alone. please contact any hotlines you can, see if there’s an LGBT organisation or mental health organisation to help you move out, you could potentially speak to a helpful social worker who will out you through the motions, perhaps help you find accomodation- this is abuse and an abusive situation and they will agree. your safety is being compromised. it should be called that. 

if you’re old enough, you want to ideally save enough money for at least three months of rent and furniture. look for council pickup days, if you have a car/a friend has a car, you can get cheap furniture, or some thrift stores/op shops sell furniture for cheap. consolidate all your plans in a hidden note on your phone. if you’re seeing friends, an idea is to take clothes or belongings in a bag in small increments so you dont have to rush all at once if you suddenly need to leave.

i also think reaching out to your sister is an idea. if you reach out with your concerns about your mother being narcissistic and that you need help, i hope she’d help you. you aren’t the reason she left, it’s your mother. i hope she can help you and that you can bond together.
r/raisedbynarcissists
No, she cut contact with my family when she was 16 and we hadn't heard from her until about a year ago and all she did was just have a brief conversation with my mum
The sisters smart, leave when you can. Awful people like that will die alone.
this happens to me too, my mother thinks that I won't be a ""good woman"" because I completely break all of the gender roles of ""being a woman"" and I want to transition my own way and not how it is ""socially accepted"" so she also thinks I'm just going through a phase and she reminds it to me every time she's able to do so
Probably? My mum's hate comes from her culture not being accepting of the LGBT community and her entire country being full of straight people.
It's all well and good assuming that, but some people want to have their cake and eat it too.  
They'll constantly try to guilt you to ""come back to the flock"" whilst also exiling you. (Just look at Telltale)
She seems smart
Tbh I can see why
Maybe try reaching out to her to get some more context about your mother. The ONLY mistake you can ever make in life is by ignoring your own intuition and blindly accepting/following others opinions and beliefs about your personal life. Stay strong love, and stick to your guns
Unfortunately it sounds like you’re going to need to do the same as soon as you’re able. It sounds like your mother is one of those people who view their children as an extension of themselves. Not as autonomous human brings with their own personalities and individuality.

There’s not much you’re going to be able to do about her. You can forever understanding and empathy onto someone. 

All you can really do is drop it with her and shut her out and tell her all she’s doing is guaranteeing you’ll leave asap and never look back just like your sister did. 

Speaking as someone who haven’t spoken to their mother in almost a decade. She doesn’t even know I’m trans. I cut contract for entirely unrelated reasons.
I think that's a sign for you.
That seems like a really good reason to get in touch with her without the rest of your family knowing.
If you reach out be prepared to have little to no relation with her. My sister and I have really talked to each other except on family holidays.  Five years separation, different school, and then the dysfunctional family never really made for a strong relationship.  We reconnected and talked over our problems when I broke contact with our parents, leading to her finally doing so as well.

But in our case she was very much the scapegoat, while I tried to be the golden child.  We were just kids trying to survive bad childhoods, and even after that reconnection, I had to accept we would never have a relationship.  

But I do take comfort that I apologized, and that we parted ways on good terms.  We each have our own found families we built from friends and partners. And that’ll have to do.
> she cut contact with my family when she was 1

gee I wonder why...
Do the same then. And maybe reach out to her yourself since clearly she also had an issue with your parents.
This is just me but- coming out to my sister and talking to her about all that made us a lot closer- we had just drifted apart after she moved out

Maybe give her a call?
I wonder why :D She's smart, try to contact her, she'll help you hun
I've not gotten the 'good woman' excuse yet, but I'm sure its lurking. I mean, I have two professions, both male dominated (auto tech and welder). I wear non form fitting clothes 95% of the time etc...
> her entire country being full of straight people.

spoiler alert: that's impossible.
I'm from the USA. My family (parents and sister) are religious zealots. Far right borderline Nazis... Actual Nazis at one point. My brothers are supportive. But I am forced to stay with my parents because of losing everything due to covid. Every day is a nightmare filled with harassment. I am about 7 months into hrt. I have tits, am close(ish) to passing without makeup. And they can't handle it. I just want out of here.

I'm 36. People like this don't change. They are self righteous cunts that never try to change. Don't waste your time

Transphobia should not be tolerated.	"The amount of transphobia in subreddits is disgusting. The amount of memes and comments that make fun of trans people (especially MtF) is horrid. If your humor is pointing out and making fun of people’s insecurities, then you’re not a funny person. 

The hate that trans people are getting because of “competitive sports” is astronomical. Look, I’m sorry your favorite person didn’t win but that doesn’t mean you should completely insult the hell out of someone and deny their identity. What happened to some decent respect?

This is hate speech, it’s harassment, and it is harmful. 

To all my fellow trans friends, I recommend to stay away from big subreddits like r/memes because I’ve noticed they encourage transphobia. Let’s not support subreddits that don’t take accountability for their messed up actions.

edit: MtF not FtM"	"> Look, I’m sorry your favorite person didn’t win

Implying thy even knew who was playing 😂
There’s been a lot more as of recently for some reason. I would expect a few because this is Reddit, but it’s gotten to the point where every other joke punches down and claims to be satire. Is it even funny anymore? How many times can you laugh at the same joke before it gets old?
I understand jokes, which are made to make people laugh. I understand jokes which are polite

But jokes which are made to say offensive things? That's too much.

>The amount of transphobia in subreddits is disgusting. 

Let me fix that for you. The amount of transphobia in ~~subreddits~~ the world is disgusting. 

The subreddits are just a reflection of popular transphobic views in the world, mostly the US since it's the majority of Reddit. Yeah, the US is transphobic, and even allies can be ignorant as fuck and say shit that just isn't funny or downright mean, even if they don't realize it.

We have an uphill battle to fight for acceptance. That's why people are terrified when they find out they're trans, when a transwoman tries to go outside in clothes they feel comfortable in, when we speak to doctors about transitioning.

That's our life. We can avoid subreddits but it's much harder to avoid the reality of our world.
I've been noticing this a lot on r/memes lately specifically. There's been a lot more LGBT themed posts that are good but I've seen some pretty clearly transphobic ones recently with those saying something about it getting harrassed
Reddit mods will never remove hate speech unless you're in an lgbtqia+ friendly sub and even then its sometimes a coin toss
Friendship ended with transphobic r/memes, now r/dankmemes is my best friend.
you should see r/teenagers.
Yep, I’ve leaved most massive subreddits cause of the constant misogynistic and transphobic humor and comments. I don’t need that on my every day.
I am surprised to hear FtM is getting more ridiculing than MtF. Youd think ""super manly men"" would make fun of a girl wanting out of their incorrect body.
Even trans people are posting that on trans subs and I hate it
I noticed on reddit especially no matter where you go there's transphobia. I recommend the shinigami eyes browser add on for people who aren't on mobile
r/dankmemes is better than r/memes by the tiniest bit, but fairly bad overall. best ones are ones like r/traa r/196 r/19684 and similar ones
This whole antiwork shit has really blown open a giant gaping cess pit of transphobia. Don't look at those threads.
I was very surprised today when i got banned from a subreddit for denouncing transphobia, and then when asking the mod about it, they told me i was bigoted :D
So yeah r/trans is safe and i'm now gonna stay within here, not gonna explore this godamn hell hole of a website anymore.
Reddit really needs to train its moderators in spotting hate speech against trans people. I've reported people outright using slurs or telling us we deserve to die for being trans, only to have Reddit's moderation team tell me it's not hate speech. 

Subreddit mods are great. I feel like Reddit's site wide mods harbor some deep ignorance and/or a few transphobes.
it’s so normalized and it makes me so uncomfortable. i literally joined all these trans subs bc of it.
No one's holding a gun to your head and making you go to those subs. It's a form of self-harm to continue to do so. You either accept that transphobes exist or you waste your life fighting against them, which is pointless because they get off on the conflict. What *really* upsets them is *your success* (like that girl in sports) so get off of Reddit and do something.

Come here for support or whatever else but why engage with these people? Would you go to their church/neighborhood BBQ/cousin wedding and try to argue with them? Then why do it on the internet? It's the same damn thing.
What really hurts and saddens me more than anything, is that people don't seem to see trans people as HUMAN. This whole argument with trans athletes having an ""unfair advantage"", (despite trans athletes competing in the Olympics since 2004 and no evidence showing they've taken opportunities away from anyone), is just the reality that society is not comfortable with trans people existing. So people pick a battle over a nonissue, claiming they're doing it in the name of ""feminism"" so cis females have their rights protected, and it's such a gross mess. Especially with banning kids from playing sports with their friends, with the gender they align with. It's so unnecessary and like people just want us to be in a third category, cast away from everyone else, so we don't take up or invade their space. I've never been more passionate about trans rights than now because I can't imagine being a kid and growing up learning of anti-trans legislation and your whole identity being disputed. I know trans people have gained more rights and visibility, due to those before us fighting with everything they had, and there has been significant progress but the progress needs to continue. The Trevor Project did a study recently showing 85% of trans youth said their mental health was negatively affected due to the state laws discussing trans rights. Come on, people! Do better!
Thank you truly for making this post.

I felt like I was just going crazy looking at the front page of reddit today. Just saw this post on and could not believe the amount of upvoted, hateful, derogatory comments against a mod who had participated in an interview:[https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sd8g28/if\_the\_fox\_news\_interview\_has\_you\_concerned\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sd8g28/if_the_fox_news_interview_has_you_concerned_about/)

Why all the hate? Well, the mod had the audacity to be trans, autistic and not work 40 hours a week. The mod appearantly ""makes the movement look bad"". My god, anyone is allowed to be antiwork. You're not invalid because you don't work fulltime/any other reason. Then I saw that places like r/Cringetopia had picked up on the story, and it too had degrading comments about the interviewed person that had hundreds of upvotes: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/scx5ce/fox\_news\_interview\_with\_mod\_of\_rantiwork/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/scx5ce/fox_news_interview_with_mod_of_rantiwork/)

I kept scrolling, just looking for *one* comment that called out the hateful behaviour but found none. I'm very grateful I found your post here, makes me feel a little more sane.
And guess what's on the front page currently, a deliberate ""Be transphobic, you're free here!"" megathread ""shitpost"" because of hate is just shitposting with no real impact on real people /s

Can we have one goddamn day where our existence isn't a controversy? Like, one? It gets real tiring after a few years.
r/Cringetopia is also extremely transphobic and banned me for being trans
There's been a huge surge in transphobia after the r/antiwork debacle.

Much like Caitlyn Jenner, you can call someone an absolute piece of shit without resorting to transphobia.
i barely comment on r/memes so i haven't seen transphobia yet there but like some video memes subreddits i have.
[deleted]
Hm yeah ik what you mean I'm almost in no lgbtq subreddit. I looked in r/memes and sorted with controversial but I surprisingly only found one post about gays (not homophobic) and yeah there were some homophobic comments but way more that agreed with the post. I'm was really surprised by it maybe I was just lucky but yeah.
 Agreeded.
The whole r/antiwork drama escalated things to the point I don’t feel safe on Reddit anymore. I might look for alternatives.
Thank you so much!!

Am ftm and i just had scrolled through those subreddits with the rampant transohobia, and it honestly hurt me a lot inside since i only came out 5 months ago and i have anxiety anyways.

Your (and other people's too ofc) comment(s) made me feel so much better now. Tysm 😭😭😭

Oh yes lets focus on Memes and Jokes instead of real Transphobia .  
I do admit yes there are everywhere Transphobes etc and Transphobia is a real thing .  
But holy shit yall guys really got a huge stick up your arse if you cant take a joke/meme .  
Honestly nowadays you can hate on Straights and make memes about them en masse and no one bats an eye , make one joke about Transgender People or an Homosexual and you get immediatly canceled.  
And well yes there is much hate about Sports currently , but that is an hard mess to solve anyways when TransFemales are competing against cis Females which is obviously a good thing , but then get Points in the Number you usually get in the Male equivalent of that Sport.  
Honestly everyone no matter if youre part of LGBTQIA+ or not , all should learn to chill the fuck out and just laugh about themself thanks to a Meme and come together instead of canceling eachother like a bunch of pussies .
I mean if they’re a joke they’re a joke, attacks are attacks but drawing the line is tremendously difficult…
Especially again when they’re not attacks and merely jokes… not an easy subject. 
Furthermore trans women obliterate cis women in sports, this is not a joke or an attack this is a fact. The world isn’t black or white it’s very grey, sometimes it you who’s opinion needs to be adjusted to fit the world better… my two cents
I'm sure they care so much about women's sports they're also in favor more coverage and more equal pay for woman athletes, right? ...right?
You just called out so many people that pretend to care so they can be jerks to trans people.
Ol’ Dave “Team TERF” Chapelle did just ever so much to normalize transphobia and the attendant hate that feeds it.
I remember when I was completely harrassed for pointing out a meme was in fact 'punching down' on trans people
exactly. if it’s actually funny, and you aren’t meaning to offend anyone, then go ahead and make a joke. it’s when people make attack helicopter jokes and get annoyed at us asking them to stop
it sucks and its really hard to control because of how many posts we get. feel free to hit me up when u see posts like that
Usually they just lock the sub and prevent meaningful discussion.
Dank memes is worse imo. They’re part of so many posts in r/onejoke, it’s insane
Counterpoint:

You absolutely should *not* see r/teenagers
I'm too old to go there anyway
Yeah, I notice that trans women are usually the subject of easy to spot transphobia on reddit (go on any popular meme sub and all the ""trans jokes"" are about mocking women with different anatomy). Trans men can still be subjected to this kind of transphobia, but a lot of transphobes just don't realize that they exist and/or invalidate them by not acknowledging their presence. Terfs are aware of trans men, but their demonizing is still centered almost entirely on trans women. I am curious as to where OP is finding abundant FtM centered bigotry because we are usually just left out of the conversation/mockery entirely
Sorry sorry my mistake. I meant mtF. Ill fix that
if you take a look at my comment history, you'd see what a *great time* I've been having with that today....
I try telling people that Fox News does like a dozen stories a day where they interview untrained people and try to paint them as the face of some movement or another. They get forgotten about by the time they are done airing. That the real harm that Fox wanted to do was sow discord among the community. 

But I know they won't listen. Most of the users there aren't even antiwork, they just want someone to hear them bitch and moan while they engage proudly in all the things wrong with modern work culture.
>think of a better way to fight these toxic people

If only there was a way, it's disgusting to see this amount of disrespect towards Trans people. 

Whatever we do, they acknowledge it like ""attention seeking"" and what not, bullshit.. They don't even wanna listen when you wanna explain and stuff..
Can you explain the antiwork drama and how it’s correlating to trans people? I’m kinda confused about that.
You got some fat privilege there, do you know how stupid you sound or should we tell you?
Empathy: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
[removed]
i'll show you what humor is:

ratio + you're transphobic
Are you talking to yourself in the mirror, buddy?
Counterpoint, then instead of simply separating by gender, why not body type? Imo that’s more fair since some woman are bigger than others and have more muscle mass (The same for men too). Wouldnt that make it more fair then?
Asking a bit too much from the transphobes there
That's better way to say what I meant

If you do not want to offend someone, it doesn't make you really bad person

And if someone feel like that, say ""sorry, I didn't mean to"". If people would act like this, we would be perfect society

We aren't

Thank you. Glad to see the mods of r/memes are good people, unlike 1/4 of its users (geusstimatating)
Oh I didn't know that sorry
yes
count yourself lucky. it’s awful.
Ah I see.
The person interviewed by fox was a non binary individual. They looked like the stereotype, and Fox News picked them because of it. They also didn’t do the interview very well. It was a shame, because now there’s people on many different subreddits making fun of their identity, and using wrong pro nouns on purpose. Some of the subreddits are the big ones, and mods don’t care.
what do you mean privilege? the privilege of not having paper skin and caring more about real issues than mean jokes? sorry not sorry.
my empathy for overly-sensitive, sheltered, out-of-touch babies can only go so far. i understand what its like to be discriminated against. i understand what its like to have hurt feelings. best to stop caring what people say about you and being a miserable crybaby. tolerance begets tolerance. people have better things to do than bow to your feelings
And because you are referring to the r-word in that, I am reporting you. Again, insulting minorities including people who are neurodivergent shouldn’t be tolerated. You think I’m sensitive but in reality, you don’t know an ounce of respect because you’re a fucking edgelord on the internet.
mmm. not everyone will be happy but as long as your intentions are good then it’s fine
PLEASE get some sleep it’s not healthy
It’s ok! No need to apologise, I was just warning you. It can feel like a real gut punch to have to find that out yourself
Lela acorn
So if you barely care about what people think and their feelings, why are you even commenting here? You obviously care because you’re mad at trans people getting insulted over transphobic jokes. Also, isn’t it natural when people insult you, you call them out on it? From what I’m getting is that whenever we get insulted and punched down you just want us to roll over on our backs and let it happen because it’s “funny.” 

Humor is subjective and calling a trans woman a man is not funny at all- it’s just rude. These are the so-called “jokes” you are mentioning. If you think that’s funny, then you shouldn’t be allowed on this subreddit.
Well sure do that , but im prefer to be an fucking edgelord instead of being a soft bitch , that cries over fucking jokes .yall should rather fight against real transphobia , but i guess you need to see an fellow Transgender being butchered on an alleyway near your House(which sadly happend really in my town, since itsinfested with fucking NeoNazis) to understand that these Jokes are literally not worth getting mad at .Since im literally an Minor in terms of Disabillity i dont care if im ""nOt AlLoWeD"" to use the ""R-Word""  
EDIT:isnt it kinda almost ""Hatespeech"" aswell to literally call an whole SubReddit Transphobic ? when there are surely more than enough people that dont give a shit about Transgender or maybe are even Allies ? .
im commenting because all i ever see trans ppl do online is complain. im frustrated with the general state of the community. its pathetic. and no i dont want you to roll over and let it happen lol. i would prefer, if anything, for trans people to dish out offensive humor as well, rather than cry about every little insult thrown our way. 
also, maybe i just shouldnt attempt to connect with other trans ppl online.maybe i should avoid trans spaces altogether because clearly if i dont 100% agree with whatever stupid fucking hivemind the rest of the LGBT seems to be apart of, i shouldnt be allowed in LGBT spaces lol."	sd967q	trans	727	0.97	2022-01-26 15:57:03
Why is the detransitioning community transphobic as it is?	"Hello! I am a detrans woman, 20yo. I've just started detransitioning a few weeks ago after three years recognizing myself as a transgender man. 

I just quickly wanted to vent. It feels exhausting to read any articles or to see any videos covering detransition. Most detransitioners I see, either on reddit or anywhere else, follow an extremely transphobic rhetoric and it makes me feel so flipping lost. I feel like I have nowhere else to relate to. Admitting the best for me was detransitioning was hard enough as it is. I have absolutely no regrets over my transition, I'm actually so proud of it. My voice may be deep now and I know it'll be a struggle, but I've learned so much and lived so much I just couldn't possibly see my past identity as a bad thing. 

Thing is, I have no idea where to go from here. 

I stopped T and I have no idea what my side effects will be, and what I can do from now on. It feels like transitioning all over again. I want to voice train but I have no idea how. I really tried browsing through detrans subreddits but it felt hostile. Anyone have any idea why detransition spaces are becoming gradually more transphobic? 

I just wish I had any space I could, I don't know. Have more information about what to do from now on. Ways to talk about it. I just really wanted to vent about this, idk."	"I think people just don't like to admit that they're wrong. Rather than take accountability and say ""hey I made a mistake"" they'd rather push the blame onto the trans community for ""brainwashing"" them.
I hear r/actual_detrans may be okay.  For voice training go to r/transvoice.  You certainly don't need to but if ur willing can u share what made you think u r trans and what gave u clarity?  A lot of people on this sub struggle with their gender identity so it may be helpful to hear from someone who is cis but transitioned for a few years.  Congrats on being your authentic self
I am only going to voice my support for anyone on any gender questioning path.

It makes me sad that anyone would use their own story to invalidate another... Or worse, weaponize these stories. 

Peace, Love
I think the actual answer is that it's not. But the people you actually see are elevated by conservatives to spread anti-trans rhetoric
Because the ones showing up to testify against gender affirming care use the term and are always the same ones in every state. It profits them, they are getting paid big bucks by the hate groups. They are even paying them to speak at conferences. It profits them financially to stigmatize.
Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm glad you've recognized that transition was not for you and stopped rather than persisting. I believe some detrans people have a ""sunk cost"" way of viewing their transitions and push themselves further than they want to go before spiraling. 

As for why many detrans folks become transphobic, I believe it largely has to do with being unable to healthily process their regrets and so it feels to them like they were ""tricked"" by the trans community. I used to watch many detrans videos prior to transitioning (I wanted to see if anything they said resonated with me, it didn't) — and a very common story was that they believed transitioning would make them happy and socially accepted, because they saw many transgender people talking about how happy transition made them. I assume a lot become bitter because it didn't work the same for them, and then this twists trans people's happiness into some sort of ""selling fake happiness"" to them. A lot I've seen eventually swing to extreme religion or trans-exclusive radical feminism to console themselves. 

As for your own moving forward, if you are looking for resources to return gained masculinity to femininity — perhaps take a gander at resources meant for trans women? I assume with a deepened voice, effeminate voice training aimed for MtF women might help in your own case, and other tips in that community. Also talk to your doctor. It's not uncommon for cis women to take estrogen.
I think it's two reasons:

First, the detrans community has been co-opted by terfs to push their agenda. So some people in the ""detrans"" community were never really trans. They pretended for attention or are simply lying.

Second, detransitioners might experience cognitive dissonance about what they see as a mistake.  And since they're flooded with the same anti-trans media as everyone else they easily accept the rhetoric that they were tricked by the ""trans agenda"" or whatever.  Instead of just accepting that they made the choice and it didn't end up being right for them. It's like if there was a tattoo removal community and it was just people screaming about the ""tattooed agenda"" to force everyone to get tattoos they'll definitely regret.

The media landscape we're all in is telling everyone that trans people are forcing being trans on everyone and infecting them with transness, which tells detransitioners that the mistake they think they made isn't their fault.  And it's nice to hear that something you did that you maybe regret or wasn't right for you wasn't your fault. It feels nice to be able to cleanly shift the blame to someone else. So it makes sense that a lot of detransitioners are doing it too.

I support detransitioners. I think that introspection is good, and if you want to change your identity or realize your identity is different than you thought you should do that at any time.  Whether that's realizing you are happy being cis, transitioning, or realizing you aren't trans and detransitioning.  It's all your choice and all those choices should be available to everyone.

If I were you I would join transfem voice training groups since they're also feminizing their voices.  I hope the detrans group people here recommended is better than the other ones. Good luck! I hope it goes smoothly for you!
Go hang in the mtf spaces! We all went through testosterone, I bet we can help each other
As someone trying to make a deeper voice sound more femme, I would check out trans voice lessons on YouTube! Also, I’m lucky enough to have a really great voice coach that was in-network for me- try looking up trans resources in your state, maybe there’s some voice therapy places!

Aside from that, I don’t have much to offer. But I wanted to thank you for being willing to be vulnerable and share your story. I’m really glad that you seem to haven gotten some really valuable insight and self-discovery from your journey, and I’m really happy for you! Good luck!
Idk. I guess because people like to weaponize it against trans people because if there are detransitioners clearly trans people are faking. 🙄 good luck with your journey!
Most detransitioners are in your boat. Unfortunately trans people are currently being heavily politicized and the ones against us are, you know, invested in making us seem illegitimate. So anything you're going to see on detransitioning is going to be politics because they're amplifying that side. So any discussion of detransitioning is highly likely to be full of transphobic people.

I'm really sorry, I wish I had some resources for you. I hope that at least explains why you're seeing what you're seeing. And I hope you find some good resources. Just wish I had more than well wishes.
I'm really happy for you that you've found what's right for you! As hard as it is to transition, I can only imagine what it's like to detransition. I wish you the best, and I hope you find a welcoming space. 😊
r/actual_detrans is the best subreddit for actual detransitioners, you will find support there, but it is small.

r/transvoice can be used for feminine voice training. I also recommend checking out transvoicelessons on YouTube, transfeminine voice training will work for you.

I’m happy for you that you are doing what you feel is best for yourself, it is your journey and no one else’s place to tell you what’s right except yourself. Sometimes it’s hard to be honest with yourself, so you deserve to be proud of who you are. Good luck going forward!
Its a tough issue. Because legit being detrans must be very hard and you might have major regrets.

In a lot of cases this groups fustrations are weaponised by anti trans people against trans people.

Furthermore while I think awareness and support for detrans people is extremely important, this should not go at the cost of the basic human rights of trans people
Unfortunately there is too much fear based information circulating. There is nothing wrong with the way you feel, it is your body.
I think most of them aren't. 

And the ones who are, are just I. It for the grift.
There’s a drag queen on RuPauls Drag Race who is called Akeria Davenport and she openly talks about her detransition but is very pro trans
I just hate detrans ppl who gate keep trans folks from hrt or try to get trans folks who r on hrt to stop hrt. Like yeah it might not work out for u, but hrt may save a trans persons life. 



Like i was arguing with 1 the other day and like hrt has saved my life in many ways and there is no study out there that will change the way i feel about myself and happy i feel about myself. (Like im 6 months hrt and the gender euphoria has ended and like im just overall happier compared to pre hrt) but like They kept sending me biased studies and some dumb documentary. At the end of the day hrt did more than any counseling and anti depressants ever did.
I know 2 detransitioner in real life, both thought they were trans men like you.

&#x200B;

One is still idenitifying as trans, they are saying, because of gatekeeping therapist they would be pushed to hard, and went further as they wanted, because they are only non-binary and that would not be allowed. 

&#x200B;

The other is living as a woman, she never was trans but got into depressions because her parents treated her brothers better then her and she thought it would be better to be a man. In the fight against the gatekeepy therapists she found strength and so she transitioned, even as she never felt well with it, but fighting against therapists and insurances and the legal system gave a thing to do, to fight, to come out of the depression.

&#x200B;

As soon as she changed envoirment she recognised, that her transition was not right, and that a good therapist, that not wanted her to fight for her to be a man would recognize her depression and worked with her on that, and she would never transition.

&#x200B;

Both people are still wonderful allys of the trans community, are both for less gatekeepy therapy, because they both got there exactly because of this, and are for self-id and other trans rights. They see the issue in the system and they see, that we are who we are.
I think the transphobic part is a very loud minority propped up by right wing media.
I think many detransitioners aren't transphobic. It's just that many of the most prominent detransitioners are propped up as political transphobic martyrs. Also the detrans subreddit is extremely toxic, seeming to focus solely on negative things and anger at trans people.

I know several detrans people who are super trans inclusive and I think more are trans friendly than transphobic, it's just the few give them a bad name. Also because of that I think sometimes they can be met with some suspicion from the trans community at times, I've seen it. Not often but it does happen.

Its really complicated but I think it's important to remember not everyone is of the same mind as others with their identity and we should treat individuals with compassion until the give us a reason not to
They usually aren't, most are cool and many retransition later. However theirs a minority who can gain personal power by leaning into the issue.

This youtube vid and some of her other videos describing her experiences transitioning and then detransitioning I thought were insightful and not malicious or ideologically motivated. You might relate in some ways? Hope this helps.
I just wanted to chime in and tell you you aren’t alone. I have a friend who is non-binary but their journey to get to that identity took seven years of off and on HRT, identifying as a transman and then cis and back again as they struggled hardcore with their identity and their personal situation. They went through all of that to find their authentic self, which is non-binary. I don’t see people who detransition or identify differently throughout their transition as a bad thing. Gender is weird and stupid and frustrating and beautiful and important. It takes time to find who you are and I’m glad you’re on the right path for you. The only bad thing about detrans people are the people who turn around and are horribly transphobic about it. You sound like a lovely person and I wish you all the best
I think a lot of detrans folks feel manipulated and exploited by doctors and society at large which leads to a lot of anger. I'm not saying that makes what they do right though.

If you don't mind I'd love to chat with you in DMs. I'm just about to start my medical transition and I've been looking to chat to a detrans person to get a balanced view on things. There's absolutely no pressure though! 💓
I do genuinely believe that a lot of people who have claimed to detransitioned simply never transitioned in the first place and just want to spread hatred and see it as an easy option to do so.
Thank you so much for sharing your concerns and your story. I agree with you that some de-transitioners are toxic and transphobic. On the other end, i feel like the trans community can be hostile towards people like you, who are detrans but not defensive about it due to the toxic ones. I am happy for you discovering your true self, and i hope you live a safer, happier life!
Transphobia is abundant. Especially online. One thing I think would be helpful are spaces like this one. Now that you've transitioned, you'd essentially be transitioning again, so subreddits like MtF would be loaded with info that could help with your journey back. Keep in mind that many of us are here with you. My inbox welcomes all, feel free to drop me a message if you need advice or just an ear ❤
I actually think it just seems that way because of the way the media portrays transition. 

If someone detransitions and they say it’s because they were brainwashed into a radical gender cult that preys on children, they’re more likely to get media coverage and social media attention than a detransitioner who just says that gender is complex and you can get it wrong. I’ve seen plenty of respectful and trans positive detransitioners on social media, they just don’t really generate controversy and thus don’t get much traction.

I think this is mainly because detransitioners get used by transphobic people to justify their bigotry, so whenever they don’t fit the narrative, cis people stop listening.
don't go to r/detrans where most people are not actually detransitoned, go to r/actual_detrans
It's because they're not willing to say they were wrong/ made a mistake so push the blame onto the trans community
It sounds weird but I found mtf sites very comforting when I first started detransing. 

I ended up socialised in my teens as a ftm boy so I had to unlearn that and as such related to mtf women unlearning their masculinity. 

Detrans community is full of grifters tho.
I wish everyone was like you
I like to think of detransitioning as being double trans. I’m sure you can stick around here if you’re comfortable with it 

Good luck with your second transition, I hope it’s everything you want 💕
I think the reason there’s lots of transphobia coming from the detrans community is because they either have new founded political and religious beliefs, think they were pushed to be trans so they are bitter because they have lost a part of there life or have pushed away non accepting family and friends or have permanent affects/features. Then in general most people don’t like to admit they were wrong especially if they were so sure they were trans.
Personally I think they're intentionally picked up by far right people. Detransitioning must feel very lonely and uncomfortable so providing support to them while simultaneously filling heads with hateful rhetoric and making them blame people who would have been supporting them for the right reasons...
I think a lot of the transphobia comes from their misunderstanding that people and their transitions are unique to every person, and that transitioning is not for everyone.Thus their own experience invalidates every other person's transition cuz it wasn't right for the detransitioner. 

It can also be that they don't want to be responsible for their own mistake and so they place all that responsibility on medical staff who are only barely responsible for that person's transition. which would be really easy when you are mad or upset that something bad happened to you.
The detransitioners that im seeing help craft laws and speak against the trans community often are sus. I dont like questioning if someone legitimately was trans but like Scott Newgent their transition story just doesn’t add up as living as an AFAB and having children and then transitioning to a man only 4-5 years ago. He is helping with the Ohio anti trans youth bill. I truely think this person is just a scammer. 

Another man speaks at churches ( I cannot remember his name) against trans people and uses their short experience as a Trans woman… the only example they have of their presenting is a recent photo of them in a car with a wig and lipstick. 

So I do think there are some that really have internalized transphobia in some trans people that think they’re doing the right thing, but I also think churches and people are making up lives to justify their bigotry.
A lot of detransition stuff is promoted by anti trans crowds to further their bigoted goals. I usually see the same handful making the rounds. I'm sure there are plenty of detransitioner who aren't that way, though. You don't seem to be one of them. As for detransitioning help, you might consider looking into trans femme communities for tips. As long as you make clear you're not there to harass people (this post makes it clear to me you aren't like that, btw), you should be able to find some help. Think of it like having a head start toward MTF transition.  

Stay safe out there, ok? 🫂
I think possibly mtf communities could be helpful. Definitely a different experience but I think we may have some challenges in common. Congrats on living your truth. happy for you 💕
I don’t care what people do with there bodies has long as it’s not unnecessarily harmful
A lot of ""transphobic"" comments are not transphobic. One person's experience is not everyone's
sorry for the question, what made you think at first that you were a trans guy?
To a hater, you’re never forgiven.
I guess maybe you could go to trans fem communities to learn from them? It would probably be more constructive that way and in a way you kinda have the same goals
Honestly, I think that there are just a lot of people out there who will give detransitioners the support they need on the right. Most trans people are scared of detransitioners and their unique ability to throw sand in our fears, but the Christian right is super excited for any opportunity. The result is that many detransitioners are jumping into the arms of the anti-trans movement. It's sad but maybe predictable.
You were discovering who you were and if that lead you to being your original gender then great! You’ve learned a lot and I hope you keep learning about yourself.
a reason, maybe not the main reason, but definitely a reason, is that trans people seem to hate detransitioners for detransitioning, probably because they believe it justifies some transphobic talking points, idfk, and the hate from here pushes them to the only other people who seem to want to happily give them a place to be: radfems. Radical feminism, or TERFism, is the pipeline not only into intense transphobia but also white supremacy and nazism, and it is an insanely manipulative form of hate because recruition into it works by exploiting any pain and trauma, and then feeding you their bullshit bitewise. 

I'm not saying ""trans people are the reason the detransitioner community often is transphobic"", but I am saying that maybe if the people here would be a little fucking nicer to people who are not the standard uwu ""oh I'm trans I was always trans, I always will be trans, and I have dysphoria/euphoria"", maybe some of the people who realised they weren't trans at all wouldn't have flocked away to a hate group that specialises in recruiting people by exploiting trauma. 

A little kindness and less ""are detransitioners bad"" discourse bait posts would go a long way.
Hey friend. I’m sorry you’re going through this and I offer my support. If you would like to voice train I would recommend where many of us MtF’s start. Vocal feminization. 

YouTube Zoey Alexandria or TransVoiceLessons. These can give you the tools to feminize your voice.
I believe a lot of detrans folks did so begrudging. Maybe they never got the support they needed or suffered transphobia and hatefulness from everyone in their life and just couldn’t continue. Now they’re feeling jealous of those of us who didn’t de transition and are somewhat successful and happy. Built up walls and joined up with the terfs and others who now “admire” them for de transitioning. Finally, they’ve found their “Tribe”. A group of people they CAN feel support and inclusion. Eh, but what do I know?!? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Given that many of the people who decide to detrans are doing so in response to social pressure, including safety concerns, and a lack of money, I think it's likely quite a few feel they need to fit into their transphobic communities.
And there are many far right people willing to applaud and *pay* detrans who are willing to chant transphobic talking points.
Just some thoughts.
maybe try getting help from the transfem community?
My response is pretty long, so I just want to start by saying that you are valid and sound like a wonderful person. If you need a friend, I'm glad to chat.

>Most detransitioners I see, either on reddit or anywhere else, follow an extremely transphobic rhetoric 

I think you're probably seeing a mixture of people with a political agenda, detrans people who are bitter, and others who just want to justify their transphobia. There are so many people who have detransitioned who still affirm trans people. 

> Admitting the best for me was detransitioning was hard enough as it is. 

I feel that. I sometimes wonder what people would say if I detransitioned (""but we went through all that effort learning a new name and pronouns for you!""), but honestly you just have to do what's right for you.

> I have absolutely no regrets over my transition, I'm actually so proud of it.  I've learned so much and lived so much I just couldn't possibly see my past identity as a bad thing.

It's not. 💜 Learning is a great thing, and as someone else wrote, detransitioning isn't admitting that you were wrong about transitioning in the first place, it's just aligning yourself to the most up to date version of your self image. 

>I stopped T and I have no idea what my side effects will be, and what I can do from now on. It feels like transitioning all over again. I want to voice train but I have no idea how. 

Others have said, but /r/MTF is a lovely place with wonderful people, and they can help you get back to a place of femininity. Or if you feel like you want to identify as non-binary, you definitely can, and you can focus on the balance of feminine & masculine traits that you like.

.

Before I went very far in my own transition, I started reading everything that I could. One thing I wish for anyone transitioning is for them to educate themselves about it. So many people say ""I didn't know that society / HRT / surgery would be that way!""

 As a Christian, I found resources that affirmed the LGBTQ community. In the years that I'd wanted to transition, I kept coming up with reasons and excuses for why I thought the things that I did to explain away (or ""fix"") the trans desires. So I looked deeper into my reasoning as well as responses to others online with similar thoughts and realized my fears were fairly unfounded. 

Once I was getting closer to being convinced that this was the path for me, I wanted to be absolutely sure. I talked to a therapist with experience talking to trans people, and she felt I was going the right direction. I read through so much dialog regarding detransitioning, with the expectation that if there was something in there that resonated with me, it might help me figure out something before I wasted time or made a mistake. <-- I see now, half a year later, that this was a somewhat flawed way of thinking: transitioning is neither a mistake nor a waste of time, as even if you detransition, you come away with knowledge and a perspective that you didn't have. The only valid concern, then, in my case was that of infertility. I think reading about detransitioning and anecdotes from those who have can be useful, but probably not in the same way I was thinking originally, and had I not been so scared, I could have started things so much sooner.

After absorbing myself in the detrans community for a while, my heart went out to them, but it didn't resonate with me, so I finally pushed forward. I've only been on hormones for  ~4.5 months, but I've legally changed my name & gender and I'm so much happier at the moment. If I end up in a place where I feel that being trans no longer feels right, I hope I remember this day and give myself grace. 

.

While I did all of my research on everything trans, I tried to take detailed notes and save sources in case it was useful. Below are some of my notes. I'm using people's current pronouns, which may be their original set or their new pronouns depending on how they currently identify.

* A large majority of the people were glad they went through with transition even after going back. They learned a lot about themselves that they otherwise wouldn't have learned, and many people felt more comfortable in their bodies afterward, even if they had been altered from their original state
* Many felt that neither end of the binary spectrum fit, and now identify as non-binary
* Some people, especially individuals born as girls, became trans men as a result of assault, and they wanted to escape their feminine bodies and identities. Some of those who got counseling went back, but some still felt more comfortable staying with their new gender identity.
* One boy transitioned into womanhood because he thought he was ugly and hated men as a result of a lot of harmful stereotypes about men, especially enforced in his own family. Eventually, he found that he could accept himself as is, though he still doesn't identify as masculine or heterosexual.
* A 14 year old girl socially transitioned to live as a boy to get away from being picked on, but it happened anyway. Now 30, she's living as a woman again, and looks for happiness where she can find it.
* Several people who have detransitioned still support the trans community, but describe it as not being something that ended up fitting their lives.
* One person who transitioned male to female did so because of heteronormative expectations, and he felt he didn't fit in as a masculine straight boy, so he started his transition. After a year on hormones, he didn't like the changes and went back to being a male, but this time on his own terms. 
*There's a thread of people on both sides who questioned their gender identity as a result of interests and gender role expectations (a guy who likes skirts, different women interested in wood working, auto mechanic work, etc). 
* There's a masculine dude who likes lingerie and dresses.
* One guy didn't feel comfortable as a man, but one day got a test to check testosterone levels and found that they were really low.  Taking T made him feel more himself.

There's an app called voice up that may help you achieve the higher voice, but you could also go the surgical route and get a glottoplasty if you want to recover a natural speaking higher pitch. They usually use a laser to tighten the vocal cords via scarification. I'll need to have it done myself as I'm transitioning and my voice is fairly deep.

With regards to the anti-trans sentiment, i believe narcissists sometimes think they'll get the attention they seek by joining the trans community, then when they realise it's hard and emotionally difficult, rather than own up to their mistakes, it's easier to gaslight the community they tried to join in the first place.

It's a shame because most real trans folk would be just as supportive of someone who started transitioning and realised it wasn't what they wanted anymore. We all collectively hate being stuck in the wrong body. If anything de-trans people have more in common with trans people than cis people who are transitioning mistakenly do before coming to that realisation.

I wish you the best of luck in whatever your future holds 💕
The term Detrans has been taken over by some vicious anti trans people. Very many people have decided to stop taking hormones, prefer to live in the in between, or simply their identity evolved. I wish there were a better word (retrans?) for this. It doesn’t need to be thought of as an error just what right to do at this time. Bravo for you for doing your best to do what’s right for you. I’m sorry that the detrans people have taken away a support.
100% ☝️
You know the types, too.  They do something jerkish, and you can see it in their eyes, they KNOW what they did was wrong, and you call them on it, and instead of a simple ""sorry"" it's an excuse, like ""I didn't see that* or ""well you shouldn't have left it there"" and it's like, holy hell, I just realized I've known you for 5 years, your're kind of an asshole, and I've never heard you say sorry once...

THOSE are the shitty detrans.  Probably.
This plus a not small number of them also being terf trolls just posing as detrans to create ""proof"" for their shitty narrative.
Yes. It's much easier to buy into a conspiracy than feel dumb or admit you made a mistake. 

Especially when transphobes are already actively building said conspiracy, and recruiting any detransitioners they find to give it credence.
Accurate af unfortunately 🫠 Like own up to your decisions for God’s sake.
Yes. It's much easier to buy into a conspiracy than feel dumb or admit you made a mistake. 

Especially when transphobes are already actively building said conspiracy, and recruiting any detransitioners they find to give it credence.
I think its a bit hurtful to call out someone as ""wrong"" when we spend our lives telling them that at every moment of their life they can feel however they want and be ""correct"" in that.  If life is fluid, feelings are fluid, gender is fluid, then thus person didn't ""make a mistake"" they just changed.

Is there really no truth to that claim?
There’s no denying the past few years have been the gayest...😄 I mean people claiming some new identity. 
And the majority of youth are learning about lgbt and neo-pronouns from TiKTok. They’re parents are told they’re children are going to die. What’s the advantage of being able to list more than forty genders but you can’t multiply forty by five. People wouldn’t have the impression of being brainwashed if the community didn’t spend the past few years forcing “theyselves” into every movie,tvshow,radio,book, even remakes. All the corporations that we all used acknowledge as corrupt or harmful sport their rainbow flag when it’s financially lucrative. There’s also money to be made by the “Dr” who performs the procedures. It’s all very shady and I don’t accept that it’s just ignorance/contempt/disgust/fear why the majority is skeptical.
Thank you so much! The actual_detrans subreddit does look a whole lot better!
And, yes absolutely! But first let me put out a warning of SA and misogyny — my story could easily be used to create more transphobic rhetorics and fuel the arguments TERFs make and I always try to emphasize that my story is my own and I will never let anyone use it to make less of other trans people.

Long story short, I was a pretty timid kid that grew up in the midst of a lot of friends of which were boys. But as a girl growing up, I was never really taken seriously. I have always tried to be as manly as possible to feel like my opinions mattered. I was very tomboy and I loved it. I also loved being conventionally feminine whenever I could. I loved both sides of the spectrum and all of the in-between. I first thought I was trans when I was 13, but then noticed that it wasn't for me. Through my teenage years, I went through a lot of abuse and SA and I started associating my femininity with the violence I went through. Since I loved being manly and feeling safe, I thought it was the right path for me. 

I imagine a person who truly is transgender feels this innate knowledge of their own identity. They just know who they are, no questions asked. 

That wasn't my case. I felt more comfortable as a man because then, I could leave my fear of experiencing womanhood aside. What gave me clarity was, after nearly 2 years of HRT, realizing I just missed who I was way too much, I missed womanhood. It feels innate to me that I am a woman. But it is because of these past three years that I began to see who I was through new lenses. I am only strong now because of these last few years. I am infinitely grateful for all I went through whilst identifying as trans. Recognizing I'm not trans was harsh, but I'm going to be okay. Detransitioning is especially rare, most trans people succeed which is great! It feels a bit lonely now but I will try my best to get through ♥️
Wow this is all amazing. Sounds like a lot of folks really are more comfortable in a non binary identity and that makes sense to me.
Hell yeah. They changed, or their understanding of themselves changed.

While you aren't wrong in your assessment, people who detransition (or people in their community) might see the detransition process as an admission of being wrong, as opposed to just changing their minds.
?? 

I'm not sure what you're saying makes sense here. I don't think OP or I are talking about Twitter or Reddit bots we're talking about actual people who give actual interviews and write actual articles and very much exist.
yea on a few of my posts on here have gotten comments that id deem as manipulative. even got a few DMs telling me that id likely detransition, or that i should watch “what is a woman” like man let me be me jfc
You would make a powerful ally for sure. Not only do you understand intricacies around being trans, including understanding your innate sense of gender identity, but you understand the process, and how difficult it is.

I’m so sorry for what you’ve been through, and I hope life serves you well in the future. I’m not sure how low your voice dropped but I’m sure transfem spaces would be happy to assist you.
>They just know who they are, no questions asked.

Oh, hell no we don't! But I understand why it can seem that way. That certainty that everyone talks about... it doesn't come easily. That's part of what kept me solidly in my egg for 39 years. I thought I couldn't be trans, because I didn't feel this overwhelming certainty that I was truly a woman inside. I wasn't a six-year-old throwing a tantrum because my parents wouldn't let me wear a dress - but that's what was always in the news.

Even if, somehow and someday, I discover that I'm not trans, I expect that I won't regret having *tried*. It's part of discovering who you are, and I imagine you're more confident in your identity now than any cis woman who never questioned.
Thank you so much for sharing your own journey and being such an ally to the trans community. Truly wish you the best as you de transition and continue to live your life.
Thank you for taking the time to share this with the community. It sounds like this was a transformative experience for you even if you didn't end up sticking with your trans gender. It's really good to hear that you feel more whole because of your combined experience with both.

These aren't the typical things we hear about/from people who detransition so I'm happy to see that you've still found meaning in your experiences and are still an ally to the community. I hope that you continue to feel welcome in trans spaces.
> feels this innate knowledge of their own identity. They just know who they are

Yep.

> no questions asked

Frickin hell I wish.

Seriously tho, your story is amazing and puts an end to this ""What If..."" Episode. Have fun re-re-discovering your identity, and good luck!
Wow. This is so different from my attempt to detransition (out of fear) a couple years ago. And yet, similar in the misogyny. 

Thank you for sharing your experience. I definitely learned from mine that I was without a doubt trans whether I liked it or not.
Everything you wrote here sounds like you did succeed, it’s just that where your road has taken you is a different place than you expected. 

Also hey, you know what? Someone posted in the Nonbinary sub about them getting comfortable with the idea of them being Nonbinary and then their friend said something about ‘how do you know it’s not internalized misogyny something something’, and if you’re in the mood to chat and feel like reaching out, they might find your perspective helpful. 

No obligation, ftr.
I think you used being trans as a way to protect yourself and I honestly don't see anything wrong with that. When it comes to our very femininity being what can hurt us or get us hurt, I can see wanting to get as far away from that as possible. When it comes to repeated SA or multiple offenders, trying to find a way to be safe is normal. 

I think that, as you grew older, you discovered it was a way to protect urself rather than your identity, you wanted to just be who you identify as and that's ok too. Growing up is about discovering who we are. 

To be honest, if it were safer to transition, we may find more young adults such as yourself. If more kids were allowed to safely transition, then more kids would feel safer about detransitioning as well. A safe community would begin to grow and more kids would have a chance (adults too, for that matter) to be their true selves. 

I may not be trans, but I was a victim, I am a survivor. Finding healthy ways to keep yourself safe and healthy coping mechanisms is an important part of growing up and staying safe. You didn't get overweight to keep yourself safe, you didn't c*t to cope, you did the best you could. 

Remember that. You did the best you could and thats always ok.
I’m a trans man who went through a lot of SA. I understand how it can influence gender, it had the exact opposite effect on me where it made it harder for me to recognize my dysphoria and repress my gender identity. I wish you healing and happiness. You’re not alone.
Thank you so much for sharing your story. It truly helped me understand a real detransitioner's reasoning instead of the tropes that are thrown around. Best wishes! 💕
I don't think that there's anything wrong with your story, you were a hurt child. As you said you blamed the things happening on your womanhood, you're not wrong for doing that either, being a woman is hard. (I started having men put me in uncomfortable positions just 6 months into my transition).
And you possibly found the trans Community when you were young as well, and this community must somehow made you feel safe as well. Both as a community where you define your own gender, but also as a space where the different genders are respected equally.
Your inner child didn't heal from the things you experienced, you must somehow made peace with yourself too. 
I do advocate for help to children that experience gender dysphoria. A story like yours, is a notion to why we still have a debate whether informed consent or psychiatric evaluation is best for the individual.
I just want to hug you. I’m sorry for your rough years and I hope there’s many great years ahead for you.
I'd say it is a bit less knowing who I am and more of that missing what I could be. (Akin to missing what you were.) 

Kinda like dreaming sompthing horrific would happen to me when I was younger (I had a few but I'll go with the classic) I would get breast cancer and have to have my breasts removed. (I now know that this is not even the same surgery as top surgery btw it's similar, but not the same) 

I would kinds wish for it? But I'd not want it all at, all at once becouse in my parents eyes 

""You just gotta love yourself"" and ""why would they want to mutilate themselves like that"" (I had a friend transitioning) 

So I deff just got depressed wishing for sompthing magic to happen, I don't know if I can miss what I did not have but that is a close description to : longing, wanting sompthing, hoping for sompthing in dreams.
Thanks! I'm semi-passionate about the subject, because I've seen (and been on the receiving end) hate directed at people who bring up detransitioning and I don't think that's healthy. Whether it's a cis person who says ""I told you so"" or uses that to claim trans people don't exist, or it's a trans person who doesn't like thinking of detrans as a concept because it's scary...

I think that people considering transitioning skills learn what that means, along with getting the resources they need to make it happen, but also those who find that it wasn't right for them should be given resources to help them detransition or change to what fits best. 

Also, I see the collective intelligence about gender and sexuality continuing to grow, as we understand that there's not so much polarity as there is spectrum when it comes to much of everything in life, so I'm really happy that non-binary and pansexuality are things that exist.
Anyone who mentions that Matt Walsh drivel as an even neutral recommendation should be immediately disregarded. I sat through that whole thing because I’m a political masochist, and my god, it’s not even really *pretending* to take things in good faith. It’s barely pretending to pretend that what it’s doing is something other than crusading against people who they think it’s good to hate.
>Oh, hell no we don't!

Seconding this from the other side of the aisle (FtM). I legit thought I was like, a late bloomer. That one day,I'd get the clothes and hair and makeup just right and poof! I'd be the woman I never felt I was. One day,one day being a woman will feel right... right? Waiting to understand when I'm older kept me in my egg 37 years. 

>Even if, somehow and someday, I discover that I'm not trans, I expect that I won't regret having tried. It's part of discovering who you are, and I imagine you're more confident in your identity now than any cis woman who never questioned.

This. So much this. 😊
This is why I personally am coming out as non binary. I feel like I have feminine and masculine traits but never felt at home with either binary The thing is I have ignored my fem side.  I ignored the social dysphoria of being called “sir”, “man”, and “male”. Never felt like me. 

I am also coming out at 39/40. It wasn’t obvious growing up. We had no non binary terms. It was putting together a million little pieces to figure it out.
Lmao thanks for this. I was freaking out thinking I can’t be trans because I don’t know what the fuck I am. Like I want to be a woman but it’s not like I had an innate knowledge that I am one.
I really like your compassionate take and approach. In some reputable research I’ve read, most people who REGRET transition do so due to  changes in interpersonal relationships like friends and family rejection or experiences of transphobia. This is telling to me. Also I would love to see a study on who just found they didn’t really NEED the transition and were they finding that they are happier as a non binary person after aiming for a binary transition.
Omg I found someone else!!!! Yes I also thought I'd find the right clothing and poof!. .... that did happen but it was a costume for cosplay lmao 🤣
Hey, I identify with this 100 %. I don't want to be a man all the time but I don't want to be a woman all the time either... Why can't I just be me?  

Could we talk? It would be nice to talk to someone who feels the same way.
I wish I knew what I was, I think that I might be demi girl but I have no clue
Totally understand this feel similarly.

I can survive most things blending in well enough when I need to, even if I feel a disconnect between my exterior and interior lives. But when I get told to do something because ""you're a man"", my skin crawls. Same as when I'm playing cards or diverging with friends or family and there's teams involved, why does someone always have to call for a battle of the sexes. I hate it. It feels awful and gross for me. As I put I to a friend of mine once, if it is a 1-9 scale with 9 being hyper feminine feeling and 1 being hyper masculine feeling,  I'm probably like 7 on most days, but sometimes a 4 and sometimes a 9. 9s are the days I'm internally screaming and nauseous, being pretty certain I should take the plunge. 4s are days I haven't shaved and yet some feel disgusted at myself. 4s have been increasingly rare through. Usually I'm shaved, less traditionally masculinly attired and simultaneously plotting deeper game strategies and wondering how much makeup I could wear without too many people giving me side eye, while thinking and major changes are terrifying and thinking if I was AFAB, I'd quite possibly just be very tomboy or an AFAB enby anyway. I always feel like I'm not totally fem, but maybe all my cis female friends really buck gender norms at times anyway. 

But being late 30s with it is a heavy thing. I'm there with you,  friend. Sometimes, I envy the youth for being able to be themselves 20 years younger than I could even fathom it. But it's okay, us ""old folks"" will sort it out too. I just renewed my license and it's officially going to have an X for gender when I get the card now. That was a step that felt good. It's a step towards better finding me. I wish you luck in yours too.
I never thought I *was* a woman, back in my egg days. I knew what I had down between my legs. I, too, thought I just really wanted to be. But it was a longing with... energy to it. I felt like whatever cosmic bureaucracy was responsible for distributing human bodies had fucked up. Negligence, and I had to just deal with the consequences.
Yeah, I read some stuff that suggested that of the tiny percentage of people who detransitioned, most of those went back and transitioned again or identified as non-binary when factors / situations changed or improved. There was only a miniscule fraction of detransitioners that decided that transitioning wasn't right for them, and they went back to being their AGAB.
🤩 Ahhhh! So much same here!!!  What/who is your cosplay of? I dream about being Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier... and Jayne Cobb from Firefly.
Sure. Of course. My private messages are open to all sane non scammers. :)
The only thing I would let you know is that some of us feel so much dysphoria about looking at our face to even shave. So as disgusted as I am about the facial hair, my fear of the mirror wins out. Or I just shave without looking at the mirror. My eyes literally twitch sometimes looking at myself shaving.
I get that. I routinely curse my existence and wonder why I wasn’t born a girl. What cosmic joke am i apart of and why did it have to be me.
It's was Gaara from Naruto. Put on the binder and felt like I was floating. Short hair for the first time. 

To bad I'd not relize it tell about 10 years later.
What about insane people trying to scam for some Hella cute dresses
I usually shave without looking.
What?
It was just a bad joke

Edit because dresses are not cheap
Okay. I am down to talk about clothing too or lack thereof. LOL. Either way, as long as someone isn’t selling anything."	11bws8b	trans	724	0.97	2023-02-25 21:49:18

Makes me want to cry. This is so sweet.

Is that your old wedding band on the necklace? That’s super cute 🥺 I’m so happy for the both of you 💙💙💙
So cute! It makes me so happy to see other girls with supportive wives. I'm lucky to have an amazing wife too. :-)
Damn girl
I have no idea which one is you lol
Such cutieeess :3
I can’t even see ur dog 😭 this is a sad day for all of us... but still ur a cute couple but it would’ve been cuter with a puppy
Aww so wholesome! My wife is the same and it’s just the best feeling ever!
God this makes me happy. I’m pre-everything and just…hope my wife accepts it. I’m scared to all living hell, but this story gives me hope. You two are adorable
Yay! More animal parents! Please give your dogs hugs from us and our two pups <3
Stay blessed, you two!
When's it gonna be my turn on the wife
It's beautiful right!  
I am so happy and so lucky to have my beautiful wife <3
It's possible!  
So many people think it's normal to break up with their SO when they come out as trans.  
It's certainly common but it's not like it's mandatory.  
If your SO really loves you, it shouldn't matter how you dress, talk, present, or what your name or pronouns are!
Goalsssss 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Aww no please don't cry! 💜  


Have this hug 🤗
I thought so! <3
Yes they do!  
And they are amazing!  
If you're really in love and really respect each other there's really very little that can break that :)
Ooh that's a cute idea! My original band has been sitting in a drawer for years now because I lost weight and switched to a silicone one for work. I'd love to give it new life as a necklace.
It is!  
My wife said I could get it reforged if I wanted, but I've always worn it around my neck because my fingers do not like wearing rings at all!  
They get all itchy, blistery, etc... it's not nice.  
Around the neck is much better!
That's awesome! Good on you <3
haha 😅
The one closest to the camera haha ❤️
hehe <3   
I dunno about me but yes Lys certainly is a beautiful girl huh :)
Haha getting THIS photo was hard enough!  
But if you wanna see the dog, here he is:

Yes he is as stupid as he looks hahahaha  
But a massive cutey and an absolute sweetheart
Feel free to PM me if you need some help.  
I remember being scared as well.  
It helps to talk it through. :)
There's a Zoom-based support group which might help; PM me.  Many Aussies and US participants.

Skye: You and your wife are such a cute couple!
Thank you <3
Ik the feeling my fiancé is amazing!!
It is possible, I know. I would love nothing more. I'm just not confident my story will have a similar chapter. I love my wife and she loves me, but this is a big change after 12 years.
I haven't broken up with my girlfriend but I am struggling with it all and have been getting ghosted by her and im not sure what to do or say to get her to talk to me I thought i was being supportive but I guess not any tips to help me get past this ? Do I break up with her ? Do I give her space ?
Best wishes to you my friend <3
You two are just so goddamn adorable!
It's awesome, I don't even notice it's there!  
I just don't like wearing rings haha, not to mention my finger gets all gross if the ring is on there!
💓💓
Give them a biiiiig hug for me <3
I have also been with my wife for 12 years.  
I am so sorry you think that it will destroy your relationship.  
The hardest part about being trans was telling my wife.  
She was a bit broken for a few weeks after I told her but eventually figured it out and is back to her normal happy self.  


If you need someone in a similar situation to yourself to talk to, PLEASE PM me, I will help you as much as I can.  
I know how crappy it feels to have this monster hanging over your head... don't let it destroy you.  


Many hugs and kisses 💜
PM me sweety.
I’ll be back online tomorrow morning (Aus) :)
🥰🥰
Aw, thank you so much. Having someone to talk to is super important. I had my first counseling session today, so I feel better. And yes, while I am worried, it's just a rational fear. I am, above all, hopefull that it will go well.

Also, damn girl! You look like you're in your mid-20s! Amazing 🤩
Awesome! Counselling helps so much.
You’re at a really difficult part in your story, but I promise with the way you are handling things it will be a happy story, even if it has some rough chapters.

Absolutely more than happy to chat to you if you need someone to talk to. 💜

And thank you haha, I am 29!

Disappointing article about non-binary identities	"Another ignorant article about trans identities. This one claims that being non-binary is a new fad among the youth and that people are using they/them and neopronouns just because they think it's cool.

As a 42-year-old non-binary person, it's obvious that this article is missing a very basic fact: Only recently has it become possible to publicly identify as non-binary without severe repercussions.

Employers and school staff did not always have to respect people's pronouns. That's a new development thanks to greater awareness of trans rights.

There used to be no ""non-binary"" option.

I spent most of my life being told I was crazy for identifying as non-binary, that this identity didn't exist. I worked on raising awareness and now . . . this? We're supposed to be a trend?

https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/health/pronouns-guide-for-parents-wellness/index.html"	"My favorite graph to show people who talk about non-binary identities, or trans identities in general, being “trendy” is about a page down in this article: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/22/the-surprising-geography-of-american-left-handedness/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/22/the-surprising-geography-of-american-left-handedness/)

Non-binary identities are “trendy” in the same way left handedness is “trendy,” which is to say it’s not. When we lift policies designed to suppress an identity, we get a spike in prevalence that looks a lot like a trend until we reach a plateau.
This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to cry when I think about coming out to people. I'm in my 30s and I hate the idea of anyone thinking that I've jumped on some kind of fad. I just didn't have any fucking language for it before.
I'm sort of confused.. where does it say that it's a trend? I read through and I didn't see anything offensive, but everyone else is saying that it's offensive /gen
I didn’t think this read that way at all honestly… can you elaborate on why you feel that way? I’m new to the community so I like seeing all these different perspectives.

I agree that it reads like a cis writer, but I didn’t see anything that indicates they were calling enbies trenders.

Edit: re read what you said, and no where in the article do they imply that the kids they interview think it’s cool. They both indicated that it was because they didn’t feel wholly happy with what they were raised with, and the article accurately reflects that.
Ugh I can't believe it. Ig because of my dyslexic ass I misread it and thought they were respecting us and was like ""oh cool! I could article that's supportive of us."" But nope. They think we are a ""trend"" we aren't a trend. We're people. We're just people. We're normal. Why can't cis people treat us like we're normal. Instead of treating us like some crazy experiment.
So so many non-binary people just didn’t know being non-binary was an option. When discovering discomfort with my gender I really only knew about binary trans identities and thought that because I wasn’t a boy then I wasn’t trans. Then I met non-binary people as an adult and kept thinking “wow I wish I was as cool and non-binary as them” and turns out I was! We’ve always been here even if we haven’t always had the words or language for our identities
We have records of 3rd and non-binary genders from cultures across the entire world for the entirety of recorded history. I'm sure this fad will be over soon. 🙄
As I sat in my egg pretending to be cis with a big, poofy, pig-tail sticking out the back of my head, knowing full well I was already past the beginning of my transition, I had an older friend try to convince me non-binary was a fad. That was an awkward conversation seeing as I wasn't out yet. I wrote it off to old people not being aware of new terminology.  People finally feeling safe being out with their gender differences with far less social pressure than in the 80's and 90s. I explained when we were kids if you deviated from the masculine or the feminine you were immediately called a f\*g or a d\*ke. We don't tolerate that behavior anymore socially and we feel safer being ourselves. When I explained to him you feel like you don't fit within the standard norms and I was non-binary (gender-fluid but close enough) something clicked in his face. As if knowing someone who wasn't over the top or flamboyant helped bridge the gap for him. Wait until I tell him Im going full transgender lol. That's another awkward conversation for another time. Just my own personal experiences with this topic.
I'm old and I get it it's not that hard to understand the gender is what we fill we are not what some jackass looked at when we were born and said this is it finally we get to choose for 58 years I had to live like they said I was now I can be what I fill inside
The whole ""to feel cool/special/unique/trendy"" myth is SO FUCKIN' FRUSTRATING both for its prevalence, and how absolutely shallow and lacking in empathy for insight into people's motivations when they come out as trans or non-binary.  


I didn't start using 'they/them' because it feels *cool*, I started using them (AS AN ADULT) because the first time they were casually applied to me in a in-person interaction I felt a sense of relief and rightness that I didn't know was possible; it was though my AGAB had been a splinter beneath the nail of my life that had been with me so long I didn't think to question that other people felt constant pain and discomfort with their gender.   


I'm non-binary because having the language to understand and describe myself as such feels more comfortable, accurate, and genuine for me than any other gendered language or perception ever has.   


Wanting to live with dignity and a sense of connection and wholeness with who I am *isn't a fuckin' trend*. Wanting to being able to go about your existence not having to constantly defend or rationalize who I am because so many strangers value not having to empathize or learn - beyond incomplete intro-level biology concepts and holding proscriptive attitudes towards language - over reducing suffering and uplifting others.
Gotta love it…
TW and HUGE RANT!
Trendy? HA! I was brought up in a religious lgbtqia2s+phobic community with no queer connections to learn the ""trend"" from... and am a Trans-Fem She/Her or They/Them... She/They? 

Will be getting an Orchi- soon and a basemant remodel as soon as I can! Also plan on FFS!

All opposite of what I was taught, and what was customary for that area... (a lot of people were still complaining about the 2020 election when I moved mid 2021 if that gives you any idea)

Somehow I still ended up ⚧️🏳️‍🌈🦄  🐛🐚🦋

It was not a trend, I just found:
1. A way out of that environment (I moved)
2. Could not stand existing as a lie anymore! (It almost killed me!
3. My therapist was in fact the person who got me to answer my own questions, end my denial and come out!

Though it would have been FAR better if I had been supported and introduce earlier, and came out before puberty... as now I just have more work and healing to do!

Anyone that is against others (that are not causing harm), rights to live as they will, is cracked!
     As well as the system and its constructs of roles!

Lol almost 8 months on HRT/GAHT and my mom asked if I was brainwashed by a cult... (I wanted to say yes your religion for the first part of my life)
     They need to get it through their head, every person should have the right to lives... 

I went from a quiet person to ... one that will not shut up when it comes to LGBTQIA2SP+ rights, the Cis-Hets have crossed the line!😤
     I appreciate the Cis-Het supporters👍🥰👍! The rest need to figure it out!!! 😤

Edit: spelling
It's fucking big media and they don't know how to write articles so they just do anything for clicks. I don't give a fuck about them at this point. I just try to troll them or report anything from them when I can.
Hilarious concept. It has nothing whatsoever to do with European colonization coming in and destroying cultural and social norms of the people that were here first…. But nah ‘tis a “fad”. My lack of gender standards is a “fad”.Good to know Ill be getting over it in no time ….
It's absolutely ridiculous how people can just say stuff like that just because they only see young nonbinary people such as myself. I personally think they should mind their own business.

It doesn't effect them at all if I'm nonbinary, and using they/them pronouns isn't that hard of a task. Personally, they just need to get their heads out of their asses.
It's so weird that once we outlawed witch burnings, the rate of women publicly identifying as witches skyrocketed... must just be a trend amongst the youths.

People's commitment to remaining ignorant is impressive.
The old stance on non-binary person was low-key racist too. Thousands of non-Western (European-based) societies recognized a third sex. To dismiss all of them and say that only the white cishet model is correct is racist.
Everything is/was ""a NeW fAd AmOnG tHe YoUtH"", like the internet, being gay, glasses, being left handed, reading books, opposing slavery

Seriously, the fact that anyone has the guts to say this about any event in society these days after how fantastically wrong the people saying that are always eventually proven to be.
I am 24 and as a kid I would get upset when someone called me a girl, but even more upset when I got called a boy. I didn’t know non-binary was an option until 4-5 years ago. We’ve existed, there just wasn’t a lot of information or talks about it. Just because it has a name now doesn’t make it some fad the kids are into
CNN has no credibility, ignore them it’s just boomer propaganda.
I hate when people say my gender and pronouns are a trend 😕
Fuck and it’s CNN. I thought they were a good news site.
Its conservative news. I stopped reading that so long ago.
I worked in the service industry with grooming standards. To transistion was always my main point why I started my own company after noticing that I am fed up with all the pretendings that I had to go along with just to bring food to the table unfurtunaly german burocrats are worse than the image of banks and lawyers, thats a reason why since months I am fighting for my rights. It's costing me a lot of time and I am all over media complaining how unneccessary this discrimination is because I hide my true colors so many years always hopeing that one day we will find ways to treat each one equally, but not equally indifferent, equally as human beings without the need of nationality and gender. Skills matter more than sexual organs or skin color.
That and the generations who didn't have access to the information before, so were just confused and didn't realise there was a name for it.
Or communities where the information was repressed thanks to Christian colonialism.
also cishet people have been murdering queer people for years but when we actually have more of a chance to live they act surprised about our identities
I think people trying to use neopronouns like puppy/puppyself or vamp/vampself are drawing negative attention
I think it is self defeating to rail against a mainstream media article that is saying children are exploring their gender identity and thats healthy and okay and adults should be more understanding about it.

Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

I got aware of my sexual dysphoria at 3 years of age. As I didn't want to go on with a hormone transition at late adolescence, I struggled to adapt to my biological sex for decades, till I finally pulled it off at the end of my forties. I've recently realized that the non binary identity came to fit my gender identity best, after so many years adapting into a body my brain was incongruent with.

However, that was only after a painful, long journey and I wish I had managed to feel like I do now as a kid or even as a teen cause I would have suffered much less, though I know social prejudice would still be a problem.

The fact is most of the gays and lesbians I used to meet in my youth here in Brazil were not trans-supportive and were actually even hostile to what was considered 'effeminate men' or soft gays, in chats already in the late 90's when the internet became a thing and for many years on, cis gays made a point of asserting how manly and 'straight-looking' they were, expecting the same of a future partner.

Back in the days, we didn't know the term, we would say androgynous among the more literate but this didn't change the prejudice against us among cis gay males, it plagues all sectors of gay society, from working class guys to highbrow ones.

By the way, I look up to trans couples who, though looking perfectly male and female, prefer to identify as non binary. Some have come out as non binary on Youtube.

This is a spectrum identity which fits us the best - no matter where one is situated in the gender spectrum - as anything which makes us compare and try to fit into the cis world categories only reinforces the stereotypes cis people, whether gay or hetero, have about us, worsening problems of low-self esteem, insecurity, etc.

Nevertheless, I personally don't care which pronoun people use to address me, having become quite used to he/him, though I find expressions like 'man', 'bro', quite unfit if used about or directly at me, as in some slang/colloquial style. I know it's just a manner of speaking but I find it too masculine for my personality. 

Many also assume that being more feminine makes me exclusively a bottom, when in fact I'm quite versatile and love using my penis:-). The stereotypes unfortunately still affect many people's sexual and romantic lives in this second decade of the 21st century - even in the big cities of our free West.
Right
thats foul bruh
Yeah, I really didn’t read it this way at all. Not writing on an aspect of non-binary identity isn’t the same as saying that it’s untrue or invalid. What this article is saying, more or less, is that more people are feeling comfortable with OPENLY identifying using less conventional pronouns, and that’s healthy and should he encouraged.
Great to know that being treated like shit, hated, and possibly beaten or killed because of who we are is a, “trend” douche wads.
Exactly. We have no data on how many people identified as non-binary when it was practically impossible to publicly do so. And trans identities are still repressed. There are still tons of people who can't be openly trans/nb because of their living situation, employment situation, transphobia in their area, etc.
[deleted]
This is the data I use to show people how ridiculous they are with claiming things are trends after they get awareness and people come out
Exactly. But if we, as a community, keep calling this stuff out, maybe it will become clear that it doesn't represent us.
Bluntly, if you're 30 - - and I'm in my 40s here - - just point to your age.

It's a phase, huh? A fad? *I'm 46 you inbred cretin*. I've spent my whole life ignoring fads. I don't change anything without dire need.

Pretty sure I'm not talking to a gender therapist because of what kids are doing on tiktok.
I'm 41. My thoughts exactly.
Me too, It seemed overall very positive and aimed at educating parents but maybe I missed something too?
""While it's hard to find data on people who are changing pronouns, anecdotal evidence suggests that more are ditching gendered words for those that are less gender-specific and more flexible across the board. And some parts of society are keeping up: Many people in educational institutions and corporate life are including their chosen pronouns in their email signatures (some with links to why they matter), and Zoom has room for people to show their pronouns in their name listings.

Experts say three main factors are driving the phenomenon: More information about gender fluidity on the internet, a spike in the number of high-profile celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Nico Tortorella embracing nongendered pronouns, and pronouns showing up more frequently in communication technology.""

This is the problem. It mentions celebrities and information being available online, but it doesn't mention the fact that there is greater acceptance and more opportunities for people to be public about their identities.

It frames gender identity as a choice. It implies that teens are choosing to identify as non-binary because of today's media climate and not the other way around - that teens are now free to express themselves because a more welcoming environment has been created.

It's subtle, and I definitely see how it could be read as positive and accepting. 

But the points they brought up really screamed, ""teen fad,"" to me. And there should have been more acknowledgement of how advances in trans rights have made it safer for people to come out.
And why did a cis person write this article? (It sounds like the author is cis.) A company as big as CNN can't find a trans person to write this kind of article?

I hate how they frame it as supportive - ""Pronoun Guide for Parents."" And no. It's just another attack.
Exactly!
Yeah, I remember in the 80's, it was considered morally wrong and a mental illness. So much has changed for the better since then.
Right! It's not hard to understand! So major news outlets like CNN can obviously do better than this.
Right on! And congrats on getting out!

These kinds of stories need to be heard. Thank you.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

I agree, but I still like to call this stuff out because it is respresenting us to a large audience.
Yeah, for me, the article had a really dehumanizing tone to it. It read like it was written by a cisgender observer making superficial judgments instead of educating themselves.

Obviously, there are a lot of NB teenagers who are coming out now because they always felt that way and now they're free to be open about it, not because of celebrities or something they read online. It's just another, ""The young people just immitate celebrities,"" approach to things, which is insulting. I'm no longer young myself, but I can empathize, having been that age and been talked about that way. It's wrong.
I completely agree. 

When I was in my teens, some of the ""fads"" were bisexuality and vegetarianism. Are there still bisexual people and vegetarians 30 years later? Yes, there are.

And if you read about ""fads"" from other eras, it is completely shocking. Like you said, opposing slavery. Women wearing pants. Stuff we take for granted as right or normal today.

Maybe ""fad"" should be replaced with, ""young people making a positive difference.""
Yeah, I hate how they're always trying to seem so progressive and . . . they're not.
Yeah. I just read some of everything that's not behind a pay wall. I can't afford a subscription right now.
Right. Before I had a name for it, I would just say I didn't identify with the gender divide, or something like that. I was pretty open about it, but it was something I had to hide at work so I wouldn't get fired. That's the way it is for a lot of people.
The article provides dangerously misleading information. It says there are three main reasons for this change: more information available online, celebrities identifying as non-binary, and pronoun options available on social media. It presents it as if youth are choosing to be non-binary because it was suggested to them by the media.

It leaves out the fact that this was a highly stigmatized identity until this decade and that people have freedom to express it that they did not have in the past. It omits the fact that non-binary people have probably always existed.

By doing this, it trivializes non-binary identities and makes a mockery of all the hate that we've endured and continue to. This kind of article makes it harder for people to be taken seriously when they are dealing with hate.

It does sound positive on the surface, and these criticisms may seem minor. But this stuff matters. They're reaching a large audience, and the article is presented as a comprehensive overview of the topic, which it is not.
Yeah, but it's also still a stigmatized identity. For every person who thinks it's cool, there are a lot more people having to hide who they are due to hate.
No need to be upset about it because people don't actually do that.  If someone says they are trans, then they are trans. It's ok to experiment with gender expression and realise that some assumptions were misguided, but that doesn't mean someone was lying. There's no ""clout"" in coming out as a gender or sexual minority and there's no value in casting doubt on the validity of trans identities. Most of us struggle with imposter syndrome enough without the myth of the fake trans person being perpetuated within our own community.
No it's people like you that keeps us from being taken seriously
I know, right?!
Tfw I'm part of 10% of the world population that's left handed and some bozos say that it's just a trend

Like cmon, wanna see me write with my right hand? It'll look so weird you won't be able to identify a single letter
*I’m sorry!* it’s not like I was born that way or something! Left handedness a trend that’s just insane. 😂
Truth. People only hear you if you speak out.
Yeah allowing an article to be written on trans people by someone who is not trans is bullshit and transphobic and cnn should be ashamed to have run it.  It honestly doesn't matter what was said, they're allowing cis people to speak over trans voices, this takes away our voice, and is thus deliberate misinformation. They know better. They've been told.
'I'm not talking to a gender therapist because of what kids are doing on tiktok"" Im gonna remember this forever and use it when I get a little less young. Thanks for this amazing quote. <3
Good point! I'd have to walk around declaring my age to everyone though, nobody likes to credit me with the years I've lived because I have good skin. (Channeling Pepper LaBeija on today- the children can't take that I look youthful. Hah! Suffer! No lines, no bags! 🤣🤣)

I actually hate it a little, for these reasons. Always grouped with the kiddos but I am not a gen Z and I do not know your slang lol
I don’t think I agree that it frames it as a choice, but it does allow the reader to make that assumption by not elaborating, so I agree there. It’s obviously a misguided ally imho
Yeah, I feel like it would be better if a trans person wrote this article, not a cis person. And I feel kinda like I idiot for misreading this article. Also does anyone know how to go to your favorite on Google and unlike articles. I can't figure it out and I don't want anymore transphobic articles In my feed.

Edit: nvm I figured it out
I'm admittedly jealous of the current generation and their doors available to them. It is what it is. Here's hoping it keeps getting better.
Yes, it's important to call them out and show that they're lying! The articles can suprisingly cause a lot of harm
It really is. I may be 15, but I am far from clueless. Sure, I don't know much about being an adult but i know a lot about the world. I can make my own decisions about my gender identity, thank you very much. 

That's nobody's business but my own.
I usually read the Gaurdian or the Independent. They are closer to neutral in politics. Its good to know where each news outlet stands politically
You are overthinking this. This article is not about the existence of non-binary people. It neither tries to legitimize or delegitimize them. It contains anecdotal stories about non-binary people, but the actual topic is about a new generation feeling comfortable with gender exploration. This is not restricted to people who identify as non-binary and the reasons it lists for this new found comfort are true. The youngest generations are becoming more comfortable with gender non-conformity because pop culture is telling them it is okay. This is the exact same proccess that helped garner wide spread acceptance of the LGB segment of the community in the 90s and 2000s. The fact that this article exsist, even with its flaws, means great things for the trans community.
I agree. The world is far from safe for trans people yet
I'm gen x. People forget we exist. Or think we're boomers. The boomers were my parents. And mine are pretty chill.
Yeah I read it as a point about representation. Kids who otherwise wouldn't even realize queering gender is a thing they can do see gender non-conforming folks in the media or hear about it online and go ""oh crap that's me"". I didn't crack my egg until I was nearly 30 and lack of representation was huge part of why it came so late.
Yeah, I think it's open to interpretation. I guess, for me, the main problem is what it leaves out, and the implications it makes because of that. That was my read on it.
I agree, and I do.
My spouse is gen x, I *never* forget. It's the wibbly generation- I feel like the definitions between gen x, gen y/millenials, the xennial thing, for some reason have been slippery. Everything you read about the gen x span seems to give a different date range and they're often not named in reports and analytics in news articles and what, just grouped up or down. I've always found it pretty strange. 

I get to be a *geriatric millenial,* which makes me feel very mature and specific, indeed! 

(My parents are also boomers, but only one is chill. Boomer chill is highly variable.)
I 100% agree that some important points that weren’t included would help with the unclear tone
Supposedly I'm late gen x. Analog childhood, digital adulthood.

My brother, three years younger, grew up with consoles and never got the joy of telling your Apple IIe how to find your sound card, or telling dos what to do.
...do you remember amigas?
I do. Never had one but a friend did. Did have an Atari. :)
Reminiscing about old tech with other adult humans makes me feel real hahaha

The family Atari is still in my dad's garage. I think it still works, too. I bet he could get some serious cash for it now.
I probably shouldn't mention by boxes of unlimited and legend magic cards somewhere.. :)
Omfg I just saw this and it gave me a giggle. Lol thanks for it"	swhg30	trans	717	0.99	2022-02-19 19:11:20
Do I have to accept my birth gender to be “a true trans person?”	"My mom (who isn’t trans nor transphobic) says I need to accept myself as a female before I could say I identify as a male, so from real trans people, is this what I have to do? If so, can you guys please tell me how to accept myself as the gender I hate being so much? Please?

Edit: I thank you all for your advice (and now I realized how transphobic my mom really is -w-). My mom kept telling me to get advice from a therapist about my identity and not kids my age to help me, so I decided to get advice from trans adults! So thank you all so very much! 💙🏳️‍⚧️"	"This statement doesn't make any sense to me? I never accepted my birth gender. Trying to pretend to be my birth gender lead to so much pain that just isn't around anymore. This just sounds like ignorance on your Moms behalf, or even gatekeeping and transphobia.
Try telling a cis woman that they have to accept themselves as a man before accepting themselves as a woman. Wtf. Not cool. Not good.
Fuck no!

You can accept yourself as the gender you are. The one that hurts you was thrust upon you and you owe it nothing if it brought you nothing.

No one gets to tell you how you navigate yourself.

Cis people often mean well but they just don't get it. Which sucks but c'est la vie.
To be kind, perhaps overmuch, I think your mother doesn't ""get it"". I'm certain that's not how that's ever worked for anyone I've been aware of.
Isn't the whole point of being Trans is that you don't accept your agab
Gender lives in the brain, not the pants.  And my brain was always that of a girl.
Fuck no, 

Although we do require a blood sacrifice
Better question: why should you take advice on how to be trans from a cis person? She has no experience or frame of reference except maybe what other people have told her. And while we are on the topic of ""how to be a trans,"" please note that there is no right way to be trans. It really is a ""Do what works for you"" kind of deal.
That is very incorrect. Some people learn to accept it over time, but many don't and never will. There are people who have specifically decided to be cremated so that they don't have to worry about the possibility of their bones being found hundred of years from now and scientists misgendering them. You don't have to accept your agab, you might along the way, but it's not something that is going to happen any time soon.
Gender lives in the brain, not the pants.  And my brain was always that of a girl.
To be a ""true trans person"" you just have to. be trans. that's literally it.

""Accepting your birth gender"" is bs. You can accept that part of you if you feel like it fits, or you can reject it entirely if it doesn't work for you. It doesn't really matter that much what anyone else thinks. It's *your* gender.
I think she means birth sex? As birth gender doesn't make any sense, but the whole point of transitioning is overcoming birth sex so naturally you would have to have accepted it first, but you probably already have
""Mom isn't transphobic-"" *proceeds to describe transphobic behavior*
Nope you don't. Though as a AFAB Enby it wasn't till I accepted that I'm nonbinary and realized I can present in any way that makes me happy (not just androgynously) that I started dressing fem and being happy with it. It's a far cry from when I was younger forcing myself to be feminine because it's what was expected. So do what makes you happy and please don't force yourself to be someone your not. 
Now I could be very wrong but with her saying you have to ""accept being female"" first it feels like she may later say ""I knew you where a girl all along"" if you even act like you've accepted your physical form as it is which if your chill with your physical form that's great! Non-dysphoric trans people are still trans, but your physical form doesn't define your gender and who you are, only you do
[deleted]
What? That makes very little sense.  


That's like saying ""you have to accept yourself as straight before you can say you're gay"".  


That's not how any of this works.
Fuck no
If you accepted your birth gender,
you’d be cis. 

Don’t take trans advice from cis people, they’re often transphobic and just give plain terrible advice.

Fuck accepting my assigned gender at birth, fuck the cis people who say you gotta accept that shit, and fuck trans phones.

Alright I’m off the soap box, goodnight
Ummm... Pardon the directness, please. That's fucking bonkers. Logically it flies in the face of one of the prime reason that many (if not most) of us ARE trans. I lived as a guy for nearly 50 years, and never felt comfortable in my own skin. I didn't even understand why I was unhappy as a guy, because my gender problems were rarely conscious. (I repress at an Olympic level 😉) Being able to say to myself and then others that I was NOT going to continue to ""accept myself"" as a man is one of the most powerful things I have experienced.
It sounds like an attempt to convince you that you're not trans, or should like being your agab
No, that’s clearly a trick.
This gives “mom I’m gay-“ “no sweetie you have to experience sex with oposite gender first” vibes.

Major ick I complétele disagree. Your mother is wrong. Key word was: She’s not trans

If you think you’re trans for any significant amount of time you are definitely trans or at least nb
It’s about accepting who you are. That’s all that matters.
[deleted]
This is just one of the ways cis people misinterpret the phrase ""sex and gender are different"" because when trans people say it we mean you've always been your gender even if you haven't made any medical steps to change your sex characteristics, but when cis people use it they largely means that they'll accept your gender identity if you accept that you'll never be truly male.
""She isn't transphobic."" To say you need to accept your birth gender is incredibly transphobic.
Your mother is not a friend or an ally. She is being VERY transphobic. I hope you are able to get the support you deserve instead of the ridicule and gaslighting your mother is providing
Haha, such great life advice from someone who isn't transgender and says they aren't transphobic. I am not my birth gender. I am not my chromosomes or my body parts. I am who I say I am and that is up for me to decide, no one else.
HAHAHAHAHAH<wheezing deep breath> HAHAHAHAHAHA!


…. Your mother is transphobic. Thats bullshit. If you feel in your soul you are male, then you are.
I'm not entirely sure what she means by that, but it doesn't sound correct.

I've known I wasn't cis since I was 11 and I look forward to the day I can finally live outwardly as a man. I'm a guy, and I've known since I was pretty young. I don't accept myself as a girl or female, I know rn I look like one because I'm not out but I don't have to accept that I am one (bc I'm not) to be trans. 

You're who you feel you are! You don't have to 'accept' who you aren't to be who you are. Your mother might be trying to say that you need to love yourself but that doesn't mean 'accepting' being someone you aren't, as loving yourself means letting yourself be who you truly are. 

(Sorry if any of this is worded weird, I'm in a loud and distracting setting so my attention was split between a lot of things whilst writing)
Maybe she means to accept you were assigned female at birth, not that you are a woman. I don’t think anyone is arguing we were assigned sex at birth that didn’t align with who we are. The sex assigned at birth wasn’t up to us, hence why transition is necessary
She’s full of shit. You’re trans BECAUSE you don’t accept/identify with your assigned gender at birth.
I'm probably older than your mother and she is full of shit
If she means “accept that you can never be the cis version of your preferred gender so you come to terms with the reality of being trans” then maybeeee? But other than that one specific statement I don’t think so. i mean I never did.
I am not trans, so there is the caveat, but in short: absolutely not. you won't be able to accept your agab, because it isn't right, and to expect you to do that is a gross misuse of your time. how can you accept something that was forced on you without your consent? you do not need to come to terms with or accept your agab, and I'd argue you shouldn't try. if it happens naturally, fine, but don't force it and don't expect that it ""should"" happen. whether your brain is able to make peace with your agab is *not up to you,* nor anyone else. 

I think, while maybe not poorly intentioned, the impact of her telling you that is still a transphobic microaggression that trans people should conform to a cis mindset of what a trans person ""should"" be. we force those ideas onto trans people to deal with our own insecurities about gender and develop ludicrous hoops to make trans people jump through to ""prove"" that they're ""trans enough,"" which if I'm being honest I think roots itself in the fear of ""what if I'm trans? no, I would know because a real trans person would do xyz.""

she may not have meant anything bad by it -- she may think it's ""healthier"" for you to accept that identity before leaving it behind. but that's like asking someone to accept they're deaf before getting a hearing aid-- you kind of already did, realized it wasn't right, and now seek to improve your life. there is nothing you ""should"" do before transitioning.
I tried forcing the male façade for two decades but no, I’m not, never was, and never will be a guy. You don’t have to “accept your [assigned] gender” to be Trans. Are you Trans? Does that term feel right for your experiences? If so, perfect! Welcome to being Trans. 

We are constantly told we have to “prove” we’re Trans. And I’m done with that. We are who we are, period. You can’t accept yourself as something you’re not, but you can accept yourself as who you are. And you know who you are better than anyone else ever could. That’s all you need. 

Not sure what she’s referencing but this is pretty much unheard of as far as I know. Cis people don’t and never will get it, but that’s not on us. We don’t owe an identity that’s easily digestible to cis people.
Nah it’s bs. Million ways you can be trans. Tell her it’s an umbrella term and leave you be with your community to be here for you with like loads of great guidance for trans orgs out there :)
I heard this from my (trans accepting) mother too. So i dont know whats up
[deleted]
Maybe your mother would understand if you said ""I am accepting who I am. I am male.""
First time I've heard of someone who says that to be a ""real"" trans person, you have to become cis. What kind of reverse logic is that?

It's not up to her to gatekeep your identity from you. Much of what you've said about her in your replies comes across as transphobic talking points. She might not mean to be this way, and might not realise what she is doing (my mother is the same way), but repeating commentary/ideology from people that are transphobic *is* transphobic.

What you think fits you, is what fits you. That's worth giving serious thought too, gender is very confusing, but it is still *your* decision and you are whatever you feel you are.
My roommate (who is MTF) has said something similar to me (also MTF) about needing to accept what you have before you can move on. I think what it means is you can’t deny the past. You (technically) were presenting as female and then later realized that you weren’t supposed to be that way, thus transitioning as if it never happened would be wrong. 

In my personal opinion I don’t really agree. The way I see it I never really was a boy, I just didn’t yet understand or had the words to describe what I was. I used “boy” as a default until I learned of something better.
She just trying to convince you to be a woman.
For me as a Trans Woman my birth gender is female, just some doctors fucked it up.
Why would i have to “except” sth else
I tried very hard to love my birth gender and womanhood like I was ""supposed to"" for years and all it did was cause more confusion and pain for myself.

There is no one path to being trans. If you feel you are, you are. You don't have to prove yourself to anyone.
She's talking nonsense.
Could you maybe ask her to reexplain that in a way that isn't fucking nonsense?
Well I accepted but not really in a positive way like she said, I just got used to fact I'm a failure n' never going to be like a cis boi

'bout the question ya don't have to accept your birth gender in any ways
Why that can't be okay ? You serious ?
What? No. That's absurd.
If you are a man, you are a man. 
Your assigned gender, therapy, or what other people think has nothing to do with it.
What does “accept yourself as female” even mean? 

If you’re transmasc, then that’s way more important than the gender you were assigned with at birth.
You say she's not transphobic but...this is coming from transphobia.
As respectfully as appropriate, what the eff does that even mean? Accepting one's assigned gender at birth is literally the definition of being cis.
A birth-gender-accepting trans person seems oxymoronic to me, personally
Wow just no. That’s not at all true. Geez. I’m sorry you had to hear that. 💕
Sorry to say this, but it sounds like your mom still has some closeted transphobic hang-ups. There's no reason you need to ""accept"" your agab to be who you really are.
As a cis woman I didn’t have to accept a male gender identity before deciding my gender identity was female. Your mom’s logic is similar to people who tell gay people “well have you just tried being straight so you know for sure you’re gay?” Or “you’re too young to decide you’re gay.” Do people need to try being gay before deciding they’re straight? Do people need to try to identify as trans before being sure they’re cis?

All you need to do to be “a true trans person” is accept yourself as a trans person. Accepting that you were assigned female is one thing, accepting yourself “as a female” is not necessary or helpful. If your mom is genuinely concerned about your acceptance of your identity, she needs to find you a specifically trans affirming therapist who actually knows what they’re talking about and isn’t just making up BS.
I feel like your mom is trying to gaslight you.
No? Not sure where your mom is even coming from with this point. One of the biggest reasons for people being trans is because they *can’t* accept their assigned gender at birth. There are people who have spent their lives in the closet trying to force themselves to “accept it”. I mean, if you want to be unnecessarily technical, using the label “transgender” for yourself implies that you acknowledge that your assigned gender at birth is different than the gender you really are. So I’d say you have to acknowledge it rather than accept it
Bad news. If your mom ain't transphobic she sure bought a transphobic point of view as gospel truth.

You don't *gotta* accept *shit*.
Your birth gender never alligned with your birth sex. So yes you have to accept that you never were the gender she wants you to be.
I'm gonna join the party and say how wrong and stupid that sounds.  Your mom is ignorant, which happens even with the best of intentions (i.e. my doctor, step-dad, etc). The whole point of being trans is you are incapable of accepting your AGAB.  Show her this thread with all the ACTUAL trans people you talked to not made up ones that your mom \*supposedly\* knows.
You dont thats the point your trans because you dont want to be cis you dont have to accept anything
Honestly I wouldn’t say you need to acsept it more as you should acknowledge it. It’s more a case of thats who you were and without that you wouldn’t be the guy/girl/genderfluid and or nonconfoming person you are today just don’t forget that you are loved. So just a quick run up it’s less of you don’t need to acsept It more just acknowledge it I’m trans MTF and that’s just my opinion but hayho ~<3
You accept that your *sex* is female, but by accepting it you understand that while that may be your *sex* you're a man and your *gender* is whats important.

You do not have to accept the gender you aren't so you can 'become' the gender that you really are. Your sex may be female but that does not make you any less of a man. Sex is male, female and unisex, gender is man woman and like everything else, your gender is FAR more important than whatever is in your pants.
The absolute best way I can possibly interpret this is that she’s trying to say to accept that you were unfortunately AFAB, but that still isn’t good on her part and she is very wrong. The whole reason I’m transitioning is because I *don’t* accept my AGAB, so why should you have to?
What the... what does that even mean. That's stupid.

That's like saying ""when you're drawing the sea you first have to color it red and then cover it with blue, otherwise it's not correctly blue"". ""When you go to the store, you first have to go the opposite way and then go to the store, otherwise you aren't truly going to the store""

DON'T accept yourself as the gender you hate, that is stupid.

Your mom is saying nonsense, you are trans. People think you're a girl but you think you're a boy. That's trans. Ignore what your mom says, you are trans.

Edit: oh... oh.. I just had the worst thought. If you do say you accept your assigned gender, your mom might use that against you saying ""you accepted your gender, see, you're not trans"". And that will be her biggest transphobic weapon that she won't let go.
I never accepted my birth gender and dissociated from being such gender to a point where I didnt think I was a gender. That doesnt mean however that I hated my own appearance like I was hot for a dude when I was a dude, but that was not who I was destined to be and not the identity that I myself had identified with. Dont let any person tell you how you should or should not be. Be yourself. That's all that matters in the end.
Not at all, if anything that's like asking your mom to accept herself ""as a man"" before she can do things that make her feel like a woman. It's an ask that will pretty much trigger dysphoria,at least it would for me. What is important though, is accepting yourself as a trans guy and also accepting where you are in your transition. I'm pretty early in my medical transition (mtf) n there are a couple big things I wish were different, but accepting that those are there and will change over time helps to minimize the amount of dysphoria they cause me! Exploring your gender and transitioning brings us a lot closer to our true selves than I think many cis people can even appreciate, so just try to practice being honest with yourself and accepting what you want to do to get to where you want to be regardless of what others say. Sending you lots of love!!
I spent 31 years of my life trying to accept my birth gender and ignore my true self. It led me down a path of self destruction, alcoholism, and a whole heap of trouble that ruined my life. I came out, got help, sobered up and got on a better track and getting help for all the damage done. I'm happier now then I ever was but if I could go back and be myself sooner and tell myself to not try accepting the birth gender given to me I would in a heart beat. Your mom doesn't know what it's like to be trans or the experiences of trans people. She loves you and cares for you and is a bit transphobic but she needs to grow and learn about trans issues which she will through you most likely my mom has. It won't be easy I still struggle with mine but it gets a little better the further along you go. Good luck!
that’s exactly what my mom says, just slightly more discreet lmao B’)

anyways no, and the counter argument to that is dysphoria. trying to pretend to be someone you’re not can only cause harm and suffering. you’ll never be happy trying to force yourself to love something that causes so much suffering.
Im an adult, kids of my own. This is the dumbest thing ive ever heard. Your mom’s either lying, hilariously misinformed or pants shittingly stupid.
Your mom is wrong.

""Understand your birth gender,"" what kind of nonsense doorknob fuckery is that?
The whole point is not accepting your biological gender
No! 
Has your mum accepted her manhood? Doubt it.

All the best x
isnt not accepting your birth grnder like,, the point lol
Yeah no. That's not how it works, at all.

If you're trans, by definition, you \*can't\* accept yourself as your AGAB because you are not your AGAB.

Honestly, this sounds like she's doing this to trick you into saying you accept yourself as female, then she'll follow up with something like 'See? No need to transition then' or some other bullshit. In other words, the usual transphobic parent gatekeeping/goalpost moving tricks.

Also fucking lol at the idea of only doing girl or boy things as a kid (mentioned in a comment thread here). I'm AMAB & played with matchbox and RC cars as a kid and was into science and video games. I transitioned years ago & I still race real cars, am studying psychological science and play PC games. Interests aren't gendered.
I think your mom, is transphobic
That's like saying you need to accept a broken down, mold-infested house before you can move out. That shit isn't working.

I do think before someone can fully live comfortably in their true gender, they need to come to terms with being transgender. There's a lot of social and internal hurdles which we need to reckon with. Very importantly: finding your own way to understand the system of gender and your place within it (or outside it); as well as tackling prejudiced ideas which impact your brain when you are forced to interact with transphobia.

Outside of being trans, all people have to make peace with their gender. When transitioning, you (eventually) get the social pressures of your gender applied to you for the first time by others. You will need to make your peace, but later in life, and with more baggage. None of that needs you to accept yourself with a gender which isn't yours (something which I doubt is possible for most people)
I think my opinion is going against the grain here. I myself am a TRANS man. But I’ll never be a biological man no matter how many things I change. I had to accept that part and realize I want be seen as a man and live my life that way. After accepting that I really felt one with myself because biologically we are still female and have female parts and if we never accept that how can you go about living day to day knowing you hate part of yourself? 

I have a chest now and I do hate it and I’ll get that part of me changed for my mental health. But I will still have to go see a gyno for my reproductive health and if I am ever in an emergency I need to tell them I am a trans man to get the help I need since I am biologically female and I need different care then a biological man. 

Of course this is just my opinion and no one can tell you how you need to deal with your transition that’s your decision. I wish you all the best in your journey.
Lol no
If I am really generous she could mean that you need to accept that you were assigned the wrong gender and not see it as a tragedy.

However, I dont think she did. This is a catch-22: if you do accept your gender, then she will say that you dont need to transition. Even if she did, she would probably still misgender you and say something like that if you accepted yourself as your agab, you would be okay with that, essentially ignoring your transition.

If you say you dont, she will spout the same nonsense she already did, not accepting your transition.

She sees being transgender as flaw, as an illness and reflects it back to herself (""I have a flawed child"") and tries to avoid that.

I think this comes from the fact that they want to keep verything
I could be wrong here but I suspect there is some truth behind it.

Although I feel that being a true trans person has nothing to do with accepting the birth sex, having accepted that you are born in a different sex can help in transition.

It's a huge challenge and while I am happier during transition, not being able to accept the limitations of the birth sex such as the effects of puberty etc can make dysphoria way worse.

I'm not sure if it makes sense?
No that’s dumb
Nah, fuck that.


You are a guy who was born with body parts not traditionally associated with men and probably prevented from experiencing a normal male puberty.

Mom can eat shit.

Also, you don't get born with a gender. You get born with body parts which are variously categorized in terms of ""sex"" some of all of which may align with a particular categorization.


Personally, I think that there is some immutable characteristic in my brain that tells me what body parts I should or should not have. My experiences post surgery reinforce the idea that there was a brain:rest-of-body mismatch.

Because the brain is a physical body part and because my brain said I shouldn't own a penis, it would seem strange to believe that my brain should be lumped in with ""male"" body parts. Therefore, no, I am not nor was I ever (to my earliest memories) fully aligned with a single sex categorization. 

Disclaimer: Me believing I was born partially intersex but with unambiguous genetalia should not be construed as invalidating those born with ambiguous genetalia or those who do not experience bodily dysphoria to the same magnitude as myself; such people have their own unique struggles and are entirely valid in their identity. My argument here is additive with all other arguments for the validity of transpeople; it does not replace or supercede any arguments. Void where prohibited, ask your doctor for more information, offer not redeemable in the Texan Reich or the Imperium of Man.
Well it does sound like transphobia just not from a place of hate but from a place of ignorance (with all due respect to your mom). You were never a female in the first place. You were born with certain characteristics that made everyone around you assume who you were. Maybe you even behaved to some extent as that gender, but that doesn't mean that's who you were. You've always tried to be who you are, maybe navigating that through the experience of what you thought you had to be. I lived my life behaving as a VERY feminine man for 21 years, that doesn't mean I was a man before I identified as a woman. I was a woman who didn't know it and tried to be myself as much as possible while also fitting in the ""male"" box. It wasn't until I understood why I felt the way I felt for so long that I was able to finally be myself and accept that I was never a boy. I was a very confused girl trying to fit in what everyone else told me I was, and just because I was born a certain way doesn't mean I've been a man for a single day in my whole life.
Is she's saying you have to acknowledge your agab and that your not biological the gender you identify as? If so then yes you do have to know your biological sex doesn't match your gender identity that's kinda the whole point
Accepting your agab to then reject your agab? Huh?
idek what this means tbh haha. You don't have to listen to other people abt your gender
Yeah, 38 year old trans lady here to say your mom is full of hot garbage, and she's just trying to control you.
Your mom is transphobic, sorry.
Sorry but your mom is being transphobic
What?!  Why would you 'accept yourself' as something you are not and have no desire to be?  Did your mom have to 'accept herself' as male before she could be female?  This makes literally no sense
Your mom is ridiculous! You only have to accept your true gender, not the one assigned to you. That's literally what being trans is lol
if you are trans its a fools errand to try and accept yourself as your agab. you can try to do it to please others around you but if your egg 
has already been cracked it will only hurt you immensely.

I think this line of think stems from some twisted empathy that a lot of women try to project onto trans men. She might be thinking of you you still as a women experiencing sexism and shame about women hood as she did and does, trying to rationalize why you feel this why to her. But that line of thinking isnt true and pretty much misses the point of coming out. I like would assume the line of thinking is still from a good intentions.
That’s……. Not how this works.
I repeat the message again: NO. That's NOT how any of it works. And that is why dysphoria is a thing. Being assigned a body at birth that doesn't align with you really are inside. 

And, that causes a whole set of things, like having the wrong voice to body and whatnot. 

So: NO. You should NOT have to accept gender assigned at birth in order to accept your true gender. That's toxic. I just had to get this out of me. Partly because I think that my mother would have been similar if she had been around when I came out.
I attempted to be my birth gender. My brain and heart rejected and said no. That’s why I know I’m trans. 

Disclaimer not the story for everyone just my case
It is good to accept that you are trans, as in, you will never be cis. But why would you have to accept to be a gender that you arent?
Accepting your birth gender would make you cis.
Remember any person who forces you to sacrifice your own happiness for a lie is not you friend.

As someone who lived a lie let me say how painful it was to keep trying to be something I actively despised is pure poison to the soul/mind.
 
Love yourself first beautiful ❤️
If I had accepted my birth gender than I wouldn’t be trans lol.
Uh I never accepted that I was a female even before I knew I was trans so no
You do not have to accept your birth gender
You dont need to at all. All that matters is what you are, and you are a man. Aas long as you are what you want to be and you are happy, thats all that matters, and I understand help from trans adults more, but always getting a full spectrum is good! From a fellow trans youth to another, i hope everything in your life goes well!
This concept sounds like some kind of way to force an admonition of guilt and I believe it is incorrect.  If you know who you are you do not have to accept who you are not.
NO, DEF NOT the point is that you aren't the gender you were aab so wtf not that doesn't make any sense
Really? She always says that I need to accept and love myself as a girl before I say I’m male. She also told me all her other trans friends accepted themselves (unless she’s lying which she usually does) so now I’m a little confused
Ditto
The only thing I can think his mom might mean is she wants him to accept that he was afab. Like accepting that it is a part of his past. That is the most charitable read I can take on it. 

Many parents assign a lot of (too much) value to their kids gender, they have a lot of memories with them being in their assigned gender role. I would guess ops mom is having a hard time grappling with how they should feel about the past. About losing the connection that is womanhood that she thought she shared with her son.

I'm not saying OPs mom isn't being transphobic. Just that she might be struggling to understand what her child coming out as trans means for her memories with OP.
So much this
She probably says it because she has a few trans friends that she doesn’t even talk to
Even if I only starting realizing it as a teen?
So I need to accept my birth sex?
She keeps denying the fact she’s transphobic because she says she loves trans people and she has trans friends
Yeah, it kind of dawned on me that the mom might want to get the admittance from him that ""he's a girl"" which she would use as a weapon. ""You can't be trans, you admitted you're a girl!"". And that's something a transphobe, or even just an ignorant parent will never let go.

This is a beartrap
The fact she said that when I came out as pan tho- XD

But seriously, thanks!
She says it like I need to know I’m a female, accept that I’m female, and love myself as female before I could do all of that as a male…
I know she worries about me, but it in this case, it doesn’t seem like it…
Yeah it’s true
I tried to force myself to be male because in my childhood I just didn't know there was anything aside from the default, but I was raised that way because my parents ARE transphobic. I dont want to double down and say yours is, especially since it seems like she's been an all for you in the past - at least from this post, i could be entirely wrong - but it may be down to sit down and talk? Try to see if maybe she is just ignorant and made a mistake?
uhhhh... no? isn't the point of being trans that your assigned gender doesnt fit? there's an inherent lack of acceptance there from any trans person - I can't accept x gender because y is the one that's actually me.

from another trans lad, I *hated* being a girl. my ""acceptance"" of it was thinking feminism is good and women are cool. both of those still apply! but then and now I hated literally anything identifying *me* as a woman, the only difference being that now i have the words for it. your mother is either misinformed, trying to manipulate you somehow, or just plain stupid
Ask her to meet ""all her trans friends"" to talk. You probably won't hear from them again, but if you do, you could gain insight first-hand from the process.

And no, you don't need to ""accept"" your assigned gender at birth because it was assigned to you. It's not like you could choose at the time, though, but the one to embrace and accept is the gender you choose :)
It’ll never happen my man. 

1) You can’t accept yourself as something you’re not without seriously deluding yourself. You can’t accept yourself as a girl because there is no “girl you”. 

2) Why would her logic apply to this and nothing else? You don’t have to accept yourself as an athlete in order to choose not to play sports. You don’t have to accept that you love eating broccoli in order to accept that you dislike broccoli. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s just a fake, subjective roadblock that she is putting in place so she can decide when you’re “ready” to transition.
But if you are a man you can’t accept and love yourself as a woman simple as that
Maybe ask if she can invite her trans friends to talk.  It may help both sides.  If they’re a part of the conversation, they should be allowed to speak for themselves.
Um, No. Just... No.

That's not how any of this works.

You're *not* confused.  Cisgender persons never doubt their gender *because* their AGAB was correct for them. It works for them, and *they don't want to be the opposite gender*.

""Fun for a day"" is one thing, but when you have this nagging, aching internal feeling that you're *supposed to be* the other, and it doesn't ever really go away... you're probably transgender
She's lying 🤥
> (unless she’s lying which she usually does)
Now I know your mom's full of wrong
How are you expected to love yourself when trapped in a body that is alien to you? Many of us fake it for a while, but very few achieve any measure of comfort in our bodies. I can't speak for your mother's friends, but your mom may be making assumptions based on something a friend told her, or she might just be making it up/making assumptions with no basis at all.
... The very DEFINITION of being trans is NOT accepting yourself as a girl.

>her other trans friends accepted themselves

BULLS\*\*\*

>(unless she’s lying which she usually does)

that makes sense.

>so now I’m a little confused

Being trans is already confusing and your mom is not helping. The ONLY thing that matters, and I really do mean the ONLY thing that matters is how YOU feel and what you want to be. You feel like a boy, you are a boy. Nothing else matters. there is no other rules, no gatekeeping, no ifs or buts, you feel like a boy and your mom has no right to tell you how you should do anything when it comes to your gender.
""I know what I'm talking about, I have trans friends""

""did you ever even speak to them, or even listened to them?""

""don't give me that tone child""

She sounds like the textbook example of ""i'm not racist, i know a black person""
Same lines as “I’m not racist cause I have black friends”. It’s not a scape goat nor an excuse, toxic behavior is still toxic behavior unfortunately. There is no “I have a friend” pass.
Cis(ish) person here with advice on how to be trans:

1- be trans

2- exist

3- do whatever the fuck is right for ***you***

*(4- stay safe though. Lots of the world sucks right now)*
You might only find out now, but that doesn't mean that you have ""become"" trans. You always were, you just haven't found out yet or didn't know what ""trans"" is. For me, I only found out like two years ago, but thinking back to my childhood with what I know now, I always was trans
I realised it when I was 35. We live in a cisnormative society, how long it takes to ""get there"" in terms of self-understanding is entirely irrelevant.
Many of us don't start questioning until later in life. You don't need to have always known you were a boy to be trans.
Doesn't matter.  It was always there.  Even if you didn't know it.  Even if you didn't understand it.

I always felt ""different"".  At puberty, I became extremely distressed and withdrawn.  At 17, I found out what trans was, and I knew.  But I was scared, and hid til 33.

This doesn't mean I ""became"" trans.  I always was.  I just didn't know it, and once I knew, I ran from it, but I was born trans whether I liked it or not.  I may have lived as a man for decades, but I will never truly understand what it's like to be a man.  Even as a tomboy.
I figured it out when I was 30. You gonna tell me and the rest of the midlife transitioners we ain't valid? No?

Then you're valid, boy.
I didn't fully crack until I was 34 my guy. Lots of things can get in the way of knowing for sure at a younger age. Why is she expecting you would have had the language to communicate your discomfort prior to this?? Nobody knows what something means until they learn about it
You'd need to accept that you are AFAB, but that obviously doesn't have anything to do with your gender identity. And the whole point of being trans is that you are unhappy with that. So you don't need to ""love yourself as a female"" at all, if you don't feel like it
I guess? But being aware that your burth sex is different than your gender is really all that ""accepting"" entails, past that its then time to decide what to do about it (hrt, surgery, etc)
Yeah exactly, sex not gender
The ""I have many \_\_\_\_\_\_ friends"" excuse! They can't be *racist/bigot/homophobic/transphobic etc* because they have a friend or two!🙄
Defensive behavior is normal in bigots. But actions speak louder than words. Someone might say they're not racist, but when they refuse to invite only their black friends to a party, or refuse to sit next to a black person on a bus, or refuse their children from playing with black kids, they are racist.

Transphobes might say they aren't transphobic, but when they say ""I don't have anything against trans people, I just don't think they should be allowed near children, or talked about in school or allowed equal rights"" then that's a transphobe.

Your mom is sadly transphobic. She might not be an evil transphobe who outwardly hates trans people, she might be an ignorant transphobe who doesn't even see her hate, but she is trying to keep you away from feeling yourself, which is transphobic. Sorry, many people have to deal with this, and people here understand and accept you.
yeah sorry that's super dumb.
I actually did but she doesn’t listen or understand me at all! And she’s says because I like “girl” things when I was younger, I only became trans because of the internet! Since I’m empathetic, she says that I take what others are feeling through the internet and make it my own problem, when all I did was figure out what being trans is through the internet, then realized I never felt like a girl, no matter what I did and liked..
My mom pulls that shit but she hasn't spoken to her trans friend since she ditched him when he went to thailand for gender confirmation surgery and took a different vacation on layover instead, but its okay because now she can pull the ""I have a trans son"" card instead and its more effective.
Funnily enough, I learned from a book by Eduardo Bonilla Silva that statistically most people who use the “I have a black friend” line actually don’t have any black friends at all.
She thinks those who fully figure themselves out at 30 are more valid than me because I want to know what my true gender is at 14 and others figure themselves out way older than me…
I actually do accept the fact that was born female and now here. Unfortunately, that’s not what my mom means by accepting myself as female
I had a similar conversation with my parents. I like professional wrestling, video games, and superhero movies. My parents tried to use that against me and said that I didn't play with girl toys growing up.

Let me ask the same question to you that I eventually had to ask myself. Did they ever provide you the opportunity with boy toys? Or, like mine, would they ridicule you and tell you that it wasn't for you due to your gender whenever you expressed interest in something masculine?
>And she’s says because I like “girl” things when I was younger, I only became trans because of the internet! 

Sure she's not transphobic? This is a pretty transphobic take. Lots of cis men also like 'girly' things growing up. Hobbies don't have gender
Yeah this sounds similar to what I said in my other comment - there was always something weird up with my gender, but I only nailed it down between 15 and 17 because that's when I started learning about being trans, and joining a community of similar people.

A lot of trans people appear to like things associated with their agab, either because gender roles are stupid and its genuine or because there would be punishment if they showed too much of an association with the ""wrong"" one. People get too hung up on whether you showed signs when you were younger when if you think about it for a minute it doesn't actually indicate anything.
Your mother is parroting transphobic talking points from TERFs... She's gaslighting you MAJORLY about your gender identity. She is not your ally here.

Absolutely no, you don't have to ""embrace your birth gender"" in order to be trans. Exactly the opposite... As a trans woman I absolutely, 100%, do NOT feel comfortable with my gender assigned at birth whatsoever. That's literally what having dysphoria is, NOT being able to understand your assigned gender at birth and feeling like it doesn't ""fit.""

What she means is that she expects you to have to act like a perfect version of a girl and *fail at it* first to be valid in claiming to be a boy and that is UTTER, UTTER trash. You know what your true gender is and no amount of your mother trying to change you to be what she wants will change that. You don't have to *fully try on* being a girl, putting yourself through discomfort and emotional pain, just to satisfy your mother.

I'm not in your head. You are. And you are telling me that you are a boy. I categorically and without question believe you are being genuine and that you understand yourself well enough to know that for you living a girl's life will never make you happy. And that if you wanted to be a girl that there is no amount of convincing we can get you to do that would make you suddenly want to be a boy.

Neither 'boy', nor 'girl', nor any other choice of how to identify is better than any other. It is all about what feels right. If what you see of being a boy 'feels' right, it's right.
Mine said exactly the same words to me. The internet.
Yours is coercing you, sadly.
Same to this comment before. I also tried to force my self. I went like. The feeling is just gona pass out for saké of others. Now I realize how stupid I was. It only lead to one huge snap of panic atack. Do not ignore something for sake of someone else.

Edit: That goes for anything.
I’ve gotta say the idea of becoming trans from the internet is- sorry for the language, dumb as SHIT

Who would actively pursue being trans ? It’s not fun to have your rights debated all the time, have much higher difficulty getting a job, feel uncomfortable constantly because people call you a gender you don’t identify with, have to worry about being clocked all the time (big stress), and have the mass insecurities that come with being trans.

You can’t “become” trans. Let’s say there was a world where you could “become trans”- what’s the issue? If your mom seriously believes in that and believes it’s the internet that made you trans, so what? 

Your mom seems more transphobic than you think, although she doesn’t seem like a strong transphobe luckily.
My mom does that too. Idk if it's transphobia, or parents just not wanting to let us change. I mean yeah I'm more feminine than my trans friend but my mom said to me ""but if you actually do transition all you'd be is a super feminine and flamboyant man."" (Which.. no, I wouldn't be, I'm not as feminine as she thinks I am.) I really don't get her point. Accepting the gender you were assigned based on how your body appeared as a newborn isn't a necessary step to take as a trans person. Yeah ik im AFAB but I'm not a girl. I don't need to accept my birth gender if it's not what I am. I apologize that your mom is being like this, though.
My mom tried to make me be a girl. Simply wearing girl clothes or girl chest garments made me wanna run away, and parents forcing us to be different than who we are just makes us resent anything associated with our AMAB and resent them, so it's ridiculous to force it on us.
I knew I was a girl at 11. Didn't read about it on the internet, wasn't pushed into by parents, and didn't have out trans classmates.  I told no one, as I was scared my parents would either force me to have surgery to be a female (I have a phobia of surgery), or I would be in trouble as my parents weren't the most excepting.  I attempted to live as my AGAB for 21 years.  It didn't work.  The only thing that makes me not wish with every fiber of my being to travel back in time and transition sooner are my children.  Most kids (like 97%) who are insistent for at least one year, continue to be insistent five years later. 

https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/few-transgender-children-change-their-minds-after-5-years-study-finds.html
Yeah, that is also bullshit. If you were older she'd be saying ""real trans people know when they're children"".

These are all excuses for ""you can't be trans because I know you and I don't know.any trans people.""
Most of us took so long because of trauma and lack of information at an earlier age. We are not more valid than you for experiencing trauma or lacking information for longer.
In that case what your mom is telling you doesn't make any sense. Like why would you need to identify as female to then identify as male?   
You should probably have a talk with your mom and explain to her that this is wrong
I think your mom's definition of ""acceptance"" is either wrong, or needs clarification
They never gave me boy toys and such.. I always loved those little race cars, but never had a real chance to play with them because all my parents ever game me were princess dolls. They never gave me an opportunity to play with boy toys…
Yeah, I had girl some girl toys when I was a kid, around 5 or so, but then my father came back from sea, and took them all away and lectured me about how my birth gender doesn't play with those...

And then he was like, ""But you never acted like a girl""
I like quite a few stereotypical male things, but I'm still a woman.
You can even grow and prefer having a beard and still be a woman. 
One of my previous boyfriends was a trans man and a femme boy that liked to dress in feminine lolita dresses.

You are a man if you are a man. You are a woman if you are a woman. You don't have to change who you are to meet any stereotypes.
My mom doesn’t think I’m valid because since I’m empathetic and I’m on the internet a lot, she thinks I just got it from there and only taking other peoples problems and turning it into my own :/
Idk why but she does think those who go through trauma and suppression are the most valid, it’s stupid honestly
And let’s all not all forget the root of this faulty logic: boys can like playing with “girls” toys and vice versa. Toys do not have gender aside from falsely associated social constructs
Don't you love the mental gymnastics and gaslighting they have to pull?
Honestly the best thing for you, and probably her, is to have you go to a gender therapist.  They will be able to assess you, and help guide you and your mother if you are trans.  I don't know you, or your mother, but it sounds like you recently came to the realization about your gender, and your mother is still in denial.  If you live in the states, I suggest finding the nearest gender clinic and getting a list of therapists they recommend.   A clinic that specializes in pediatric patients would be even better.
This is also transphobic nonsense and excuses.

I'm sorry but she's just wrong about this.
It *is* stupid... trauma did _not_ make me trans. trauma only made me have a bunch of mental illnesses _and_ *still* be trans. Is that what your mother wants? For you to be so miserable you become mentally ill?

I've always been trans, it just took me 34 years to have the language and to have dealt with enough of the trauma I'd been forced to endure in order to crack.

I am not more valid than you. You are wonderfully observant of yourself, eloquent, and you are fortunate to be unburdened with having other pain stopping you.

This is for your mother: If you want your son to be miserable to prove authenticity YOU need some serious fucking therapy, lady."	vjnsil	trans	675	0.97	2022-06-24 12:53:58
basically im out of the closet as a transwoman but i havent started living full time yet. in fact i actually did the opposite and got a buzz cut so now im wildly depressed. ive never felt worse about my gender identity		"1. You look pretty as hell
2. I would have thought you were cis just by looking
1. You're cute as heck
2. I thought you were cis
3. I love the Tuesday face
Are you serious you look gorgeous!
Hun, you are gorgeous!!
Oh no! Hair grows bb it’ll be ok xoxo
You’re so gorgeous. Seriously!!!
Well wish you the best. Beautiful lady will have a great future for sure.
look, if it makes you feel any better, there are plenty of women out there who wear their hair in a buzz cut. you look wonderful and aren't any less of a lady for having a buzz cut, i'm sure you look wonderful with it 🧡🧡
Relax, nothing about you looks male.
it isn't about the hair. you'd look good all day whether short or long hair...or none at all.
Congrats on coming out, I hope it went well for you. Your hair looks great
You look very cute
Hey girl, I’ve been there and made rash decisions about myself. It’ll be ok. It’ll grow back. Be strong and be proud. 
You got this
You look amazing, but I defs understand dysphoria and know how bad it feels some days regardless of how we look. Your hair will grow back, and in the meantime, remember you're still a girl regardless of how you look. It's going to be okay sister ❤️
We all take steps backwards sometimes. The key is to forgive yourself, practice some self-compassion, and get back to taking steps forward. You're still a woman, you're still valid, and you still deserve to be happy and comfortable.

Also, tons of women have buzzcuts. I think it's a beautiful look.
why? You are a complete woman, do not be fooled, do not even fool yourself. sorry google translator but i think you understand. 😘😘😘
So pretty don’t understand how to be so depressed when you have so much going for you!!
One of my trans women friends shaved her head a few months back to start everything growing at one length. There is also no right way to be trans, I’ve been living as male for about 7 years and sometimes I still question what I’m doing lol
Ur hot srrt
Seriously, you're 🔥!
I guess it’s time to invest in wigs
Awesome Tuesday face...can't wait to see what Wednesday brings.
You look beautiful girl!
and this buzz cut is going to change the world for you? come on gurl, pull yourself together. you came out of the closet, good. your gender identity is just that, YOURS. dont be afraid to live your life. slowly face your little fears so they dont grow. always remember when you fall down, there's no where else to go but up.
😔
~hugs~
Gorgeous!! Congrats to you 👏🏻
You are lucky. You are so pretty you could do either and make it work. ❤️
Your gender identity is no issue really you just need to be happy in yourself and happy whichever way you want your gender to be just be true to yourself if others can’t cope with it then that’s there issue and shows how blinkered they are to sexuality personally I think you look good keep fighting for what u want and always keep smiling
Nice
Stfu you look cute and passing
I think you look good enough to eat! 😍😋😘
You are picture perfect to me. Wow ❤
1. you look awesome
2. It's trans woman, not transwoman. Trans is an adjective, and should have as space between it and woman. You absolutely are a woman, and being trans is a subset of womanhood, just like blonde women and tall women. Transwoman is a thing that terfs like to call us, to mark us as other or not real women.  <3
i second this
And I third it❤️
I concur muchly..❤️😊❤️
Yess
Natalie Portman, Demi Moore and a million Buddhist nuns back this up as well.
I had never heard of this before, are you sure that's a thing? I've always used both interchangeably to refer to myself and never run into this before.
thank you for pointing this out!
I fourth it 💜
Absolutely :) 

Next time you come accross a garden variety ""gender crit"" and talk about this, there is an inisistance that trans women are not women, and that ""transwomen"" is what people should refer to us  by. See even Debbie Hayton's insistance on this. There is a refusal to admit that we are women, and that we are just transwomen, a ""third gender"" or something other than women. 

It's called out specifically in Whipping Girl by Julia Serano :)
Make it 5!
You're beautiful sis.
Make it 6

8!
8 but I also want to add you really are a god damn hot girl.

is my trans identity valid even though I don't experience bottom dysphoria?	"Me and my mom got in an argument over my transition, I came out about 6 monts ago and she is REALLY against it. I just want to look like a girl, and play a female social role, but I have no intent of having bottom surgery, and I don't experience bottom dysphoria; my mom however says that since I don't want bottom surgery that I'm fakeing it for attention, or, I just want to dress up sometimes and I'm not really trans. 

I'm fairly certain that she's wrong, but I don't quite know how to explain how I feel, or how being trans works. I also have this pent up anxiety that she's right, and I need a second opinion."	"The only necessary part of being trans is gender euphoria from a gender not assigned at birth. Is your quality of life better as a girl? If yes, then you are trans and valid :)
yes it is. dysphoria is not something all trans people deal with, nor is it required to be trans. if she's still iffy about it you could link her some articles on the subject matter. one for reference: https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/is-suffering-from-gender-dysphoria-necessary-to-be-transgender-c6de811f89c
Yes, you are valid. You do not need bottom dysphoria to be trans.
Being dysphoric with what you were given isn’t what makes you trans. Being happier with what you *become* is what does.
you don’t need *any* dysphoria to be trans! literally whatever combo of dysphoria and/or no dysphoria you may have is *perfectly fine* and there’s NO “right” way to experience transness!!!!
Your good. Dysphoria, even if it is how most trans people figure out they are trans, is not really necessary to feel to be trans, and you definitely will not feel dysphoria over every little bit of yourself. Feeling euphoria over your gender is a much more clear sign for if your really trans or not.
Pain does not equal validation. Those who tell you otherwise do not feel good enough about themselves. You are always, ALWAYS, good enough. There's no reason to believe otherwise. Stay positive, love yourself, and ignore those who try to make your life that much more difficult
[deleted]
There is no “minimum suffering required” to be trans. You can love every part of your body and still want to transition. The persistent myth that we HAVE to suffer to EARN this is, in my opinion, one of the biggest harms to trans folk both in making their existence hell AND in stopping people from ever coming to terms with who they really are. 

TLDR: your mother is wrong. Tell her I said so.
Let me answer that woth another question that has the same answer.

Do you exist?

Again, the answer to this question also is the answer to your question.
I don’t experience much bottom dysphoria compares to everywhere else
You are completely valid, there's no one way to be trans and if she's not trans she wouldn't know that at all. No-one understands trans people more then trans people so we as a community decide what it's like and whether someone is trans. I'm non-binary but I sometimes have bottom dysphoria and that's completely fine because no matter what you feel or who you are you will always have the right to validation. 
I hope it ends well and she tries to understand:)
You see most people have this stupid idea of genitals = gender.  If you want to be the girl you are but still keep what's down there, it's totally fine.  For me, it more depends if you feel gender euphoria from being trans and accepting who you are and not so much about dysphoria
Just going to put [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vcg2oj/a_helpful_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here as a friendly reminder
If I don't get bottom dysphoria and I am valid then so are you! You are valid!

You don't need dysphoria to be valid, just be you! For you are amazing!
No human existence and identity is defined by suffering, misery and self-hatred.

If you don't supress your emotions, you're not a real man, if you don't or didn't suffer from absurd and impossible beauty standards, you're not a real woman and if you aren't miserable from dysphoria, you're not really trans.  

/s
Others do not get to police your dysphoria.
Yes. You are who you are.
You don’t need bttm dysphoria to be transgender. If you aren’t comfortable being the gender you were born with. I’d say non binary or genderfluid is different and had their own labels . But I can see why she would think certain things aren’t true . This one person for instance. Asks me if I like ftm because they’re ftm . I look at their profile and they have non binary with they pronouns. Ftm is female to male and I don’t see anything of their part to try to make besides they them pronouns. So if you’re a certain label own it and don’t change for others
You. Are. Valid.
I've been really afraid of this as well tbh lol
TBH that part of your transition is none of your mother’s business
100% valid
you don't need gender euphoria or dysphoria to be trans, both ideas are medicalist. both can be signs but your trans identity is yours and always valid, whether you have them or not
You're still totally valid. If anyone says you aren't trans because you don't have bottom dysphoria they're just wrong.
I read the title and instantly went YES!!! I barely have any bottom dysphoria at alllllll and it’s not like there’s just one way to be trans, you can be trans and not even experience dysphoria because everyone is different
mane you just are who you are
Are you afraid that because you don't feel bottom dysphoria you are faking it? Are you afraid you are faking it for the attention? If so, what kind of attention would faking it give you and do you want that?
Trans does require gender dysphoria but it does not require bottom dysphoria. Just dysphoria for your assigned at birth sex. If you have dysphoria for that you are still Trans. Gender dysphoria and euphoria are required for being Trans. So yes you are trans don't worry about it. Imposter syndrome is totally a thing.
You are valid regardless of anything. You are a human deserving of respect. Love yourself, love each other.
yea
This is pretty much how I feel. I ain't even doing HRT, because I like my dick so much. Hoping laser, ffs and a boob job, will do everything I need and want it to.
Screw labels! Just be who you are and be happy.  What anybody else says doesn't invalidated you.  To hell with words this is your journey.
Honestly, your mom has no idea what she's talking about.  You can be trans without any dysphoria of any sort. Now, I suspect that the vast majority of us do experience it over one facet of ourselves (or many!) but it's a very individual thing. General rule of thumb for whether you are 'really trans' or 'trans enough' is, ""Do YOU believe that you are trans? If that's a yes, then you probably are. Being  different in society is never easy and we're under an especially nasty wave of hate at the moment. If your heart and brain tells you that this is your truth despite all that, then honey you are trans.
So as someone who’s dealing with this issue from the other side as my sister is trying to transition to a guy and I’m having a super hard time with it I’m gonna give my advice but by no means am I saying it’s right because I don’t fucking know what to think but I will say this… and i hope I don’t offend… I mostly don’t understand the need so many people feel to transition because I truly have plenty of self image issues and had depression for a while and still do sometimes because I don’t look the way I want or feel I should especially because I went bald early which really sucked for years but I think most people except for the truly aesthetically blessed model type people we all struggle with self image issues which k think for most(just how I see it) that’s what it boils down to and k believe acceptance is definitely good and important but being brutally honest I think many people think they have gender dysmorphia when they do t and it’s just struggling with self image and not being the pesos. We want to be and it makes us desperate for change in many ways which some people they feel like that’s a transitions. Now trying to speak from maybe how your mom is feeling a bit or at least maybe something you should think about,at least how i feel about my sister is… your mom truly probably lives and respects you as you are naturally and the person you’ve already grown tk be and wishes you would see more of your good traits in who you are in the inside and it probably hurts he that you feel you need to change who you are physically just to feel better when it’s such a drastic change and if your doing hormones or surgery it’s mostly permanent or semi permanent. How I feel about my sister is I’ve spent 28 years growing with her and live who she is right now and hate that she doesn’t live herself on the outside as much as k live her in the jnside and Ben g honest I think her feel g the need to transition is more about other issues about herself she doesn’t know how to cope with and conquer and also wants to be apart of the whole community because it’s a very accepting community but acceptance and short lived acceptance from strangers doesn’t typically help the core issue. I won’t rant but my honest advice… try and be who you want to be 💯 but don’t dk the hormones or make and permanent decisions esprit your younger like 20s and definitely not if your under 18. You have plenty of time to truly decide if that’s what you want and if you look wierd or off tk some people in “society” who fucking cares… it may be tough sometime moment tk moment but society’s opion means jack shit… for most people your close family and friend are the ones that truly live you respect you and know the person you truly are… strangers don’t and will say a lot of things to be nice but it’s not a genuine love like your mom probs it has. Just my advice
Yes. Totally yes. I am engaged to a person who I think is both male and female. Totally male when male. Totally female when female. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Doesn’t matter to me either way but zero genital change and zero confusion. 

Be who you are baby. You are female even if it’s just your insides and you change nothing else.
Your valid! There's nothing wrong with being happy with yourself and you don't have to have major surgery to fit in anyone's definition. I have no plans for any surgeries, dental implants sucked enough
the belief that a trans woman needs to get bottom surgery to be truly trans seems to be a cis centered mentality/ideology. you don’t need to conform to cis women to be a woman or to be trans in general. cis women are not the “standard”. there are plenty of trans girls that never get bottom surgery and don’t experience bottom dysphoria, so do what makes you happy and feel comfortable in YOUR body!
You are valid no matter where you are at and what you have figured out.  We are all trying to figure out who, what, and where we are in our journey.  I don't think it ever really stops.
I'm ftm and I also don't experience bottom dysphoria, I also don't want surgery down there. It is common that trans people don't want  surgery or don't have dysphoria in some parts of their bodies
I think that’s actually not uncommon. A lot of people don’t experience bottom dysphoria specifically
ofc it is darling <33
I know, personally, so so so many trans people who are undeniably men/women/enbies who don't have bottom dysphoria or want bottom surgery. I've lived in a female social role for almost a decade and personally I could go either way with how I feel about my junk. Ill probably end up wanting bottom surgery in the near future but I don't have like hyperventilating, crippling reactions towards my privates, I more just feel inconvenienced by it.
She is wrong.

I have a cishet friend who dresses exactly like my brother in law. Khaki cargo pants or shorts and a big shirt. Always. Is she less female somehow? Ugh. This hurts and infuriates.


I had no *awareness* of bottom dysphoria until I began my transition last Feb. Now I'd be on a table tomorrow if I could.

Your brain can only take so much trauma and as you relieve some of the layers, others come into mind view.

And by began my transition I mean having the conversation with my not soon enough ex wife and actually beginning to try acting and dressing as I felt instead of as a boybot using ""movement macros"".
The dysphoria I get is more like detachment or apathy. I neglected myself because I don't identify with my (AMAB) body. 

Now I get euphoria from every new change I notice.

Already have a few bras. Can't wait till I follow them out more.

Never noticed my dysphoria for many years specifically because it was so a typical.

Also dysphoria might hit you later. Or not at all.

Either way it is your decision not hers.

Thank your mom for challenging you and asking you to do some introspection. Then explain how you feel again.
Absolutely! Having any sort of dysphoria isn't required to be trans, and anyone who says otherwise is stuck in a really old way of thinking. Hell, I don't have a ton of bottom dysphoria, at least not as much anymore
You don't have to have any dysphoria. My girlfriend doesn't, but she's still very much trans.
Of course it is! I don’t experience bottom dysphoria either!
Yes. Period.
Valid
Yes. It never bothered me and I’m never getting it ✂️
Of course it is! Gender dysphoria is still gender dysphoria, even if you don't experience dysphoria about your private parts! You are still valid! Being trans is different for everyone and not everyone will experience dysphoria around different parts of their body! No matter where or what your dysphoria is or isn't focused around doesn't matter because it's still gender dysphoria! I wish you the best of luck with any and all steps you take in your transition and always remember that you and your identity are valid!
No type of dysphoria is ""required"" to be trans, even though it is commonly talked about. The most important thing is gender euphoria. Does being a girl make you happier than being a boy? Yes? Then you're trans! And that's all there is to it :D
I'm the same, just FTM. I don't really think about my genitals like that, I guess. I don't have that kinda connection to it. It's just there and as long as everything is healthy amd not trying to reproduce, I'm good. Also, with how FTM bottom surgery is rn, I don't wanna rush it. I sadly feel like my top surgery was a rushes mistake, so I'm taking my time on this one.

There's not *one way* of being trans. We're all on different paths
Dysphoria when it comes to your gender is typically in relation to how you want yourself to be seen in the context of gender identity vs how others choose to see you based of societal fuckery. Not every trans person is going to have bottom dysphoria; uniformity in relation to such a complex situation and journey is Foolish™️
Yes.
Yeah
100% you're still trans
I’m the same way tbh. You’re perfectly valid, gender=/=genitals
She's wrong.
Totally valid :) i only have testicle dysphoria and thats the only part i wish was gone which will be soon i hope.

Dysphoria isnt the end all be all. If you feel incongruent with your gender identity. Basically still dysphoria but the bits dont matter. Most of us are trying to normalize girls with the penis, not everyone fights for that but i think its fine since it puts people in boxes by forcing all of us to have bits that all match others that have the same gender identity to bits. But i dont think its right to force us to cut our bodies to fit that narrative. I dont need surgery to be loved.
I had heavy bottom dysphoria before I was on hrt and then it completely went away after being on it for a while. I still plan on getting bottom surgery eventually, but by your mum's logic I wouldn't be trans because I don't constantly feel displeasure at what's in my pants. 

Frankly it's a stupid opinion, because I know for a fact that if I stopped taking hormones I would be too miserable to live, and not hating my crotch doesn't make me less trans.
Fuck yeah! If you wanna be a girl with a dick, you go be a girl with a dick!
Yup. You're valid. 

I'm boutta go into something deeply personal that involves sexuality, please skip if it makes you uncomfortable.

I don't know if I experience bottom dysphoria or not. I have trouble telling, because I love masturbation and am used to that with female genitalia. It is quite possible that I am simply afraid of not knowing how to do that. I definitely wish I had a dick, but it's just weird for me to think about masturbating with one. I'm stupidly horny, and I'm sure that when I'm older, I'll have a better time figuring it out. 

Sorry for divulging into something weird like that, I just needed to share it.
Absolutely you are valid I don’t experience bottom dysphoria at all. I actually like that part about being AMAB 🤦🏻‍♀️
Yea

It’s valid

You’re real, met many other non op people who very much like having a dick, have one as a partner
I (ftm) don’t have bottom dysphoria either, you don’t need bottom dysphoria (or any dysphoria for that matter) to be trans
Incoming r/truscum users “uM aCtUaLlY yOu nEeD dYsPhOrIa tO bE tRaNs sO uR jUsT a TrEnDeR”
This is a message to all my brothers, sisters and nb siblings. For all of you who don’t have bottom dysphoria I am really glad. It is such a terrible experience that I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemies. You don’t need any form of dysphoria to be trans. As long as you are not satisfied with your agab that is kinda the only “requirement”. I want you to know that you don’t need to have a debilitating incongruences with your body, ie you don’t need dysphoria. The worst of all I would say is bottom dysphoria: basically falling into a depressive state for an hour or so cause I needed to go to the bathroom, that is what that feels like. Being trans is just a feeling and it doesn’t need to be caused by negative feelings surrounding your body. You are valid no matter what. All you need is just pursue what makes you happiest.
To me, yes
yep
Is my trans identify valid..YES! Next question pls
Dysphoria can be *a* sign, but not *the* sign. Because gender and sex (and pretty much everything else about the body come to think of it) are completely unrelated, you can be perfectly content without bottom surgery and still be trans. I get the feeling, correct me if I’m wrong, that your mother doesn’t know jack shit about trans issues and will never have to experience what you and lots of others here have.  
  
Long story short, your mom is just trying to cause you guilt and grief for being who you are.
I never thought of it this way! I've also never heard the term gender euphoria, thank you for the different perspective (^-^*)
Thank you so much! I'll be sure to check out these articles :)
Saving this comment to look back on when I feel unsure of my identity <3
[removed]
And you certainly don't need bottom surgery to 'complete' or fully be trans.
Fascinating, why do so many people have a differing mentality? This idea of what you become makes sense to me, but my mom can't seem to grasp it :/
Literaly all of this ^^^^ ❤️❤️❤️
[removed]
Thank you for your words! I appreciate the support, but, how am I to ignore my own mom? She's basically my only friend, and regardless of her transphobia, I don't know what id do without her
Thank you for this perspective! However, I find the words ""girldick"" and ""boypussy"" to be extremely humorous haha maybe it's my internal 12 year old...
[removed]
Well it's good to know I'm not the only one! But no Russians? I'm Russian though :(
Thank you for the kind words! I do have a quick question, how do you get the little flag under your username? I've seen a couple people with them and Im so curious!!!
Haha I love this! You are a good person random internet stranger! :)
You don’t need to be miserable or self-hating to have dysphoria. That’s a really gross generalization over something people can’t help.
Same
euphoria is the only measure of transness
no you don't.
Hard to say. Maybe she has an outdated view on what trans people are (very possible, given how little the overwhelming majority of the population understands trans issues). 

She may also be moving the goalposts to avoid admitting (either to you or to herself) that you’re trans. 

I can’t really say for sure, but putting your foot down and declaring your identity, not as something for her to question (because that’s not something she can do. Your identity is your own), hopefully would get her to come around. I can’t say for sure though.
People fear change, and transition is such a *radical* change that even people not experiencing fear it.

To them, they can't conceive making such a huge change without there being something untenable otherwise driving it.

To most cis people, I think the idea of an existential agony (dysphoria) gives them *kind* of an idea why. So many people have said ""VaeVictoria, you were *so* sad and miserable before, and we see that you're *so* much happier now. We don't understand the specific pain, but we saw the pain it caused. Your transition makes sense"".

And some people (conservatives) lack empathy so much that they just can't believe it at *all*.
This ^
I'd say that you should agree to disagree, just make sure both of you understand that you disagree, and won't let it get in the way. For example; regardless of your beliefs, if a serious problem arises like a nuke (as an extreme but obvious example), it doesn't matter how she feels about it if she's out of the blast radius. See it's a problem for you because you're the one dealing with it, all she has to do is help a little. Like, say you want underwear. All she has to do is buy it for you, what does it matter if she likes the underwear?
Also, even if you were just a crossdresser, then you still want the underwear, and she can help. Once again, she doesn't need to be thrilled by the idea. I'd say you tell her that if she really disagrees or doesn't like it, then she should think of it as a form of dedicated hobby to make it easier.
Most of all, whatever you do, don't be impolite. It's not that you're trying to get her sympathy or empathy by coming off as pleading, it's just important that she knows you're not attacking her or demeaning her. If she gets offended that you disagree, then... well, there's no easy solution.
Unless of course you bribe her by making a deal where she gets something out of it, but save that for if she's stubborn in not helping.
I wish you luck, and I hope she's trying to understand you and not change you. Good luck 🌈
You are 100% valid. You feel how you feel. I have had zero surgeries and not on HRT, with few plans for either. I still feel 100% like a woman, and I'll allow no one to tell me otherwise.
That's ok too! The language around people's parts can differ from how they feel about those parts of their bodies too :) Like maybe, the words might not be comfortable to use even if the actual part of the body doesn't cause dysphoria
Excuse me? That's so harsh, why are you saying that?
Dw its just a reference to a fucked up mission in a call of duty game from over a decade ago
You go to the r/trans subreddit, then click on the 3 dots next to the search bar and go to: ""change user flair"". I do it on an Android phone so I don't know if it works the same on another device but I hope it does.

You’re the one that understands the situation though. Just know that you *are* valid and you *are* trans (or even if you aren’t, that’s fine, you should just be able to be happy. It’s just that that points towards being trans), that’s not for her to question, especially if she doesn’t have an open view to how a trans person can go about their life.
Fascinating, thank you for this perspective! Is there a way I can describe my need to transition?
I see! Thank you for the advice. Hopefully in due time I can repair our relationship, I just don't like to choose between two things I love (her or my identity). Till next time kind internet person
[removed]
That makes sense haha, I just thought it was funny
Lucky, I have an Android too! And now I have a little flag :) how cool
not true
you don't.
Thank you so much! This is an interesting perspective, and a lot to ponder about. I have trouble processing emotional/social information, so perspectives like this really help me to understand the situation, and handle it in a way I can understand. I really appreciate it
I think others have nailed it. It makes you feel *better*. You feel *more* like you, and that's what matters.

Because in the end, it's *your* body, and you should have the autonomy to be who *you* are.
Well, you don't know anything about me, you haven't even asked if I'm trans. I'm not just some cis person lurking around trans forums. I would never use those terms to describe an individual trans persons body unless they asked me to, I used them here because they are terms that some trans people find empowering. Obviously, if someone does experience bottom dysphoria then these terms aren't going to work, but that wasn't the context of this post.

PLEASE tell me you’re joking. i don’t actively have bottom dysphoria but it feels really good to pack. you don’t get to tell people they aren’t trans just because they don’t fit into your little mold
why are you trying to force dysphoria on people? why do you WANT trans people to experience that? not everyone is gonna experience it, and trying to make them seem like they're faking it is bullshit.
Language that helps people is not disgusting, and I never refered to genitals in a sexual context.
[removed]
no you're not. you can be trans without dysphoria. you're trying to force dysphoria on people and it's disgusting.

Really thinking about giving up	"Hi all <3

I am a 26-y.o. trans woman who has come to terms with her identity over the past few months. I spent quite some time questioning, but I've been sure that I'm trans and not just a feminine guy for a while now.

I recently had a run-in with a pretty shitty therapist who told me he wouldn't allow me to access HRT before I socially transition and present fem. I'm pretty defeated now, since I look nothing like I'd love to (I guess it's a feeling we all know) and I would prefer to start HRT and medically transition while still presenting male, and then gradually and slowly transition socially while my body and mind adapt.

With DIY looking harder and harder to access in the EU and me not being able to even get appointments with better therapists while also being pretty damn broke right now, I feel like I should just give up now and accept that it was all just a dream. I think I'd manage somehow, I'd probably have dysphoria and gender envy forever, but I'd probably survive.

Rationally speaking, I know this is a terrible idea and will probably kill me, but I just don't know if I can handle transitioning, especially if I can't get on HRT."	"Do not give up. If you give up, you'll never be your true self. If you give up, then there's no chance of you starting HRT.

Decide what will make you the happiest, and aim for that. Good luck, sis! <3
[deleted]
I'm in the US and had to wait 9 months between first seeing a therapist and meeting with an endocrinologist. My social transition began when I absolutely did not pass in any regard, but I found small victories. 

I threw out old clothes as I replaced my wardrobe with new garments that just made me feel better when I wore them. 

I took that time to practice makeup and start working on my voice. This was also nine months of hair growth and laser treatments.

I settled on a new name and I started asking people to use it at all times. Same goes for pronouns.

Moreover, I didn't have money set aside for all this. I made do with Amazon Basics garments, finding things on sale, and scrounging enough money to afford laser treatments.

Looking back, I have no idea how I did it. I wanted to start HRT, but I couldn't, so instead I found some small way to be me every day. When I finally started HRT, I felt so relieved but I also did so while presenting as a woman. Honestly, socially transitioning before starting HRT turned out to be a massively good thing because HRT doesn't fix everything. It doesn't make socially transitioning any easy. It gives you the body contour you want and it is incredibly affirming, but even then, those results can take up to 18 months to fully appear.

So please don't give up. Find a small way each day to be who you are, to socially transition, and when you do start HRT, you'll get to focus on all those milestones!
Don't give up, please. This is not the end. Try to find another therapist. I don't know, if in USA exist paid therapists, but in Russia you can run a paid commission and get the approval for money. 

I am transman myself, and there were so many times when I felt down. I accepted who I am eight months ago, and I've had... different situations. Where everything was cool, and when it wasn't. But now I am really happy and woudn't trade those lessons for anything. Yes, my mom still doesn't accept me (and some people too), and I don't care xD 

Remember, even the darkest night ends and dawn always comes.
I honestly don’t understand why therapists do this, they treat trans people like children, like they’re in the position to give us permission to to certain things with our lives. 

You are an adult, if you decide that’s it’s best for you to start HRT, you do it. Therapists are supposed to be a support system, for people who ask for support and nothing else. 

Even if you end up regretting HRT, it’s your responsibility because you are an adult. 

It is not your therapist’s place to dictate what’s best for you (in their opinion) and they can not force you to do something that you don’t want to do. You are responsible for yourself because again, you are an adult. 

Your therapist’s job is to make sure that you are lucid, willing and able, that’s it. They can give you advice only if YOU ask them to. So your therapist is definitely abusing their role and crossing the line. 

Unfortunately you will have to fight, you will have to be assertive, if this therapist is willing to understand and fix their behavior, good, if not, on to the next and repeat, until you get what you want, and you WILL, because there’s no other option, this is your life and no one else’s.

I suggest that you go into the wpath website and check if there are any therapists in your area. Wpath nembers are usually better and more educated, at least from my experience
I don't know how rough things are in your country, nor do I know what your circumstances are. I can't imagine how you're feeling right now to arrive at this conclusion, but I know you want our thoughts.

In short: Please, don't give up.

If you want to take a break and focus on other things, I could get behind, but to actively hinder your growth and convince yourself that ""it was all a dream"" will only cause deep, terrible trauma in the long run.

> Rationally speaking, I know this is a terrible idea and will probably kill me...

I mean, yeah. You've kinda summed up my argument in your conclusion. You would be actively abusing yourself, so it's a fucking terrible idea.

> ...but I just don't know if I can handle transitioning, especially if I can't get on HRT.

> With DIY looking harder and harder to access in the EU and me not being able to even get appointments with better therapists while also being pretty damn broke right now...

It's scary. It's really scary to move forward when everything is hard.

*But, you're not alone.*

Find support in your country. See what your fellow trans folk have done. Make friends in the mean time, research and try to problem solve solutions. You've got us here, and countless brothers, sisters and siblings who have walked this path.

We're here to help, and we want you to be happy.

So don't be a stranger, K?
Giving up is not a good solution, especially when you have a goal and and have not been able to put forth your best effort. Look for a different therapist, a good person knows it is a long journey and never a straight line. Your also very young and have an opportunity for a great happy life.
There is also informed consent HRT. This is primarily focused on the US, but I see 2 in Spain. https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1423995620784807936
Don’t give up! it will be a long and hard journey to start HRT and socially transition but while you’re in it life will become better even before you medically start to transition. I know it seems like the next few months or probably even years are gonna be like sitting in a room waiting for your appointment but in reality there is so much more going on. I don’t know if anything I said is helpful at all but I hope you’ll follow your heart and don’t give up❤️
Sometimes, you think something is impossible, but you just need 1 good phone call with the right person to get the machine rolling

Think about it like this, if you stop now, you'll forever wonder if the next appointment would have been the right
Hey, I'm sorta newly-trans myself (or rather recently-realized). The plan you're describing is EXACTLY my plan. Transition in private while still presenting male. Been doing it for like 7 months now, and honestly it's going great! Doing laser, growing my hair out, HRT, etc...

It sucks that good therapists are hard to find for you. I don't know if you can just look for another one, or if you HAVE to have a letter of consent in your country.

I personally got lucky and I've got a great endocrinologist and a great therapist. I've learned a lot about HRT in a short time. I can say with confidence that it is absolutely something you can DIY if you start with the right information and do regular blood tests / understand your own health and the risks associated with each drug.

Again, i don't know if you can afford it or easily get it shipped to you. The whole point I'm trying to make in this comment is your plan is a GOOD plan, in a LOT of ways! Seriously. I hope you can figure out a way to make it work.

If you have any questions about HRT, let me know! I can't really tell ya where to order stuff, but I'd be happy to discuss my own testing plan, targets spelled out in endocrine society guidelines, etc... Or if you just want to chat. Good luck girl!
Don’t give up.  It sounds like this therapist is making you jump through shitty hoops.  

I know you feel defeated and it is not what you want to do, but you may just have to jump through those hoops to get hrt and be in a bad place for a while.  :(  That’s an awful situation.  But at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel if you do that.  

And who knows, maybe you will get that good look going anyways.  Think of it like this, if it helps: you are training in 1000x gravity.  If you can get yourself looking good without hrt, then once you get on it you will be fucking dynamite!
Here's a hug ＼ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ／
this therapist is transphobic bc he’s testing if you are really trans or if you’ll just give up already on this “trans thing”. so don’t give up and find another therapist or just talk to other healthcare professionals that can indicate a good person to assist you, you know deep down if you don’t be yourself it’s gonna be worse so why not fight for yourself with all you got?
Hey girl. Do not give up. It's like being in the middle of the sahara, dying dehydrated, and saying ""after all, I don't think I need that water"". It's possible, sweetie, and you can always go see suggestions others told off. I know it was already mentioned, but GenderGP is affordable and online. I have the Canadian version of it (LeSexologue) and it's online as well. Online services are actually easier, and like my dad says, ""you won't sweat your balls off stressin' in front of a grandma"", since it's mostly webcam unless told otherwhise.

Honestly? I know you can do it. I'm the same as you, and I think we're all the same as you! We just went through some big stuff, bad stuff even, but we don't back down, even at the lowest! You can't give up yet, and this community is always here to help!!!

I know it can be hard right now. I know the end isn’t in sight. I know these things because I feel them too. But it isn’t true. It’s just the bad voice in your head and mine. Telling you that you will never be good enough. But that’s a lie and we both know it. Because the end is in sight. You are so close. You WILL be a girl physically and mentally. But you can give up. Or that reality will never happen.
I don't know what country you live in but in the us there is informed consent clinics like planned Parenthood and some websites like plume and folx that offer hrt without having to go to a therapist there are more options but those are the ones I can name off the top of my head so don't give up there are always options for you                                                               edit: I didn't read all the way through I see you are in the EU so I guess what I said here doesn't really apply still don't give up I'm sure there are always more ways to get what you want/need
Can’t you just say you present as female while seeing the therapist as female?
I feel you. I have been pretty certain that I'm transfemme in some way for a while now, but I'm essentially a goddamn lumberjack. I can't even imagine what I'd actually look like, I regret not acknowledging these feelings when I was younger, and I'm terrified to even try cause where I live means it wouldn't be unlikely that I get hate crimed.

I already gave up loving myself years ago. At this point, why bother trying?
Start looking at ways to stealth if you are ready to socially transition yet, it can help you feel more like you and get more confident being yourself
Giving up will just make all the shitty ppl win, be who you are and ( though it’s rly hard ) don’t give a shit to what they think!
Don't you dare give up! You definitely need a better therapist.
Hey there,

No need to give up :) I was in a very similar situation and had to present Fem to the outside for about half a year before getting any shot at HRT. 

Let me tell you that even for being 27 yo having a very receding hairline and not really a female figure there is a lot of things that can help.

Have a look at shareware for those curves, if you have problems with your hairline like I had try some wigs and of course try to find some make up that fits you.

Of course it’s a lot and it most definitely isn’t easy. But IT DOES HELP A LOT.
Is there anywhere in the EU that does informed consent? I haven't been to a therapist or Endo, have only been presenting at home, and should have a prescription in the next couple days if all my bloodwork checks out. It was super easy. And I did all that in like, the most hyper conservative part of the US. What's the EU equivalent to Planned Parenthood?
Who are those fakhing therapist to tell you what you need or not.
It’s a shame that some therapists can be so ignorant, but stay strong. There are resources that will work for you, and you’ll find them. Dysphoria is nothing to mess around with, and you deserve to be rid of it. You can do this, and your future self will thank you.
I’m so sorry hun. You deserve to be happy and your therapist is wrong. If you feel you’re a woman then you’re a woman. Doesn’t matter how you present. Are there informed consent clinics in the EU? I’m from the US. I don’t know much about healthcare in the EU but in the US we have informed consent clinics where you can just go and sign a paper and start HRT. Hang in there. Sending you much love. 💜
I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. As someone who transitioned socially due to thinking there were not other options rather than as a requirement I would tell your therapist that it can be harmful. Since starting HRT my dysphoria is so much more manageable, the years of social transitioning would have been much more tolerable. I would try to find another provider. I went through a few before finding one that had significantly lower barriers (possibly due to my own work in previous years and therapy but still…)
This therapist needs to read the pre-release version of the WPATH SOC (Standard of Care). It’ll be published this Spring. It’s much more progressive and a lot of the old standards about transitioning socially and about starting HRT and the requirements for length of HRT before surgery are going to be changed. Hopefully that will make things better for us.
Please don't give up. I may be mistaken but I think it's pretty common for therapists to approach it this way. My therapist is awesome, I love her, and she is a specialist in seeing LGBTQ patients. She is having me do the same exact thing. Maybe there is something different about my case that is making her do this, I'm honestly not sure (I'm also in my late 20's discovering this about myself only fairly recently). I'm not trying to invalidate you - I know how much it sucks when you get all dressed up or take some Faceapp pics and are like GIMME DA E NOWWWW, but therapists are professionals that want you to work through everything that might be going through your mind before they prescribe you medication. Patience is key, and sometimes we have to do the hard work that seems incredibly daunting before we get the payoff we need : )
In which country are you? Maybe some of us could direct you to some lgbt organisation near you that provide trans friendly therapist.

This is the way I took in Brussels, I already had a t-friendly therapist but he redirected my to ""genrepluriels"" because they have a whole network of trusted people that provide care for us. Often those org are really cheap.
Hi Diana.

If you know that you're trans, then you're trans! 

I've read about how bad the appointment with your therapist went... I myself am scared of that, so I haven't even seen a therapist myself... 

But as the comments in that thread said, if you think that's right, then you can diy hrt first. You said that it gets harder to get here in Germany, but as far as I know, Germany is still much better than, let's say for example France... I don't think I've heard of packets being seized in Germany, and even if that happens, estrogen is not a controlled substance here (according to reddit), so it might get seized, but you won't get punished for owning estrogen. Have you checked out the subreddits 'transDIY' and 'estrogel' yet? I'm transfemme myself (at least I think so), and I'm wondering if I'm ""trans enough for DIY""... 

OK, what I've wanted to say is: DIY is possible in Germany.
(This is not medical advise! 😄)
Keep going! you'll get there someday
*hugs - hey there, I have been exactly where you are at around the same age, I made the choice to bottle it up and keep on keeping on. It was horrible but doable for just over ten years .. Now instead of just jumping in the deep end when I was in my early 20s, I’m was in my mid 30s married with kiddos, when all of those repressed emotions and longing to just be my true self came boiling over — tw -Self harm - 
-
-
-
-
-
long story short it took 5 attempts to un-alive myself in 6 months for me to have the strength to come out. 
Fortunately I was lucky to live in an informed consent state (US) at the time so I didn’t have to deal with another ignorant therapist like I did before to start HRT. I know things are totally different in the EU and you don’t really have the option to just got to another jurisdiction where things are easier.  
— nobody will judge you for giving up, but I truly hope with the support of others you’re able to find a way to keep up the fight and finally be you.!! If you need to vent, Cry, scream, anything, I’m here and willing to listen. 
- open for anyone who sees this, I know most of you are younger, but if you need that one friend who will always support you and do their best to motivate you feel free to DM me..
You are valid in your pain. And you are not alone. While HRT isn't nessisary to be trans, I know it helps. For generations natives have believed trans individuals were sacred. Depending on the tribe we still do. If it matters, you still are to me. I think it would be worth it to present beforehand to get HRT even if it's difficult. If you have any requests for advice on clothes and hair and what might help fight dysphoria or ""pass"" pre HRT I'd be glad to help the best I can. I know ""passing"" doesn't have to be the goal either,  but some focus on it to stay safe or just to get misgendered less.
That really sucks.  As a vet, I struggled for years to find a therapist that fit with my expectations and needs. Don't give up! It may be slow going right now, and the road may suck right now. But never forget your goals and who you are!
I wouldn’t say that’s a shitty therapist. That’s the same thing mine did. She told me to start off socially presenting and progressed from there with how I felt and I’m thankful for not rushing through everything.
Please don't give up. I know it might seem near impossible right now but it's worth fighting for
Hi!
My first attempt to get therapy went terribly wrong. She tried to urge me to come out to my family and to cut off my hair, despite me not being ready and not having sorted through my feelings yet at all. She gaslighted me into more doubt. I stopped going! 
Your therapist sucked and it is not your fault!
I'm in Austria and my counselor (from a trans help center) explained to me that
a) you can transition at your own pace
b) who and when you tell anyone is your decision! Yours alone, you don't own anyone an explanation 
c) it's the professionals' job to understand what you're saying when you explain your feelings, it's what they are supposed to be trained for.

My hair's still long, I still look like a woman to the outside world. I'm waiting to for my first session with a new therapist anyway, I'm getting the statements I need and I'm going to get HRT, if and when I'll tell the people around me that I'm transitioning I'll see along the way. It's my truth to share and your pace has nothing to do with whether you're trans or not.
hey, youre completely valid, and i hope you feel better in general soon :>

as many others have said, giving up isn't the solution. giving up would mean not taking future chances and not trying anymore - giving up on the future being brighter just makes both your future and your now darker, as it's harder to have something to look forward to. giving up trying isn't gonna get you anywhere in the end

there's almost always something you can do, but things take way too long and it sucks. stuff like mental health and hrt take both way too long to get started, and way too long to even show if its working, and even longer to get the desired result if it does. but that doesn't mean you should wait a lifetime for no change instead

if there's not something you need to actively work on or if there's something you need to or should wait on, try small things to make yourself happier, whether it be getting some euphoria from trying on a shirt, or simply doing something you enjoy! when dealing with a problem you need to wait on, it's often good to do something small to temporarily solve the problem, or temporarily or permanently solve a subproblem -
feeling dysphoric? do something that give you euphoria, stressed about work/school? find something that helps you calm down

though doing something correlated isnt always the best option, as you may not want to yet for any reason, or it just makes you think more about your problems, so in that case, just do something you enjoy and that distracts you

i hope you get somewhere soon, you're valid and deserve what makes you happy :>
I'm not trans but my daughter is, and I understand how you feel. She is only just beginning to feel comfortable with presenting in a feminine way outside our house after a year of hormone therapy. Can you find another therapist?
Why do you need your therapist consent?
Try to find another therapist. 

Also, talk to your regular doctor. Maybe they can give you an Rx. 

I don’t know what country you’re in, but many places have telehealth focused HRT companies and/or private practices that specialize in gender affirming care.
Based on your post history, I assume you're German. I am too, I started 2 months ago, even though a lot of therapists would probably consider me failing the Alltagstest. Using the website Transmann e.V., I managed to find a therapist who does things on an informed consent basis - essentially, he just made sure I have all information I need without asking too many questions of me, all on a half-hour video call. 

I got that appointment a week after having a bad experience with a transphobic psychiatrist. Bad experiences are so demoralizing, but there are some therapists who help make it easy. And, while I won't suggest lying to therapists, they do also only see the snippets of your life that you share with them...
if you are able, find another therapist. No decent or ethical therapist will or even should gate-keep you by forcing you to socially transition first.
I know what would make me happiest, but it’s not as simple as wishing and hoping really hard to wake up as my true self…

It’s hard to keep going, knowing that your dream may never come true
This. GenderGP literally saved my life. Without them I'd have been stuck on a 5 year long waiting list that I would not have survived
Wow, this looks amazing. So if I live in another country how much can they help with the transition?
I'm in the UK and this is pretty much my story too. 

If I thought i had to ""pass"" as cis I would never have come out. Instead i decided I could pass as trans, stopped caring what others thought of me, and started socially transitioning about 6 months before i got any HRT (which i got through Gender GP, BTW).

I came out to my family, my gym, my dentist, my work - and pretty much everyone just accepted it, even if they didn't understand it!

There's a quirky song on Youtube ""I've no more fucks to give"" and this was my mantra. 

You can do this.
I'm doing something like this. I hate the idea of publicly presenting femme, but while I try to get HRT there is so much else I can just work on. Starting voice training with online resources was a great decision for example. It also reaffirmed just knowing I'm trans and I can work on it when I am more dysphoric.

Not wanting to do anything before HRT previously made me do nothing ... not even getting a therapist to get HRT. I was stuck until I did other things. Mainly coming out, but voice training among other things led me there.
This is what I needed to hear. Thank you
I got lucky in that I found a therapist pretty quickly once I started looking properly. My GP also already wrote a referral letter for an endo. I got the referral in February, soonest possible appointment is mid August, so yeah. 

I'm using the time in between to swap out my wardrobe a bit and get rid of overtly masc clothing and replace it with more androgynous/fem clothing. 

In my country they actually explicitly recommend you wait with lasering until you're on HRT for a bit so the hair has had a chance to naturally thin out. 

I'm finally starting to take the looking for a new name thing seriously as well, as I felt too embarrassed to talk about it with my wife. 

Voice training is still scary though.
This is currently what I do, and tbh I’m becoming so comfortable with myself that HRT is seeming less and less necessary for my particular situation. 

I may consider HRT again in a few months, but for now, I’m loving even just my social transition :)
WAAAAAAAY too gatekeepy; that thinking just reeks of the 1970s.
It will never come true if you give up. So don't give up.
[deleted]
its pretty expensive tho if you ask me ... as a nurse i cant afford those services tbh 🙈😅
[deleted]
i live in a southeast asian country (ph), so i’m guessing they’re within my reach?
(Not the person you asked but) I can't answer that as we're in the UK but they are supporting my daughter with transitioning if you have any general questions. They provide an appraisal pathway that includes meeting with a counsellor, and prescriptions for hormone therapy. You have to organise your own blood tests. If you're over 18 in the UK you can use their online pharmacy not sure about elsewhere.

(edit for clarity)
You’re welcome 💕
I'm so happy that you're feeling this way! Continue to shine!! <3
Mind explaining exactly what was “gatekeepy” with what I said?
This, so much.

Odds of your dream coming true if you persist: less than 100%, but greater than 0%.

Odds of you give up: 0%.

I've also had the thought of, maybe it would all be easier if I just pretended I was straight and pretended I was cis, maybe I could bear it, and there would be no risk of losing my family and being attacked for who I am. But I know I would be miserable trying to be something I'm not. When I get those urges, it terrifies me. We can't let them take away our identity.

I wish you all the strength and only the best of luck.
That was my situation. Must be almost two years ago now but when I wanted to get in touch with the gender service here in Ireland I was quoted a wait time of a little over 4.5 years. According to my therapist that wait time has only increased as time went on
200€ sign up and 30€ a month. It's a chunk of change but when it's the only option what else do you do?
Wow, that's amazing! This has me finally feeling like transitioning is within reach! Thanks for referring this. 

I'm excited for your hrt, holding thumbs for next month!!!😁
It sounds like OP is extremely confident in her adamant belief that she's a woman. While a good therapist can certainly help the transitioning process, her current one seems to actually be making things worse: she's more dysphoric and is looking into DIY HRT. A formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria (and the accompanying letter) is always a good thing to have, it seems like overkill for HRT. Honestly, your advice seems to be bordering on truscum nonsense.

OP needs a better therapist and/or an informed consent provider like Planned Parenthood in the States.
[deleted]
thats right ... but alot of people dont have that kind of money .. i could afford it barely ... but i will try the ""normal"" way first 😅
Wich county are you? This social transition model they ask you is out of date!. I am asking in the minimal chance you were here in Switzerland so I could refer you. To my psychiatrist. Or get you another good one.
Oh wow, small world!
And yeah I've found most GPs aren't the most knowledgeable about trans healthcare, they might have heard a year or two before you asked that the waiting list was that long and just assumed it was the same.
Sadly I'm not from Switzerland, I'm from South Africa. 🥲 Thank you though, I really appreciate the thought! ❤️
Shit i know nothing about how is in South Africa. But i send you hugs and support. Is this like a governmental stuff ( like by law)? Or you can may be find another psychiatrist that use a different protocol?
Thanks so much.🤗

I'm a bit dumb, sorry. What do you mean by different protocol?😅
Like not forcing you to transition socially a year before hormones?, cause I get your point.
Oh yes, definitely.  My current one told me that be deals with transgender issues and after 3 sessions, he is yet to help me."	ufvtie	trans	643	0.99	2022-05-01 08:54:49
Am I trans?	I’ve considered myself trans for 7 months now (mtf), but the more I think, I don’t know. I love being called she/her and a female name (Skylar). I want a female body. But I’m not uncomfortable with my current body or voice. I’m not uncomfortable with myself even though I haven’t made the transition. Is that normal? I’m kind of freaking out I’m having an identity crisis.	"I’m going through the exact same feelings. I don’t hate being male I just think I’ll be happier as a female. Yeah that makes us trans! You don’t have to hate your current body to be transgender.
I'm not uncomfortable with my male body in general. But when I think if how I want to look in the future its always one femine step then the next. 

In the future I would much rather have long hair, slim waist, big bum and budding brests than be a he.an muscle guy. 

There is something very happy and contented about being just pretty and taking care of yourself.
I never had obvious body dysphoria, so things took a long time for me to line up. The earliest clues have been there since 3yo, but I only started connecting the dots in august 2021. By now, I'm pretty sure I've always been trans; just deadly oblivious about it, though.

The pattern I saw/see was roughly this:
- I've felt like there's some ""forbidden"" femininity in me ever since I was a toddler. I almost immediately, as if from instinct, felt like I had to hide it. Still mostly do...
- I've tried to be ""one of the boys"", but to this day, I get imposter syndrome despite my best attempts.
- I've always been jealous of girls; their friendships, their clothing options, their more open (in some aspects) gender role...
- I have an innate desire to be seen as beautiful, cute and soft, which I feel is hindered by my masculine appearance. These aren't stereotypically male desires, I guess. In my current form, I feel like a creepy stalker when socializing with cis girls, except if I'm very familiar with them, or if they're tomboyish.
- I obsessively try to hide my femininity by trying to ""maximize"" my outwards appearance of masculinity. Beard growing and grooming, massive amounts of body hair, rough clothing style, lowering my voice, ""male"" banter, focusing on ""male"" hobbies, limited expression of emotions etc. etc.

If any of these sound familiar, I'd advise to bring it up with a doctor. I did so with mine, and they said I was right to tell them about all this stuff.
You don't need dysphoria to be trans. It's all about euphoria. If you are happy and prefer to be a women then you probably are.
You don't have to be uncomfortable with your body to identify as trans, some trans people never transition for a variety of reasons. You and your identity is just as valid. It's about what you feel comfortable with
You're trans if you were male at birth and ask to be called she/her. You're not trans just because you have gender dysphoria, one tends to lead to the other but they're not the same. You can absolutely be a valid trans girl without being uncomfortable with being a man. If that's what you prefer, that's what you prefer and if that's the way you want to go, that's what makes you trans.
You might benefit from socially transitioning, although not necessarily from medically transitioning.
Similar thing here, all the signs point towards me being transgender but i'm scared to make that decision. Do i want to be female? Yes, do i think i'd be happier? Yes, do i hate being called ""he/him"" and my current name (picked an nb name when my birth name became uncomfy)? Yes. So why am i afraid to transition? I'm scared that i'll still hate myself if i do transition, that i'll ""never look right"" or that i ""won't pass"", i'm scared of the hate that i'll face if i do transition. I'm scared of so many things right now and nothing makes sense and every day is getting worse.  


My options are; live my current miserable life or explore transitioning and maybe find some kind of happiness on the other side. But all the uncertainty scares me so much that i feel almost trapped in my current emotional place.  


If i could just know what would happen, if i could just have that assurance i would be willing to dive right in...i just fear the unknown.
wait i commented on the wrong post

gosh darn it homepage, why did you have to make two posts on the trans subreddit appear right next to each other
I felt the same way 7 months ago before starting hrt, I knew I would be happier as a woman but I didn’t experience dysphoria in the same way I saw other people experiencing it. but now I’m starting to adjust to the hormones and I’ve never felt better ❤️
I mean it sounds to me like you’re a girl 😊
Gender Euphoria is the more important factor than gender dysphoria.
not everyone hates their bodies, voice or parts, but feel happier being addressed a certain way and feeling a certain way.

so I wouldn't say you're not trans just cause you're comfortable with yourself as you are
I have the exact opposite problem


Not comfortable w/ where I am now, but not comfortable w/ moving on to full fem



Though, I think it’s internalized transphobia of some sort. And fear.


Honestly, being comfortable being yourself is what’s important. It doesn’t really matter what you label yourself as as long as you’re happy
Yes.
If you experience any kind of gender euphoria when you express yourself how you want to, that is more than enough to say you're transgender.
Honestly, I feel the same way about myself. I don't necessarily hate my body (I'm afab) but I also don't hate being perceived as a male/boy or being called more masculine names.
From what I read and what many people say, its important to be comfortable in your own body , because there is no right or wrong about being trans (because not all trans people experience dysphoria or want to seek medical help, like starting T)
Everyone is different and has their own experience.
social dysphoria and physical dysphoria aren't always nessecarily going to show up to the party together, I'm FtM and I lived most of my life with little to no social dysphoria while my physical dysphoria was debilitating. I've fully socially transitioned now, after first testing out how it felt to have my best friends use ""he"" to refer to me and just generally starting to feel better about myself after that. you don't need to have both social and physical discomfort to be trans, it's totally normal to feel disconnected from just a certain part of your assigned gender. I love dressing in ""feminine"" clothes, and Im still am a man when I show up to an event in a dress. if you're comfortable with your body, it doesn't negate any other discomfort you've had, it's just what feels natural and right to you personally. what I'm trying to say is, your experience is solely your own and while other people can relate to it, you're the one who truly knows yourself and nobody else can dictate who you are.
This is my exact situation
Ask a therapist/psychologist/doctor, strangers on the internet are not qualified to give you this kind of psychiatric help
You sound like you are and your just experiencing some self doubt is all- I do too, but I’m trying to stop letting that hold me back 

Still scared I’ll regret going on T but like, what if I regret not going on it, ya know?
Same thing. I consider myself ""trans/NB"". Trans because that's how I want to generally be seen publicly. NB because there are times (~10% of the time) where being a boy feels ok. Gender is fucking hard for some of us, the point of the trans community is to support however you wish to express your gender.
I would say yes, you are trans. In my opinion, the deciding factor isn't how much dysphoria comes with a male identity, but how much euphoria comes from your female one. In other words, it's not about how unhappy you are currently as much as how much joy you experience in your desired identity.
In my case it started from that and then scalated. First I tought being a girl seemed better, then that I would prefer being a girl, then I started disliking my body (or understanding why I never felt really comfortable with myself) and now I hate my body a lot. I’ve been on hrt for 18 months or so and don’t really see changes and it hurts a lot. So yes, from my experience it’s normal but it can scalate
I was there but I just knew that feeling of longing every time I looked at a woman was never going to go away. I'd rather be a woman definitely.
It is pretty common for a trans person to not experience dysphoria at various points in their transition. The most important thing to remember is that cis amab people do not wish to have a female body even if they are comfortable with their current male body. That is a thing that basically only happens to trans people. It is also important to remember that it is very normal to only realize that you are experiencing dysphoria after transitioning.
You can me both sister, best of luck.
The single and only requirement for being trans is not identifying with your assigned gender at birth. Not dysphoria, not social transition, not hormones, not surgery, not dress, not pronouns, not name, etc. Only identity.

Most of the videos on [this list](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDz6AP8ieCe5hJFwXXtrLdh39nTOp3Y0Q) are fantastic
the people who say your identity is based on dysphoria are wrong. it should be based on gender euphoria. 

i personally never felt dysphoria until i thought about transitioning. some people never feel dysphoria. we're still just as trans as anyone else. 🏳️‍⚧️💜
Honestly, more important than dysphoria is euphoria imo. If you're happier as another gender, that's what matters. Lots of trans people don't experience dysphoria, but that doesn't make them any less trans.
I literally feel the exact same. So I’d say you’re trans and that’s the imposter syndrome talkin.
Yes u are normal  I'm trans mtf  I don't hate my body  it's jus wrong type but that's not my bodies fault
You do not need to feel uncomfortable with your actual body! Being trans is more about what you ""want to feel/what makes you happy"" more than ""what you dislike about yourself""
Hello fellow Skylar!
I went the other way around and for me once I started I was jumped RIGHT in. I wasn't dysphoric or anything but I was like I'd prefer to have a male body and use he/him. Once I picked a new name and pronouns that was it, don't call me she/her. Once I got on hormones I was like now I just GOTTA get top surgery. Idk if that'll happen to you but don't be surprised if once you start you get super motivated to do more. I'm not having bottom surgery cos I honestly prefer my birth genitals but man did I start out not feeling a huge need to transition and ended up being like hnnnng MORE
Same with me its fucking weird
Dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans! If you’re happy living as a certain gender, then that’s all you need. Gender euphoria is a valid indicator of trans-ness.
I'm not saying you're trans, but I had the same experience and I transitioned. I had no dysphoria, contemplated whether I was trans for 6 or 8 months, got hit with my first bout of gender euphoria and I couldn't go back.

Good luck to you on your journey, even if your journey ends with you being cis!
Being trans isn't as black and white as other people make it seem, just like gender itself! A lot of trans guys don't want to get top surgery or bottom surgery, and some even want to get pregnant! There are no specific requirements to meet to be trans, you just gotta identify as trans. 
I had this entire identity crisis myself when I realized I was trans, for a while I thought I wasn't ""trans enough"" or even just ""manly enough"" because I still love feminine things and I was comfortable with my high voice. As you go along this journey you'll find that it's okay to have the best of both worlds and you don't necessarily have to be uncomfortable to be trans.

Edit: do whatever makes you happy! No matter what, your happiness matters most
All that matters is what would make you happiest. You deserve to seek that happiness. If the idea of being a woman excites you, then that’s enough. 

Transitioning is as much about joy as it may be about pain. We do it to feel happier, regardless of how you’re feeling now - wanting it is enough.
Of course you still are! It’s valid to not have a ton of dysphoria it doesn’t make you less of a girl or less trans!
I sometimes tell myself that I might get used to feel comfortable in my own lies. I want to be treaten with the dignity that women deserve. I behave like I think that we should treat each other and I am scared of a transition but I feel the need to change fundamental because I am overcoming several trauma experiences and I want to be the family that I always wanted to have. I want to have a husband and raise children with the love that only a mother could give. So I want to become a mother. I am also MtF and just starting my way.
It's so difficult, isn't it?

Every day I go through the exercise where I imagine the ""turn into a woman"" button in front of me, and every day I press it. I've even started imagining two buttons: ""get my ideal male body without limitations"" and ""get an average/equivalent-to-current female body"" and I don't even have to think about it. It's something I've literally always wanted.

AND YET... I don't know. I don't hate the body I have, I don't avoid mirrors, I don't remotely conform to a stereotype, and I've even experienced brief periods of actual confidence while living as a man. I don't even know if my belief in my identity is anything more than ideology, different to belief in a zodiac sign or a religion. I've never so much as had a tattoo so all those permanent medical treatments and surgeries (and I would be seeking FFS) are incredibly daunting, especially based on such an intangible and subjective belief. Not being able to go back in the closet is a scary idea.

I can't say much other than that I relate... And it seems to be a very common set of feelings.

Much love ♥️
I didn’t really have a lot of dysphoria. I just new that when I did certain things I felt centred and happy and calm and that’s how I knew I was trans.
Depends, it sounds like you have symptoms of GID/ Gender dysphoria. I’d highly recommend a trans friendly unbiased therapist to talk it over. For many of us it’s also very uncertain at times but we know at quite a young age even before puberty. You have to ask yourself a serious and very personal question is it how you feel inside or is it possibly a personal
Fetish. If you find sexual gratification in crossdressing than I’d say there’s a good chance your not, however that’s not always the case. Keep in mind that we are not cookie cutter trans people, we come with different tastes and styles for clothing and different sexual orientations. authentic trans people are born not developed, try and remember your past and signs you may have missed or dismissed growing up… there should be signs as early as 5-7 years old…. We don’t know it then or understand it but we are quite self aware at a very young age where puberty isn’t a factor. Be cautious because some of us here are eager to be so inclusive and to welcome new individuals like a book club that people who are merely confused thinking it’s a lifestyle choice or preference to change gender often regret it’s later, therefore be very open minded about your options aswell as the advice from people including myself. This is not a decision you make to be trans it’s a decision you make to transition. If you chose to begin your journey understand that the world is full of hate and evil but if your careful and surround yourself with positive people you can transition and live a relatively healthy and borderline normal life.
If you're asking are you trans then you probably are. Cis people don't usually have these doubts
No, sounds like you're probably not trans.
..........
 did reading that feel awful? There's your answer.
It is absolutely okay to be trans without dysphoria. It's okay to want something more, and better, even if you don't dislike how you currently are. Be your best self, never settle for less ❤
You're trans if you feel that label describes your feelings. Not being dysphoric or euphoric does not exclude you from being trans, the idea that it does is truscum rhetoric.

Maybe you're a cis man who uses she/her pronouns and a fem name, maybe you're not dysphoric and trans. 

You do not have to transition, that's not what ""trans"" stands for
Dysphoria isn't a requirement for being trans, neither is transitioning. If you feel you are a woman, then guess what? You are :)
Being trans ≠ body dysphoria. I’m so sick of people saying you have to have body dysphoria to be trans! It just isn’t true!
Sometimes being trans is the euphoria you feel from being recognized as (female in your case). You don’t need dysphoria to be trans
Yep! Dysphoria isn’t a requirement for being trans. Dw, you “qualify” as trans if you don’t identify as the gender you were assigned. Simple as that, no’s things attached. :)
You may not be trans exactly, you may be a “sissy” who likes to dress up and be dominated but not want to be dressed full time
You can be trans and not feel dysphoria. There are many trans people who don't feel dysphoria, but they are still trans because they feel euphoria from being called by different pronouns like you you don't have to transition and you can do what you want! You can still be trans even if you don't feel dysphoria 


(I probably explained this terribly but I'm but this so you'll have to manage sorry)
I mean, hope you find your true self and the trans umbrella is real big!
You're still trans, don'tcha worry!
Being trans doesn’t have to be about dysphoria, and it can definitely be about euphoria!
Nobody can tell you what you are except for you, honestly. I'm in a similar boat in that I enjoy my masculine side but hella love throwing on some heels and makeup and going out looking like a bad bitch.

For the moment, I'm identifying as genderfluid. Part of me is debating whether or not I enjoy my masculinity simply because I enjoy the benefits of male privilege (got called out hard by my therapist on that one!) If I eventually do get on HRT, I'll flip my label from genderfluid to simply trans, but I identify now under the trans umbrella as non-binary by being genderfluid.

While it's nice to have a way to identify yourself, don't let an arbitrary term consume your entire identity. Be you, and enjoy yourself for what you are. Let yourself change and move as you want and use the labels as an afterthought!
As time goes on I get more comfortable with where my body is I still have strong bottom dysphoria but even having just my B-cup breasts isn't as much of a discomfort to me as much as I want D's I could live with my B's
Yeah I went trough this as well. I was never uncomfortable with my body, but if I could have been born as a woman that would have been really cool :p

Now I have actual boobs and I love it lol.
So i have all the symptoms trans ppl have..but one cis friend said you are too emotional to be a trans male..are cis male not emotional?
That’s how I felt - it was only after I started hormones that I realized that I wasn’t happy, and that I’d been numb over my dysphoria
It's easier to except others than it is to except ourselves
For medical reasons, dysphoria is considered more crucial. Medicine generally focuses on addressing disfunction and when working in that framework, dysphoria is more useful. 

However, when it comes to living in the real world, it is just as valid to follow what makes you more comfortable than to avoid what makes you uncomfortable. Follow what makes you happy.
I once heard this feeling put best on a podcast I listened to. The speaker was a MTF individual who started her transition in her late 30s. She said she wasn't unhappy as a man, but that transitioning made her realize she could be happier as a woman or something along those lines. It's exactly how I feel about my own (ftm) transition, I wasn't unhappy as a woman but I am so much more happy and confident in myself now. That said, it wasn't until after my egg cracked that I started to struggle with disphoria, or maybe I just learned to recognize what I had been feeling since puberty.
Wait Skyler/Skylar is a female name?!?

*enby name panic*
It’s normal to not be uncomfortable with your agab. Being trans is about euphoria, not dysphoria. It’s about being happier being another gender than about hating your agab. It took me a long time to learn that and I don’t want others to suffer how I did.
It's normal don't worry about it like legit there is no rush to decide what you are or Wich lable to use and if you'd prefer to be a woman and you identify as a woman you are a woman even if you don't hate masc characteristics
You're a valid human. 
Also I can relate, in reverse.
You might experience less dysphoria if even any is all, transitioning isn't about treating dysphoria its about getting a better life (if it fits) yeah.
i think we’ve discovered the ‘imposter syndrome’ of transgenders. i’ve felt like this for a little bit now, i’m not particularly uncomfortable in a male body but part of me feels like it’s the wrong one. but like, for the past 3 years all i’ve thought about is being a girl, and now that i’ve finally realized that im trans i feel very unsure. ur not alone in this, and i think it’s ok to feel this way, it’s just a little bit of imposter syndrome. kinda interesting to think about now that i say it
I don’t hate being female but as far as everyone else in concerned, I fall under the transgender umbrella because of having taken HRT and having had surgeries. In other words, medicalization is present but classical and currently obligatory belief in gender identity is absent. As far as I am concerned, I only wanted a particular aesthetic result (didn’t get it), as the non-transgender folks who get boob jobs and plastic surgeries.
The more I see this the better I feel, cause I was like this! 

The wild part is that as soon as you do feminine things, you’ll (probably) start feeling dysphoric appearing male. 

It is pretty wild to see you write out my feelings though, get outta my head you goblin.
yeah i feel pretty much the same way, but i dont think that makes us not trans
Hi, Skylar, I’m Skyler!  Nice to meet you.

I’m kinda in the same boat.  I think it’s normal.  :)
Dysphoria is not lineal and definitely not the same for everyone. Our bodies and minds are very different and you are allow to feel whatever you feel, to feel what others feel isn’t a requisite to be enough. You’re enough already.
being trans for some people can be less about the dysphoria when referred to as their agab, and more about the euphoria they feel when referred to as their preferred pronouns/gender ect
Skylar is a typically gender neutral name,, just pointing this out
Welcome to every day of my life since I was 14. I envy you courage. My life home life was a mess and I didn’t have internet so I couldn’t really talk about it with anyone. Still haven’t even though life’s gotten better
Does gender fluid or nonbinary sound right? Or maybe labels aren't for you and you just want to do whatever the fuck you please whenever you please and refuse to let people tell you to pick a side.
I don't hate my body but I do hate my sexual organs...do you?
You don't need to feel dysphoria for bey trans in fact gender euphoria is the best way to know if you are trans.

In my personal experience, I didn't realize that I had dysphoria until I realized I'm trans. I guess I was just so used to it that it felt normal, but more I started express my true self more I start d to notice it.

When I realized I was trans and started to come out us trans to my friends, one of them said that she has a dress that could fit me. At the time I didn't realize my dysphoria that. Being trans were simple something where all the puzzle pieces fit together. When I tried the dress and saw myself in the mirror I got this extremely strong and happy feeling tell me ""This is me!"". In short euphoria.
I..umm..i always felt different even the people around me said..i have boys body..when i was 14 years old..i used to pee while standing..i used to call myself a boy..luckily my grandpa liked my short hair..so i have short hair till now..i am 21..

I played with boys..i have more guy friends..i was 12 years old when i got periods..it was horrible..then i started wearing double best to hide my growing breast..i started wearing baggy clothes..the way i behave talk walk its really boyish..

Once my father told me to wear dress..i felt like suffocating..so when i was 19 years old..i came to know what i am..i was happy..i always got staright girls around me..even one of my friend told me..that there's boy hiding inside me..

So few days ago one friend told m a 100% girl..it felt so shit i cant even explain..
But i have some questions..
Why i dont like lesbian sex..
Why i never liked a lesbian...not even liked when i was called..
Why only normal sex turn me on..where i imagine myself being a guy..

Just i want someone to confirm..that i am what i think i am..i have nowhere to tell..i have already left my country..i live in canada now..i am really sorry for
Rambling here..i hope u wont mind it..
Just tell me i am trans..from the symptoms/signs i have..
I’m glad to see I’m not alone :) thanks
Omg thank you for this... been having eclxactly the same thoughts and didn't realise others were feeling similar
Me too! I started considering myself trans this past summer. Check out https://youtube.com/c/TransVoiceLessons, she is just so full of tricks and exercises for voice feminization.
yes same here it’s like i used to be super dysphoric and now i just don’t care and still like my new name and pronouns more and i wanna transition but i also get imposter syndrome and stuff ;-;
I’m glad to see that I don’t have to hate my body to be trans. I too feel like I would be happier being perceived as female. Don’t get me wrong I think I’d be a bit of a tomboy. Skirt stilly goes Spinny, and euphoria from wearing makeup go burrrrr, but I still prefer to dress comfortably.
Exactly. That stereotype is because it was so difficult for trans folks in the past to get hrt and gcs without playing it up if their dysphoria wasn't debilitating. For some people it is, but I think by and large (and I could be mistaken on this) most trans folks just feel an 'offness' to the world when in their agab. Like a little voice in your head saying that something is wrong, but you aren't quite sure.
I’m going through the exact same feeling, and I consider myself a recently cracked egg.
You don’t have to know where you’re going to leave behind the things that hurt you :)
Same
It's not the disforia that should determine how you feel. It should be the euforia that cements ""yes, this is right, this is me, and I am right""
But what if i am hating it?
Samey same! At the end of the day I’m just me, but I can’t help but think I’d be more comfortable in my skin if I was female. I’m miserable at times, but I don’t know if it’s because of my assigned gender.
Wow, all 5 of your points are exactly how I feel. I've been unpacking a lot of these feelings over the past month or so. Like you said, it's always been there, just so wholly repressed, to the point where I could ignore it. Like limiting my emotions, well that really lead to some bad stuff.

The desire to by hypermasculine to try and hide the deep down desire for femininity is huge. I would always be at the gym, love talking about cars, and so on.

I'm starting to have the recalls of memories in childhood that I think i've kept the lid on. Like how I would go into my mom's or sister's closet when they weren't home just to look at their clothes.

Do you have any desire for transitioning like in how you dress, use of pronouns, voice, etc?
I had always felt a little feminine. I grew up with my mom and sister, so living with females I thought it was just a coincidence. Then I met my current gf who introduced me to the term trans which I wasn’t aware of before tbh. I feel like it’s me but sometimes things can be conflicting lol
I can relate to every point here. I feel called out…
I second this. Besides, I will say once I started experiencing euphoria I started realizing the amount of dysphoria I had. But euphoria is definitely where it’s at.
This is making me feel so much better thank you
You don't have to say ""if you were male at birth""...  Also non binary people do prefer other pronouns too doesn't mean they are transwomen or something
It’s a little hard. I’m nervous to because I live in a very VERY Christian society and everybody is so judgmental..
Yeah true theres many cis women who have deep voices and hairy skin and they like it
Thank you for this, I really appreciate you took the time to type this. It’s making me feel a little better :)
Good to know we aren’t alone :)
Yeah I understand. I constantly question things. Like what if I change and then I end up not liking it or vise versa
Just the thought of me being female makes me happy so I guess your right, thanks :)
Thank you :)
Haha the imposter syndrome
I love the name Skylar :)
Ikr lmao
This is really deep and means a lot to me. Most of those points I feel the same exact way and I appreciate you taking the time to type it out for me, it means a lot.
Your probably right. I’ve had thoughts of being female as long as I can remember
That explains it like perfectly
I love our names! And thank you for making know I’m not alone :)

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Oh? I thought Skylar with an a was more female and skyler with an e is more gender neutral
Honestly, no not really. I don’t mind it. But I wish it were different.
Sorry for spelling mistakes..didn't read before posting..so😑😑
No problem! I’m glad we have a place where we can help each other like this!
Remember, dysphoria isn't everything when it comes to be trans. You should not be defined by your suffering, but your euphoria.
Well that’s perfectly valid too! Not everyone is going to have the same experience, there’s many different paths on our journey, even if it all leads to the same place!
A growing desire, which makes me even more neurotic about hiding any femininity; whether it's really observable or just my own mental image of femininity, I hide it practically everywhere. Family, relatives, internet outside Reddit...some two or three friends know I ""struggle with identity questions"", but I still can't bring myself to spill *all* the beans...
Being raised the way I've been, I blame my slow realization on the fact that my parents sheltered me from the whole concept of trans (and the rest of the LGBT+ for that matter). I still feel doubtful at times, but when I first labeled myself enby some years ago, it felt more honest than claiming I'm cis. Now, when I label myself trans, I in turn feel more honest than when I claimed I was enby. Even if I'll never feel 100 % certain, I think whatever label feels the most honest is also the one that points towards my true identity. In my case, that's transfem.
Omg this! I thought I was just fine before I transitioned. But I had in fact just lived in a disassociative state. Once you know what right feels like, suddenly wrong is sooo much louder.
Yeah, while I very seldom ""feel"" dysphoria, I definitely exhibit *a lot* of behaviors used to repress dysphoria. Still searching for that guud gender euphoria high, because I don't think I've ever experienced anything like it. Apparently cis people experience euphoria when expressing their gender, or so I've understood...yeah, I'm definitely not cis, judging by that...
Exactly what I went through as well
Well, if they were AFAB and wanted to be she/her then they'd not be trans.

And yeah non-binaries to complicate things, but given the way OP was talking, I assume they're currently not NB and aren't really considering it, so it's not relevant here.
Honestly, just take your time. You don't need to rush with anything. It's always better to think things through than to jump on and do stuff you might later regret. Just remember that whatever it is you're more comfortable with, you're still just as valid, loved and welcome in the community. No one's rushing you, so be comfortable and take all the time you need.
I'm glad to know I could help you with my ramblings! :-)
Yeah :)
Yep, I’m starting T soon tho- I can’t spend the rest of my life wondering how people perceive me and if I pass, it’s driving me insane. 

I didn’t know this when I first came out, I’ve never been in person since high school and just started in person college classes. So I didn’t think HRT was needed, like there was things I didn’t want and all but yeah.
What girl name do you like?
If it’s any comfort, OP, I’ve only ever heard it in reference to women - I never knew it was considered gender neutral
Hmmm you might start to hate afterwards...at starting you don't completely start hating everything it's a slow process...try things to know if you are trans or not
Can i ask you something?
Yeah I feel you. I’m essentially out to nobody except my partner. Even she probably doesn’t know the full extent of it. But she’s extremely supportive!

I guess we just continue to explore what makes us feel good. Hopefully eventually we can find the courage to “spill the beans” and tell our true selves to close friends and relatives.

Sending my internet hugs of encouragement!
Omg exactly!! It’s SO weird
It’s so good! 

A couple weeks ago my mom noticably avoided using my deadname for the first time and I literally cried. I’m like is this what happiness feels like
Ok I’ll take it slow thank you :)
What helped me was looking at it like you can always just stop if you dont like the changes. It happens slow enough to the point where you can get a feeling if it is right for you or not without permanently changing you.
I go by Skylar, my favorite name ever!
Okay yeah same, that makes me feel better :)
Of course you can! I’m so sorry that this got lost in my notifications.
I had this tummy-full-o-butterflies feeling the first time someone used she/her and the chosen name I'm trying out. I don't know if it was the euphoria everyone keeps talking about, but it was definitely a new feeling. I still get all giddy and stuff when people treat me to some of that same, sweet validation; just not as much as the first time.
Hi Skylar x
I had the same with my own name, Robyn. It’s gender neutral, and often used for femme people, but I just prefer the spelling of it over Robin. If I’m ever in self doubt, I Google the name and look at all the male celebrities with Robyn as a name ahah
I love that! It’s definitely the giddy feeling omg it’s so… It makes me wanna jump like a fucking bunny 🤣😭
Hii :)
Haha I see
For me it's like ""b-baka, i-i-it's not like I enjoy t-this or anything!!!""...I'm definitely a finger-twiddling lil tsundere at heart...

To make sure our community continues to feel safe here, we are now explicitly banning truscum, transmedicalist, and other gatekeeping ideologies.	"While reading this post, please keep in mind this is a safe space for identity first. What this means in regards to this post and this subreddit is that there are vulnerable people who are figuring their identity out, and while they're doing so, we want to make sure this space isn't invalidating or attacking their identity. To clarify; this _**DOES NOT**_ mean that you'll be banned instantly if we see that you've posted on truscum/transmedicalist subreddits in the past, just if you're posting common truscum/transmedicalist ideologies on the subreddit. This includes, but is not limited to requiring Gender Dysphoria to be transgender, ""Fake Trans"" people, bashing on identities you don't understand, claims of certain identities not existing, etc. Take note, that when making decisions on how to action users, their post history (or lack thereof) will be taken into account.

In general we have seen a lot of people afraid to post here because their identity may or may not line up with the experiences that other people have, they're afraid of being ""the out group"" when they are anything but that. We can't have a thriving community while also attacking those who use this place to explore that identity. Just because someone's identity doesn't exactly match up with your experience, or may be something that you don't understand, does not give you authority on whether or not their identity is valid.

Keep in mind that we've already held by this rule for a long time now, but we've been slowly pushed into making this rule explicit. We want everyone to feel safe here, and always have, and we have always made sure to action those who spread these ideologies before. The biggest issue we've ran into is that since it's not explicitly stated, we have had people afraid to report comments that would break our other rules with the idea of potentially remaining ""neutral"" when all it's doing is allowing truscum ideology to stick around when it shouldn't be. For the most part you probably won't notice too much of a change in comparison to before this new rule and post, but it should allow us to catch more rule-breakers faster.

Finally, as a heads up, we would like to notify the community of some upcoming announcements and surveys:

- [If you would like to apply as a moderator, please do so here.](https://forms.gle/hK6SvtTBBi36Jdk19)
- We will be going over selfies and their role here.
- Rules clarifications and reworking to make them more understandable/readable"	"good riddance.

Older, dysphoric, binary trans woman here. Good call!
a step in the right direction :)
I was honestly worried on joining because I'm a non-binary trans and have been met with some hate for it in the past, so seeing this makes me feel more comfortable
Honestly I might actually be active on this sub if this is true, I’m non-dysphoric and I’ve been really scared to participate in online trans spaces cuz it’s such a taboo thing in the trans community.
Question, will this general philosophy of banning transmedicalist and truscum bullshit extend to people who subscribe to Blanchardist nonsense and will talk about AGP as if it’s anything other than bullshit? I’d assume and hope that it would, but I do sorta just wish to check.
God this is ridiculously based. Thank you for working to keep this community healthy and welcoming!
Thank you for doing this and for reassuring that this is not a safe space for those exclusionary people. Much appreciated. :)
Does it mean warnings to those slamming those of us that identify with “transsexual”? There seems to be quite a few comments through the sub which vilifies us, but its how some identify. I have 20 years identifying that way.
I'm very happy to hear this. I feel like I was derailed from finding my true self by being told so many 'you can only be trans if--' type things, I should have been myself for decades now, not years. Thank you for making sure others won't be similarly discouraged.
I don't need to have experienced gender dysphoria to be trans?

I was under the impression that it was somewhat frowned upon... I have a deep desire to be a woman, but I've never experienced gender dysphoria. I don't know why I have such a strong desire to be seen and appear as a woman, but it's something that's been with me for well over a decade, maybe longer.. yet I don't believe I've ever been dysphoric about presenting as a male publicly.
Excellent news.
Win
Thank you!!!!! I transitioned to a woman for a spiritual journey of not identifying as anything, so I was nonbinary for a while until fully embracing the feminine me that I discovered, as well as recognizing some gender issues since childhood through many flashbacks but I had repressed myself due to gender norms because of so much bullying that happened to me and other gender nonconforming people who seemed almost non-existent when I was a kid in the 70s. This post is very affirming that I am no less trans than those who had major gender dysphoria. What matters is that I am happy with the reinvented me. I support every trans person’s journey for whatever their own reasons are too.
Per *Hate Speech (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series)* by Caitlin Ring Carlson,

> Hate Speech represents a structural phenomenon in which those in power use verbal assaults and offensive imagery to maintain their preferred position in the existing social order.

Transmedicalist gatekeeping is definitely an example of people with power / privilege using verbal assaults & offensive rhetoric to maintain their preferred position in a social order.

So this rule clarification is upholding Reddit’s Sitewide Rule 1.

^(I just wish Reddit AEO / Trust & Safety would recognise that transmedicalism is hate speech)

Mid aged pan trans here
Ok I’m someone who has been out of the community for a while.  What is a transmedicalist.  I know what gatekeepers are I had my share of run ins with a few of them back in the late 90s and early 2000s they were part of the reason I left the community. Don’t know what transcum are.  Forgive me trying to prepare returning to the local community so I feel these are things I should know.

Happy cake day!🍰
I'm not clear on who gets to decide and by what authority what a ""true"" transgender or transexual person is. I gets very confusing, and the ""acceptable"" terms seem to change with each high school graduation class.
So essentially, only people that agree with you are allowed? Even if they’re not spreading hate or even sharing those views here?
Can someone explain these words to me? I’ve never heard of them before.
W rizz
Nice call
What is trascum? I don't know what that means, I'm so sorry!
💜
[removed]
Here, here!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
[removed]
lol I had to look up what those words meant! What's the issue here?
I didn't know what Transmedicalism was so I looked it up and had a public transport company pop up

Edit: it wasn't a public transport company, but it was a hazardous materials transport company.
I'm 32, not sure if that counts as older or not, but glad to hear this <3
Hate is prohibitive to growth, but so are echo chambers
Yes, it's true, and if anyone harasses you about your identity, feel free to report them.
[removed]
Yes.

I didn't really think to include it specifically just because there's so much overlap between these groups, but that's why I included ""gatekeeping"" in the title, as I find it kinda fits under that.
What's AGP? I'm not too active in trans spaces and I've never heard of it before.
I'm not entirely sure who downvoted you, but identifying with an ""outdated"" term does not make one a bad person and you will not be banned for identifying with such terms, that's actually part of why this rule is made; gatekeeping identity is bad altogether.

Now on the other hand, if you go around stating that some other user isn't a true trans or that transexual has some special meaning that some people won't be able to attain because of XYZ gatekeepy reason, then yes you will be warned and potentially banned for that depending on how bad of an infraction it is.

""Transexual"" holds a lot of history, but that history is both bad and good, and the reason why it's been dropped by many people is at least partially due to that negative history, which I'm sure you're aware of.

Truscum/transmedicalist ideology are the main concerns, as well as the offshoots of those ideologies, like the ones centered around AGP. Anything that asserts that someone isn't who they say they are due to arbitrary rules is the target here.
[D] Since I’m also a bit gun shy (on other issues not this one) I wanted to point out there’s also another subreddit r/honesttransgender with a wide range of opinions and less social policing.

I just wanted to mention it, since I didn’t know it existed previously.  It has a mix of people so no viewpoint it seems is completely in the minority.
You definitely do not need dysphoria to be trans. Be who you are, whatever makes you most happiest.
You don't, but I also don't know if you've ever explored this site [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)
If you read the actual WPATH standards, persistently and consistently feeling that you should be or want to be another gender IS Gender Dysphoria.

The way clinicians define it is not how the ""street"" defines it. So if you hear doctors or psychologists talking about gender dysphoria, they also mean what you described. 

Tweens on Tumblr fell for some etymological fallacy stuff and said ""dysphoria means a bad thing so if I want to be another gender that's gender *euphoria*"" and here we are. 

But doctors generally speaking are not listening to what kids on Tumblr say and have no idea that madokahime1997 DECLARED in 2014 that what you're experiencing isn't GD, hashtag I don't make the rules
Ok, i am late. Just want to say, strong desire to present as other gender than the one given at birth I think counts as dysphoria,you just experienced less than others maybe
I just wish Reddit would recognize the blatant brigading they do, as well as the hate speech, it's tiring dealing with their bs when there's more important things to moderate.
Honestly none. Having it is a big ol' +, but taking out the trash is the big job anyways.
Nice!
Us genz who are still exploring our identities are grateful to have those with experience like you!
Truscum and transmedicalist are relatively similar.

Truscum often believe that you need dysphoria to be transgender.

Transmedicalist often believe that you need to either want to, plan to, or are currently, transitioning medically to be transgender.

Both gatekeep the community in different ways and have their own quirks. Oftentimes there is quite a lot of overlap between them. Neither ideology are a positive impact on the community.
<3 Thanks!
It's really simple; the trans person decides. Anything/one else is gatekeeping.
1. It doesn't say that.
2. Gatekeeping identity goes against rule 6, we've been enforcing this rule long before it was instated visibly.
3. If you're going to come up with strawmen, come up with a better one.
4. If you participate in a hate community, that does not mean we immediately ban someone. If they bring that hate here from that community, then yes they will be banned.


This is a safe space for all trans people, if you're going to gatekeep that identity, or otherwise attack other users about who they are or why they exist in the way they do, you will be banned.
No, only people that don't needlessly spread hate or cause harm. There's a difference between disagreeing with someone and denying their existence.
Transmedicalist and Truscum are the same thing. Truscum is just an insult to describe transmedicalists (pronounced true-scum).

Transmedicalists believe you must have gender dysphoria to be trans. Many LGBTQ+ people disagree with this because we believe that anyone should be able to live in a way that makes them happy so long as it doesn't hurt other people. Being trans is not about having dysphoria; it's about living in a way that makes us happy.
To be clear, which words?
?
""Truscum and transmedicalist are relatively similar.

Copied from OP's comments to some people (ik your comment is 3 days old but just commenting incase u weren't sure)
From my GenX POV, no!
Nah I’m gonna keep calling myself trans, it pisses off people like you and that’s kinda funny to me.
That’s fair, I should’ve assumed as much, and I apologize not for just taking that from the post originally.
Honestly, personally if I was you, I’d stay that way and try to just never learn about that nonsense, it is a harmful idea/mindset and has no benefit in knowing about.
I won't go into detail, but it's yet another theory that paints trans people (particularly women) as nothing but perverts. You can look it up for the sake of general knowledge, but it's probably nothing you've never heard of before, so you wouldn't miss out on much if you chose not to.
AGP is just disguised self-loathing.
Oh yes, I know my history, been identifying as transsexual since 2004 so talking 19 years with that identity, just some groups need to stop telling us to stop using it as its meaningful term to many also.
It's a safe space for transmeds to spread their bs under the guise of it ""just being an opinion"". If you speak out against it you will be socially shamed, it happens all the time.
Oh. I genuinely thought that was a true thing, because other trans people have always told me that. Don’t hate on me, but can I have a little explanation of how? I was always told that having dysphoria is a big part of being trans, and being that I have it I always assumed that was true.
I have this conflict that goes on in the back of my head sometimes that sends me through a phase of losing all motivation towards expressing myself, though... I'm not sure exactly what the conflict is, or why, but I'll get in this rut where I just don't have the energy or motivation to wear my feminine undies or clothes, where I question myself, sometimes even think I might not be able to pass, or think that maybe I should push everything back down because it'd be easier than facing all the changes.. I'm sorta entering back into that rut where the joy and happiness of wearing my girl-mode clothes is dissipating, lately, as well.. I wish I knew why that happens. I'm glad I don't need to be dysphoric though
Ahh but not every can afford or even survive the medical treatments due to other conditions.  Everyone experiences gender differently. I just don’t get it and I’m an ex self hating trans person.  It’s as bad as the girl I ran into advocating hatred of all cis people.   Just plain dumb.   Thank you for the definitions.
Ah I see. Thanks for answering. I think I'm gonna keep the Hazmat Transport definition. A lot less toxic.
Gen Jones, if you know what that is, here. I agree. On both.
FYI that user was banned for being transmedicalist. We don't tolerate that so if you encounter anyone else like that please report the comment or send us a modmail.
Nah, no worries, it can be hard to word rules exactly right.

For example, even rhough this is a ""new rule"" it's existed under other rules informally, so for us nothing really changes, this is really just a formality so people know where we stand as a subreddit.
....you're probably right honestly.
I think I've heard enough...
It's often a big part of being trans, but it's far from being required.

Not all trans people go through the same journey that we do, and some experience their gender in different ways. All that really matters to me is that they are respectful towards others.
It should be noted that OP said “want to” when referring to transmedicalist beliefs. As long as there is a desire to transition medically (like with hormones and surgeries) it counts as transmedical.
The very last section of boomers :3

TIL - Thank you! <3
Oh wait, I've just realised your original comment is 10 days old. Sorry for necroposting

Its pretty bad that people like this are going around the community spouting hate. Like, what about all the trans people who are comfortable with their bodies, just not their expression? Those people are just as worthy of the trans label as the rest of us.
Yeah but it's still pretty callous. People often have to hold back what they want and need because of family, scope of opportunities, etc.

For example Patrick Califia didn't transition until after his mother passed away.
You're Welcome! We're the most sarcastic generation too. Like, yeah sure knock yourself out, I'm sure it will work out great for you.<eye roll> Because we got screwed first by the f'ing boomers! jk. some of my best friends are boomers! <snark
No worries, I kinda wanted to know
The definition of being transgender is not identifying as your gender identity, that's all. Gender dysphoria is closely linked to being transgender, but is not only experienced by trans people (IE cisgender men with gynecomastia, cisgender women with a beard).

This is why being transgender is not necessarily something that requires you to have gender dysphoria, and is not linked directly linked by it either.

Keep in mind, I'd argue that being transgender isn't a choice, as identifying as something outside of your gender assigned at birth, isn't a choice. It's the same as being gay or asexual, neither of those are a choice, why would gender identity be?
Gender expression is not the same as gender identity. GNC is not gender identity. A man can wear a dress and a woman can be masculine, that’s what GNC is and what gender expression is. It has nothing to do with how you identify. A GNC person can be trans but not all GNC people are trans.
The most sarcastic generation is teenagers. Regardless of what time or place, it's always the people in high school
Yeah I just mean a lot of people get very dysphoric when they are forced to wear certain clothes"	10eh4a2	trans	636	0.99	2023-01-17 16:56:33
I've got stupid question for trans people	"(I guess If It is anyhow triggering It could trigger questioning your gender identity)

Imagine that you've been cloned, your clone is genetically identical, idk about soul and definitely does not have any of your experience or memory. Do you think that your clone would also turn out to be trans or not? Btw I'm definitely blaming Danny Phantom for that question."	"Answers are going to vary heavily based on interpretations of the etiology of transness, and while we mostly agree basically it is not mutable in the person who has it, people who believe it is rooted in neurological processing, body mapping, natal hormone exposure, or post natal identity formation (this is not an extensive list) will probably all have different answers for that.

The first two may be genetic, so yes. The latter two aren't so no.

Personally, I don't know, but I once knew a pair if twins who ended up both being trans men, and I always think about that when this question shows up.
I don't know. Being trans can come from many different paths; some of which are mental, many more are physiological. It's not a simple yes or no question because we aren't computers, we're humans. We exist outside the concept of ""true"" and ""false"". We can exist in between or outside of this our that, yes or no, and black and white, so there really isn't a way to say yes or no!
A clone of me would be a clone of me. 

So, yes, they'd be trans.

It's not in my DNA, but in the rush of estrogen that came down the tube after the first trimester.

It would be, well...

Another me
Yep.  Unless it was a completely different person mentally/emotionally, they’d be the same.

Asked another way, imagine you’ve been cloned in the manner you describe.  Would your clone have the same interests?  The same tastes?  Would it love the same people?
If humans were deterministic machines yes.

But since we are not I'd say we can't answer without ""observing it"". Id say most likely yes, since even 21 years of reinforcement against my gender was't enough to make me think I'm not. So without any of it, it would be an instant yes.

This sort of question sounds like a philosophical movement,I think, where the idea was that everything is deterministic, and that free will is an illusion. Idk what the name was, but def heard of it'.

Edit : okay that was just ""determinism"", what I meant. Looked it up a bit.

I feel like that question, and its implications sound interesting from a philosophy perspective. But im not really well-versed on it so that's just my 2 cents here. I used anecdotal experience with an assumption to answer.
probably yes. I expressed weird gender feels very early (like 3), and everyone tells me my late grandfather would've transitioned if that was an option for him, so I'm pretty sure it's genetic for me
This doesn’t have to be hypothetical because identical twins exist! They can be compared to fraternal twins and to other siblings to see if the relationship is higher and the data supports that the congruence is overwhelmingly high in cases of identical twins. https://genderanalysis.net/2018/03/pervasive-misrepresentation-of-twin-evidence-for-a-genetic-component-of-gender-dysphoria/
Humanity as a whole is not scientifically or culturally ready for the answer to this question.
I would say if I assign them non-binary at their birth(clone creation time), they wouldn't be trans. Because I am non-binary, but I was assigned something else at birth. I think that would be how that works 😵‍💫
It's unclear. Transness seems to develop early, but there's almost certainly more to it than simple genetics. The environment in utero could play a role. Studies have shown that when a mother gives birth to boys, future boys are more likely to be gay. It's probably due to maternal hormones, so something similar could affect trans kids. There's just a lot we don't know.
There are no stupid questions except the ones that aren’t asked. I personally believe that there is no such thing as a soul, only a perceived mental image. To answer your question, I think that only copying the genetic code over to a new version might not yield a clone, but rather an alternate version of oneself, with choices not yet made that would impact the appearance. Additionally, my opinion is that all minds, when it comes to thought process, start completely blank, save for basic function and possibly disorders that may manifest later. I would say that without any experiences or memories, it is remarkably unlikely for one’s clone to turn out like anything resembling the original
As long as the clone gets my brain and gender dysphoria yeah it would be
Well if it doesn't have my soul, it means it either has a new one or none at all, so... I'm going to assume no.
this is difficult, I have decent parents and know I'm probably living in the closet, sooo, there would be a better way of doing this. 

as clones need to grow up and such, this'll take along time

so, get 3 clones, 

 put nu1 into a extremely supportive, all queee type house hold.

put nu2 into a neutral household, where one wouldnt need to be afraid to come out, but might.

put nu3 into a household of extreme Conservative Catholic House hold that actively shows their hate for prude.

now we would have to monitor the clones for their whole lives without them knowing, otherwise it could make the experiment biased.

the families can't know if the person the clones came from is queer, bias 

we need someone all 3 go to, never seeing each other, never confusing them, that even the one growing up in the Conservative house hold will come out to. 

the results is where the problem arises,

if the  all 3 come out, we can assume biological
if nu1 and nu2 come out, we can say itsprobably a mixture of biological and environmental
if nu1 alone comes out, it's all environmental 
if  nu3 is queer phobic, that will show that homophobia and the such is environmental (which let's face it is already proven, but you need to explore all result types)
if nu3 and nu2 are both queerphobic, it's a mixture
if all 3 are queer phobic, then it's biological, or is just a anomaly

the best way to assure reliable out comes is to have about 100 of all families, meaning 300 clones, now let's say we have 3 scientist or what not to each family to try and assure reliability  that's 1200 people, now let's assume that each family is only a 2 parents, one child type family, that 1800 people. now let's say we have 6 generations of researches assuring reliability in the one life time of a clone, skyrocketed to a total 6300 people if my maths is correct. all dedicating their lives to an experiment. you loom me in the eye and say that someone won't cause bias. 


this will could show a few things.
1. whether clones can be trans/queer (cause let's face it, if its just a straight up clone, without any knowledge, how would it express queerness?)
2. whether its environmental or biological.(I'm not a bug fan of saying either, cause imo they're both wrong but Idk a third option)
3. how long it takes to come out..
My clone would be too
Probably, though them realizing it would depend on how they're raised, but we'd either duel to the death or become an unstoppable duo when we meet
Maybe
I would believe so we arent Trans due to our experience but the way our brains are wired. Though saying we would be the same person no, they would have different experiences.
Yes, my clone would be. Looking back me being trans was pretty obvious from a young age. And with that I mean from 3 years old already.
Huh, that’s an interesting question…

I guess I’d expect a perfect clone of myself to be trans. I’ve had these feelings for as long as I can remember, and I assume I was just born with them. It’s not like there was an inciting incident that made me trans or anything. So, I figure my clone should have those same feelings, too. 

I’ll turn the question around on you. Do you think _your_ clone would turn out transgender or cisgender?
I’d say yes? As long as like the brain is the same I think that person would still be trans. Because like I didn’t learn to be trans with like life experiences and stuff, it’s just who I am and who I’ve always been.
I absolutely love this love this question. I don’t think it’s transphobic it’s more of a umm; deep thought or mind game. 

Either way good question. 

If I had a clone and it was raise in the last decade 2010ish ya probably. 
But only if it had an open supporting family that talked about lgbtq. It was very hush hush let’s not talk about the gays house hold until I moved out and my mom was like dude when the fuck are you gonna come out we know you’re lgbtq. 

If my school wasn’t also just homophobic af that help. 
We had a GSA but it was very that’s where the light doesn’t touch Simba don’t go there mentality. 

Soo eventually the clone would transition but only in a perfect world would it do it earlier than I did. 
And I do blame a fair amount on Covid much like others here on Reddit that forced coming to terms with who u are inside with no outlets forced me to be me.
Personally, I think that I'm trans due to excessive exposure to estrogen in the womb, my mother didn't know that she was pregnant, and she took estrogen pills throughout the entire pregnancy, so I think that's why I came out the way I did. If I was cloned, and the clone wasn't exposed to estrogen the way I was, he'd probably be a cis man, but that's just my opinion.
This is largely dependent on what hormones you get in the womb. Provided that the hormonal cycles are the same as mine were during the clones gestation, it's very likely they would also be trans. Any variance in that, I couldn't say for sure.
Idk
Why does this question this sort of what if philosophical question need to be asked? Opinions are opinions wishful thoughts are wishful thoughts. Idk ask my clone if they’re trans. I can’t know who they are until they tell me who they are.
No because there are so many variables that probably affected me growing up.
Eh, probably, it would depend on a lot of stuff as to wether they knew or not lol
Higher likelihood than average, but not a guarantee by any means. There are actual twin studies to this exact question.
My identical twin niblings are trans.
Well if it’s a completely perfect 1-1 clone, they’re probably guaranteed to have GD ? I mean we don’t understand GD a large amount yet, but we do know one of the multiple possible causes is stuff in prenatal development (I forgot what happens and I’m too lazy to find it rn I just woke up). Because of that I’d assume their biology would set them on the same path.

As for me myself- DEFINITELY yes my clone would have because I experienced gender dysphoria for 5 years before I found the term or even knew what being trans was. There’s no way in hell my clone wouldn’t be trans, and I’d make sure my clone got representation so they didn’t have to argue with themselves for years thinking they’re weird. Nobody ever told me about GD or what being trans is, yet I’ve just always had the same emotions long before I discovered anything about them. Learning about transgender stuff didn’t push me in any direction it just gave me a definition and acceptance for the feelings I’d been fighting for 5+ years.
If one twin is gay or trans the other twin is more likely to be gay or trans but its not a guarantee. The same logic would follow cloning and even if the clone isn't trans that wouldn't nullify the existence of trans people because an N of one isn't good data and the small diasportic nature of trans people and whether they have the means to come out already makes trans studies hard.

In a dream scenario you would have to have a large sample of thousands of clones and figure out how many came out as trans over an entire lifetime, then do statistical analysis to see what effect genetics had on that outcome.
for me personally, no probably not. I actively avoided pretty much everything until this year (only 16 so not saying much) and i wouldn't have noticed it was even an option if i hadn't accidentally run into a group of people from our schools pride club.

one heck of a coincidence that wouldn't have happened otherwise because it was *so specific*
I guess it depends on how the cloning works. if it is like an identical twin, I think there is a higher likelihood both twins are trans but they aren't always both trans.

The actress Laverne Cox has an identical twin brother who isn't trans, who interestingly plays her character pre-transition. (I assume in flashbacks- I haven't seen the show)
If everything's the same, it means the brain also is so yes
Yes. He would also know dirt thing after some days of living that he’s actually a man, despite his body. 
The only reason I didn’t notice earlier is for the things I lived, and since he didn’t live any of that he would totally notice lmao
Yes. I have a naturally low T and can only assume it is likely genetic based on what I've read. This means that my clone would be ""resistant"" to it as well, which would probably limit T exposure in utero leaning the brain toward the female side.

Even if all that was garbage, a lot of signs and behaviors I associate with being trans date back to puberty and earlier, and were something I struggled with again and again before I accepted it. Even if knowledge and experiences leaned her the other way, I suspect she'd still feel the same way on the inside, but do exactly what I did and try to bury and suppress it. Doesn't work, I promise. It just finds new ways to express itself.
Genetically, you also have to take into account epigenetic factors as well 🤷‍♀️
I feel like it’s still be queer/gender queer. I’d likely just be plain nb than transmasc probably lol
Maybe, maybe not. I’d assume that my transnesss is the product of both my genetics and my upbringing so really it’s anyone’s guess what my clone would turn out like. 

Identical twins can be different in terms of their queerness (i.e. one trans and the other not) so I’d assume a clone would work about the same.

Well on one hand there are the physiological aspects to being trans. My neurological makeup gave me a positive mental effect when I started HRT, but the matter of why and how my brain came to be developed for such an outcome is one giant unknown. Is it genetic, a product of the hormonal balance of the womb, developed through post-birth brain development or some combination of all three or the result of some other input?

Personally, I don’t think it matters. I’m trans and back when I didn’t think I was I spent all my time thinking about hypothetical alternates to myself that were trans. I guess by just becoming who I was all along, I stopped caring about hypothetical other versions of myself.
Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope. I’m not answering that. My brain hurts. I’ve literally got a headache now.
Question gender? Yes, absolutely. Realize I'm a trans man? Probably. Come out? That's not likely. A lot of my environment and random circumstances are what led me to come out. I've got supportive parents and friends and struggled like hell to find the nerves to come out. I can't say with certainty that in a less optimal situation I would have found the confidence.
Spoiler horizon Forbidden West:

>!i was wondering the same things after playing Horizon Forbidden West. Not with gender identity but with sexual orientation!<
Yes. I don't have a logical explanation but I think it would
no idea and i dont give a shit
We do not know what causes people to be trans, only that it’s not a choice. I believe there was a study that showed that identical twins are more likely to both be trans than typical siblings. I don’t remember what it said about fraternal twins. It’s likely a combination of genetic factors and hormones if I had to guess, but I’m not an expert and it is not known. Experience or memory shouldn’t have much of an impact, but not being in the womb together likely would. So, I don’t know. Luckily, this is just hypothetical and I know that I am trans and that’s what matters

Edit: it said the twins were more likely to both be trans even in cases where they weren’t raised together
I think you framed this really respectfully. You didn't bring it up as anything other than identity my clone could have. And all I can say is... I don't know. I'd like to think so, and I see no reason why not, but were they to identify as cis I wouldn't question myself.
They'd be trans. They just wouldn't know that they are right away
My answer is that he totally would be, but if he stumbled into the wrong places of the internet and met the wrong kinds of people, he would at best not know what being trans is and at worst be blatantly transphobic while trying to hide the fact that he wants to be a man, which would make him miserable. Or, knowing me, he would do exactly what I did and know that he's trans.
In my case I'd say most likely. At 8 I had no clue of the concept of being trans, grew up in a unaccepting conservative household and was taught that being queer in general was a sin and I still would think about how life would be better if I was a girl and hoping I could wake up in a female body. Those feelings have always been a part of me. If I was born in a more accepting household or had different experiences I would've most likely still had those thoughts but I would have probably shared that with my parents.
I think my clone would be but it is hard to say. Sny time someone brings up cloning myself, I'm distracted imaging getting to have sex with myself lmao
I feel we’re getting into the realm of science fiction on this question.
I think mine would be because my gender identity is heavily linked to characteristics my dad and grandma shared as well (ASD).
I don’t know and I’m not the one to choose for them. My clone or not they should figure it out for themselves. I’m not the one to define who they have to be and I’m not doing that to them.
My clone would be trans. I've known I was a boy for as long as I've been able to conceptualize gender (3 years old). But I think it really depends on the person. There isn't really any one way to be trans, and someone else might feel differently.
I mean, I guess.
Well, because technically the scientific way to clone the clone would grow up in a different time than I did, and a different family (unless my family somehow got custody of my clone). And I think of trans being a mixture of something that just is about a person and that something about the person is nurtured to become something. So I feel anyone can be trans but sometimes it isn’t nurtured enough for them to actually figured it out and act upon it. I personally would like to think that my clone wouldn’t nurture the fact because being trans for me is hard and confusing, but it could be easier for my clone if the family and time it’s raised in could nurture it the right way. Does that make any sense? If it doesn’t I can try and be clearer…
A clone of me wouldn’t be me, just a lab-grown copy, a whole new person. I feel like placing any gendered expectations onto them would be unfair. 

That reminds me of another, I think equally unanswerable question though- are there any parallel universe versions of yourself that turned out cis agab, and if so, how many? Their universe is a identical to ours leading up to your birth, the only factors that deviate our timelines come after your birth.
Yes. I have actually thought about how if I had a clone that was a cis female, I would be so happy for them but at the same time so jealous!   


I don't think society had much effect on me wanting to be a woman, in fact quite the opposite. If I raised a clone of myself, I think it might still be trans, but perhaps raising them to not conform to gender norms is enough for them to not have dysphoria or want to actually be a woman. Maybe they would dress and act how they wanted to and not be as bad off as I was.

Nature vs nurture is very interesting.
Idk anything about the science of being trans but I honestly don’t think my clone would end up being trans cuz of memory and experience. I’ve basically hung out with girls my whole life and at the same time I always tried too hard to prove I was manly (idk where this came from but I used to have the idea that if I wasn’t manly enough I was a failure.)
It’s been studied that when one twin is transgender both are transgender, therefore there’s a biological link but it’s still a grey area. Many conservatives will argue anything to make trans people seem like crazy nut jobs that like to play dress up, but it couldn’t be further from the truth, it’s only their truth not the reality of the situation. Many studies have been conducted as to why this occurs, my opinion is we’re all on an Intersex Spectrum where we may have both / ambiguous and even unknown internal organs such as ovaries, uterus and testes in opposite sex assigned at birth. I believe that the brain falls within this category. People will cry xx and xy chromosomes but there not really aware of xxy xyy and so on! Which lends itself to a genetic predisposition which in turn causes disphoria and the cure being HRT and maybe not always surgeries based on the dysphoria of the individual. There’s trans people that perhaps would also reject the genetic basis of being trans and perhaps there are a few cross dressers that choose to live and identify as Transgender. I’m not trying to come off as truscum or transmed but I think it’s important to understand the variety of transgender under the umbrella as a whole as there’s transgenders that apparently do not experience disphoria at all. But with that said those on a medical genetic predisposition yes cloning in theory should yield the same end result of ending up as a transgender person in my opinion.

Gawd my Trans people Don’t kick me for this Hell I’m Trans too!!!
I think so because some of my earliest memories are of wanting to be a girl and feeling jealous over the stuff they got to do. I guess it would depend on how accepting the environment around other me is
I guess it depends on what you mean when you say trans because there are so many culturally different and religiously different interpretations of what it means to be trans. In the Native American community people use the term twospirit or duelspirit and in this case many people mean actually two literal spirits in the same body. But in the modern American European sense being trans can mean a lot of different things.
Clone of my gender depends on how many splits. 1 or 2. 1 a cis man. 2 a agender not sure on sex. Both would be asexuals. Im a demiboy.
I don't think we know enough about what causes people to be trans. It's a really interesting question, but right now it looks like it could go either way
Currently, the science is still unsure about whether being trans is a result of genetics, prenatal experience, postnatal environment, or any other factors. Therefore, I cannot be certain of the answer to your question. I'd presume that if I started my existence over and did everything the same I'd still turn out trans, but I don't know what or how much of me would need to be changed in order to undo that.
There appears to be genetic markers that are more common in trans women than cis men, but it's nowhere near conclusive research as of yet. So there's a reasonable chance my clone would be trans, but I can't say for sure
Yeah she would be
From a science standpoint, not necessarily. When that whole pet cloning thing was a (very short lived) fad, they were very very clear that you'd be getting a pet that *looks* just like your pet. Not acts like. It could have a different temperament, different level of trainability, totally different personality, etc. Because even though they were genetically identical, their brains were not.
There's a chance they could. But, my understanding of the science research and the theory on the origins of transness lends me to suggest that if the conditions of the womb before my birth were recreated, then it could be highly likely that the poor clone would be transgender. 
Regardless, I would be praying, for the clone's sake, that they came out a cis woman.
We'll talk about the ethics of consciousness swapping if it comes to that point. 😈
I legit don’t know. I’d presume so since my desire to be a woman was always a passive part of my life, but it’s possible that was influenced by something from when I was like 2. Although even when I was in preschool, my friends were girls, so it had to have been very early
y e s
Maybe, maybe not. I’d assume that my transnesss is the product of both my genetics and my upbringing so really it’s anyone’s guess what my clone would turn out like. 

Identical twins can be different in terms of their queerness (i.e. one trans and the other not) so I’d assume a clone would work about the same.
Like, my current state? I think they’d already be trans. Or, like, not trans, because Im already openly genderqueer and present that way physically, mentally, and socially… I never really fully comprehended gender (especially not that I’m supposed to actually align with it on a personally, internal level) even as a kid, and only understand it now because I’ve grown up in a society (unfortunately) surrounded by it. I think if I was cloned right now, with none of that conditioning, I wouldn’t even comprehend it again, so I’d be just.. nothing, by default.
If you want to, go ask r/asktransgender you'll probably get more answers. Have a good day
Well if the clone is completely identical then most likely they would also be trans… but if they turned out to be slightly different or developing their own ideas and stuff then they might want to be something else and that’s fine too
So I had a very good life. We didn’t have much but I was always happy. But I know if I didn’t transition I would have drank myself to death. This would be the case for my clone
good question.. Definitely not
I don’t know. I think it’s just something that happens, like being left-handed.
Statistically speaking, she would be more likely to be trans and transition than not, but circumstance and experience can have an impact on life.
I definitely believe so.
yeah
This is simply a “nature vs nurture” question. Period. It’s hypothetical and redundant. Sorry.
I would say probably not. There are cases of identical twins where one is trans and the other isn’t. So🤷‍♂️
It depends. If they have a completely different personality than me, than probably not, it depends on how their (or mine) brain interprets the concept of womanhood and whether or not it thinks they fit. But if everything about the clone is different except for the DNA, then why would the gender stay the same? Its not a biological part of you.
Varies how you clone, clone via current method of basically taking your DNA and making a new copy?  It might be trans, it very much will not be like you by the time it finishes growing and it dead.  Clones suffer from the same problem we all do, cellular degradation.

If you mean sci-fi cloning?  True copies?  Then yes they will be trans becuase it a copy.  If you mean clone but can live long?  It can be a crapshot on effects.  We are not sure what really causes transgenderism but we know it happens in the womb and can be genetic or enviromental or something.
It’s difficult to say, because personally I transitioned due to gender dysphoria, and we don’t know what causes gender dysphoria exactly. Some people think it’s genetic, while others think it is a result of fetal development. If the latter is true, then my clone wouldn’t necessarily be trans as well. But if the former is true then they likely would be unless they tried to repress their dysphoria
I think its a 50/50 thing. I person is made of from there experiences and up bringing. How ever while since has not yet proven it, from my own experience and talk to others it was a feeling that we have had from our earliest memories. It seems to be that the brain develops one sex and the body a different. We know that the genital's develop first and the brain some time after. We all so know the one dose not confer with the other. They get there build instructions from the clomazones from the parents. I think in time it will be found to be a brain defect. A lot of people will not want to hear that on both sides. But it will be what it will be.
Maybe.
This reminds me of how I learned that you can have identical twins where one is trans and the other cis and that absolutely blew my mind.  Based on this I would say that it's likely but not necessarily the case that my clone would also be trans.
I don't know personally. 

First reason why I don't know is, although we are genetically the same, we didn't go through the same life. We might react similarly, maybe having some base morals, but ultimately we have two different brains and two different reactions. Two different responses, based entirely on the people that raised us and how we grew up. It's easy to say that, maybe I'd still be trans, but I'd be more open about it. Maybe I'd be less open about it. Maybe I just wouldn't be trans. Wouldn't feel what I feel that makes me transgender

Second, we don't exactly know what makes u9 a trans person. It could be a jumble of how we were raised, it could be because we've always known, it could be for many different  reasons. All of us are bonded in the fact that our experiences are so vastly different from each other and yet the same. I believe if it was just how my mind was, my clone would still be trans. Maybe fully genderfluid, maybe still trans masc, but I feel like I've always been trans. Some part of my brain just clicks when I call myself that like a puzzle piece, and I know it's different for others but that's my experience 

Now with these two reasons, because I didn't have many people to support me, I would support the shit out of my clone. We're twins now, trans or not, and I'd be DAMNED if I'd let my toxic family hurt my new sibling. We're both trans bitch, let's get you some new clothes to match
Yea, probably, there alot of evidence there's a biological predisposition to being trans. 

 ""A 2012 review of the literature found that of the reported cases of identical twins where at least one was gender dysphoric, 39.1% of twin pairs were concordant for gender dysphoria (Heylens et al., 2012). However, out of all the reported cases of fraternal twins where at least one was gender dysphoric, none were concordant for gender dysphoria. In other words, genetically identical twins were vastly more likely to be concordant for gender dysphoria than those who were not genetically identical. That is not a negligible biological contribution to gender identity – it is a significant one."" 

So if its my identical twin science would say it has a 39.1% chance of also being trans. 

Ofc this likely is a higher % chance,  as there are significant social factors that suppress the true rate of trans in society, same as they suppressed the rates of homosexuality and left handedness. And seeing how one sibiling is treated after comming out by family or society will have significant impact on the likelihood of the other chosing comming out or denial. 

When there significant negative social factors around something, like there is atm for being trans is always good to assume the percentage rates are being artificially depressed by the those factors from the true rate.
In my opinion, yes
I feel like... Probably? Just because I can recall early memories that were along the lines of I want to play with girly toys/I want to be friends with girls, and me not fully understanding why I didn't just have these things but also understanding that I was a boy and got ""boy things"" or whatever
yes if we have the same brain, gender disphoria is gonna be there
Maybe? I don't know.
I think my clone would. I don't know how much time it would take them to realize about how they feel since memory and experiences wouldn't transfer, but the questioning situation would be constant
Twins are the closest thing we have to human biological clones, and there have been cases of one twin being trans while the other is cis.
My understanding is that gender has more to do with who you are, rather than your biology.
I am not sure. I know how my mother raised me has played some part in my transitioning, but I also have no doubt nature is as involved as nurture in my decision.
If my brain is the same and have the same fam and upbringing then yeah right, or do you mean that I would not have had an upbringing cause I'm a clone if me now, then I think yes right because you cloned my brain now and my brain now knows I'm trans, I think no matter my upbringing I'm always gonna be a little trans so idk either way I look at it I'm probably still trans
They would probably still have my brain and my looks so probably yeah
I don't know what causes being trans, I think it would be 50/50 chance
according to my doctor the reason I'm trans is mostly because I'm autistic, so if I have the same brain, i guess probably
Hell if I know
That's a nice one! And my answer is ""possibly"". Since it's uncertain that my clone will have the same soul and/or experience with me, they might or might not come out as a transgender UNLESS someone specifically indicates that or somehow loads my memories into their consciousness. But for today's tech, it's an enigma.
Yes. Experience and memory don’t make gender. He might start out thinking he’s a girl, but hopefully he’d realize quicker than I did who we are
No duh, I had breast growth before I even started HRT, my body was made to become trans.
Research into ‘gay’ or ‘trans’ or whatever genes is fundamentally unethical, such information could only be used to hurt LGBT people. It would be used to about pregnancies with those genes and to ‘prove’ that someone isn’t really gay or trans or whatever.
Yes. I feel like my identity is sort of tied into my autism because i just never grasped the concept of gender. It never appealed to me. I think i would definitely internally know something was up it just depends on if i had the language available to describe myself
It would be trans, but probably wouldnt realize it at first. For me, realizing i was trans took me being treated like a guy and realizing that i hate myself for it. Gender never played much role for me, i was just myself and have always had trouble with seeing myself in 3rd person, but i realized that i view myself as a girl, i just didnt notice untill i knew that being trans was a possibility. I defenetly got hurt by it without noticing though.
I think being trans is a result of brain structure so yes they would unfortunately be trans.
I’m trans and my sister is lesbian so I don’t know it’s down to brain chemistry so anyones guess
Yes, it's a clone of me so it definitely would be trans
I think they probably would. But more concerning is if they don't have the brain damage I sustained as a child. Which means they could have a better memory than I do and their facial recognition software isn't corrupted! Plus without their processor damaged and them not put into a situation that supresses their linear logic to the point of atrophy they'd probably figure it out and accept being trans faster.
Most likely
Definitely
Just my opinion, not disagreeing with others on here. My feeling is that it entirely depends on them. If they've been raised in a different environment, around different people, and with different values and such then they'll likely turn out entirely differently. Their relationship with, and understanding of gender, may well be enormously different to that of the 'original' person who they've been cloned from. Genetics, hormones, etc... 'might' incline them to more likely be trans or not, but that does not mean they definitely will or won't. It is our own experiences and upbringing that has the biggest effect on the person we become and our relationship with our gender, so a clone is no more likely to be trans than someone completely different on the other side of the world regardless of the person they're cloned from.
It depend on his past
I'm an anthropology major (so this is scratching my brain in all the right places) and this question, in my interpretation, touches on the ""nature vs nurture"" argument. Very interesting question!

I think it would depend on what memories are shared and the situation your clone is put into. Are they starting fresh or are they an exact replica of you as you are now? Say you took of the exact same embryo and gave them to mothers across the world from one another. The culture their raised in would wildly differ and would most definitely end in different results. Would both end up trans, though? I don't think that's something we can answer.

There could be a genetic component to being LGBT, as some others have mentioned, but we don't have concrete evidence on anything like that. In the case of trans twins, I'd argue that they are raised together and this often produces similar outcomes in terms of their gender identities. But! It could also be genetic. Who knows?

Edit: if there are any cases of separated twins both transitioning separately (I'm sure there must be at least one) send them my way! It would be super interesting to read about
That's tricky, but to answer the question (for myself) I'll have to look at what gender is, first.
So the concept of gender is nothing that's written in our genes, it's something we created as a society. In an (ideal) world where the concept of gender is totally free from a persons sex, are there trans people? I would say no, as there would be no agab and therefore nobody could have a different identity than their agab.
So transness is the dissonance between what society sees in us and what we actually are.

Therefore I would say that being trans is totally up to the environment (society) someone grew up and not a trait someone has. 
To make that clear: Transness as a separate trait would mean that a person would be trans no matter their agab. For example a afab trans man would be a amab trans woman in a parallel universe in which they were assigned differently at birth tho everything else being exactly the same. 


If you'd meant to ask if my clone would have the same gender as I have, I can't answer that question.
I believe that multiple factors in our dna and during our development shape how we perceive certain things and therefore shapes how we manage the certain cultural rules of gender. 
So if my clone developed in the same hormonal environment I'm pretty sure that they would feel towards those things the same that I do. But if the concept of gender would be a different in the society they grew up I think they would have a different gender, maybe they were trans, but maybe not. It highly depends on how that society would connect sex with gender.
Yes, still trans (as in dysphoria and a state of internal pain) no matter what, because I wasn't raised to know what being trans was, and was in the opposite of an accepting environment for it. It could not have been any less favorable. 

If my clone was raised in a very liberal and accepting family, they wouldn't be anywhere near as disgusted and internally transphobic with themself for it because they wouldn't remember all the horrible things that happened to me. Maybe they would have memories defending them in their head, instead of my memories reminding me that I don't deserve to be around.  They wouldn't have ever tried to actively agree with said memories about not deserving that either... 

Basically they would still be trans but in much less turmoil about it probably.
I’d think it would depend on the society my clone was raised in. Similar place and time to how I grew up? Definitely trans. A society that had different gender norms/no gender norms? Maybe not. I agree with the other commenters that it’s uncertain because we don’t really know what causes being trans (nature vs nurture) yet.
The question isn't stupid at all. Recent studies suggests (but don't confirm yet) that the brain in trans folks develops differentely than in cis individuals, trans MtF having more ""feminine"" features while trans FtM having a different phenotype. This would suggests some kind of genetic predisposition. This however does not include the social environment, epigenetics (genome activation) and actual psychology of the individual, that could be similar but also entirely different.

Maybe the most similar thing to a clone we have are homozygous twins, I would like to hear their story and if their siblings turned out to be trans or similarly non-binary.
Both Wachowski sisters are trans.

My dad and his twin sister are gay.

If I were cloned, I'd be absolutely surprised if they didn't turn out trans...but clones tend to half half-life of the host....so at this point, they may never make it to an age where their egg cracked.
I also know a pair of twins except one is a trans man and the other is still cis 🤔
Make sense
My partner has two step siblings, preteen i believe, who both came out came out as trans within 6 months of each other. One MtF and one FtM.
An example with identical twins where only one is trans is the core of the band Steam-Powered Giraffe.   David and Isabella Bennett.
My older sibling and cousin are both trans, like me. However my twin is not. I find it interesting
Valid
Somehow I didn't thought about estrogen/testosterone thing, even If I knew thats important, before asking that question
>but in the rush of estrogen that came down the tube after the first trimester.

Sister, be careful suggesting that transgender identity can be concretely isolated to biological traits or experience. The concept of some trait ""marking"" a transgender brain is easily the basis of genocide, and could enable refusing healthcare because ""trans identifying"" but ""wrong"" brain shape or DNA marker etc.    

The hunt for a gay or trans gene/marker serves to benefit those who wish us harm more. ""Scientific validity"" does not convince those who do not value science.
Wouldn't that make the clone less likely to be trans? Your clone would require that same event during it's development as well, that's not how cloning works
Then my answer would probably be no. I honestly think that my interests and what people I like comes mostly from the environment and experience.

Still your answer is as valid as mine.
Yea my question is definitely philosophical one there is no right or wrong answer. At least not with our current knowledge.
In this hypothetical scenario the clone can not be compared to a twin, as twins share a whomb, so everything that is happening there happens to both of them (they swim in the same hormone soup).
If you clone somebody, the clone would develop in a totally different environment.
So tho it's very likely that a part of being trans is in our genes, it is as likely that other parts of our development play a big role, too. So changing one of those factors can actually make a change.
True that would probably make like a big scandal
So true
i don't believe that a soul exists either but i don't think minds are blank slates at birth either, i think genetics have a substantial effect alongside experiences later in life (and epigenetic stuff too affecting the actual expression of genetics). so tl;dr idfk if a genetic clone of me would be trans but it doesn't matter because at the end of the day it wouldn't be me, just a twin
I personally agree with most of this answer
It doesn't get your brain, the brain of a person develops and changes over time. It only gets the brain that your dna generated with an average development. So basically the brain you had when you were born, if your development inside the womb was average.
Does that mean you would say yes If clone had the same soul as you?
Wow I'm almost flattered by how seriously you've took my silly question. I will also add that every results from nu3 should be taken with a grain of salt because clones could possibly never risk coming out to anyone considering their family view on that topic.
Both ending sounds like something that could make a decent anime
It' tricky question for me well It's tricky *tricky* question for me considering that It's just tricky question in general with is why I ask trans people. You have more expirience with thinking about gender and knowing actual facts about gender then me. I never felt any need to question or look more into genders with made me think that my answer is kinda biased to no. It feel even more biased when I know I'm not so sure how to answer when you ask about my sexuality(I'm bisexual) expect gender.

So yea It's no but is It really no If you don't know what are you talking about?

Edit: By no I meant ""clone wouldn't change their gender"" I've got confused and didn't answer corectly
Technically your clones brain will be different because experiences make neural pathways in the brain because brain change through all life
Yea I was a little bit worried that question can be transphobic but I figured that It's somewhere in the gray area? Like If I change how I *wrote* that question and actually use this for transphobic reasons then I guess It would be actually transphobic
Sounds complicated(at least considering this question) and It sounds like something I should have known from school presentation
True and bad me for not asking clone about clones gender
True
The more I read the more difficult It is to answer this question myself
I feel like you would become cool older sibling for your clone

Btw is GD a gender dysphoria?
You are probably right
I get you It was the same with my bisexuality I thought I was straight until I read one to many fanfiction with bisexual character and jokingly decided to question my sexuality
that's probably one of the best ways to show a trans character pre-transition
So I guess It also depends on how age work with this clone. Like does the clone's life begin by being ""born"" or by being already age you were cloned.
True
So true! It really don't matter well maybe If governmant catch you and clone you then It *could* matter
Yea thats definitely tricky enough to get a headache
Valid you don't have to give a shit
Honestly? Everytime I think about clones I ask myself ""If my clone and I would be the same aka have the same memory, experience, biology and all of that who would be the bottom and how would we even determine that?""
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_D0ZQPqeJkk&feature=youtu.be
Thats... Actually good point
I get It I think
Addition:
When I only look at the moment that the clone is becoming conscious, it has no memories and knows basically nothing, it doesn't know what gender is and therefore can't have one, it's agender. 
In our current society my clone would definitely have an agab (afab), so it has to be trans (at least until it learns what gender is).
My cousin and I are trans, both FtM. His dad is my dad's biological brother and his mom is my mom's biological sister. We might as well be siblings with how close our DNA is. I'm gay and I think he's either Bi or Pan
I’ve heard with twins (can’t remember if it was all twins or just identical ones) if one is trans there’s like a 25% chance the other is also trans.
has the trans man come out to their sibling? and are they identical twins or the other type, I've forgotten the name
Have identical twin trans niblings.
I’m a trans woman and so is my twin 😉
The Katy Couric documentary shed light on  development ‘in utero ‘  so maybe depending on what stage the clone replicated

Interesting study if you want to check it out. It's about early hormones effect on the brain.
I'm not trying to expose us to harm...  We have exposure enough.

To the contrary, medical and scientific evidence will actually protect us because it nullifies all their reasons against us.... Primarily, it's a choice and it's against God 

Science is actually on our side and there's proof out there already.

We can't cower for fear that society will mark us.  We were already there, regardless of any tangible proof we exist  We're their soft targets of hate that they wanted anyway.

And, it isn't scientific facts that make us targets, it's their ignorance to science as well as ignorance to God's true message of love.


We cannot cower to what will ultimately free us.


They think we don't exist. They think it's just in our heads.  I'm telling you doctors have found proof we do.  So, for us to fight back, we need to prove we're real, and this science shows that and proves God made us this way.

We've been going about it all wrong saying it belongs in the DSM as a mental disorder. Believe me, I was seeing someone for gender identity DISORDER, way back in the day.

It's not a disorder. It's who you are.

Let's stand up for our God-given biology as trans!
Ahh!  Ok.  I'm not read up on the details of cloning. Thanks for the info!
I think you're right about those things. Our experiences shape us and our opinions, but they can't effect our gender. Could you imagine cloning yourself and they are a different gender? How would that even happen? It's not different just because we are trans; our gender is as innate as yours.
We don't totally understand it, but we actually have a good idea of how gender develops with hormone washes in the womb, so we know it's not just psychological.
Thats fair! It’s a combination of genetic and environmental factors that makes us so cool. Like catching lightning in a bottle!
I guess it’s all down to empiricism vs rationalism, isn’t it
I came out of my womb a month early sooo but I suppose even then it'd still be trans if it gets my DNA.
yes, but their results none the less, also all 100 clones of nu3 will be secretly monitored till they either come out or die.

this experiment could gather tonnes of data
Lol, that sounds kind of fun tbh
It’s a no if you say it’s a no. You know yourself and your gender best. You don’t need to be engrossed in gender discourse to do that, it just means you might not be able to fully put it all into words. :)
That’s true but I think it’s just how your born.
Yep
I actually joined that group (i call them The Gays) and at this point i was the only cishet person there, so i jokingly said ""im cishet are you going to bully me?"" they said ""no, but you won't be cishet if we have anything to say about it""

apparently i started questioning gender and sexuality faster than any person in their group 


so yeah they made good on that threat :]
Yeah 100%. Unfortunately it requires a trans actor with a cis sibling who is also willing to appear in the show/film, which must be incredibly hard to find, kind of insane it happened at all tbh.
I was assuming the use of modern cloning technology, yes, which requires a clone to be grown more or less normally from an embryo.

In reality we don't really know, because this has never been tried. I just feel that there's sufficient evidence for me to expect it as a likely outcome. It would be interesting.
YES!! Same!
Because I'm usually a submissive except when it comes to pegging
So I've sat here and wondered if we would have an awkward first 30 minutes of trying to figure out who was ballsy enough to just top already 🤣🤣🤣
That family tree is a ladder
Omg I thought it was rlly weird that my moms sister married my dads brother but I’m glad there’s someone out there who relates 😭
Honestly, I learned to live from my mom, I've been doing my girl thing forever, my clone will have the same dysphoric feeling I have.
I would assume identical? Because genetically nonidentical twins are just siblings. But ohhhhhh wait…. if the hypothesis that natal hormone exposure has anything to do with being trans holds any weight, then it could totally apply to nonidentical twins as well.

Lol y’all just watched my brain do a thinky think in real time.
Huh I guess everyday you learn something new
That seams right. Cause I know 4 pairs of twins where one is trans and only one of them is double trans.
I’m a twin fraternal and came out as trans my brother I know isn’t but he could still possibly be gay he’s pretty homophonic sometimes
This does sound like it is genetical.
Quick study I just read (by no means extensive) said 39 percent for identical, no relation for fraternal.  Which definitely strengthens the argument of a genetic component, though not so much the hormone exposure in utero.  That is, if it was environmental factors that primarily drove ""trans-ness"", you would expect similar numbers between identical and fraternal twins.
Fraternal twin here and I'm trans... meanwhile my brother is cis haha
Yes they are out and yes they are identical.
You hit the 1 in 4 chance then! (According to some people here)
This was a v interesting read, thanks for linking.
Wow, that's even in addition to what a doctor once told me about a rush of estrogen that comes down the tube in utero, in trans people.
To answer your question I can't imagine my clone being other gender then I am but on the other hand when I ask myself the same thing with sexual orientation answer become less obvious. I can see how my experiences made me bisexual and I personally think that It's because I'm more willing to question mines clone sexuality then gender because I did question my sexuality but I never feel need to ask myself If I'm truly cis woman. 

With make me think that I don't know enough about genders in general(because I never thought about It  deeply enough) with make my answer more like It's from a noob that don't know what she's talking about.

So yea my clone would be the same gender but is It really true If I don't know what I'm talking about?

Edit: I didn't mean no as ""my clone wouldn't be the same gender"" I just got confused because of thinking to much in english now It's fixed
That's why It's *mostly* philosophical

Edit: Now when I know I didn't said mostly but definitly I feel a little bit stupid for not checking what I said first
If you believe transness is bound to the dna and can't be changed by other factors (biological or social), then probably yes.
But as most things in human development rely on several factors I would not agree.
Yea I do know myself and my gender but I don't know my clones gender. Like my clone isn't really me She's genetically the same as me but It's not me from every other perspective with is why this question is so tricky
Better than a sweater.
The grandfathers on both sides also got divorced and replaced with step-grandfathers. My mom's dad left and started a different family and my dad's dad got divorced but he stuck around. Coincidentally, I have disowned my own father due to the fact that he is a gaslighting piece of shit. I have no idea what to consider our family at this point other than a train wreck
The term for genetically nonidentical twins is fraternal twins if I’m correct*
I have read about how different exposures to different hormones and stimuli in the womb can greatly affect a persons life. I don't have sources, sorry, but one article I read was how the mother had something happen that released a ton of adrenaline and only one twin had exposure, and they ended up being very different (don't remember if it was one was gay or trans but it was something like that). And it's not even just getting exposed, it's when and for how long. There is so much we don't know about developing lives in the womb, and I mean any life in any womb, not just humans.
Even for know genetic disorders, presentation can vary drastically between identical twins: take for example CP: one twin barely able to move their arm, the other doing perfectly fine with just ages balance issues.

The genes we have as an egg will also be influenced by epigenetic changes.

So you get another possibility.

Genetics, environmental factors causing epigenetic modification, as well as natal sex Hormone influence at just the right time.

Which explains how two twins with the exact same genes, can be different, even though they should nominally be exposed to the same amount of hormones: just takes them being a bit faster in development, and the E/T would hit them differently.


Just like identical twins with Contergan/thalidomide defects: how exactly your arms and legs are malformed depends on which /days/ of the pregnancy the drug das taken. So something like inbetween days 30-40 it stops the arms forming at all, 40 to 50 from the elbows down, 50-55 just fingers.

Numbers just made up, don‘t remember the exact dates; and there you‘d also have identical twins being off by a week or more of ‚expected‘ damages if just looking at one of them.
Hehe - double-trans made me giggle for some reason.
I know that for a LONG time, I was transphobic, but in hindsight it was mostly due to them being able to do something that I was too scared to do myself, which made me jealous, and I hated myself for it, so I hated them for making me hate myself. Now  at 55, I’m about to enter my second month of HRT.
Sometimes being homophobic is a way for a person to deny how they really feel. 

Also, all I can think of is homophonic, like a bunch of people singing songs that turn others gay or something.
Yep! We’re also identical
You might be interested in the Katie Couric doc. it speaks to this as well!
I do revise my theory, as there can be factors from outside or inside the fetus. If the factor comes from outside then for example if Im trans due to my mother's estrogen then being raised in a test tube would make a cis male version.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10843193/ 

Also interesting and affirming.
You cannot choose your sexuality.  You can become aware that your interests are broader than you thought, but you can’t choose who you love or who you’re attracted to.  No different with gender.
Something occured to me yesterday. I may have been a tad defensive due to people being to people being so critical of our genders and shaming us accordingly, but in the example of trans development I mentioned it could still go either way.

I've often wondered whether I'm trans because my mother has always had a high amount of estrogen which may have had something to do with the feminization of my brain. On the other hand some trans people just don't react to that hormone.

My point is trans people may be trans due to 2 different set of factors, from the parent or vessel versus internal factors in some way coded into the fetus.

If I'm trans due to hormones from my mother, then developing in a hypothetical test tube would produce a cis male version of myself. On the other hand someone with a brain that doesn't react to certain hormones would remain trans regardless of parent unless perhaps developed in a parent that changes that.

That's how I'd expect it to work.
Or a circle. It's my typical family tree in Crusader Kings XD
Lmao thanks. Brain no work today.
Awesome!
Wow!  Very cool!  Thanks for the supporting info!
I'm not saying that sexuality or gender is a choice I'm saying that I'm biased into being cis(because no one ever make it difficult to me including myself) and because of that I never bothered to learn or think about genders in general. I'm saying that I know to little about the topic to answer without feeling like a idiot talking about something they don't know a thing about.
I think you have every right to be tad defensive about It. My question is kinda gray in nature and can easly become really offensive. And people *are* really critical about your gender, with is most likely due to how easy is to assume that trans means liking cross dressing *and* because how bad cross dressing is portrayed in films and series(especially in anime one piece is good example)
ever tried to emulate the Hapsburgs or the Ptolemy family lines?"	vvuo1h	trans	618	0.96	2022-07-10 16:05:55
i don't like it when my mom watches TV shows featuring trans characters	"it may sound a little weird, but let me explain

before my coming out my mom did not know too much about trans people, only the basic info most people her age possess.

i came out only a few months ago and realized that i am trans, or to be more specific was able to label what had felt so off about my existence all those years, only 2-3 years ago. i am ftm and as a kid i liked the typical ""girl activities"", didn't mind wearing dresses until middle school and also liked dressing up and being pretty. and that's why my mom is confused. how come her child that perfectly fit into the girl standard in her eyes, how can that child possibly be a boy?

she still doesn't fully grasp the concept yet that what you like to wear, what you do and what you enjoy has nothing to do with your gender identity.

now, back to the whole TV shows featuring trans people thing. oftentimes in those TV shows or even documentaries, those ftm people realized that they're trans at a young age. and every time my mom sees these TV shows or documentaries, she starts comparing it to me.

and i absolutely hate it.

because that's just not similar in any way to my story and sometimes i feel like she thinks i am less trans just because things didn't go for me like they do for most trans ftm people.

it's so frustrating and i am happy that she kinda wants to educate herself on all of that and gain more information about trans people, but it's not at all beneficial for my situation and just makes me feel like shit."	"every journey is different, she just needs to understand that everyone around her lives a life just as complex if not more so than her own.
My suggestion would be to find something you do relate with to share with her. If all she wants to learn from is media, then that's what will teach her.

That being said, there's a severe shortage of trans male representation in media.
Does your mom have short hair, wear pants, do anything ""masculine"" at all? Point out that people can enjoy things that stereotypically are aligned with the opposite gender, or which historically were considered the domain of the opposite gender.
My mom also started consuming LGBTQIA+ media trying to understand a little more about what we are facing/ have faced in our lives.

It was good in concept, but sometimes I have to explain to her the 'glorified tv version' of my struggle is not always in line with what I experience.

And what one person in our community experiences, is not what I experience.
I mean honestly trans YouTubers are better I feel. Like I learned when I was 12. Keep in mind that I didn’t know what trans was before then, but like there are people that learn at 70. You can learn at any age
Talking to your mom is key. See her educating herself as a positive but explain how comparing others journeys to yours is affecting you. I'm a parent whose son has recently come out as trans and I'm trying to educate myself as I want to be the best support I can be.  I'm trying to understand what it all means without putting pressure on them to educate me but I rely on them to put it into context for me as to what it means to them.  Hope it all works out well for you 💕
Have you tried telling her this makes you uncomfortable? ""Mom, please stop comparing me to fictional trans people. It makes me feel really invalidated. The fact that you would rather listen to the TV than to me is really hurtful.""

It sounds she is trying to accept you and is genuinely misguided. Though I might add, her behavior is very strange.
Just want to take a moment to say your frustration is valid. My little brother came out as trans ftm years before I even started questioning and while our parents were relatively supportive, they would do the same thing to him that you are dealing with right now.

It can be exhausting being both invalidated and somewhat supported by one person at the same time. Sometimes the best we can do with stubborn parents is gently remind them that the experience they are watching in media is not yours, and that people who are trans are not a monolithic hive-mind that experience transness in the same way. 

Personally, I find the older the person, the more difficulty they have separating being wrong or misunderstanding something with their worth as a person. So when correcting or explaining or educating, we have to be as explicitly clear as possible that it’s ok that they don’t understand yet, and that you appreciate their trying. 

Which, is honestly a shitty feeling trying to be patient and gentle with someone who doesn’t seem to want to understand, but they often only act that way as a defense because they don’t want to feel dumb. So be patient and share your own experiences if you have the spoons for it. Try to be reassuring and welcoming within those conversations, and hopefully with time she will come around.
""she still doesn't fully grasp the concept yet that what you like to wear, what you do and what you enjoy has nothing to do with your gender identity.""  
Assuming she has / had those same hobbies, I'd ask her if she would stop being a woman if you took those traits away from her.  
Presumably she understands her identity isn't tied to those things.  
Then you can follow up with ""So why does liking those thing mean one IS a woman?""
This isn’t helpful for you at all, but my dad once denied my transness because “but as a kid, you always wanted to play tea party!” I’m ftnb, but for a while I believed I was ftm.
It took my mom awhile to understand that we all find out we’re trans at different ages because she first started learning about trans stuff through documentaries featuring very young trans kids. What helped her was talking to a professional who worked with trans kids (my old counselor). She became more open minded after awhile of learning, it didn’t change instantly.

I don’t know if your mom is objective or more subjective but that could help dictate how you can talk to her about being trans.
OP you need to have a conversation instead of resenting a parent actively attempting to learn about your choices. If there are trans characters you've related to (for me Jamie Clayton in Sense8 was a big wonderful revelation of a trans character treated well, and its from the wachowskis to boot) or if that just isn't out there, ask her to talk with *you* instead of going to documentaries and the like.
You have a very unique and unfortunately confusing situation and I’m sorry you’re going through it. It’s definitely a process and I’m sure you’ll find a way in time. At the very least mother seems open to something and just the smallest opening is all it takes sometimes. I really hope the best for you. Take care. ~Enjoy
You could open to some transpeople on social media that have a different story to tel learn it comes to their gender. I would have to agree I would be pretty annoyed as well if someone was constantly comparing me to the only few media stars out there.
Lots of trans people didn't really get that about themselves until they were older. I definitely have some moments I can look back on from childhood that might have been hints, but I didn't really start considering anything until I was 21, and didn't really accept it until I was 27. Media that tries to be supportive tends to focus on those that knew very early on because it helps to push forward the concept that it's not a choice in a way that's more accessible to cis people, but it does push those of us that don't fit that same model to the side in pursuit of that.
OP, umbrella academy's next season is supposed to have a trans guy in it who wasn't out at the start of the show, you can try to watch that with her!
Honestly, 'glorified tv version' sums up a lot of depictions of anything and some people struggle to wrap their head around this idea.  
I do mean A LOT by the way, the way someone talks can be totally different from a normal human being! (Any Japanese speaker, for instance, will ASSURE you that anime does not follow the guidelines of real communication.)

Any doctor will point out 7 inconsistencies in any medical show!  
Lawyers will at some point declare that a case would be thrown out!  
Romance shows are just generally nonsense with a plethora of tropes I could personally list for why it doesn't work out that way in real life!

People need to understand that ANYTHING you see on TV is up for further investigation on how poorly it reflects any one topic because chances are, it butchers it!
it may be a bit of a surprise, but i already tried that. told her how it makes me feel when she compares those people she sees on TV to me. but she still does it. that's why it's so frustrating

and she doesn't really like to listen to me when i try to explain things
>choices

oh so it's a choice now
Repetition, continue to explain it and force her to actually listen whenever she starts doing that.
I can see how that's tough. If I can share from my own shortcomings when reflecting back on how I wish I had done better when dealing with my mom, I first off hope you find the strength within yourself to not let your mom wear you down. I hope you continue to have the strength to do the opposite, and keep countering what she's consuming when what she watches doesn't apply to you by restating that the experiences she sees people share on the internet are not the circumstances that apply to you. I know that's easier said than done because it actually hurts, and sometimes it's easier to avoid then it is to confront. My mom simply couldn't wrap my head around it because I did so many ""boy things"" growing up.  Unfortunately I chose to avoid after a while. I wish I had the confidence I have now, but back then. I wish I could've stuck to it until she did come around and acknowledge who I truly am and how I feel."	ue2nxn	trans	614	0.99	2022-04-28 19:09:56
Im apparently a troll	I never thought I’d experience this but, I’m currently having someone tell me that i am a troll because me listing the labels i identify with , the fact I’m autistic, and my pronouns (he/she/it + neopronouns / xenogenders) in my introduction here was a shaky attempt at being a troll. They specifically brought up the fact that i use it/its pronouns, saying ANY trans person takes being called that as offensive? Being told that my identity is me “trolling” was definitely an experience.	"**It is NOT OK to attack and harass people on this subreddit.**

If you believe that someone is trolling, these are the preferred ways to respond:

1. Report the post or comment.
2. Send us a modmail that includes the URL.

Because these issues are addressed personally and privately, you may not get a detailed response as to the action taken.
I've seen other nonbinary people use it/its before. Some people have a hard time accepting that others are different.
[deleted]
I have no idea wtf a neopronoun is, but life is too short to have problems with people that are just kinda trying to live. You obviously know you aren’t trolling, and you should definitely ignore people who are getting angry over no other reason than because they want to be angry.
It can be hard to tell what's sincere when a particular culture is plagued by constant mockery.
You are valid 💜 I've known a few souls that use it/its pronouns and they were awesome!
The English language isn't great but is evolving. If I knew you and you'd ask, I'd use those pronouns.
As a stranger I'd be skeptical of your intentions and hyper aware of disingenuous comments or actions.
End of the day we're all entitled to being respected and called what we want. So if you own it. Own it.
I'm sorry you had a dumb person experience. I know there are plenty of people who use it/its pronouns. For me it's a bit of a hurdle since calling someone it is often an insult but that's my issue, not yours. I hope you find more understanding people. If it helps I'm open to chat if you have questions or just wanna vent or whatever.
I don't understand neopronouns at all really and I'd be wildly uncomfortable and upset if anyone referred to me as 'it' but that doesn't immediately make someone a troll. Just because I'll never understand it doesn't mean I get a pass to disrespect people and accuse them of trolling
Yeah unfortunately there is a lot of gatekeepers in the community I've been told off by others when I say I'm not just a woman but a proud trans girl they get mad lol I am actually happy that I wasn't born a woman and got to experience the other side. Now i have a strong understanding of both sides and I'm thankful for that.
Not a troll, it's common especially among Non-binary folks to use it/it's one of the most famous NBs from history use it/its. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Universal_Friend
My fiancée uses it/its as one of their pronouns (they/she/it) so no, it’s not trolling to use those. 

A lot of trans people do not like those pronouns for themselves (myself included), but it’s not about us. If that’s what you want to use, go right ahead.
idk about you op but i think the person who said that was a shaky attempt at being a troll
I also have a friend that uses he/they/it pronouns.
[removed]
nah bro, I understand why people don't like it/it's if it isn't their pronouns. when I came out in highschool asking to be referred to as they/them (now he/they) I was often called ""it"" instead. but if it's the pronouns people use then that's that. it should only be offensive to people if they are being called pronouns they do not use.  

my advice is to just ignore those people, it's each to their own in most things like this
Okay so I read this and I thought it meant they thought you were a troll, like the gremlin like creatures that live under bridges and I was like, “why would they think that???” And then I realized. :c
personally, I think it’s weird to go by it’s/it due to my ancestors being enslaved, but if it makes someone comfortable then I honestly couldn’t care less. Go by whatever you want and whatever make you feel comfortable! :)
It/its is valid! my gf uses them
I'm trans and I accept it/its pronouns, along with they/them. When I was a kid, people used to call me ""it"" in order to bully me. The idea of being called that was triggering for me for a long time. But using the pronoun is like reclaiming it for me. I don't call anyone else it unless I know they want it because I'm aware it can be offensive. But the idea that all trans people find it offensive without exception is false.

You and your pronouns are valid. Don't listen anyone who tells you otherwise.
I have a friend who is VERY aggressive that they go be he/its, not he/they
Nah, you're fine. I'm autistic and non-binary myself. If anyone is trying to tell you aren't valid they are the troll or grossly uninformed.

You don't need to understand everything about a person's identity to support and acknowledge them, especially here where there are so many different gender expressions.

They were probably upset you didn't fit in their little ‘trans’ box and lashed out, it doesn't make it right though. There are some people here who should understand what being misgendered or invalidated feels like, that have such a narrow view of what being trans is they loop right back around to hurting their fellow trans people.

Sorry that you had that as an introduction to this place, but I swear at least 90% of us are better then that.
But isn’t the it pronoun used in a derogatory way against trans people that dehumanizes them? 
I think it’s got some strong stigma
I use he/it/they, you’re absolutely not a troll and are welcome in trans spaces, don’t listen to what that rando was saying they’re probably either a gatekeeper or simply disagreed with something you said and wanted a reason to disregard it.
I've seen people be referred to with it/its pronouns and not feel objectified. Some people are okay with that and I don't think you're trolling in any way!
Someone called me a troll one time because I said saying that people who are on welfare are leeches is still demonization of the disabled even when they live in a red state. They just call anybody a troll
Gentle comforting hugs if wanted, from one autistic enby to another.
People who use it/it’s are my favorite people
[removed]
I’ve been on both sides of this and from experience, neither is pleasant. People disregard and hold so much animosity towards it. I used to go by “it” but I faced so much hostility I went back in the closet. Then when I came out as a trans woman, some asshole coworker referred to me as it without knowing that I used to go by that. Holy fuck it hurt. Either way fuckem and do your thing homie
Yeah, I saw that. It’s pretty shitty to be dismissed as a troll just because you use it as one of your pronouns and decided to introduce yourself and list your labels. I personally don’t use it/its for personal reasons, but I’m not hating on anyone who would! Also, I’m the type to list the labels I identify with too when doing an intro post, so I guess I’d probably be considered a troll too LOL
I mean I wouldn’t want to be referred to as an “it”

It’s dehumanizing but that’s just me personally…
People that use Neo pronouns and use xenogenders 

Typically are on the “attack helicopter” level just on the other end of the spectrum.

You check off a LOT of boxes (a LOT….) of boxes for trolling.

I can’t say and Shan’t say use this or that, you do you. The more non traditional you get the more pushback you’re gonna get from the common rabble.
To me, personally, a trans person who uses it/it’s pronouns, I don’t find it offensive unless someone is using it offensively. If they are using it in a derogatory way/using it instead of my pronouns to try and “trigger” me or bully me. Then i take it offensively. But if it’s people who know my pronouns are he/it’s and use them regularly in a NON offensive way, then it’s absolutely fine with me.
Idk, depending on my mood I'd also be find with ""it"" just sounds like gate keeping and refusal to accept that other people have opinions and likes that don't exactly align with theirs. As far as I care you're cool as long as you ain't malicious
my top started using it/its this year.  
definitely confused me when it switched from what it was previously using.

you're still valid\~
You just seem young or autistic

I don't really get it/it's but it's not offensive or anything
It/it’s is completely valid. I don’t personally use them but they’re valid. You are valid. I’m also autistic which I feel plays a little into being trans. I relate to not expressing my gender normally. I was told cis guys don’t wear that many rings or that much jewelry. I guess I dress and act slightly feminine
[deleted]
When you say you’re pronouns are it/it’s, I trust you and I’m sorry you’re being treated this way. 
I believe wholeheartedly in respecting who you are. However, historically, people used it to other and misgender us. it’s hard for us older trans people because we grew up dehumanized by being called it/its prior to being hate crimed. And there’s also a history of hate groups impersonating trans people online to depict us as unreasonable. A lot of us binary trans people are struggling with a lot of trauma, and I’m sorry that’s getting taken out on you.
[removed]
I’m sorry but Nero pronouns aren’t a thing they were actually originally started on 4chan as a joke to bully transpeople I don’t care if I get banned for how many days for saying this but it’s true
I had someone do that to me in a discord server of all things. People are very weird and will have an excuse to hate on people because it's the easy thing to do. I've met quite a bit of people using it/its pronouns, ones they set themselves like you do! It's stupid honestly haha. I wouldn't worry about it too much - they aren't looking out for you genuinely or putting their best foot forward.
The denizens/entities of r/voidpunk often go by it or xenogenders so unless you’re accuser wants to debate an entire subreddit they can stfu also it’s a really cool and creative sub i lurk and linger there often
I personally use it/it's as a trans demiboy and I can confirm that this person is bullshitting you. You're not a troll honey, you're just trying to live your life in the way you want and make people aware of it ❤️
trans person here, it/its pronouns and neopronouns/xenopronouns are rad as hell.


if anyone needs advice on how to use it/its pronouns in some phrases:
this person uses it/its! i hope to meet it later in the day! what is its schedule again? what's its favorite color? it's my dearest friend and i would give it anything it needed to make sure it's safe and happy.
I have no problem with it/its. I prefer she/her at the moment, but preferred it/its during early transitiin.
Oh the irony
I am sure you didn't mean anything bad...
It’s frustrating 😭 i feel bad for anyone else who’s had to deal with being told that they are lying about their identity just because they don’t fit the “norm” for what being trans is
I love being called it/its pronouns, it makes me feel more connected to myself & the world around me
I technically like he/they/it but I never use it cus people don't like it as pronouns, even in trans spaces . I've been told it's homophobic by other trans people so I just kinda stick with he/they.
I met somebody who used it/s pronouns at a pride event recently.   It was nice.
I use it/its exclusively I don't have an issue with it and some people get uncomfortable unfortunately
Yeah I'm trans Nonbinary and use he they it lol
This was a completely unnecessary reply.  This person was venting about their own experience and you for some reason decided to add on something on that indirectly invalidated them (even if it was unintentional) while bringing nothing new that op hasn't already heard. 

You sound like a cis person going ""why would anyone want to transition? I love being a man/ woman! Not to invalidate anyone tho""
People don’t realize it, but being on Reddit involves a near constant fear of someone jumping down your throat over some dumb bullshit. I started getting back into Reddit a few weeks ago after spending a long while floating around the Fediverse and non-corporate social media. Indie forums and shit. I think I’m gonna go back soon. I didn’t miss that feeling of lacking even the most basic shared context with the people reading my posts and comments.
Oh I didn’t realize The Friend used it/its
I dont know the full science (?) behind neo pronouns but neo pronouns just basically replace “normal” pronouns. The reasons people use neopronouns is because. Well . Normally people who use neo pronouns are neurodivergent. Neurodivergency can cause a person to experience gender in a way thats out of the “norm”. Like for example, feeling their gender is connected / related to outside sources like maybe weather , music , feelings, etc. for example, i feel like i personally do not feel that my gender is connected to generally being a man or a woman as a PERSON, and im completely fine with being perceived as something that isnt human, because i experience gender in a way that makes me feel like i dont feel connected to the concept of being a human. Not everyone who is neurodivergent feels this way, but some do. An example of using neopronouns, is instead of saying “he went to the store” you can say “love went to the store” it sounds a little bit like a name.
Some people feel less tied to humanity as a whole, and their gender feels a mile away from the normal binary, so they pick a word or invent a word which reflects how they actually feel. Neo-pronouns have been around almost 200 years, and there are a few classic and consistent ones. ie xe/xhe, but ever since the 60s Fae has been popular, because some people feel a bit fae. As fairy folk are often show to be feminine non-binary. But are also very clearly not human. Some people feel akin to fairy and go by fae. Likewise, myself, although I use She/her and I am totally Trans Femme, I'm actually non-binary but more orcish/oni/ogre so if I did a neo pronoun I would use one to reflect my large aggressive self. But I can't figure out how to structure it so I haven't. 

&#x200B;

* In a sentence. 
* Fae:
* Fea did the work. 
*  Frenda began dancing with feaself. 
*
*That it goes by he/its? And yea, I have met many people who like to be called by it/its pronouns, it is uncommon, sure, but not unheard of. I do get the hesitancy of calling a person it, because it can feel weird to refer to someone in the same way you refer to a chair or something else inanimate
Yes people use it in a derogatory way but it doesnt mean that people dont use it as a pronoun. I personally identify with it. The same way that the word gay is used in derogatory ways against people but thats doesnt mean they arent gay. AND the same way that anything else is used against people as an insult even though its something some people identify with
It pronouns are mostly derogatory because they’re misgendering and othering, no? Therefore it’s not derogatory when they align with your gender (usually in some form of “other” category/outside of categorization)
Thank you thank u 🧡🧡
Yep. It’s, feels like a slur because that’s how it’s been used towards me when I was a kid. Super hard to call people that.
Cool, this post is literally not about you
Maybe they made a new account so they’re old/main account wouldn’t be blasted with people disregarding/diminishing their pronouns?? Unless somebody’s  using a slur or an entire phrase for neos, there’s no reason to assume somebody is a troll because of their pronouns. 

Now, I wonder why you mostly see it on Twitter… totally couldn’t have to do with the fact that putting pronouns in your bio is extremely common there (often considered courtesy) or that announcing you use them IRL is likely to get you ridiculed…. 

Edit: checked their account, wtf do you mean no activity
I honestly feel that using it/its pronouns is completely removed from that whole situation with cis people.
Tbh being called ""it"" pretty much ruins my day. It hurts enough that I don't even want to remember it. For someone to want it creates this gigantic contradiction in my brain, I want to see myself as compassionate which requires respecting people's desired pronouns but also requires not ruining their day. Even if I logically know it's what the person wants, it empathetically hurts.
It’s particularly funny if you consider it’s the first pronoun (and sometimes word in general) we’re all referred to when we exit the womb! 😅
I read it in a book years ago about trans people, going over the wiki page I see no mention of that. So I'm starting to suspect that might be false, as P.U.F seemed to use the neopronoun ""Friend"" or ""P.U.F"".  Which is even more awesome IMO.

&#x200B;

\---

20 year old books, and memory being unreliable.
THIS!!! thank you so much for explaining better than i could ><
fucking... gdi. No you are 1000% right. It can be hard to use in that tense. Its the kind of thing where ""They"" is the gender neutral pronoun I've kinda defaulted to using for literally everyone, but taking issue with it still throws me off. Love my friend, respect it's pronouns, a slip up I have to do better to avoid

Genuinely ty for pointing that out <3
I’m sorry but did they not say “any” trans person? So am I not allowed to give my personal perspective on it? I don’t think they’re trolling but just saying how yes SOME trans don’t like it but if they want to refer to theirselves as an it, that’s all them.

But cool my reply was to OP it was literally not about you
The person youre replying to is also transmed / truscum
it's also worth noting that many autistic and neurodivergent people have a different experience and conception of gender and it's not something others could exactly understand or empathize with 100% bc they just come from a different perspective. which is okay! being referred to as ""it"" from someone purposely misgendering and dehumanizing is very different from someone consenting to the pronoun and someone referring to them respectfully, it depends on context. and even people using it/its can be called ""it"" in a derogatory way from transphobes as well. for example, i have an autistic friend who uses multiple pronouns including it/its, but only wants close friends they trust to use it/its pronouns because of this reason
Im autistic and people who have autism usually process gender and feel gender differently. As for me, being perceived as something that is outside of gender (it) is fine with me, i understand it hurting you, and even i have been called IT as an insult before and of course it hurts but its important to not project your own personal insecurities and issues onto other people and learn to detach insults of ignorance from actual queer identities
i know you mean no harm with this comment, so I apologize if this comes across as rude, but I find it a bit odd that a comment like this is generally regarded as a fine thing to say about neopronouns when a trans woman like myself would be (rightfully) scolded for saying the same thing about masculine pronouns.

I understand why some people want to be called “it/its”, not because I relate to wanting to be to be referred to that way, but because that’s just sort of how pronouns work. It’s degrading when I’m called “he”, but that’s not true of my transmasculine siblings and brothers. It’s empowering, affirming.

Again, sorry, I know that this is a bit more complicated than I’m probably making it out to be, but I feel like we don’t need to fit into somebody’s exact pair of shoes to understand how those shoes fit that person.
Hadn't thought of that!
Yea for sure, we're all out here trying to do our best, that's all we can do. Some habits are definitely harder to break than others <3
Would it be equally appropriate to say this in the context of a binary trans person saying they loved being referred to with properly gendered pronouns?

If I as a trans woman said I love being called she/her, I’d probably feel pretty put down if a bunch of people came to me to tell me about their awful invalidating experiences with that pronoun set as a response. That’s not the topic.

People like being referred to with affirming pronouns. That’s normal, so if someone is complaining about their pronouns not being taken seriously, I understand being upset by people *as a response to that complaint* marking grievances against the use of those pronouns.
- sees a post checked as ""vent""
- ""guys I'm very upset, because people don't respect my pronouns""
- ""AKCHUALLY PERSONALLY I would HATE to be called those pronouns, they're TERRIBLE for ME""

like literally who asked
That would make sense
To maybe make it a bit easier to rationalize for people it would be like a transphobe trying to be transphobic and referring to a transfemme  by she/her. Even though it’s correct the intent was what made it derogatory
Wouldn't outside of gender just be they/them or ze/zem? I don't understand why ""it"" is used
Pronouns are not gender. There are cis people who use they/them in certain situations. There are non-binary people who are uncomfortable with they/them. If you don’t understand why it/its is used, you could ask someone who uses those pronouns. But they may not want to share intimate details about their gender and that’s okay too. We don’t have to understand every single person’s gendered experience in order to use the pronouns they list.
because some people, like myself, resonate with it more. Its just as simple as that. If someone can use ze/zem then someone can use it/its. I really dont know what else to say on this. Reiterating a very important point in this whole thing, i am autistic, and people with autism usually process and feel gender differently. ex. feeling like their gender is outside of being human or a person. It all depends on what feels right in the end, there's no need for an explanation when it comes down to it, and some people don't have an explanation, its just that being called it makes some people happy, and feel good in their own body.
Because that’s how they feel about themselves in their own skin. 😊
Fellow autistic trans person reporting in!!

I really enjoy your perspective!!!

I prefer they/them and see myself outside any binary definition!

I'm definitely more fem but at the same time I don't feel the need to seek validation from others in terms of more feminine pronouns.

It sometimes bothers me when someone uses he/him but that feeling is fleeting and I refuse to give other people power over MY directing mind."	x882x8	trans	603	0.94	2022-09-07 15:29:19
Hey! Would anyone like to join a discord bookclub? I’ve only recently started exploring my gender identity and most of my irl friends don’t really understand what I’m talking about, so I thought it would be a cool idea to make friends while also doing something I love, Reading!	[discord link ](https://discord.gg/mUszJ2n8)	"I am FTM, need friends, and love books so much I plan to study literature and writing at university. 

I am SO in! 

(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ✧
What kind of literature?
[deleted]
It could get me back into reading, depending kn genre. Plus, friends would be nice.
If you're into fantasy genre, I do highly reccomend Kith & Kin. Its a book based off the campaign 1 of the popular D&D group Critical Role! 

The book explores the backstory of Vax'ildan & Vex'ahlia before the beginning of campaign 1, its also a book where you really dont need to know anything about the series to follow along and be sucked into that world. But Critical Role has soooo many amazing graphic novels as well, that explain and go over the origins of the characters, story, setting, etc.. that its a pretty easy series to jump into and get a understanding for.

Kith & Kin is a very recent release and I've heard only good things about it, and the small friend group i have has also been enjoying it! 

So if you're into fantasy/D&D aesthetic books, Kith & Kin is a great choice
I’d like that. :) I used to love reading all the time. Joining a bookclub might get me back into it.
I'd be game.  I've been searching for a bookclub, and this sounds fun
[removed]
Sounds fun
Cute idea! Would it be the kind where you all read the same book, or the kind where you each read a book then share it and recommend it to the other club members when you’ve finished it?
I'm down ☺️

How do I join <3
i would love to! i need more trans friends and i’m also trying to get back into loving reading!

That sounds fun!! I sort of fell off of reading for a while but I’ve been trying to get back into it, and this sounds like a fun way to do that while also meeting people! : )
I’m down! I’m in a graphic novel/comic phase, just wrapping up Sandman and my next is Watchmen.

I dont read often but I write a lot, if youd have me
I like to read SHTF fiction.
Yeah sorry I don’t have money for books.
That would be awesome. One of the things that helped me understand myself and come out was books. The two that helped me were Gracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky and Being Emily by Rachel Gold. I'm mtf and these books opened my eyes because I found myself relating to the characters in a way I never have with other books before.
Need to know what books! I am reading Quantum Brginnings by Joe Kuster atm.
Sure :))
I don't read much, but I really want to!
I am not reading that much currently but sure
What kind of books ?
I would love that I read a lot and a book club sounds really nice
oooo fun but i don’t read a  lot of books
Count me in!
i’m down!!
Count me in ;)
Iiiiiinnn!!🥳👍🏻
Hey, currently cracking ftm here. I have no friends that I can come out to so I'd love to get to know some folks who know who I actually am. Also, reading is everything. Bring it on.
I'm interested. I've recently gotten back into reading and would love somewhere to discuss :)

Oh my god yes
I'd be down for that I'm a literature nerd MTF and could use some more intellectual friends who feel me about my trans ramblings
Seems fun! I need an excuse to read, anyways. Recently got Dune if you wanna read that together!
HOLY SHIT YESS
This sounds so cool! Id like to start reading this year so this would give me motivation to do it!
I’m non-binary transfemme and I’d love to join a book club. I have so many books (or comics) I’d love to read and talk about.
Definitely! How do I join?
That sounds like fun
omg i would love to! i need new book friends         *\(^o^)/*
Hey I’m down for that!
I'd love too make more trans friends and I'd love to get Into reading, I don't do much now but it seems fun, I'm 15 so maybe to young? I'd love to join anyway
I'm in. Let's do this!
That would be amazing! I have been picking up and putting down the short book, Beyond the Gender Binary, by Alok Vaid-Menon for months. It might help to have the motivation of a group reading and disecting the material together 😊
I’m down!!
I'd definitely be up for this! Let's read a book!
I would like an invite! I've been reading You and Your Gender Identity, which is really guidebook. Are you thinking fiction, non-fiction, any/all?
I’m absolutely in if you want!
Would love to join!! FTM 23
i need friends and need to read, absolutely!!
Sounds fun I would definitely love to join :3
Definitely 100%
Hey i’d love to!! Books are my passion, love an invite if ye make one
As long as I can listen to the books on audiobook if available, I'm in. My schedule makes it hard to read myself
I'm in!
I would love to join a discord book club! I have also started exploring my gender identity or identity in general. I also really, really like to read!
I’m not trans, just supportive of this community and trying to be open and learn as much as possible. I’d love to be a part of a book club if I’m welcome.
Could we like, not specifically read trans/queer centric stories?

Like, I’m not against it! Bring them on, I love your recommendations.
I just honestly read a lot of spec fiction and scifi…

My nerd>queer ratio has its preferences!
Heck yea!! Genderfluid bisexual femboy here lol
Yes!!! I’m ftm and would love to talk books with other trans bookworms 📚
Yo dude sure thing!!! Though I don’t really do much reading… but I would love to do more of it!
I’m really into very philosophical and existential stuff like science fiction. But haven’t really delved anywhere else besides that.

Also I’m kinda in the same boat as you honestly in terms of my gender I’m just a lot more closeted and more confused as to what I am.
I’d definitely be interested in that as long as it’s 18 or 21+. I’d love to discuss literature with other trans or lgbt+ adults
Of course!
I would love to join that!
Me me me
I can't read tho
I'd might be interested in a book club. I fear I'd have a hard time keeping up when I have a busy schedule though.


I'm currently reading ""Tranny"" by Laura Jane Grace, an American Punk Rock musician of the band Against Me! 

She also has an amazing album: Transgender Dysphoria Blues

I saw her live before that album and her transition. I would love to see Against Me! live again.
I probably won't be super active but I could try, also I have a book suggestion ""symptoms of being human""
Um you recently started exploring your gender identity? What made you want to do that?
Omg this sounds amazing! I love books and am currently rereading my favourite book as of now! (Of whom, the main character is a trans woman) I would love to join ☺
I'm a huge bookworm. I also play ttrpg which is like ""next step from books"" if you are interested
May I also join
LOVE THIS, yes! <3 great initiative, thank you for this!
I think this would be great! I need some motivation to get back to reading, which I love.
Ohhh, can I join? 
Although, I'm only 16 years old, I hope that's not a problem.
I’d be interested how do i join ?
Yes! Dm me!
i would love that so much reading is like my only interest right now!!!
Absolutely!!!

I’m open to either, I just find the second option always gives more freedom of choice to those in the club. Like, I prefer horror novels, but most of my friends like adventure. When one of us reads one that has elements of both, we recommend them to each other and often end up loving the recommendations!
Thank you so much!<3

If you're interested, you can also try the following titles: 

1. Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe - a graphic memoir

2. Orlando by Virginia Woolf 

3. Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay
Would be stories based around events like the collapse of society, wars, disasters, pandemics even. Maybe even apocalyptic..? If I recall correctly the SHTF phrase is used/came from the prepping and survivalist communities. They are good at making you think what you would do in certain circumstances and maybe prepare for a possible event yourself.

My household has a SHTF plan should the earthquake fault we live near ruptures, or a scrub fire threatens our home.

Thank you! I’ll look them up :)

my mother thinks transphobia isn't real???	"she's extremely catholic but she doesn't believe that anyone is actually against trans people. according to her, nobody cares.

this is the same person that tried to kick me out of the house when i was a child because she *thought* i was a lesbian. I was dating a guy at the time! i didn't even like girls then!

i bet if i came out to her now she'd get rid of me in a heartbeat. honestly i don't understand her at all. goes out of her way to say all sorts of transphobic junk and then turns around and says that everyone basically accepts trans people anyway. the prime minister in our country is literally trying to pass a bill that lets schools choose not to let queer kids in for ""religious reasons"", and my mother says ""oh that's just one thing it doesn't matter""  
???of course it matters! kids are being denied education for something so trivial, and using *my faith* to justify it! i'm tired of it! every time Christianity comes up in the news or on social media its always because of some transphobic garbage (or just bigotry in general) and it's fucking everywhere!

&#x200B;

i can't go one day without someone talking about how there are laws being passed basically everywhere just to make our lives harder, or how people are joking about us joining the 41% (>!and goddammit at this point I might as well end things and make it 42%!<) or how all trans people wanna surgically massacre children (bloody hell it's hard enough for me as a grown ass adult to get people to stop calling me she, let alone go through any medical procedures for my own sake. even if we did want to surgically change the sex of random children we don't give a shit about it'd be impossible with all the medical gatekeeping there is nowadays.)

&#x200B;

im sick of it all. I wanna give up and just live the rest of my life as a tomboy but i can't help but feel like shit every time I'm called ""she"" or ""girl"". it's such a small thing but it feels disgusting every time. and I can't even blame them for it! i do look like a girl! i do look like a she! and i fucking hate being stuck that way! all these horrible things are happening and i can't do jack shit about it! why the hell are Christians nowadays so obsessed with being the worst people possible? what's the point in going to church every week if you throw everything you hear out the window whenever queer people are involved? there's **nothing** in the bible that condemns our existence, there's **nothing** in our faith that justifies transphobia and being transphobic goes against almost everything Jesus tried to teach us.

&#x200B;

i'm tired of it. i like being Catholic. I do feel at peace when i go to church, when I pray, or when i simply stand in front of a crucifix. i like being trans, i like being unrestrained by gender and being the truest version of myself. my faith and my gender identity are both important parts of who I am, and I wouldn't be *whole* without either. it just sucks that the same people I go to church with are probably praying for me to hang myself because i'm a tranny, and other trans people are probably hoping I'd abandon God, and start siding with the devil (maybe not literally but the memes/jokes I see about gay/trans people partying in hell is so fucking annoying at this point. would it kill people to not encourage the thought that being queer is a sin?)

&#x200B;

i wish i could just tell my mother how scared i am. how tired i am waking up *wrong*, every day. I wish i wasn't afraid of *her*."	"Has she been watching the news?

&#x200B;

Best wishes on a safe withdrawal from enemy territory, whenever you can get out.
Sad to say: the catholic church isn't very trans friendly. It's anti-you pretty much. Religion is that way now. Esp in USA. Just keep yourself safe. I get the conflict, but being the real you is far far more important.
Here's what you do

Step 1: Wait for her to say transphobia isn't real

Step 2: Immediately come out

Step 3: Remind her that lying is a sin, and that if she does anything transphobic she is going to hell for lying.
My mom will say something transphobic and straight up afterwards say she's not transphobic and doesn't get why I'm mad at her.

I'm 100% with you mate.
I’m sorry about your mum. I’m also trans, queer and Catholic (with nuance). I don’t see the Church as being a part of that cultural practice anymore. The Church have brought almost no good into the world and continue to intentionally destroy, wherever they go. It’s frustrating and maybe it’ll change but until then, they’re coming nowhere near my soul, ye know?
I saw an interview with a high level member of the KKK, and they said they were not racist. Because in their mind what they perceived was truth. 

Everyone knows being homophobic/transphobic/racist is bad. But if someone is indeed one of those, they will deny it, as that label is for evil people. Someone that thinks gays are going to hell and are brainwashing children to abuse them isn't homophobic in their own eyes, as that is reality, and they aren't going out and running gay people over with their truck. 

I've found the best way is to not say ""you are [thing]"", but ""what you said is [thing] because [reason]."" Either they will dig in and defend themselves, or they will listen because they don't want to have that label.
🫂
I’m so sorry about you mom. People like that just want to believe they’re soo oppressed and that the world is against everything they’re for. “I hate trans people but they’re not illegal so no one else hates them 😡” is pretty much their mindset but genuinely what do you mean by ‘surgically massacre children’?? Wtf do you mean by that?
She is either and idiot or in denial. Either way, an unsafe cis person. I am so sorry.
I've never read the Bible so I won't question you or her on that, but she is definitely wrong if she things that no one hates transpeople. Often times I find men who don't even realize im trans till I tell them then its ""43 percent yourself"" and ""you honestly think you can change your gender? What an idiot"" or ""I feel sorry for your parents id disown my child if they were trans."" It makes having long-term meaningful relationships difficult. Another thing, the 43 percent statistic (that changes depending upon the person amd can be as high as 50 sometimes lol) is only attempts and not actual deaths. I would argue the existence of any systematic discrimination though at least in the United States.
I grew up in a Catholic/Jewish home.  I retain a bit of an affinity with both, but I also see that the failings are so overwhelming that I don’t feel at home with them.  So, I look forward to seeing my own way of interpreting and it comes down to this:  Compassion is the one commonality that I’ve found in most faiths around the world.  “Hungry I was and you fed me, etc.”  But, all of them also fail at this in one way or another.  If a faith rejects you (and that includes a parent’s faith) then the faith fails.  If it feeds you then it succeeds.  If it only feeds part of you then you are free to add faiths that feed the empty parts.  

In America and European cultures you seem to be allowed only one religion.  In Asian cultures, such as Japan it seems strange to be so limited.  I draw from as many beliefs as I need to keep my brain from exploding from the bigotry of any of them.  

If you’re worried about cultural appropriation ask someone from that culture.  If you are respectful, they will understand and offer some accommodation.  I know this from my own mixed racial heritage (European, African and Asian).  I’m lucky in that my mother was matriarchal in her culture and her parenting, and her children had her blessing to choose their own path.  (I never met my father, but I’m told that he was an abusive patriarch.)

Just don’t go where you’re not invited.  It sounds that the Catholic Church is not inviting, so retain from there what works best for you, and find the welcome that you need in another tradition.

You don’t need to limit yourself just because other people want to limit you.
onlyread a bit so take with salt.


ask her to take you to church and introduce you. Now your fear is her fear. her discomfort is what you might feel every second.

too many people can't feel what another feels.

Jesus asked everyone to attend his sermons. If a congregation cant make you feel welcome they are doing Christianity wrong. personal opinion.
Remind yourself that the community that supports you is blatantly smarter than the community that doesn't. Take a good look at your allies and then look at your enemies, the people who want you to feel bad are as predictable as actual children, they just kept on developing after childhood with the absence of their judgement. Not your job to educate annoying people, go have fun

I wish you luck friend, stay strong, stay safe
I've come to the conclusion over a long time that religion is not compatible with lgbtq people. Religion is built from the ground up as tribalism to exclude everyone that isn't just like you. The ONLY exception I've found is unitarian universalism. I've found many of these churches are very accepting. My local UU church has a lesbian preacher. It's still kinda iffy though, but it's the closest to being friendly
Right when you get the chance, move. Do a lot of research and emigrate. I know this is big, but America isn’t that bad for me. I’m 13 and FTM trans in a public middle school. Sometimes I wanna shoot [anonymous] and punt [anonymous2], but other than that, I love it here. Just don’t be in Texas or the other transphobic states. Virginia is where I’m at, it’s probably got the most redneck Christians here, but thank god I’m a minor and they’re all angry dads in their mid 40s. As long as you’re not in your mid 40s too, it’ll probably be fine. You could start over in America and only your doctors would know you’re one of us.
>Has she been watching the news?

Yeah... Fox News. 🤦🙄
Some churches are trans friendly. Some churches are tolerant. The majority are not, and the Catholic church especially is not.
Because to people with intolerance the label is a step worse than them in their mind. A racist person will say they aren't racist, because what they think to them is truth or they aren't burning crosses in people's front yards.
Dw I'll help you defend your soul, I'm atheist so I can distract them by talking about how Jesus was fully human and had human urges. Nudge Nudge Wink Wink.
Anyway I gotchu fam
Eh, my Jewish (reform) temple is INCREDIBLY inclusive, and that's been a strong theme I've seen.
I don't think religion can be so simply conflated as ""tribalism"", nor should it be. But I get the sentiment.
Unitarian Universalism isn’t even a religion, it’s more of a spiritual practice
Given that OP is clearly not in the US, I'm leaning more towards Sky News, which is pretty much the same thing.
Reform poggers
I believe that's giving it too much credit. I'm firmly anti religion in all contexts. It creates otherism.
Well, I was joking.  But you get the idea. 😁"	ukbxil	trans	575	0.98	2022-05-07 12:08:06
i want to press send, but my hands are frozen.		"It's ok to be afraid, Avery. This is a big step. But if you're sure in your heart of hearts that that's what you want, then pursue your vision of embracing who you are meant to be. Life's too short not to. Good luck!
give warm water a try, that should thaw them out :)

but seriously, send it if you're definitely sure you want to do so. you're very clear in your message, I'm sure your parents will respond well
It takes tremendous bravery just to be ourselves in this culture. You can do it. It's worth it.
go avery!! i believe in you (but if you can't press send, that's okay too <3. this is a huge thing!!)
All the feels for this. I'm sorry you hate to wait - avoiding having to experience an unwanted puberty must suck and is a key reason why I argue that allowing teen transition is REALLY worth the risk:reward. But you can still have a lot of big advantages over doing it with a few extra decades under your belt.

You can do it.

Being trans is going to take a lot of these moments, on all sorts of scales. It does get easier. 

Its only fair to note that I am one year in (yesterday) and having another round of rather crippling doubt and confusion. But I would still say you should do it IF YOU TRUELY BELIEVE YOU NEED TO, and it sounds like you do believe that. I have still found pieces of myself, and humanity/the world that I would have never found any other way. And on a higher level, that kind of makes doubt impossible and irrelevant (I do think a lot of it is from the intersection of my other challanges + the fact its HARD to be trans. I'm probably super trans, even if unclear right now - just having trouble with the process). But that doesn't change the human experience either.

OK don't want to go on and make this about me. Its complicated but its not fair to only give you encouragement without the full view, and maybe this helps some.
Breath. Loosen your shoulders. Put the phone done and stretch for a bit before you hit send. It's going to be okay. We're here for you every step of the way.
Sending you luck and courage!
Really well written 💕💕 Good luck, hun 🥰
Send it girly that is beautifully written
This is a big step, Avery, its natural to feel afraid. I can feel your emotions in your words, and hope you mom can act with love and not fear. You deserve love.
Definitely scary. But you should be really proud, too, to have gotten this far.
I was in a similar situation and I wrote an text of comparable length and couldn't send it to my parents. My best friend was able to persuade me to send it and it was good, it really helped and all I wanted to say is that i wish you the best when you decided to send it.
Tell them you don't wanna be a gay man when you're  older do you? You want to look like and be a straight woman.  A lifetime of gender dysphoria and hiding  your  true  self sucks.  I remember bits at a young age. Wanting to wear my sisters underwear instead of my boy clothes. At school I was forced to be a boy but I was a shy girl at heart and i felt more comfortable hanging out with girls. Of course the girls didn't want a boy in the group.  So the boys it was and the questions, why don't you like girls?  Are you gay? I'm thinking no I'm a woman. I was a mean boy to myself and others because in a way I resented being a guy. For some gender dysphoria is a feeling that never goes away.  You are stuck between two worlds.  The boys locker room was the worst!  I almost failed gym class because I didn't wanna shower and wear  shorts. Lol anyway  It's harder for women to make a life. If you do transition always must be a independent woman first. Respect yourself and others.
Beautifully worded Avery. Love your name btw couldn't get my husband on board for that to be a potential baby name. Your mom seems very supportive and I know that sending this might seem hard but it will open a conversation and hopefully a door to your future as the woman you are on the inside. Good luck!
I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this. You deserved better when you first brought this up.

You are who you are - you are, always were, and always will be a woman, no matter what else happens. I hope your mum accepts this and does her best to make up for past mistakes, accepting and celebrating you as her daughter.

You don’t need her permission to be yourself - you don’t need to argue for or justify your existence. You just need to assert who you are. Others can choose to be decent people and accept it, or to not be decent people and try and argue. That doesn’t change who you are.
Just do it Avery! I believe in you. I know the feeling of the anxiety but you did it before and you can do it again! Don't let fear swallow you <333333333333
Sending much love❤❤
you got this avery, i wish you all the best 🐣
Good luck, Avery. That is very well written! You can do it, girl!
Courage, sister!
Tell us how it goes Avery. Keep us updated
You can do it. It's ok to be afraid of taking such a massive step. Just remember we're all here for you.
Good luck my fellow sister😇
I tried taking a first step just now and froze. And mine was a micro step, not a big brave girl step like yours.
This happened to me a week ago! I was trying to send a simaler message to my mom but I couldn’t do it. Having the strength to type that out makes you so much stronger than many people. Though that dosent mean their lesser. You are doing amazing Avery!
I wish ya luck Avery. It's hard to share this with a parent, especially if they previously shut you down and tried to pin it on other things. I think this might be a rough battle for you, but stand firm. Hold your ground. You've got this.
It is okay to be afraid, be true to yourself ❤️
I'll do it for you!! I promise she'll have to adapt. She doesn't really have a choice, because she'd have to disown you to not treat you like her child. In my opinion, just keep reminding her about the name if she gets it wrong.
As a mom, I would be proud of you for sending me that message. I might even cry. Then we will go shopping for clothes that fit your asthetic.
Good luck. Well said. Wish you all the best ☺️❤️
I believe in you, i say to send it.

I personally would avoid saying peer pressure contributed at a point just because its important that this is focused on how you are feeling internally and I am worried it would make it seem like thats the reason when it isnt
Seconding! I personally was where you were,Avery, but had significantly less self awareness as to what I was feeling meant. I empathize with your struggle (I struggled for 16 years before I finally understood, came out, and lived my truth) and I wish you the best.
thanks for the wise words, but i'll have you know im actually a lesbian. this isn't to negate your point though
Thirding! I didn’t know how to describe how I felt when I was your age. I hid from myself for 20 years.  I wish I could go back but forward is the only direction we can go. Good luck, thinking of you. <3

De-transition Awareness Day	"Twitter has informed me that today is de-trans awareness day. While I fully support everyone’s gender journey, I can’t help but have some complicated feelings surrounding some of the posts I’m seeing. Many de-transitioners seem to feel like they were pressured to transition from family or healthcare providers, and seem to be advocating for less accessibility to transition resources. Resources like puberty blockers and HRT- resources that would have saved me years of crippling pain and dysphoria if I’d had access to them before t puberty destroyed my body. 

It is estimated that about 8% of people who transition end up detransitioning to some extent. And of those, about 90% do so out of fear for their physical or social safety. 

Just because it wasn’t right for you doesn’t mean that it’s right to deny access to millions of trans youth around the world. 

We all have a right to our gender identities. Don’t let your mistake (their word, not mine) veer you away from allyship or towards transphobia."	"100% agree, fam. I used to lay on my living room floor and cry because E puberty made my body so misshapen.
It’s worse in the UK, with the tories in charge. It’s impossible to get even blockers before 18 without a court case at this stage apparently (I have limited understanding on the matter) because of how de trans people have been depicting the healthcare system. I understand it wasn’t right for them, but they make it difficult for others
I can promise you, most of those posts will be from trolls/people pretending. Nobody is pressured to transition, and in most countries, it's very difficult to even be allowed to transition. It is naught but a way to discredit trans people
Don’t buy into this crud. TERF’s and the right-wing have formed an uncomfortable alliance on this issue, but the nice thing is our president supports us and we have the winds at our backs. We have to press forward and be visible at all levels of society. We can and will do this. 💕
Speaking of what I'd like to be improved would probably be representation of trans people and information about it. I didn't even know Trans people were a thing until I turned 18, so I was already pretty late when I started questioning which in itself took a bunch more years...

If I was explained what they were in a non condescending way when I was like 10, it would probably have changed my life for the better.
I think it can be hard to support people who detransition because of all the fear mongering that comes from conservatives.
Detransition people have been used as an argument to push a transphobic agenda. So when people mention detransition we get weary because most of the time it’s followed by transphobia. This doesn’t make detrans people any less valid.
This shouldn't be a thing.
I usually say it pretty blunt:

Any person who detransitions (for whatever reason it may be) and therefore starts to try and make transitioning an even harder process than it already is for others, is an absolute worthless person, and I also don't necessarily care if they got affected by TERFs (who do love to pile on vulnerable people like this). It's alright to be frustrated at making a wrong decision, but to put the blame on trans people makes this person a scumbag, period.

I rather have 92 people transition somewhat happily (it is already harder than it needs to be) and deal with 8 cis people (who might not be cis anyways but detransitioned for other reasons), if we take the 8% given here, from memory most of the time those numbers are actually lower in the 3% room.
i didnt De transition persay, but i was one of the many who stuffed themselves back in the closet out of fear for their own safety. it kills me every single day i really wish i could be strong enough to just be who i am but ive had too many straight death threats from strangers to ever feel safe tbh. now even when i Know im safe the memories of getting the shit beaten out of me, or getting kicked out of public spaces, or my parents being my angry then I've seen them in my life. idk if ill ever feel comfortable in my own skin. i cant hell but feel had i had access to puberty blockers of some kind this wouldn't be the case but idk. long story short, a little understanding and empathy can really change someone's life
I detransitioned when I was younger and spent a few years as my agab. there were a few different reasons but they didn't hold up. a lot of my life would be way way easier if I had not done it but I also had experiences in that time that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. It was definitely part of the journey but Idk if I'd do it over again. unfortunately the stories that fit the conservative narrative get a lot more attention than those like mine.
I'd be willing to bet just about anything the vast majority of people actually presenting this stance aren't and never have been trans. It's just transphobes posing as ex(?)trans people.
I really like how you framed this cause it's real complex and how it's politicized also further complicates it

. [It does happen but it's mostly not that they aren't trans but because of pressure, but even so some people who do detransition discover they weren't trans, but then politically it's used to defend anti trans laws -> very complicated]

I really learned a lot about de transitioning from Elle Palmer on YouTube. She's part of the 10% of the 8% that de transitioned cause she realized that she wasn't trans. She also addresses these statics and nuances and explicitly states that it's rare to be in her situation and that she still supports trans rights and everything. 
At least from the few videos of her's I watched.

I recommend folx her videos (a little cautiously cause I think the topic in general can give some dysphoricy vibes, for lack of a better term). I really had not much info on this topic outside of how it's weaponized by conservatives
I guess Twitter just meant awareness for a bad example
Now I will always grow facial hair. My voice will always sound too low and distorted to me. Trans men who decide to get top surgery will always have their scars. Just to name a few examples. It really sucks to see people advocating that this is something trans children deserve to go through. It’s too late for me, but it’s not too late for them.
The story is way worse than you know

The person who filed that court case didn't get their hormones until after the age of 16. My understanding is they've essentially slammed the door for all children in Britain

Over something that didn't even happen to them
Yeah the UK is fucked up right now for trans people.

I’m originally from England with a lot of family there and in Northern Ireland, and I don’t feel like it’s safe for me and my family to travel back there any more - which makes me very sad.
>It’s impossible to get even blockers before 18 

But do they even have any purpose at all at that point?
no no, there are genuine detrans people out there.

except, they just like to peddle the myth that ""society forced them to transition"" as a way of excusing the fact that it was probably them who lied to their therapist as a way of getting HRT for some reason that wasn't related to being trans.

obviously it sucks an incredible lot for them and I genuinely feel for them, but I also feel for the trans kids who have to live their lives with a ruined body and with people gaslighting them into being their AGAB, who are probably living the same exact pain and suffering from dysphoria that detransitioners are.

except the only difference is that detransitioners are treated like children who fell off the monkey bars, while trans people are treated like war criminals.
Sorry, I live in America. You’re right. We actually have it okay here. I know it’s hard in other country’s rn but we HAVE to fight for what’s ours. Nobody is going to just give us our rights.
Look, I lurk on the different detrans subreddits, and some of them are honestly people in pain going through a difficult time after transitioning for the wrong reasons. Yes, some detrans people totally flip and become transphobic and that's bad. It is terrible that detransitioners are used as a weapon against trans people, but that doesn't mean we should throw all them under the bus, and deny them the right to call for awareness altogether.

I believe that awareness about detransitioners is important despite the transphobic crap can sometimes accompany it. For one, it's an important thing for people who are questioning to learn about in deciding whether or not transitioning is right for them. And two, some detransitioners are trans allies, and trans people pushing them away will only alienate them from us.

As trans people, detransition should remind us that not everyone questioning their gender is trans and should transition, and that the best way to help those how are questioning is to encourage them to explore everything, and take time to decide what's best for them.
What shouldn't be a thing?
I think some of you are making it more complicated than it is. Isn't it just that some people have gender dysphoria, transition then the dysphoria changes and they realise they don't want to be transitioned, so they detransition? I've been watching some of their videos. None of those said they were pressured by anyone to detransition, only they felt it inside.
One thing I will say if you are a trans man new top surgery techniques have made scars basically invisible just wanted to say because a lot of people might not be aware
That really brightens my future then. I bloody love the conservatives, always focusing on the right things. Like it’s in their nature to be bigots but they could at least wait for the international problem to end first
I was genuinely unaware of it all too, luckily I’m in the most trans friendly area of the place, but I only found out recently that I won’t be able to get HRT for even longer than if I was on a waiting list. I don’t think a lot of people realise how much damage they’re doing
Scotland is pretty chill though if you overlook the blatant human rights violations committed by the SNP government
Puberty continues for a few years after that, especially for facial and body hair growth. But, for the most part, the effects on bone growth, muscle development, and so on are done. It's messed up because if puberty blocking were generally accepted, the risk of transition regret would go down since gendered development would be delayed by some number of years. (In order to ensure proper development after resuming, they can only delay certain effects so long, so which effects are blocked varies.)
Adding on, you have to be on blockers for a year before HRT at least as a minor under the NHS
I completely believe there are people out there who felt something they perceived as pressure to transition, and then detransitioned when they discovered that it wasn't right for them.

I also believe there are people out there who felt transition was right for them, then discovered that it actually wasn't, and have used ""pressure from society, etc"" as a reason for why they transitioned in the first place in order to reduce how much of a mistake they're owning up to.

And finally, I believe the vast majority of people who decide to detransition do so out of a loss of insurance or financial capability to continue their transition, threats to their safety, health and wellbeing, and just overall unhappiness feeling like a persecuted class in society or a combination of all of these reasons.
>society forced them to transition

What society to they live in? A conservative fever dream version of Portland?
Of course there are real detrans people, no doubt. But all research shows that it's very few, and only a tiny tiny part of them do it because they regret it, and not out of outside pressures/circumstances. I'm talking about the people online who peddle detrans stories as a reason as to why no one should be allowed to transition. I'm willing to bet that very very few of them have ever transitioned, let alone detransitioned.
yep, there are plenty of genuine detrans people. and they get preyed on and manipulated by the terfs. chewed up and spat out when they're no longer useful.
De-transition awareness day should not be a thing. It's just an excuse to attack trans rights.
I'm not negating their experience. I'm saying that a whole day devoted to it will do more harm to the community than good (which includes trans people who decide to detransition).
Only for smaller chests, right? Anyways, surgeons in my country won't learn it for years... :/
I’m sorry to hear that. Yeah the wait times are out of control 😩
[deleted]
Yeah, it is one thing to validate the people who did ""de-transition"" and another thing to make a WHOLE DAY dedicated to it.
I think it should be a thing, but it shouldn't be a valid excuse to attack trans rights. It should be a day for people to actually learn or be educated about why people detransition, the stats and how the only solution is to make resources more accessible and easy to experiment with.
it's terf propaganda, nothing more.
It is a bit like ""I prayed the gay away"" day or something...
Which,  is very icky. 
And definitely used as an excuse to attack our rights.
only for small chests yes :/
I just picked a random liberal west coast city for that example. That using and San Francisco would have been a little to cliched for my liking."	m3lwkb	trans	563	0.99	2021-03-12 17:01:49
Is it normal to be trans mtf but not have hated growing up male?	"I'm about a month on HRT so I guess this is all the mental stuff happening but even though I don't associate my identity with my masculine body, there are plenty of times where I have felt comfortable and enjoying life as a male.
I guess I'm wondering if that makes me any less trans because I know people have suffered way worse being stuck in a body they hate and honestly I feel female but I don't hate all my life experiences growing up in a masculine body.

Still going by he/him pronouns and plan on using she/her when I am able to pass in public."	"I think I'm a bit similar

Like no dysphoria (until very recently when I've like *seriously* started questioning and trying to accept myself) as a male
But I feel euphoric as a woman, I feel attractive, I feel nice, I feel cute, and I just feel liberated ✨

Still haven't accepted if I'm trans 😅
I don't know if it's normal but I know it's valid.
Seems to be atypical but not uncommon. I'm of a similar mindset.
Just wow... I cannot tell you all how much I appreciate your comments and advice, this community is amazing and I'm so grateful I can open up like this.
Thank you so much ❤️
im ftm but ive been thinking the same thing lately and thought i was weird for it, so glad to know we're not the only ones!
There have been study’s that show that questioning gender has a spike when puberty hits. I was that way, I was fine till over covid I started having this weird feeling. Skip ahead 2 years and I’m a trans girl on hrt.
Hey !
So, I'm also mtf and can totally relate. I have so many good memories as a male, such as with my friends or my brother. I enjoyed being a male probably cuz I didn't care at that time. Now, some things have changed but I still don't really regret being born male, and I don't think it's a bad thing. We spent our childhood as male, we learnt so many things as male, we discovered the world as male; it's normal to have envoyed all of this right ? Now it's different, we have grown up and we want a change in our life, the reason don't really matter after all. You don't have to feel ""less trans"" than other people, and you don't need to have a trauma or to hate your current body to be trans. Every trans person has a different reason to be trans, and it isn't always cause of bad things happening in their life.
So be yourself, and love yourself.
And to finish I wanted to thanks the trans community for being so nice to each other and everyone else <3
This is a nice way to describe how I feel. I plan to take my time, although my bosses, friends and family know, ill be taking my time. I need to grow my hair out, want to get my facial hair removed first before I plan to swap to she/her and using my name Nia in work. Until then ill stick as I am. I just wear pretty nail polish every day and that makes me happy.

&#x200B;

I should add I do hate the sound of my own voice always have, dont like looking in the mirror at myself and seeing a stranger look back and really hate my body hair.
I didn't hated being male or I thought I barely had dysphoria. Fast forward 19 monts and close 4 momths om hrt I can't say that's true anymore. I relized I jsut repressed everything and only focused on good things, now that I'm more open to myself I know that actually I didn't actually liked being male and I had plenty of dysphoria. Ofc that's my experience and we all have different experiences. Also for me there was a huge mental shift of week 6th of hrt when my brain went full on girlmode.
I’m 20 months on HRT and have totally transitioned and will continue to be a girl forever. 

It’s ~weird~ to remember that I grew up male and was mostly “okay” with it. My body wasn’t, but I didn’t really mind at the time. 

I regret the period from age 21 to 26 when I knew I was trans and was fighting it as hard as I could. I don’t regret the period from 12 to 21 when I didn’t know yet and struggled in the dark because there’s nothing I could’ve done about it. 

I look back and mostly just wish she could’ve been a little more free to have fun and make friends as herself, not that she had transitioned then. I don’t know how I would’ve handled the info at the time, and likely not well because of the environment I was in. 

She made it out okay in the end though. :)
It is probably normal, I am going through the same thing.
It is. Everyone is different, some people have no dysphoia, some have a lot of dysphoia, some finds out really late, and some finds out really early. There's many ways to be trans, which makes it so beautiful and hard at the same time.

For example: I found out that is was trans when I was 12 but my dysphoia first came a year after, and it wasn't much until last year (when I was 15).
But no matter what if you're trans then you're trans, and nothing will change that
It is more common than a lot of people realize. You can know something’s not right without being able to name it, so you bury it and try to be ok with that.
Yes, it is certaintly ok not to hate your AGAB but still not feel right. You should be happy that you don't hate yourself. I'm certainly happy for you. 

I wouldn't say I hated myself but more strongly disliked that I was born male. Hope this makes sense. There have always been things I don't/didn't like about myself, such as body hair, but it wasn't self hatred, just disaapointment and sadness.

Not hating yourself doesn't invalidate that you don't feel right or complete in your AGAB.
im ftm and have similar experience
In recent years I had been struggling with aspects of similar thoughts. I kept thinking to myself I was a fraud, or a pervert, and not ""truly trans"". That's a pretty damning thought process, particularly since I would never think that of someone else who simply enjoy to wear women's clothing or had a fetish. I guess I've just been hard on myself. Even though I was 12 when I finally put words to my feelings that I desperately wished I had been born a girl, they were definitely lots of ""boy things"" that I thoroughly enjoyed as well. As I went through my teenage years, I was very athletic and really appreciated the capabilities that my body full of testosterone gave me. I fully appreciated my capabilities.

Another aspect I was struggling with was the guilt of not being able to fully experience the societal challenges that women go through as they grow up and through adulthood. I wish I could change that, but since I can't I do my best not to dwell on that aspect.

Going back to enjoying male aspects of my life, I guess the reality is is that if I've been born a girl and had the same interests, I just would've been considered a tomboy. And I'm cool with that.
Same thing for me. I do dislike my body, but for reasons not pertaining to my gender in particular. It's just that I really, really would prefer/do prefer being a girl/woman.

There are ""signs"", going as far back as pre-school, of ""transness"", that I can now ""identify"", but that's just me.
Just because you don’t have dysphoria and a hated for your agab, doesn’t mean your less trans. You can still have gender euphoria that’s different to your agab. If it makes you happy, do it🥰
… let me say something I’ve seen people basically scream here, “Dysphoria doesn’t determine whether or not you’re trans, euphoria does.”

Are you happier as a girl? Then you’re a girl, whether or not you enjoyed being a man doesn’t matter. If you don’t have dysphoria good for you, you’re still trans if you identify as a girl! Nobody can change that.
in my experience as ftm, i didn’t necessarily hate growing up presenting as female. but when i moved out of my parents’ house and into an apartment with a diverse group of friends, i recognized that i didn’t strongly identify with being female and starting identifying as nonbinary and using all pronouns. 
i realized however that having people use he/him pronouns for me sparked incredible amounts of joy. 
i now am transmasc nonbinary using he/they pronouns and didn’t start feeling dysphoria until it felt as tho ppl weren’t respecting my gender identity and were not perceiving me the way i wished to be perceived.
in my opinion, transitioning following the euphoria of being your happiest self is just as valid as transitioning to dissolve dysphoria around your agab.
I have the same feeling. I'm 25 and have spent the last few years doing bodybuilding, but still have no hatred towards the person I am currently/was, even though I know it's not who I am
Yeah, that’s about where I’m at. There’s a few points in my life growing up that I’m not happy with (weird christian coming of age ceremony, “congrats, you’re a MAN now” when I turned 13 and all that) but I never really minded being born a dude. Now it’s more of a “oh shit, being a girl’s an option? Don’t mind if I do” situation.

Dysphoria is there but it’s not crippling, I don’t have an issue with suicidal thoughts either, but I see myself in a better light when my self-image is that of a girl rather than an awkward, not-super-masculine guy even on the most cis of days.
I wonder at least in part the hate your describing maybe do to toxic masculinity that they hated?
Yeah it's not that unusual. Anyone who wants to tell you otherwise is just a gatekeeper and should be ignored.
I didn’t hate growing up as female and I don’t hate that I’m biologically female, it’s not bad to be male or female so I’ve never felt angry or depressed about it 🤷‍♂️
Nothing in the world can make you or anyone “less trans” there isn’t an amount. It’s a yes or no question. Are you or are you not? 
So, no, it doesn’t make you less trans. 

Because you just are.
Not uncommon. I had pretty severe dysphoria about my body but I enjoyed being treated as a guy. I prefer what I have now obviously, but I never hated the social aspect of being a guy.
It never really bothered me until a good few years into first puberty so i relate. Then again I enjoy masculinity i just don't enjoy being a man.
Same here...I'm more detached from my birth body than anything.  I don't hate it, I don't love it, it's just...sort of there, and if I woke up in a different body tomorrow as long as the new one isn't worse I wouldn't miss this one.

It wasn't until I had a medically-induced existential crisis...""Good news, it's not testicular cancer, but your disfigurements may not be just cosmetic, you should get tested for XXY / XX Reversal""...on the cusp of 40 when I finally had the ""Well...I guess all the shit through my life wasn't normal after all; wasn't just a stupid preschooler who 'didn't know any better', a stupid fantasy everyone has at some point, and not being burdened in 'create a character' games by attachment to my body"" moment...getting utterly wasted because of said crisis, buying forms, and then having a ""Fuck it, I paid for them, I'm wearing them at least once...fuck, this is strange, it's like I've been made whole in ways I didn't know I was incomplete..."" moment when they arrived.
This is just my experience and it does not mean yours will be the same, but I *thought* I felt the way you're describing at the start of my transition. 

I didn't realize how much discomfort many of my previous experiences caused me at the start of my transition. Living with dysphoria my whole life felt ""normal"" because I didn't know a life without it. When I finally put a word to the experience and felt what euphoria was like, I began to realize just how much I disliked the experience of growing up as a boy. This pattern has continued throughout my transition thusfar. I unpack my feelings on something, I explore what brings me euphoria related to it, then I realize how much I dislike the way things were. I did this in order of my hair, my clothing, my pronouns, my name, my body as a whole, and most recently my genitals. I never tried or really even considered the alternatives to these things when I was growing up,  so the discomfort around them was just my ""normal."" 

With all that said, there's so much more to growing up than those things. I don't really feel bad about any of the hobbies, friends, or experiences I *did* have. I genuinely enjoyed the majority of the hobbies I did (including the stereotypically masculine ones,) my guy friends, and the experiences I had during my time growing up. I still look back and wish that I had gotten to have a more typical girl's childhood, but not in the same way that I look at the things in the previous paragraph and realize that I never enjoyed them in the first place.

This ended up longer than I intended at the start, but I hope my experience will be either relatable or useful in the fact that you don't relate to it.
Yeah it’s fine, being trans is different for everyone
I never hated being a guy until after accepting I was trans.  Before then it was always “easier” to just go with the flow.  I felt completely disconnected from my body, though.  Didn’t care how I looked or dressed, did the bare minimum for basic hygiene.  Very different story now.  Is my life easier? Absolutely not, but I feel like me and that’s worth everything
In my experience in all things my entire life everyone is different.

I've known my entire life and the crippling depression that nearly took me . . . it was hiding in terror the whole time. Ptsd probably didn't help much either but lying was the worst.

That's me. Hi 👋 

I've heard people who never knew until far later in life and that's them. 

I've heard about people who knew right away and were supported and loved and that's them.

Everyone is different and has unique experiences. There's beauty in everyone and everything ☺

You are your own person, I'm so glad you've found yourself and can be happy with your experiences, that's such a wonderful thing! It isn't negative and it isn't something anyone should be jealous or upset about, it's just you and it's beautiful! 😀
I'm mtf, but I didn't hate growing up male. I actually didn't start not liking my body until I realized that I was a transgender woman. And I realized fairly late in life. I didn't even realize that transgender was a thing when I was growing up. So maybe that may be part of it.
I feel the same.
I didn't hate my body (which was, admittedly, always super feminine) but I absolutely fucking hated growing up male and being ram rodded into male gender roles
I’m FTM and I don’t hate that I grew up female. I would just hate living that way now.
I feel similarly- I’m loosely ftm but don’t hate thinking about my time as a child as time when I was a girl. I definitely had some dysphoria, but now that I’m almost five years on T/three years post top, I’m shifting back in the fem direction.
I mean I grew up a boy and did boy things.  I didn't mind looking like a strong guy, though I always preferred to be a strong something else.  I always like video games, but preferred more non-gendered games where you playing as whomever or playing as an alien race, like preferring zerg in starcraft for example and playing rollercoaster tycoon.  Always liked idea of various male hobbies but never really considered them totally masculine, just hobbies.

Actually what you mean by growing up and enjoying life as a male?  Did you just view everything as non-gendered and thought it silly everything was gendered male vs female?  Did you have breaking points?

Like I also had break points were I hated and still hate wearing more masculine clothes like suit and tie and love wearing dresses instead.

I still use he/him irl but that largely because I am still ultra early and would feel like dying of embarrassment to be asked to call she/her and be called Sophia instead.
You're not less or more trans depending if you experience dysphoria or not, it's complete valid if you identify as trans even if you don't. ❣️ 

I've seen this is a common question in this subreddit and yes some trans people suffer a lot from their dysphoria, but every story and every process is valid; trust your own and do show whenever you pass in public!
Yep.  You don't have to hate your childhood etc to know that who you were doesn't align with who you are now.
I dont think that's weird at all. I'm ftm and I think of myself as a girl who grew up to be a man.
Euphoria, believe it or not, tends to be a better indicator of a trans identity than dysphoria. While it's POSSIBLE that you dislike parts of your male figure but downplay them as typical feelings, the more likely odds are that you just like being a girl more than you like being a boy; enjoying the idea of yourself as a female is a better indicator than despising your time as your assigned gender.  


You DID mention that there were ""plenty of times"" where you felt comfortable as a male. While this could mean you had the typical downs that growing up does to people, the times where you were down could be more intense than cis people experience, being a form of dysphoria; unfortunately, there's no real unit of measurement for qualifying something as a dysphoric feeling. In any event, you've found your identity as a trans woman, and that's what matters most. As much as you hear about dysphoric experiences, you shouldn't worry too much about not having those kinds of moments.
I have had a similar experience and I also have just started hrt two weeks ago!
I didn't hate being male, and I also didn't let being male stop me from exploring my gender while identifying as male  I started experimenting with my gender expression almost 8 years before I decided to transition. I look back on the first 27 years of my life in a good way, and I feel lucky that I can do that.
Same with me. We’re in the exact same boat
I don't know if I've thought about it much because I had a really traumatic childhood. I knew I had confusing feelings about girl's, but I think I was too busy feeling bad in general to figure out that it was envy I was feeling. You've given me a lot to think about!
This is how I feel! I just look better pretty.
I don’t think the trans community is known for being normal.
yes, that's me! i grew up,,, generally content as male, though looking back i wasn't really as happy as i thought. never really hated it though, just occasionally daydreamed about being a girl
I didn't hate it I just... didn't vibe with it. There was no part of masculinity as a whole or the life I lived before coming out that I felt actively drawn to or happy about. 

I just did the things I enjoyed, spent time with people I cared about, and figured my total apathy / lack of caring toward my AGAB was normal.

It wasn't until I came out and started transition that I realized how it can feel to actually _like_ your gender. To be able to look at an article of clothing and think ""oh I want to try that on!"" Or to see yourself in the mirror and _feel_ something, anything, about how you look.

It's not that I hated being ""male"" (actually intersex), it's that I _love_ being a woman.
i’ve never hated my body moreso i have hated how people decided my body disallowed me from things like girls nights and all girl sleepovers. i also think as mtf transwomen a lot of how you grow up can actually be pretty liberating as men are trained to believe they have the freedom to do anything
It’s probably just one of many paths. I was able to separate my body from my self and really enjoyed solo sex. Since in a way it was male/female sex.
I'm the same way, don't worry. I even plan on keeping a few masc clothes and not lose my voice entirely just to camouflage amongst the guys in situations I'd feel unsafe as a woman, but then a friend of mine was a bit shocked with the idea, as she'd never go back to presenting as masc even if it kills her.
Literally me
I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't say I really enjoyed much of it either.
A lot of people realise they are trans later in life. I personally had a good childhood, good teenage years etc. And I could honestly say that I enjoyed those years. But once I started to question myself at the age of 18 well... That's when shit hit the fan. I've been on hormones for 2 years and only have been going with she/her etc. For the last of those 2 years. You're experience is definitely valid and does not make you any less trans! Do what feels good and what makes you happy and as long as that is the case, then you'll do just fine <3
Seems uncommon but so is being trans in the first place 🤷🏻‍♀️.
Personally, I don't have any hatred with growing up male. My issues were more distance from the whole idea of being male. I just didn't really fit in with it.  Once I transitioned, I just sort of realized that I'm so much more excited about life as a woman rather than going through the motions as a man.
I don't hate it, for me masculinity is like a dish you would never try again but don't have a particular reason (I do have a reason obviously). My father died when I was young and I grew up with mostly women
Not to be 'That Trans', but ""Is it usual...?"" or ""Is it common...?"" seem like a better way to phrase the question, rather than 'Is it normal...""? I think that's actually the question you're asking. Words like 'normal' play into and confirm the sense that certain behavior/feelings/identities are okay (ie, normal) and others are not (abnormal), and each of us is a living, breathing example of ""F7ck 'Normal!'"" 😉 

I'm absolutely sure this isn't what you intended! Just being super vigilant since the words we use are just like casting spells, and as Hermione said. “It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.”
I always hated my body, but am very glad to have been raised ad male. I was raised in a Midwestern, conservative, religious house, with heavy gender stereotyping, and I would not have been able to do or like the things I do and did if I was a cis girl. It would've been shot down. So I'm glad I was raised the way I was, just wish my body didn't suck.
yep it's completely normal!
That's totally fine
I feel the same when I self identify as demiboy/agender and when I present myself femme (more like a femboy) and/or androgynous, when my sister and others use he/him with me, when I say I'm trans ftm, and enby even if there's a side of my head saying that is not right cause I see myself neutral in a relationship (I dunno if is gay or ""straight"" one but I'm definetely a bottom) when I see myself as genderless/not quite a boy/agender transmasc... yep I feel the same
I felt the same way! I was so confused cuz my dysphoria didn't seem present until the realization that I was trans. So many questions invaded my thoughts ""Am I just faking it for attention"" ""Am I just a very feminine man"" ""Is this just some weird fetish""...but then I asked myself...""Would I ever want to go back to presenting myself as a man?"" And the answer would always be NO.

Every trans person's journey will be unique in a certain way but that does not invalidate who your authentic self is. ❤️
Same here bro I want to start my transition process because I want to feel my true self
You don't have to have hated growing up male to be a trans woman fam. Gender dysphoria, being transgender, these are all things that affect all trans people differently.
Yeah! I mean, i’m sorta similar. I didn’t really hate it but i did dislike it.
Yeah! It's okay to change your identity over time and not hate the old one. I think boy/girl is more androgynous because kids are kinda just inherently a little more androgynous. For me, boy was fine, but man was not fine.
I think it's more than normal, it's natural... You had  a possibility to find yourself, to explore, to check, to think... and gradually to know what you are and what you're not, what you want and want you don't.

You could live your life and taking it step by step, cause you was able to... to express yourself, to figure it out sooner or later on your own 

Not all people are this fortunate, but it's the same outcome, same journey, but dfferent path, pace, environemnt...

Im glad that you had it this way... It should be more like this... for everyone out there.
Not having dysphoria doesn't make you any less trans, it's not a competition to see who suffers the most. The better measure of transness is euphoria: will transitioning make you happier, more true to yourself? By what I can gather from this post, you're happy transitioning, you can sense that you're a woman deep down, that's what makes you trans. Some people need a break in their transitioning journey to think things through a bit more, getting thoughts like yours, doubts. It's okay to take that break, ask your doctor how taking a break from hrt would affect you if the doubts are really strong, talking it out with a therapist, supportive friends, or trans peers could also help. Don't be ashamed to take a break if you need to, transitioning can be tough.
Just because u were not aware of it or had Dysphoria earlier - u should be happy for it. Imagine u have to live for 10 years daily thinking that u r in wrong body. However, some experience discomfort but are not able to describe it until they ‘grow up’ and go out of ‘ child mode’. For example I didn’t have any thoughts of being trans as teen or child and I even didn’t know that it exist but e.g. as body hair started to grow it really impacted my life that I couldn’t wear shorts outside  and I couldn’t change my clothes in front of boys in locker room, I didn’t think of any sexual or gender stuff ( probably because of Dysphoria I couldn’t describe that time, it was easier for me to cope with it in a way just not to think about it). On the end thare no specific pattern what trans is. However, if someone is not trans he/she should notice this during transition. Just because u don’t use pronouns even though u r on HRT doesn’t make u less trans. I am 6 months on HRT and still don’t use she/her pronouns always. Of course I don’t enjoy being called male but currently it’s just not my priority. Because I want to feel like natural girl until I completely get rid of my beards, got longer hair and not to pressure myself by wearing highheels, wig and 10kg of make up just to present myself as women. Because how often u see young girl going to supermarket in high heels - well almost never :) I think HRT ist best sign which can show what is good for u. Other bullshit like pronouns, claiming if u r trans or not etc. doesn’t make u less or mor trans. being so to say trans is about energy and feelings inside us and not if u fit to picture of women in eyes of others. I don’t judge, everybody can chose how they want to proceed within the transition, but Even I present myself feminine and had feminine curves so to say I still get questions well why I don’t use make up, why u don’t use wig. It’s something that went into minds of many ppl. If u r trans u have to wear make up everyday otherwise u r not trans enough. Well go to ever gym and see how many of cis-girls wear make up- few. So are they less women just because of it?
I was very neutral towards my male body until I started questioning if I was trans. I always wished I could wear women's clothes, but the times I tried them on I hated how I looked in them because of my masculine looking body, but aside from that situation I wouldn't say I hated being male. I did come to realize that I was happier being a woman and that's when I started to be more dysphoric about my body. I use the analogy ""I spent all my life eating mediocre food, but since I had no other experience it didn't bother me much; then one day I was taken out to an exquisite restaurant, and the old food I grew up with became disgusting by comparison.""
I grew up male and came to terms with it and was somewhat successful being one. I didn’t have dysphoria, but I kept myself busy at all times so I wouldn’t think about it. I just figured I had to play the cards I was dealt in life. It wasn’t until COVID that I suddenly had all this time to myself and started thinking about where I was going in life. So after a lot of counseling I realized I had to transition. It was the only way I could see to accept who I was.
Literally me
Also the same! 👩🏻
This is the best answer I’ve seen so far! ❤️
Yeah that covid vaccine made me trans too
Similar to me, working from home and not having to mask every day(and then getting laid off) just improved my mental health until I knew that being a girl was the only way forward. Pandemic saved my life. But puberty for me was years ago and it was horrible.
Literally same! I just painted my nails too but I don't plan on wearing female clothing until I physically pass
What you mean full girl mode? Like more aware or emotions or what?
Holy crap that sounds so similar to me… I’m kinda on the precipice though… I still feel ‘a little unsure’ and I haven’t started hrt yet… but I relate so much to “I didn’t really know as a teen” but “Jesus, at 21 I said “oh gee I really should do this while hip growth is still on the table,” and look at me 5 years later still procrastinating

Would you be ok with dm’ing? I’d just love to understand more about what made you sure/got you over your doubts
This. My thoughts exactly.
we are not men but our training growing up told us that we could do whatever we wanted
Same!
Same!!!!!
I still wear pants and t-shirts at home, simply because I prefer the texture of my female clothes to boymode clothes.
It's harf to explain, but I try. So when I realized i was trans, I had this mindset I'm guy who is actually a girl inside so I'm gonna transion into being a girl. I had impostor syndromes that I'm not actually a girl just I wanted to be one. Also my whole way of thinking and feeling was different. So back to the 6th week mark. It was a Saturday morning then I relized I'm a girl and my mind is unable to see itself other than that. I was no male to female anymore to my brain. I was a girl with fucked up body. Also things like gender bender and tgtf stuff which were things I used in my whole egg life instantly became uninteresting and undesirable. I didn't need illusions anymore I didn't wanted illusion, because that's only hurted me. My mind became more clear and I become less intrested doing somethings in the sake of doing somethings. I started to like peace and quiet. Of my emotions become more bigger part of my daily life from there, The highs are higer and a lows are lower and dysphoria is just getting out of hand lately. The more I become connected with myself the more pain I feel because of my body. 

I feel like I feel like a girl and think like a girl. I feel like I'm a girl and when I notice my body is not matching with me it hurts more.
I’m more than okay with that! I just have notifications on my phone totally turned off for everything that’s not phone calls (god everyone should do that ASAP), so it might sometimes take me a minute to reply, but I’m 10000 percent down to chat about it. :)
There are dozens of us... DOZENS!
That's sorta what i thought ya meant ok well i hope your doing well and keeping your mind healthy any way you can :p"	wz1oxx	trans	561	0.98	2022-08-27 12:29:21
I'm a trans Christian	"I'm a trans Christian, and it's a bit confusing. I mean, on the one hand, I want to be who I am, but on the other hand, I want to honor God. I know several Christians who say that being trans is alright, but I can't change my body since it's dishonoring God, several who say it's cool, and I can change my body, and several who just straight up think it's a sin. I've done my own fair share of looking through the Bible to see what I can see, and to do my own research, but I'm still a tad confused. I thought I'd come to a trans community to see if y'all have any thoughts on that. I know not all of y'all are Christians, but if some of y'all are, I would appreciate some feedback, your views, and some Bible verses as references.

Edit: I'm also pan, and I know that there's something in the Bible about homosexuality, so that's not fun

Edit 2: Electric Boogaloo: Thank y'all guys, you really helped me today. I'm still gonna have to do some more of my own research, but you all set that in motion, and made me feel better about my faith and identity. I can't really thank y'all enough, especially since there were so many of you who helped in so many ways."	"Well, are you okay with people wearing glasses or using lasers to fix their eyesight?

I don't see how this is any different. You're simply fixing your body so you don't feel awful about it. 

If you trully believe god is infinitely loving, would he want you to suffer?
Awww sweety I hope you don’t take this as rude, but you can’t let a book like that decide your own personal happiness or what’s right for your own body. That book has been used to justify slaughtering trans people before, if God is real God would want you to be truly happy and love yourself, I used to preach at my local church and the one thing I got from “Christ’s teachings” is that ‘Love Is Love’ ❤️ and you need to love yourself to love anyone else. Christ hung out with outcasts and those society deemed outcasts and the lowest of low (which is how trans people are viewed by most Christians) so don’t think “what would the Bible tell me to do” think “what would Christ do” and Christ would love you, so love yourself ❤️
An important thing when reading the Bible.

The old testament says *a lot* of things. The new testament says one very important thing.

Christ: ""Yeah all the rules in the old testament are outdated bullshit. Love and respect one another, that's the important thing.""
Honestly this probably is (or should be) a subreddit. The word ""christian"" is extremely broad though to it might be pretty challenging to find common ground.

My own experience is that I was raised in an evengelical church with the generic sounding name ""church of christ"" in Texas.  I went to a Christian boarding school which was fairly conservative but there were a couple of progressive teachers and elders here and there. Decades later, when I came out as trans online I was really impressed by the fact that several of my old classmates and even a couple teachers from that school sent me messages of love and support.  No-one has said anything to condemn, or shame, or even really question me. 

As for finding a doctrinal answer... I think it is going to be hard. I remember studying Christian ethics in high-school and there really is not a lot of solid authority about sexuality, let alone gender. But of course what you consider ""authority"" is going to vary radicaly depending on your demonmination or definition of ""christian"".

Just another random observation I'll share is that since going to university, my connection with church really faded.  However, since coming out as trans I have found a new motivation to connect with both spirituality and religion.  I have sought out a queer christian church in my area and I'm really excited about connecting with people there.  If this path leads me to learn more I would be glad to share with you.  In the meantime God bless you on your own journey!
No one can tell you how you can and can't be a Christian. The only real qualification is that you believe jesus christ is the savior. You can be trans and Christian and afaik there is nothing in the Bible that says you would need to feel guilt or abstain from transitioning. 

I'm not a Christian, so I'm sure my advice might not mean much. I'm an atheist agnostic that rifles through religions and philosophy for spare wisdom. But as i understand it the important lessons in Christianity have nothing to do with your gender. And in the long run you'll be better able to be of service if you're living true to yourself.
I mean, you can change your body, losing weight is not a sin, shaving your beard is not a sin, washing your face or brushing your teeth, that's not a sin. If it's about your health you can do it, and that includes mental health. (And if you want i can share tou some versicles that a friend sent me when i was worried about this too)
My understanding is that if god made humans in their image it would mean that god would have to either exist in both male and female at once or be able to choose wich one or gid would have to be nonbinary or something so i think that if you want to change your gender it isnt going against anything it is just being in gods image.
Coming from someone who left the church, I think the best course of action is too look a church that accepts you as you are. Find a church that doesn't discriminate against you being trans. Otherwise, there will be a constant struggle between your desire to be a Christian and your desire to live as a trans pansexual. You will either hurt yourself mentally struggling with that or have to give up one of those two things. Thankfully, there are some churches out there who will accept you as trans. That way you can focus on the parts of Christianity which are important to you and ignore the bigotry. Good luck ❤️
Hi, gender-questioning Christian here.

Long story short, the Kingdom of God is inclusive.

When the scriptures were written, they were done so in the context of a time and of a people that did not have our modern understanding of gender and sexuality.

Just to first ease your mind about being pan; homosexuality was often acted on in a predatory or incestuous manner, or in the context of pagan worship (1 Cor 6:12-20, Lev 18:1-22, Rom 1:21-27, respectively). It also went against the Near Eastern cultural norm, and it was described as ""detestable"", rather than morally wrong (see Leviticus 18). However, the writers did not take into account a loving, consensual, committed relationship between two people of the same gender, since that was outside of the cultural norm.

Now the big one: gender. There is really not a lot to say about it from scripture. There is Deut 22:5, but again, that's derived from cultural norms. Realistically, clothes have no gender aside from what we assign to them, and the verse may have been written to prohibit people from ""trapping"" others in a predatory manner. Acts 8:26-40 gives us some hope though.

Short history lesson: eunuchs were seen as a group that lied outside of the gender binary: effectively, eunuchs were seen as not [insert gender here] enough due to whether or not their reproductive organs worked. So in the Acts passage, we see someone as gender non-conforming (for the time) who is baptized and comes to faith in Christ. He (still identified as male, so I'll continue to use those pronouns) is accepted by God through Philip.

Jesus' mission while on earth was to bring everyone to wholeness through a relationship with God through teaching us to live like him. That includes man, woman, and everyone in between, regardless of how you were born.

I hope this helps :)

Edit: corrected the Deut 22:5 reference
God is not a book, the book is written by men to control man. Don’t let people thst are blind in a faith that lies to them control how you should live. Do you and be you.
Luckily enough, there's nothing in the Bible about being trans. I'd say you're alright.
Leaving Christianity was one of the hardest things I had to do in my early transition. I couldn’t be happier having done it. Freedom from that toxic world has been so good for me. I wish you all the luck in the world friend. Don’t let anyone tell you who you are or what is/is not ok in your own transition. You can do it
Here's the thing, it all depends on how you veiw the bible. Personally, I think treating the Bible like a ""how to book"" is really dangerous. Recognize that the Bible is FULL of history with rich contexts, and that the things that are talked about within the Bible change over time. American Christianity has really enjoyed ""using"" the Bible, because we are a culture that emphasizes that things with a ""practical use"" are valued more than other things. We also REALLY like laws and loop holes, so if you go about looking at the Bible with a mindset of ""how do I use this"" and ""how can I justify my actions"", then you get into very strange and dangerous territory. You begin trying to apply lessons meant for a culture that existed thousands of years ago into your own context, but society has grown so much since then. 

So what does that leave us with?

It leaves us with a book that documents people struggling to be better than they previously were, trying to understand a God who sees them in their context and supports them. Sometimes the get it right and sometimes they mess up.

I think the prime example of this is Jesus. God, coming down to earth to push the Jewish culture away from using the Law as a means of justifying their actions and trapping themselves. Constantly he spent time with people who were the dredges of society (realize that fisherman were deemed ""unclean"" and would never be allowed in the temple since they constantly death with dead fish, and tax collector's were considered traitors to the Roman Empire) and he used his status and power (Jesus being a Rabbi meant that he had a lot of privilege and education, possibly even some land and power, being near the top of their caste-like system (though he probably didn't have much land and power considering his birth place)) to lift up those around him. Specifically, to give hope and life to the people that the religious elite were discriminating against. Jesus focused on the human, not the actions, and the thing he talked most about was ""love your God, love your neighbor, and love yourself"". 

I think that message is the pinnacle of the Bible and possibly the only message that circumvents context.

Anyways, no matter what occured, Jesus slandered by those whose political power was threatened by Jesus' determination to uplift the dredges of society (those people being the religious elite). He would embrace the suffering that occured to him, refusing to use his own privilege as God. He could have avoided pain and death, but by embracing it, he proved his own ""humanness"" and experienced a profound transformation of flesh. By embracing all parts of his identity, he experienced whole-ness. He became perfectly himself, exactly himself, precisely what he was made as.

I think people get caught up in the minutia of what was said and miss what was impactful. The entire Bible is a book about a minority struggling to find their identity and is a documentation of a cycle of construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction of what that means.
I was a Christian when I first realized I was nonbinary. The book ""Transforming"" by Austen Hartke helped me significantly in understanding my trans identity in relation to God and the Bible. (I left Christianity for unrelated reasons)
If you’re looking for more discussion and support I’d recommend joining r/transchristianity  it’s a group that is dedicated to this topic
the bible is full of contradictions I dont see any reason of being in any religion under any identity or anything else for that matter.
Don’t let a book decide how you want to live. The book may be important to you but if it dictates your life and makes you feel guilty then it’s time you found a different book/religion hopefully one that will accept you
Just live your life
The homosexuality thing was a mistranslation.

People originally thought it was ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman"", saying homosexuality was bad, but modern scholars believe it was actually closer to ""You shall not lie with a boy as with a woman"" implying CSA is bad.
hey, fellow Christian trans gal here!

scripture states many times that God wants us to be happy. (see Psalm 37:4, Psalm 126:2, and many other verses). obviously alleviating gender dysphoria counts as being happy xD 

what i believe is, as long as you’re giving God His rightful place in your life, and letting Him guide you in the right direction in His infinite wisdom, you’re perfectly fine as a transgender person. heck, one of the first people who was converted to Christianity was an eunuch. (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208%3A26-40&version=ESV&interface=amp)

i believe that God understands the heart of everyone, even His children who are transgender. as long as you make sure your identity doesn’t become more important to you than God and His plan He has for you, you’ll be alright. i don’t know what God has planned for your life, but listen to Him and He will guide you to do things you never would’ve been able to otherwise, for your happiness *and* for the happiness of other people. (Philippians 4:13, Romans 8:28)

feel free to dm me if you wanna talk more :3
Check this out.  God is infinite, right?  God created ""mankind"" in his image, therefore mankind would be infinite, right?  God is a creator, then that makes mankind a creator.  Therefore it is god's plan for mankind to create.  Mankind has the power, shall I say the duty, to create an existence in line with god's vision of creation.  If mankind wants to alter something in a creative way to express themselves such that their existence brings harmony, then in God's eyes that is ok.  If god created you in his image, then you are god and you can do what ever you want as long as it is in line with divine love.  God wanted you to be happy.  Dont listen to people who do not want you to be happy.  Be happy.
I'm trans mtf I'm a Christian  i see it this way wen God made me he made a woman  but human  genes made a error so in transitioning  I'm being wat god made me
I am not religious, but maybe it's a challenge from God?  
No one ever considers that, maybe you're one of the messengers from God to tell people to accept each other regardless who we are.
having the faith to trust that you are who God says you are, and to go through the process of transitioning is in fact a VERY sacred act. being trans was your cross to bear, and by living your truth, you are carrying it. you honor God’s creation by allowing yourself to live in the fullness of your true self.
Hello, I am a pan trans Christian/former Christian. Its a little complicated but I would consider myself non-denominational just because I've come to prefer definining my relationship to God and the Bible outside of denominations. 

Anyways, I grew up in Christianity my whole life. I went to my church's private school from kindergarten to graduating my senior year and even went to a semester of Bible College. I was taught and know the Bible from front to back, or at least I like to think so. My over simplified take on myself, what God wants from me and what my place is on earth comes from Matthew 22:35-40.

35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,

36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

38 This is the first and great commandment.

39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

I spent my entire life being told that x,y,z was the absolute truth or x,y,z was an absolute sin. It was hard to put everything together, but now I look at things through this passage. If I know my actions are from love, if they hold no hate or ill intention to God or my neighbor, there isn't anything a pastor or friend could tell my that would make me believe I am not doing what God would want. The center of everything is love, love for God and love for our fellow neighbors. Every law, every rule in the Bible hangs on that love as mentioned in the passage. Many men muddle the Bible and their interpretation of it to mean many things. I grew up in a place very similar to the Pharisees in this passage. They put more importance on rules and man's interpretation of what God wants. This passage and what Jesus has to say is the most important commandment of all is what I choose to live my life by.
There are a lot more trans Christians than I realized. It’s nice to know I’m not some kind of anomaly.
I was raised christian, so I have some experience with this. I am not a christian myself, but I like history and theology and have read the bible a few times. 

I’ve found that general christian educations are disingenuous about the actual text and very stringent about interpretation. I went to a christian school for a good bit of my education, and many of the people who parrot texts don’t critically think about what they’re saying or reading. 

First, if man and woman are made in gods image then god is both and neither at all times. His concept of time and space is clearly not bound to human thought patterns, so the concept of correct gender likely does not matter to an all powerful being. 

Second, it is said god knows all his creations before they are born. This implies that god always knew someone was trans, gay, etc. If a supreme being’s grand plan can be undone by trans people existing then they aren’t a supreme being. 

Third, while the original bible texts are said to be written through the divine hand of gods intervention, it makes no mention of copied texts being unalterable, to my knowledge. If we look at the oldest copies we’ve managed to translate, we can clearly see where homosexuality was added as sinful. Originally the text referred to pedophilia, and was altered sometime later, as these words are not a direct translation of one another.
Physically transitioning is no different from internally being trans. It isnt against God to physically transition, its just a correction of a birth ""defect"". Its like saying that we shouldnt operate on an infant with a bad heart, because god made the infant perfect as is. Without the surgery, the infant will die or suffer all their lives, and for trans people its just the same. Without transitioning, most of would live life suffering because of our existence, and many will die by suicide because of suffering. You cannot help who you are, and God would not want you to live a life of pure suffering and still expect you to have faith in him.
If god doesn't want you to exist and be happy, you need to find someone better.
If it helps, remember the Bible isn't written by God. It was written by what man interpereted, and even what they just wanted it to say. God would be absolutely happy with you, he would want his children happy! You're okay <3
Is christianity making you happy tho? Sounds like its holding you back. Ik there not the same but if someone can be openly gay and chistian whats the prob with being trans?
\>>but I'm still a tad confused.

Disclaimer: I'm a spiritual person, but not a Christian and I have some real talk for you that won't be easy to hear. I say this not to criticize you but because I care about your survival.

So there's zero evidence god exists, so you're really absorbing the mismatch of opinions of anyone from a schizophrenic desert wanderer from 2500+ years ago to a modern pastor who knows how to keep the pews filled. Of course its confusing because Christianity doesn't actually make a lot of sense because its the product of thousands of different scholars and writers and theologians making things up as they go along.

I think the more you subscribe to Christian mythology the unhappier you'll be because its a religion of contradictions, exclusion, ignorance, and guilt. And even if you find some verses that make you feel better about yourself, remember, your community won't agree with that and will see you as a monster, because Christianity is in itself a little monstrous. FWIW, a lot of queer people find solace in other spiritual traditions because of how tied Christianity is to misogyny, the patriarchy, and queerphobia.

My recommendation is to perform whatever medical and psychological treatments you need to survive. If that's transitioning then that's fine. Just go on the path you need to survive. The same way you wouldn't be here asking for ""verses"" to justify a kidney operation. See the double-standard you're operating under? Trans medicine is just medicine. Being yourself is just being yourself. In any other case, you'd be fine with it, but its this very politicized case by Christians that has you down. Think about why that is and how you think you can lead the best life you can. You may have to make some hard decisions that isolate you from your community/oppressors for your own survival. This is not a trivial thing and I wish you the best of luck in this.

Get your transition or whatever and worry about the religious stuff after. Take care of yourself because the suicide rate for trans people is very high and I don't want you to become a statistic.

tldr; your survival is paramount and should dictate your path, not the religion spoon fed to you as a child that you never chose. You can worry about the religious stuff after you've taken care of your survival.
I am not personally a Christian but for whatever it's worth I know plenty of christians myself that do not think there's anything sinful about changing your body, and it's my personal opinion that being who you are dishonors god in any way.

There are Christian denominations out there and churches of many different denominations that are welcoming and open to trans people and I hope you'll be able to find a place where you don't feel your faith and your identity struggling against each other. Good luck! I truly hope that if you decide to transition you feel every bit the amount of grace you do now.
The Bible should not be the framework around which you build your life. It can be the framework for your *religious beliefs* but if you look to the Bible to validate or justify your identity, you *will* come away disappointed. 

The Bible is actually several different books that were written by humans over many hundreds of years, compiled by the Council of Nicaea. Most of its contents were written thousands of years ago, and some were contradicts itself in many places. It has been [revised, changed, and translated and mistranslated](https://youtu.be/XKp4yWGTfXo) from Aramaic to Greek to Latin before ever reaching you. It was written *by humans* who were living in a cultural context completely different from ours. Save yourself a lot of misery and try to learn about where the Bible actually came from and how it became the version we know today. 

The Bible says [rape victims should be stoned along with their rapist.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2022%3A23-24&version=ESV) The Bible [endorses genocidal wars in which infants are killed by blunt-force trauma.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20137%3A9&version=NIV) This is not a book you want to consult for matters of morals and ethics. 

If you choose to stay a Christian and live a fulfilling life as a trans person, you'll have to come to terms with the fact that the Bible is not the inerrant word of your god, and you'll probably need to find a church or congregation that is openly LGBT-accepting. Hopefully you can find someone who can give you a more honest look at what the Bible is and where it came from.
Where do you live?? Aside from my mom(?), I haven’t found a Christian who doesn’t want to hate crime me
My personal take is that Jesus himself is trans. If he was born immaculately to a woman that means he has XX chromosomes and presents masc
The views expressed in the Bible, and by Christians in my country in-general, about LGBT+ people were a very large part of why I left the faith. For your own sake, I’d advise that you do the same.
People can and do interpret everything in the Bible (probably other religious texts too but I grew up in a very Christian area) to suite their needs.

You can just as easily make an argument that god told you to honor yourself and made you the way you are. 

I doubt you will find a church in many places were nobody has ears pierced, tattoos, surgery, etc - so we all have to decide on our own what is changing our body in a way that is disrespectful.

Do you consider having a heart transplant against god? Probably not. Why is hormone replacement against god? Who got to decide that? Was it fallible humans or the Devine that interpreted things this way? 

One common thing I remember is a quote to the effect of ‘God will measure you by the same stick you use to measure others’.

Side note, I am not actually Christian just thoughts from the outside that I hope help?
I find it really hard to find any measure of personal happiness or truth in something that can so easily be used against me. The Bible was one of the most poorly written pieces of low fantasy that was used to horrify the people living under once misogynistic warlords and later used by two of the most influential cult leaders of the era to claim they’re god incarnate (or whatever nonsense best fits your narrative) or the sole prophet of a warring demiurge. The Bible can also be so perverted from its original text and so taken out of context that all it contains is the “love” of god and his “sacrifice”, when in reality and in context, any relationship likened to the relationship of god and humanity as shown in the Bible would be classified as extreme levels of abuse. 


I don’t really think any Christian’s heart is in the right place if you can read a book that describes a god that sends hordes of barbarians to rape little girls and kill everyone else and come away thinking “yeah, this guy knows what’s up”. Unless you follow gnostic thought and believe god is super evil and Jesus was the only thing saving us from him, you and the Christian god are completely incompatible. From his past actions and what he has, according to you, chosen to say through humanity, it should be immensely clear that god does not love anybody, does not love you, sacrificed next to nothing to say you are safe from him and is not deserving of an excellent and beautiful person like you.
Ok I don’t really want to get into discussing religion really, and I am not saying all of this to convince you to leave or anything, just wanted to explain why a lot of trans people are not religious and offer my perspective, as someone who used to be Christian before I became trans. And I’m hoping maybe this can help you understand your own faith a little better if you understand why others have left possibly? Like I just wanted to play devil’s advocate here and present another side of the argument, I feel like that could possibly be helpful.

(I also want to preface this by saying I don’t mean to offend anyone or upset anyone, this isn’t an attack on anyone religious, just wanted to add to the conversation)

I want to lightly suggest that there is a reason why queer people are significantly less religious than the the rest of America.
Here’s a good article on the differences:
[Article on religiosity stats](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/24/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-americans-are-less-religious-than-straight-adults-by-traditional-measures/)

For me, I just felt that being queer and Christian was incompatible with one another. Whenever I would ask people at my church if I could still be Christian if I was gay, they would always respond  with a long tangent about how “we will help you overcome your sins and ask for forgiveness.” This isn’t acceptance. I just wanted to go to church without them trying to make me feel bad for being gay. So there was never any time I felt welcomed at a church or anything. And I think this is probably even worse if you’re trans.

And the reason I’m telling this story is that once I finally left Christianity, I lost the guilt I always felt for being gay and I finally found a group of friends that accept me for who I am. And I absolutely know for a fact that I would not have ever discovered I was trans if I had never left either. No one at that church would have ever let me dress feminine and join their service. I would have repressed it further and further. 

I finally felt free once I had left the church, and my mental health and self esteem was so much better for it. I just feel that for some people they never really notice what effects religion has on them while they believe it, so an outside perspective could possibly help you understand these issues better.

Again, I did not mean to offend you or anyone else, I just wanted to give my thoughts on how I think, a lot of us trans people feel about religion and how it affects us trans people in turn. I wish you well in your transition and hope you get the support you need in this thread and this community! 🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️
As someone raised in a Christian home, who went through a long, painful process of questioning my beliefs, I’ll tell you something difficult, but ultimately liberating. 

There’s no evidence for the existence of any gods, and no evidence for the truth of the Biblical accounts. So what the Bible says about your identity is irrelevant. God didn’t write the Bible, ancient humans did—and it contains their prejudices. 

It’s okay to leave Christianity. There’s probably no god, and if there is, I seriously doubt he/she/they cares one bit about your gender identity or expression. 

Talking to a good therapist (one knowledgeable about trans identities AND religious issues) may help you along your journey. 

You are strong and brave for asking these questions, and trying to reconcile your identity with your values. Keep asking questions, and keep being kind to yourself. 

All the best to you!
I'm roman catholic, and my deacon strongly encouraged me to start hrt. He made me feel like I'm not so much of a monster


The Bible talks about us once - vaguely. I think you and I have reasonable doubt to assume god was not referring to trans people when he used the word abomination to refer to wearing cross-gender clothes. 

With the world so undecided about it - and the bible so vague - I think you can argue ignorance. Just do your best, and accept that you'd rescind say wrongdoing if you were actually made fully aware of its gravity. 

I dont know if what I'm doing is bad, and no one else seems to know either. If I face God at the pearly gates and he says I did wrong, I'll beg forgiveness and repent my wrongdoing 

Mortal sin requires you to have full understanding of the gravity of the sin. Given how complex being trans is, I don't think it's possible to not be ignorant. In heaven, you'd probably reject being trans if God told you ""nope, it's actually bad. Youre wrong."" I pray that isn't the case, and my heart says it isn't. But on the off chance that is how God feels, I'd swallow my pride and accept I was wrong. 

Idk maybe that's transphobic, but if God says to my face that I'm wrong, I'll accept it. Until then, I'll do the best I can with the knowledge I have, and pray God and I are in agreement. I truly truly hope he loves an accepts our decision to transition.
do you want proof the bible isn't real well here is some we have evidence of the big bang there is no solid evidence 2000 years ago a man named jesus turned water to wine virgin mary is physically impossible because artificial insemination was invented in 1922
What happens when you pray to God and ask if you are okay in His eyes?
My main point to you is that you need to decide why you believe in Christianity. If it’s because you want to socially fit in, then it doesn’t really matter what the ground truth of Christianity is, just figure out what your social group expects, then decide whether those terms are acceptable to you or whether you’d like to move to a different social group along with the attendant costs of moving. As many Jews say, “G-d doesn’t care whether you believe, just that you obey”.

If you believe in Christianity because you’re concerned with what’s actually True, in an empirical sense, then you sure have a lot more work to do before you could possibly have a justified belief in Christianity! There are a lot of different sects of Christianity and many of them contradict each other. Let alone all the other religions. Privileging the religion and sect you were born into and for which you received indoctrination is not valid reasoning; to get to the real truth incidental facts about you personally are not going to cut it.  

So what’s your concern with Christianity? Social or empirical? That’s where you need to start.
My understanding of God is that He is above all benevolent and kind. He wants us to be happy, in whatever way is best for us. Julian K. Jarboe wrote that “God blessed me by making me transsesxual for the same reason God made wheat but not bread and fruit but not wine, so that humanity might share in the act of creation.” For some people transition is an inherently holy thing, and that by becoming closer to our true selves we also gain a fuller understanding and appreciation of God’s plan for us. It’s an act of communion.
I’m Christian, and I’m non-binary and queer. There are people who try to weaponize the Bible and selectively interpret things to drive an agenda. But the agenda is always counter to God’s message of love and inclusion. It’s possible and important to take both your identity and your faith seriously.

Also, not sure if this helps, but this quote has helped me in the past:
“God blessed me by making me trans for the same reason God made wheat but not bread and fruit but not wine, so that humanity might share in the act of creation”
im definitely not christian and largely against organized religion so take this as you will, but it seems to me that so much of the bible was written so long after the death of Christ with parts rewritten and reemphasized over the years to make it function better for controlling people that if there’s anything that justifies hatred towards yourself, it couldn’t have been Jesus’s word. he kicked it with thieves and sex workers and still his love was universal. i feel like my spirit was made immaculate just as God intended but biology’s real messy and the human body has its own kind of free will. tl;dr jesus wouldn’t hate you and wouldn’t want you to hate yourself for who you are and anyone trying to pull hateful messages out of bible is working against His word
u/Gnurdette  is an awesome Trans Christian, and r/TransChristianity is an awesome subreddit for this.

r/Christianity will say it's not a sin, even several Baptist preachers.
I'm not Christian anymore, but I used to be, so I know the teachings decently.

In my opinion, you should do what makes you happy in this life. God is all loving, right? He gave you what he gave you, but it's up to you to mold it in a way that makes you happy. If he is all loving and all good, he wouldn't make you live in suffering when you can do something about it. We alter our bodies from what nature gave us all the time through vaccines, piercings, medication, GM foods, everything we do. This isn't any different. Take care, and good luck.
My personal feelings about Christianity aside, I was raised in it, I don't think there's any issue with you changing your body. God made you as you are. Mind, body and spirit. God put you in this body for a reason and same with the mind. You're not correcting a mistake by transitioning, you're experiencing the growth God wanted you to. God helps those who help themselves. You've got a long journey ahead but it's part of the plan. No different than a surgery correcting a physical issue or wearing glasses or dying your hair (metaphorically speaking)
So I used to be Christian, but not anymore. The knowledge still dwells within me though. I’d look at it the same way you would glasses, or prosthetic limbs, or a knee replacement. Those things aren’t “necessary” for a human being to live, but they’re quality of life improvements that let a person live their best life, which I feel like is a celebration of the gifts given to us by god. Some people are born without hands, and we give them prosthetics. You were born in a body you don’t align with (from the sounds of it), so take the hormones! No where in the Bible does it say “thou shalt not medically and socially transition”. As far as being pansexual, I’d advise you look into the history of homosexuality in the Bible, because it’s a relatively recent translation change. Also, it’s an Old Testament verse; which was according to many transitions nullified by the new covenant of Christ. That’s why Christian’s can eat pork and wear polyester. I think if you believe in a loving god, then the loving god desires your happiness. He doesn’t put people on earth to suffer, but rather to rejoice. Savor your gifts and live authentically.
I’m personally a wiccan. But let’s pretend for a moment I’m catholic, I was brought up Christian and was like super super catholic. So in the bible we’re all god’s children, that in mind I’m sure god would want you to be you. Jesus Christ (who no matter what religion you are was a real person) preached love and acceptance, accept who you truly are whatever that may he. I hope this helps, love. Best wishes.
Hun, that book has had so much editing in it that I wouldn't take it as fact. At one point it was probably even a decent book to hold near in a moral sense, but a lot of the stuff in there at least now is sorta questionable.
I’m personally not Christian, but the way I see it, you’re changing your body for your own (mental) health - if your religion doesn’t oppose things like lasik eye surgery, it doesn’t oppose other “unnecessary” surgeries like gender-affirming surgeries.
the bible is thousands of years old and has gone through hundreds of translations and edits, a lot of those being from extremely corrupt church officials from like medieval and even enlightenment europe. in all likelihood, a large amount of the messages in the bible are anywhere from a slightly different from the actual message of those in the bible, to purposeful mistranslations that are so bad they might even be against the actual word of god

not to mention the fact that the bible is extremely open to interpretation, it’s written to have almost no concrete meaning.

if you really want to honour god, i guess you can like… try to learn hebrew and be able to read like the actual messages or something. but i can absolutely guarantee that choosing to not be gay or transgender is not going to help you in that
Ngl the bible is fairly inconsistent with delivering clear views on any one topic. There is a reason why there are tens of thousands of split chritian groups who all believe it a lil different. Id say, you should live in a way that you dont regret on your deathbed. If you've done everything in your power toblive a good, moral and happy life, any compassionate and rightious god would accept your choices and understand you.
No matter where you go or what you become God is always there holding you, loving you, protecting you. God also has a sense of humor.
isn't the entire point of god is that he is a benevolent, all-loving father/creator who lays out a plan for ever living thing? wouldn't becoming trans and ultimately your ideal self be part of his plan?

I mean, unless we're talking about old testament god who's kind of an ass
Loook kid. God is dead. I knew her personally…
My partner is a lesbian Christian, if you'd like I can get her in touch with you! And I'm trans so I'm sure she's got her explanations on that, too lol.
*TW: mentions of r@p3*


Leviticus 18:22

how are we sure that leviticus 18:22 is talking about a man and a man? doesnt God know that women would read the bible? so it means that no one is supposed to have sexual relations with men. he isn’t specifically speaking to men, and since he isn’t specifically speaking to men, it isn’t okay for ANYONE to sleep with men.



1 Corinthians 6: 9-10

this passage does not even mention homosexuality. the bible never once said the word “homosexuality” until around 1946, when PEOPLE (humanity) changed it. 



Timothy 1:10

this passage speaks about whores and people who are r@ping other people. not about homosexuality.




Genesis 9:20-27

this is about a father and a son having non-consensual sex. the passage is not clear about if it is referring to the homosexuality alone or referring to the incest and r@p3. 

i am SHOCKED that the only thing you see wrong with the situation is that it was 2 men.


Genesis 19: 1-11

this isn’t about the fact that the men were wanting to sleep with the other men. this was about the fact that the men wanted to R@P3 the other men. they wanted to force the other men to have unconsentual sexual relations. that is about r@p3, not homosexuality.

i cannot believe that the only thing you see wrong with the passage is that men wanted to be with men. how could you not see the rape aspect of it and think that’s what’s wrong?

Genesis also has a general dislike of polyamory and in general sexualizing angels because angels in hebrew dont have a designated gender.




i have done a deep study on the scriptures people attempt to use, and here’s what i found.



also the bible never mentions anything about transgender people.
God isn't real, even if *a* deity existed, the odds of your religion being the ""correct"" one out of the thousands that have existed in human history is basically zero.
There really isn’t anything in the Bible that says that being trans is wrong. Also as far as the body modification thing, pretty much everyone does at least one small thing every day or every week to modify their body. Most of the body modification stuff is in the Old Testament as far as I am aware, but we as Christians are no longer rounder the covenant of the Old Testament and don’t have to follow the laws written out there. When Jesus died on the cross we were put under a new covenant in which there are really only two rules, love the Lord your God and love your neighbor as yourself ( this isn’t to say that things like the Ten Commandments aren’t important, just that we no longe grave to live under the hundreds of laws laid out in the Old Testament ). Also about homosexuality in the Bible, it is actually a mistranslation most of the time ( especially for the Leviticus verse ). The verse in Leviticus originally referred more to pedophilia and not homosexuality. It originally talked about men laying with boys and women laying with girls, but not consensual relationships. The one in Romans says it is unnatural because at the time, it was customary for people to engage in gay acts to worship their idols, but not done out of genuine love for the person. In the story of sodom and Gomorrah, they were actually destroyed for their treatment of the poor in the original text, and homosexuality was added in later. I believe that the word homosexuality was added to the Bible somewhere in the 1940s. This is all coming from my current understanding of the Bible as a progressive Christian. It also should be noted that humans, because we are by nature sinful, make mistakes. There are some examples of translation errors in the Bible, like the one about homosexuality, as well as examples of many pastors and people taking verses out of context to make it seem as if they mean something else. When you put many of the verses about being LGBTQ+ into historical context, and try to go as far back to what the original text said, many of the verses that seem anti-LGBTQ+ aren’t actually condemning consensual relationships or trans people. I found this to be very helpful: https://baptistnews.com/article/why-being-transgender-is-not-a-sin/
I'd ask the people telling you these things where they got their info from. Where is the proof?
You can be trans and honor God, so long as you ignore 99% of what organized religion says about what the Bible says. 

I mean, let's be realistic: if there is a god, he/she/it surely doesn't care about you following some puffed-up preacher's interpretation of how you should live your life. If there is a god, surely he/she/it cares way more about you being a good person, living your best life, and doing what you can to help others. Why else give us emotions and a sense of right and wrong, if not to be happy and do good works? I see literally no other point to those aspects of human existence than to motivate us towards happiness and good works.

Honor god in your own way, and live your own life. You're good.
I'm a former Christian, and I totally understand how conflicted you feel. In my opinion, based on the Evangelical culture that I grew up in, there's very little wiggle room in scripture and in Christian culture when it comes to being transgender. And I can say without a doubt that there's none for homosexuality, in the way that my former church and my peers interpret it.

The apostle Paul was very vocally homophobic (I Corinthians 6:9-10). For me, transitioning meant I was now a gay woman. I was already married to a woman. Was I supposed to divorce her? The Bible condemns that, too (Matthew 19:9). Live a life of celibacy? That certainly wouldn't be fair to my wife.

The Rock that my faith stood on was Biblical inerrancy, that it was the perfectly true Word of God. But to accept myself as a lesbian put my very experience of reality in direct conflict with my understanding of Paul's teachings. I felt like Paul had to be wrong, and when that realization hit, my confidence in the rest of the Bible fell like dominoes.

I had to make a choice: To accept myself and the aspects of my identity that made sense of the weird internal struggle that is dysphoria, or reject all of that and live with the constant mental dissonance of my situation.

I came out this year as transgender to my family. It was a disaster. My parents don't respect it. They use my old name and the wrong pronouns. They're worried about my salvation. But I don't feel as hopeless as I did before, and my emotions and responses to things finally make sense.

You likely need to weigh these things for yourself and decide, just like I did. I wish you all the best, and hope you find happiness whichever way you go.  


Edit: grammar
If God had a problem with changing your body, wouldn't He also have a problem with healing the sick or amputating body parts? What about shaving or styling hair? Surgery in general? 

God has given you this body, and gifted you with free will. If you use that free will to change your body, I'm sure He won't mind. After all, if He did, wouldn't He have made it impossible?
Have you heard of the Eunuchs? They’re a group within scripture who were born male, but, throughout a variety of circumstances, had their genitalia removed. These people were recognized similar to how we recognize non-binary identities today. 

During several scriptures, Eunuchs were accepted by God as they are, without any demand to call themselves men. 

It’s even specifically written in one prophecy “I (God) will give them a new name, better than sons and daughters.”

https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people

The resource above is a really good read to sort out your feelings about the biblical attitude towards gender identity. But here is one thing that remains that I had to endure. 

I call myself a universalist now. Not to say that I believe in and follow any religion, but I believe wisdom can be found in many places, even outside of scripture. And because the Christian church and culture has hurt me the way it has, I have chosen to remove myself from the label of “Christian.”

This is going to take a lot of searching to figure out your personal theology, but my opinion is that God loves you, and will accept you no matter what you do to achieve peace with yourself.
Hey fellow trans Christian! A paraphrased version of something I've seen floating around the internet:

""God made me transgender for the same reason He made the wheat not the bread, and the grape not the wine. He wanted humanity to participate in the act of creation, and the divine alchemy of the self.""

Basically if you believe in the God of love and forgiveness, then God wants you to be the best YOU you can be.
A short, not-so-theological answer from me...don't feel pressure to give up religion just because it feels like a juxtaposition to your life. But neither should you feel pressured to cling onto a religion that isn't working out for you.
I grew up in christianity, and have since left the church for many reasons. But, many people agree that the passages in the bible relating to homosexuality and gender diversity are a modern retcon as it were, mistranslating things.

Here is the thing though. If your god is perfect, and he gave you your soul, then he intended for you to be thus way. To deny yourself this harmless happiness would be to rebel against the god who wants the best for their child.

There are queer inclusive sects of christianity, I have heard good things about certain Lutheran churches

Good luck on your journey, and may you find peace
I'm not a Christian, but an atheist who respects religion where its due. To me being religious should just be living the best way possible. Be happy and fulfilled however that may come to you. Make other people happy. You can go on and on about Hebrew mistranslations, accidental or otherwise. But there's no need to follow the bible word for word. Be a good person and the Lord will see it. The Bible, torah and quran were written before modern science, before modern society and its general constructs and for better or for worse you have to live happy in the world you have. You can be against capitalism but you still have to work to buy things, you can be young and want to settle down, you can be old and still be a thrill seeker. So go out and find what you want, and help your peers where you can. 
The bible is a great book of morals, not opinions
From an athiest
I’m a Christian too. When I found out that I might be trans (not sure yet) I could feel that my God had actually led me here, and He love me just as he did before, and I actually feel like I can now be closer to him because now I am able to talk to Him as who I really am.
Okay. Some disclosure up front so you understand where I’m coming from. I was raised in a religious environment. Trained to be a priest when I was young. At some point though my scientific approach to knowledge destroyed my belief in organized religion, all of them. 

That said, there are a couple important points you need to remember here from a theological perspective. 

One: the book itself has been retranslated by so many people, so many times over the years that it is practically impossible to say what originally was in it with any kind of certainty when it comes to specific words and meanings. This is why it’s practically a cliché to see rabbis arguing over the definition, meaning and context of certain verses in the Old Testament. Bear in mind that’s just the Torah which was written in Hebrew and even for those born to the language there are many questions of this nature. It’s just too long a time and too many copies. That’s not even counting translation to other languages, where you have to deal with ideas and phrases that have no parallel or cultural context.

Two, a frequent criticism of the Bible by atheists is “it’s just a book written by men”. This is readily discounted by believers, however there is a couple points here which still bear looking into. Let’s say you take it on faith that a divine being tapped into the mind of an individual and exposed them to the truth of existence and commanded them to write this down. This very concept requires divine intervention to comprehend. It’s beyond the human rational mind. Thus it has to be couched in metaphor and phrasing that is appropriate to the culture in question for them to grasp it. Bear in mind we’re talking about a culture of uneducated people from thousands of years ago. A lot of it is going to be wholly irrelevant to modern people, due to the change in context alone. This is the logical reason for Jesus’ restatement of the law. Even then these concepts were outdated and the point was to stop wallowing in and arguing about minor details (something the Jewish religious leaders did constantly) and focus on the core principles. This is the fallacy of Christians throwing around out of context Bible verses all the time to justify things. It’s something that goes against specifically what they were told. Breaking, for all intents and purposes, their only remaining commandment. 

Also tied up in this is the fact being written by man, retranslated by man, and the church being run by man means it can and most probably has been twisted to a specific individual’s wants and ends at multiple points. History is written by the victor as we say. The same holds true for religion. So you can’t trust that everything written down or taught by the church is in it’s original form and has its original meaning.

As I said, I am no longer religious. In that realm the only advice I can give you is to listen to your own heart. Your relationship with any divine being that may exist is solely between you and them. Don’t base it on the teachings of man.
No longer Christian, but have taken an amateur interest in theology. Christianity has had so many conflicting dogmas and tenets over the centuries. 


I've become very fond of this quote from Julian Jarboe: ""God blessed me by making me transsexual for the same reason he made wheat but not bread and fruit but not wine: because he wants humanity to share in the act of creation. I am only doing the Good Works here on Earth as intended."" 

I encourage all Christians to read up on Church history. The conclusion I've drawn is that Christianity requires the believer to define what their God expects of them. To my mind, a Baptist believes in a different God than a Catholic or an Orthodox Christian. Why shouldn't your God love you as you were made, and how you will be made tomorrow?
If God exists, he made you this way.
God will love you no matter what you do. If not, change gods.
You could view Christianity in the way that YOU choose. Or you could reevaluate your idea of god...like you can believe in a higher power, but that can mean whatever it means to you.

For example, I left Christianity and then started viewing god as a being who represented my values and beliefs. You know...the voice in your head that tells you what is right or okay. So if being trans/gay/whatever is right for someone...why not choose to believe in a god who doesn't think your life is some kind of abomination?

As of now, I've actually been an atheist for a long time...and other things fill me with hope and meaning. But for many, god is and always will be a big part of their lives. But just remember that all these beliefs are experiences/concepts that popped into the minds of people. Your own interpretation of god is just as valid as any you could find on earth.

So again, either interpret the bible in the way that makes sense to you...or break down the walls of faith and create your own beliefs! I wish you the best, and bless your heart.

Edit: typos
Here’s the thing.

(Full disclosure I tried the Christian thing, now am agnostic)

1. God is said to know everything, down to the number of hairs on your head. Correct?

2. God is said to have created you correct?

3. “You” are mind, body and soul? Yes?

4. You believe that God “calls” people to various tasks? Moses was to lead the people from Egypt. Those who go into the clergy are “called” to it?

5. And you believe that the Divine plan, the plan of how everything in the world will go was created by God? And as the prayer says is “His will?”

So, with all that. 
Who is to say that you’re not placed in this situation for a reason? That your calling is to follow that divine plan and maybe your part in that plan IS being transgender. That part of that plan IS transitioning (or not, I only know what Im feeling) Then honoring God is doing what you’re being called to do, and dishonoring God is disobeying that call. That the real being led astray is being pulled away from that call…Why would it be out of the realm of possibility for you to be made transgender? 

Why would this be the case? (I was always told we don’t question the big guy) but we can speculate. What if your raison d'être is to test those who claim to follow the teachings of Jesus. Not because God needs to know, (we are assuming he knows everything…) but because it puts those who are Christian in name only on public display as being false. 

God has my contact info, everything from animals he can speak through, my cat will do nicely. To a bush he can burn. Or even the classical sending a messenger angel to pass on his direct thoughts… invitation has been there for years to say something. So unless he decides to finally say something. I have to make up my own mind, and so do you. Good luck!
A lot of Christians will try to take things from the Bible out of context to try and prove a point. In regards to your first edit, there's that line that says something along the lines of ""man shall not sleep with little boys"" and a lot of people will try to say it's a no-homo message but most people these days are saying it's a no-pedo message. I bet there's something in there about being truthful to one's self so that might help.

I'm norse pagen but was raised Christian and at my church, the pianist was gay, there was a lesbian couple that sat in the front row, there was even a gay priest for a bit but he was fresh and we were a church of three hundred. Recently there's been a less spiteful vibe and message in the religion so more, love your neighbor as your self and be true. Basically as long as the way you conduct your self and well being doesn't involve going out of your way to piss someone else, God will save you a spot.
There's nothing in the Bible for or against being trans. As for the changing your body argument, ask them if people with birth defects shouldn't get them corrected. Or people whose appendix ruptures shouldn't get them removed. How many of those people have piercings? Is Lasik okay to fix vision problems? Is amputating an infected limb to save a life okay? The changing your body argument is one of the absolute weakest arguments. A similar response could be used for the ""God doesn't make mistakes"" argument. Or go with ""no, he didn't, he gave me this challenge to overcome and transitioning is a way to overcome it.""

Or I could give the better route and explain why religion is BS, but that's not what you asked for. 🤣
I'm transwoman and christian. I had the same fear before transitioning because of my christian belief. But it's not religion that would save you. It will be your faith.
Look. Being Christian doesn't entail being a bigoted hack, ok? Like, one can believe in Jesus and still be progressive and cool as hell. I mean, Jesus himself seems like he was a chill egalitarian guy who cared about people and stuff.

There are many ways in which the bible can be interpreted, and this says a lot about those who choose to adopt the most hateful and oppressive of interpretations.

I really hate how Christianity has been co-opted by bigots and other awful creatures.
I grew up in a Catholic family so know somewhat how you feel, then brother got involved in born again baptists churches which sem like a pyramid scheme to me. I believe in worship and making Tim to do so, but I don't believe in the chore of church and being two different people, one on church and another in the business world. I think live with your values and morals in everyday and every interaction. As for the bible, this is controversial, but to me, being a Christian isn't as hard and contradictory as it should be, If you follow Jesus, you follow Jesus, not the letters written by other people, to me, ""they are more like guidelines than actual rules"" if you stick with Jesus teachings from the four gospels, they all say the same thing, very simple kind loving things. Nothing about shunning homsexuality or anything wrong about being trans. That's my feelings anyway
Oh wow this is rather a conundrum isn't it? So you actually flipped through the Bible looking for answers? Well they aren't there I'm afraid. That book was written way before there were present problems. Trans people simply didn't exist 2 millennia ago. God simply wants you to be a good person. He doesn't really care what color your skin is, male, female, trans, and every other denomination people of the 21st century identify as. Are you a good person? Who actually cares about other people? Then great. That's really all there is to it. Just that. Live your life the way you want to live it. And if that means being trans... then don't let anyone tell you differently.

Wasnt ""man shall not lie with man"" a misstranslation and it actually ment ""man shall not lay with boy"" 
And it called pedophilia a sin? And not homosexuality?
Humans are made in the image a God, including trans people. God made trans people to participate in the act of creation. Trans love is God's love.
Coming from another trans Christian, it is a sin, but not an unforgivable sin. The only unforgivable sin is blasphemy against God, sure it is a sin but God is still a forgiving god and you can still glorify Him. (Sorry if this doesn’t rlly help)
I comw from a cristian family and it wasn't easy to take the step. Pretty much no one supported me at first and it was hard. I do believe that god loves us the way we are. And being happy is the best way to open your heart for him. Thebrules may indicate the opposite, but those are mankond made. God and his love for us is beyond that. It took me a while to understand and get some inner peace.
❤️❤️❤️❤️

Also read Isaiah 56 and Mathew 19 

Interesting note. Being a Eunuch is outside of gender binary in the bible. And is also gets a blessing. 

Being trans is not a sin.  Have sex outside of marriage is. But you can be trans and asexual, married or straight etc. 

Some people try saying the bible is against gay. But the context of new testament authors had for gay relationships were only Roman prostutes and Romans soldiers rape. 

There was no context for marriage , or non Roman. The bible only has one mention of lesbians and condemns it but it has to deal again with temple Prostitutes. 

Is this our context? No.  And even if it is a sin, sins are forgivable (I don't think it is a sin). Do let people mis judge you and damn. Bible warns about giving judgements on others. 

You are loved and cared for and valid.
God is forgiveness.  The only sin thats viewed as ""unforgivable"" as seen by the holy spirit is Blasphemy.  Turning your back and ridicule God is unforgivable.  As long as you live your life with faithfulness, loving yourself, and helping others, you will have a blessed and rich life.  

The book of Job is one of my favorite chapters.
Hey guys telling OP the bible is fiction doesn't help what so ever respect peoples beliefs. But hey op I get it but really your not disrespecting, dishonoring or disappointing god god wants you to be happy I have no idea why they made some people this way but that's what they want for us and it's apart of our journey as people. God doesn't want us to suffer just how they want you to wear glasses to fix your eye sight they want you to transition to make you happy. God loves everyone and that includes you it doesn't matter if your trans it's not a sin you did nothing wrong this is simply a path god wants you on and it must be for a good reason as being trans isn't easy. Trans people offer a perspective on society that no one else can offer so we're not a mistake just another person with purpose who god loves. (Ps I'm not pushing anyone into any religion this is purely for op if this helps anyone else than great)
I'd highly, HIGHLY suggest reading the book ""Finding God"" by Sosino. It has to do with the many Jewish philosophies of what or who god is. And is an easy read. This ranges from Man In Cloud Says The Word to God Is The Energy That Flows Through Us All. Let's you learn who your god is. 

""the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob"" doesn't have to mean it is the same god for all three, but instead that God is how each of them see it themselves. 

So screw having to appease someone to THEIR view of what god is. 

Much love, a Trans Jew   :)
while i am not religious, i know that christians believe that the father, son, and holy ghost forgive all sins. i am 100% sure that there are christians at your church/you know who have tattoos, pierced ears, eat shellfish, get divorced, have sex before marriage, etc. they’re going to heaven, and so are you. your body is a temple, so treat it like such. install stained glass with the colors YOU think are pretty (metaphorically).
I am also a Trans Christian. God created your body, and your mind. Jesus loves you and wants you to live for Him. If you're living every day as a lie hiding your real gender identity then how is that living for Him? He wants you to live in Truth not in a daily lie. It took me a while to accept myself because of my Christian background but I also studied the Bible during college and prayed that God bring understanding to what I read. Only the Holy Spirit can reveal the Truth in the Bible, everyone else has no idea what God may mean in this passage or that passage. Trust in Jesus, know that He knew you before you were born.  And in regards to homosexuality in leviticus, take another look at that story, the true sins are fornication and rape, not being genuinely in love with someone of the same gender.
If you’d like some Discord’s where you can talk about these things with other Christians who will understand, DM me. But long story short you are fearfully and wonderfully made, trans and all. God loves you very much, trans and all. Changing your body to match your brain is not a sin, it’s treatment for mental distress. Do whatever you need to do hun.
Not sure if this would help (as I don’t think he is still Christian) but Daniel Lavery’s book of essays has some great chapters on Bible chapters that can be interpreted as trans stories
Howdy! I’m Christian too! Just wanted to say hi! 

I also have thought it through and believe there’s no reason Catholics shouldn’t support LGBTQIA+ fellows. I think God is okay with you changing your body for you to be comfortable as long as you do it safely and don’t hurt yourself because he doesn’t want any of us to feel pain. There’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to.
So here's my thoughts. God intentionally made you trans and put you at this exact point in time where we have incredible science to help us transition. If he's perfectly loving, he would understand if you transitioned. He knows your pain, and he's given you ways to take care of it. I could see people saying like, ""Oh but your body is a temple."" Like yeah, exactly, and transitioning will make your temple a more welcoming place that more accurately reflects your spirit.

From what I remember, the Bible doesn't say anything about HRT. There's stuff in there about tattoos and cutting your beard and wearing mixed fabrics that no one pays attention to, but the Bible doesn't say anything about transitioning. As much as people want to say that it's definitely a sin, there's just nothing to support it.

Tbh I'm not a Christian anymore, but I remember grappling with stuff like this. It's tough stuff. But you'll sort it out eventually.
you know how it says in the bible that god loves everyone?

yeah I'm pretty sure there's little to no exceptions to that, and being trans and pan isn't one of them.
God is omnipotent and benevolent. That means he can handle anything you throw and him and he'll love you anyway.   
Your #1 priority is looking after yourself as well as possible, God only gave you the pieces of a life and its up to you to make it yours.  
If you're trans, that may well mean transitioning, but that bit is ultimately up to you. Not me, not your friends, not your family, not God. Everyone else is only responsible for their reaction, not your decision.   
That being said, have you tried speaking to God yourself? Not through a church or anyone claiming to speak for God, but have you personally prayed and asked for help? It's not the only thing you can or should do, but for a religious person, balancing your faith with the rest of your life is important.   

I hope you find the answers you need.
❤
A couple of thoughts here.

First of all you are reading an English translation of the Bible, to really understand things, you have to go back to the original language and work from there.

On the key points you need to get hold of a good concordance and see how certain words are used and in what context throughout the bible.  There are many times where a word is translated one way in one verse, yet in every other occurrence translates a totally different way.  This was done by the translator to fit their desired meaning yet used in its correct form totally changes the meaning of the passage.

Now I am out to my wife, I shall be conducting a full length look into the arguments given by christians against trans and other lgbt issues.  I guess it helps that I studied Hebrew and have some understanding of the way Greek works.

Secondly if you are getting grief from church goers, I put it that way rather than say christians, just remind them 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone'.

Thirdly Adam was created male and female in the image of God, the metaphoric rib that God took our of Adam to create Eve, was to remove the female attributes from Adam and bring life to Eve, technically God performed the first sex change.

I say these things not as an anti christian, but as a person who has preached around the world to thousands of people, I was the main worship leader in one of the oldest charismatic churches in the UK. Born to Jewish parents but raised christian from birth, I battled this from a very young age, praying constantly for God to take these evil sinful desires away.  It took me almost 40 years to accept that if God doesn't make mistakes, then he must have made me trans, and another 14 years before I finally allowed myself to break out of my shell.

Just remember that God doesn't care what you look like on the outside, he looks at your heart so don't beat yourself up and be the happy you that God wants you to be.
Honestly you can read if you get bored, lol. It’s def a TL;DR post and I am by no means the religious expert but God’s work is what I want my life to be about and yet it doesn’t change how I feel inside:
 
1. I’m Christian, trans (NB technically) and pan as well. My faith does not challenge my feelings and I have not once felt like God is judging me for this.the Bible stops after the New Testament- it doesn’t keep going so it’s it’s not meant to be exclusively the only source of material in which to connect with God. Otherwise we’d be adding books to it to this day. It’s immensely valuable and is so important but God is bigger than the book.

2. God is a parent, and he wants what is best for his children. Considering the nature of the New Testament’s focus on forgiveness and love everlasting, it seems a stretch to say his love just stops if you do very exact things in a very exact way? I don’t see how he could forsake you at the beginning of creation and yet never give you a chance to love a life where it truly wasn’t a part of you.

3. I personally believe God knows everything that will happen, and yet he gives us free will (let’s face it, we don’t know so everything is a choice still), where he lets you make a decision and yet knows what you will do. If he were as judgmental as he’s made out to be, the even if you never act on anything it doesn’t mean you still don’t feel it- and therefore you’re still guilty, right?

4. Not that it’s about this but people who argue that gender and sex are the same thing usually justify that belief by saying if you don’t have primary sex organs of the “other” gender then you never will be that gender. So, if you “can’t be the other gender”, then how are you truly changing yourself any more than someone who gets plastic surgery, for example? Does God disapprove less of those who get Botox or use steroids or get super fat, or get super skinny, have anti-aging or stem cells or remove cancers, or get plastic surgery for injuries or even just for fun? Using this particular argument in reverse, there’s no grounds for God to be looking at you as dishonoring him for doing something “superficial” to your body. All you’re doing is wanting to act differently around people and look superficially different, right?

I’m just saying, gender identity is a hot button and if tattoos were a bigger deal then everyone would be saying God will send you to Hell for having one. But most people don’t care about that in Western Societies so suddenly God doesn’t care either, you know?
Hello. I’m trans and Roman Catholic. We actually have a subreddit on here. It’s very hard to navigate this path. But I believe that this is indeed a test by God for me to get threw. To see both side of something and come out stronger on the other side. But that’s just how I see it.
God created YOU. And by making you trans, he thus gave you sight into the darkness of humanity. Not within yourself, but within others. So that they may learn to be more human.

Not that I'm religious or anything.
That verse is a mis translation that was done many years later in europe, it was originally referring to catamites but was over simplified to homosexuality as a whole, and if god made you then they made you as a transgender person, it's not disrespectful to them to change your body, it's just a mode of transport to experience earth, people change it all the time cosmetically and medically in alot of different ways, if God gives someone bad eyesight are they not allowed to treat it in fear of God's judgement? No, so same goes to you, you could have been made to be trans for a variety of reasons, it really changes how you experience the world and treat others, people are just being hypocrites and using religion as an excuse for their prejudice

There are several sins listed in the Bible. I never really read if one was worse than the other. Of course there are the Ten Commandments too. I was told by one Evangelist Preacher that most of us cannot do anything bad enough to go to Hell. But here is another thought. Some of these sins were written at a time before modern medicine. That includes psychology. It has just been proven in the last few decades that we are born with gender issues that have nothing in common with our sex organs. So that’s my take.
Jesus supported gender reassignment 

Mathew 19:12
There are definitely trans Christian's.  I am one as well.  I am also a bisexual Christian.  Coming to terms with my identity and my existence in two communities so often opposed has been hard.

One quote that a fellow trans Christian shared with me that helped me a lot (I unfortunately dont remember the original source) is ""God didn't make a mistake when he made me, he just isn't finished yet.""

My view on transitioning and my body is kind of summarized by a story we see in the Gospels.  While I dont have the verses off the top of my head, Jesus encounters a man who has been blind from birth and heals his sight.  God didn't make the man blind by mistake, yet his plan was not for the man to remain blind.
Well we have scripture and doctrine to consider don't we? I think you should examine how doctrine is created from scripture plus culture plus politics. Ask yourself if you believe the bible is always fundamentally literal, if it is allegorical, which context was it written in and how does it apply to a modern context that the authors could not have dreamed of. Why is there so much focus and energy in these doctrines when Jesus didn't think it important enough to even mention, why are these verses taken literally and used to energize massive political and social action today when other inane rules laid down are totally ignored. 

I can't tell you not to be a Christian and I don't antagonize religion but I can say that there is room for us there and that many denominations have built up doctrine that does not allow for our survival. You need to reconcile who god is to you, what you believe god is saying to you and how you personally integrate scripture into your life. If there is a god they surely did not make a mistake in you and they gave you a body to express as your own. You cannot exist in a church that does not believe you have the right to exist as yourself with equality, if you try you will destroy yourself or they will destroy you.
Many of the characters of the bible were lgbt 

Daniel 
David and Jonathan 
Peter and other apostles 

To name but a few 

Possibly jesus himself tbc
I don’t know much about christianity but any god worth worshipping would want you to be happy.
I’m trans and a Christian as well if you want to DM and talk or ask any questions about my journey 😁
A wise man had a similar quote:

“The Bible is a set of rules. They guide us. Shape us as followers, it teaches us to hold kindness and responsibility sacred above all. But how we live by those rules is a true test of a Christian.”
ok I'm new to this and questioning my gender so I've thought about this.

If you ask me God woud'nt hate you for wanting to be who you want you to be. I cant imagine God a being of pure good would hate some one for wanting to be themself and wanting there body to reflect that.

I hope this helps
As far as I understand it, so long as you live in accord with the spirit of Jesus’s teaching and you recognize him as a blood sacrifice for your sin, you’re good to go. Christianity has gone through a bunch of iterations to get to the contemporary version of the religion. I don’t see why it shouldn’t change again to be inclusive of lgbt+ folks
God would want you to love the body he gave you, even if that means changing it.
You don't have to medically transition obviously but if you want to don't let other people's interpretation of their own faith dictate your transition. There's a concept of ""the stained glass closet"" among christian queers where they can technically come out since christians aren't supposed to judge but they still get shamed for acting/living authentically. There's an episode on the Sexing History podcast about this in the Mormon church, but regardless of your denomination it's worth a listen just to hear from other christian queers in a similar situation.
On the homosexuality part — in the story where Jesus cures a man’s servant of this disease (I don’t remember the specifics), showing that helping people who are ‘below you’ or something is good, I’ve heard that the actual original text before it was translated with used a word that could mean a homosexual partner instead of ‘servant’, showing that gay is okay, which was changed in translation. I don’t know about any of this in detail, and I’m sorry if it’s wrong or inaccurate, but a friend who knows a fair amount about stuff like this mentioned it a while ago.
I'm not Christian, but I went to catholic school and enjoy discussing Christian theology. With that in mind:

There are precisely zero anti-trans arguments based on the text of the bible that hold water. The bible has precisely zero to say on the topic of trans-ness. Trying to find any message (either positive or negative) about the bible's stance on transitioning requires digging deep into interpretation and arguing over semantics and translations. If God really thought that transitioning was a horrible sin, don't you think He would have been explicit about it? The fact of the matter is, God made you the way that you are: trans. If he didn't want you to be trans, he would have made you cis.
modifying your body isn't a sin Christians and wear glasses and get corrective eye surgery, so that throws the whole god made you how you are and you should live with it thing away, the way I see it your gods made you like this to test your faith and the faith of others around you, the whole love thy neighbor thing

also that bit at the end about being pan, the no gay bit in the Bible was translated into the king's James version and the original meant don't be a pedo but they miss translated it cause that's what they were into, hope these help
They change their wives bodies, Christian’s don’t care about god. They just want fuck toys. Nowhere in the Bible does it say it’s ok to get a boob job. Yet many Christian’s do. Be true to yourself
Jesus was the great acceptor of difference and marginal groups. It's a tragedy most Christian institutions don't follow his teachings.
There is one thing that resonated with me, but bear in mind I'm an agnostic atheist and can't speak explicitly on religion, which is the following:

God made trans people for the same reason god gave us the ingredients to make bread and didn't just give us bread, so that humans could share in the joy of creation.
Hello sweet girl. I also identfy as Christian.  The Bible is as I believe the word of God. But so many use archaic interpretations to bolster and justify there own hate. God has made us perfectly for his purpose, for the journey he has for us.  We all have a unique journey he has set for us. I believe my journey includes becoming a women, just as it included me having a family.  God loves taking the least likley person for the most extraordinary of journeys. So be who God intended for you to be if that's starting out as male and becoming female do it. God loves you. I love you sister. Remember love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as you love your self. Stay strong, stay Beautiful may you have a lovely and blessed week.
There is so much involved in following Christ - giving without fear, forgiving without resentment, loving all creation - it's really stupid to be distracted by right-wingers who think Jesus can be their excuse for getting rid of trans people.  The Biblical excuses to be anti-trans are really feeble - they depend on the notion of a god of changelessness, whereas the real God has created a vast, rich universe of endless variety and continuous change.  It's blasphemous nonsense to make up a rule requiring everybody to be unchanged and predictable.

Check out Austen Hartke's videos and Transmission Ministry Collective.
In my opinion if god made everyone as intended then they intended for you to be trans and go whichever way you need to. If they didnt then they cant possibly be all powerful.
As a Christian panromantic/Demi-Pansexual trans person (ftm), let me say one simple thing: religion does not equal sexuality or gender identity. You CAN be trans/gay/bi/etc. while still being Christian. Nor does being Christian negate your trans identity, or being trans negate your Christian identity. 

This is something I struggled to come to terms with, and many people were confused about how the 2 could coexist, but there are so many gay Christians. Just because you we trans, it does not make you less Christian, and you are also not ‘dishonouring’ God. Just the same as being Christian does not make you any less trans or invalidate your identity
I'm not sure how to help u w the trans part I mean people dye their hair all the time and cut it and style it to their preference so ur basically fitting your body to ur preferences right? As for  the homosexuality part, it isn't actually true the original line was ""a man may not lie with a child"" but they changed it in the 60's to ""a man may not lie with another man"" because they didn't like gay people hope that helps
So it depends largely on your denomination of course. But my experience is ""Catholic Adjacent"" i got the whole Saints and Miracles stuff but less emphasis on going to hell and guilt tripping. 

I had always been told that everyone is tested in their lives like Job did, though usually not as bad as him. And I have taken being trans as my challenge to overcome. Not to deny who I am but live as I was intended to be with the challenge of having been born the wrong sex. 

If that doesn't help, God did make Eve from a man so like, Eve could be argued as a transwoman if you're loose enough. I'm not but I have a friend who's said that.
Good to know that you feel better, i would say something like ""no one is perfect, and God know your suffering more than everyone"" but i guess they blessed you with tranquility in mind trough all the comments, so... God bless you more and more, also i feel really good about it, knowing that God make me that way, and do know my suffer too, i just try talking to him a lot and appreciate the life that was given to me.
About pleasing God, find one verse, and act with this verse in mind, no one can act straight with all the verses.

Ain't nothin in the Bible about being trans
Actually, the Bible says nothing about homosexuality as we think of it today.   


Concerning being trans, God makes no mistakes so if you think that you are born in the wrong body (easy way to say it), God knows it, It has plans for us even if we don't understand the Paths that It drew for us. God is love and I don't think you will dishonor It by being happy the best that you can
i recommend having a read https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people
i feel the same way as you do, i used to distance myself from christianity and religion in general very heavily because all the examples i had of other christians were mostly negative especially towards people who were somehow different from the norm. i only sort of recently returned to faith and actually started believing in god because i found a group of other younger christians here in the area and they're honestly the best people i ever met, they're extremely supportive and open especially towards queer people (a couple of us are trans and they use our chosen names and some of them are queer themselves) and they showed me that you can absolutely be christian and support lgbt people at the same time. i still occasionally struggle with the thought that there's a lot of people trying to justify their bigotry with faith, i'm not trying to sugarcoat this and say that as soon as you find cool people all your doubts are gone because they won't be, but definitely try to surround yourself with other accepting and open christians, it helps a lot. another thing i tell myself when i'm struggling with these doubts is that god is love, and he loves all his children, so why would he intentionally make some of his children a way he doesn't approve of and make them suffer? it's not like being queer is an active choice, it's simply the way god created us. he wanted us to be like this and this is his plan for us, and surely being happy as our true selves is more important to him than having to pretend to be something or someone you're not, even if that does involve changing your body (using one of your examples)

tldr: surround yourself with accepting christians instead of bigots + god created you as a queer person with that plan for you, he wants you to be happy because he loves you
God only want that you believe in him, helping the others is the best way to glorify god by the way :)
everything you can and can't due is in the torah, so its not too hard to find Jahovah's laws, and I don't remember anthing that states an issue with trans people, and transitioning, but I can't fully tell either...
The Human Rights Commission has a whole section talking about Biblical interpretation and homosexuality, which also includes a link to a video by Austen Hartke talking about Biblical Interpretation and transgender and nonbinary people.

i dont think god would have made you want to be happier and then let you suffer with not being able to do it :)
The thing is, is it not entirely plausible that god *intended* for you to discover yourself?
“Then the Lord said to him, ‘Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?’” — Exodus 4:11
Generally speaking I have to say that the people I see in Christian circles who follow the message of God the best, are those who don't lay too much stress on the letter of the Bible, because they recognise that it is, largely, a work complied entirely by humans and so is bound to contain much that is apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate, and so ultimately you should do what *you* feel your God would want you to do.

Just as an example of this, the implication of homosexuality being a sin in the bible is largely believed to be a mistranslation, and the original message was that pedophilia was a sin. Similarly the take of sodem and Gamora is often taken to mean that sodemy is the sin, but most theologians claim that the moral of that story was that rape is a sin, as was previously stated at other points in the bible.

In the end the real message is just, do what you think to be best for you in the long run, not what other people, who realistically have no idea what God might want you to do, tell you to do.
They don't have to be mutually exclusive. The Torah and Zohar, on which the Bible is based, clearly state that Abraham's child Isaac was female in the womb but was changed by God to be physically male to carry out Abraham's covenant with God. Isaac still had a female soul. The father of Christianity literally had a transgender kid.

Edit: I am not personally Christian but I was raised Southern Baptist and have studied religion extensively.....which pretty much made me an atheist.
What denomination are you, and are you in the U.S., if you don't mind me asking? I've been to two churches in two separate denominations, and they've never given me any issues, and those two denominations aren't the best known for tolerance. There's definitely a decent amount of space out there for trans Christians--at least in the Midwest and Northeast U.S., which are the only areas I can speak to from personal experience.
I've been in your position, and you aren't dishonoring God, having once been in the faith, I'm aware it's often told that God doesn't make mistakes, and I had believed that God made people trans on purpose, as if he has a plan for everything, why would you be trans to begin with? LGBTQIA+ and Christianity can coexist, and they shouldn't be seen as contradictory
In the Bible, most sins are considered roughly equal, so be a good person, don't drink, do no harm unto others, just balance it out with the other sins that most Christians **do** partake in and you'll be just as fine as the rest of them.    👌

And if they do give you shit for it, just call out some of the sins they indulge in that you don't, make it clear you're on the same level playing field as they are.
I was kinda in the same boat. I started my transition as a single adult so I just drifted away from church rather than deal with controversy. 

I definitely have a spiritual side though, so while I was not going to church I took a fun class in meditation, and read about other faiths and ways of being. 

About 5 years later I came back. If you're looking for a church, include the acronym ONA (Open aNd Affirming) churches. They accept the LGBT community. My church is great I really like being apart of it.

Faith wise I don't know or even care that much if there is a God or not. Something in me likes the mystery of faith. On the practical side if someone's beliefs or lack thereof makes them a better person that's trying to treat others the way they want to be treated that's fine with me. 

The theological tenets are interesting to me but I no longer care if yours is different than mine useless a theology is used to hurt and discriminate, which sadly it often is.
I am a Deist/Gnostic Christian. It's a really awkward overlap with the LGBTQIA+, even though I personally hold few if any actual ""religious beliefs"". It can be awkward how hard people are on all religious people, especially anyone within the giant umbrella of ""Christian"". Treating it like a monolith, despite it being one of the most varied belief systems in the world.

That's not even getting into how disconnected and jaded I feel over the religious institution of the church. The same thing they did to left handed people a hundred years ago, and to people with glasses a few hundred years before that, they are doing to gay and trans people now. It's shameful, and makes it hard for to tell people they are wrong when they criticize Christianity as a whole, given how long this has been a problem.
I’m also a Christian and I used to be in a similar situation but after researching the topic I came to the conclusion that God is okay with me being trans as gender dysphoria is a mental condition and as such one cannot be punished for having it.
Honestly the most interesting take on this I have heard comes not from the Bible but from some random quote I saw on a tumbler post, it went something like ""God made people trans for the same reason he made wheat but not bread and grapes but not wine, so that humans could share in the act of creation.""
Yup. Narrow minded strict liturgists will focus on Leviticus, ignoring Jesus. Here in Texas I was excommunicated from an St. Chad's Anglican Church, for being a transgender woman.  Despite the Church of England giving specific instructions to the world wide Anglican communion, to be inclusive of all LGBTQI persons. Three members of the congregation contacted me afterwards to express how they felt  the local bishop was being unchristian. One of the priests, Father Sam the told the bishop that he would still minister to me and my family.  Not all southern churchmen are extremists.
I am nonbinary & bisexual and grew up Christian. I felt a lot of hurt and confusion with my faith while coming to terms with who I am. A few important ideas that helped me: 

- There’s no reason not to assume God made you trans on purpose. In a this day & age, it’s hard being trans. Maybe this challenge and His plan align. After all, the trans community is a beautiful and loving one, and you too as a trans person have the power to make a difference and spread love just by existing. 

And these Bible verses: 

Hebrews 8:13 - “In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.” 

Galatians 3:28 - “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” 

Romans 8:1 - “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” 

Galatians 5:14 - “For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” 

Basically, Love is the one true answer. We may suffer as human beings because of our physical attachment to this world/state of being, but trying your best to spread love is why you’re here at all. It’s okay. You’re doing fine.
If you don't mind, cause this is a question I ask myself currently.

Before you realized you were trans, did you kinda struggle with stuff like like: ""You are now the son who returns to his father's home..."", Being a ""Man of God"" or even a simple just being the real ""you"" because you don't need to hide anything?

Just curious, if that may be a reason or its just my all-present fear of being rejected, so it's good to hear what others think and experience

Edit: Also it says that the two most important commandments, which also belong together are to love God, your neighbor and yourself. This requires realising who you really are and knowing you are accepted and loved by God, so I don't see any problem with being trans in that.
Have you read much from Paul Young? He’s a breathe of fresh air compared to religious dogma you get from most religious leaders
[https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Transgender-Identities-Four-Views/dp/1540960307](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Transgender-Identities-Four-Views/dp/1540960307)

This book's a really interesting discussion between four people with really different theological views on transgender people. I hugely recommend the Justin Sabia-Tanis chapters. I actually scanned and printed out the one in which he references the part in Genesis where God parted the land from the sea - and then points out that He also made estuaries, tide pools and so many other transitional areas that are not quite wholly sea or land and that because it isn't something that isn't directly referenced in Genesis does not mean it isn't a part of creation. 

I'm no longer a christian myself but I still have a huge amount of respect for him. [https://lgbtqreligiousarchives.org/profiles/justin-sabiatanis](https://lgbtqreligiousarchives.org/profiles/justin-sabiatanis)
Just my two cents. I was raised pretty religious, and spent a lot of time at church in my mid teens before I realized I wasn’t straight and got uncomfortable (not to mention the gender crisis a few years later haaa) I no longer identify with Christianity, or religion in general, but I have a good outlook on it having grown up in the South specifically. My personal stand point has always been that God doesn’t make mistakes, right? You’re born the way you’re born, right? Gender dysphoria is just an illness like any other, and sometimes illnesses involve prescriptions and surgeries to get better. No harm in that! 

You’re not dishonoring god by taking hormones and having surgeries to become the person you wanna be. You’re just getting the help you need for an illness that you’ve suffered with. Jesus will still love you at the end, and so will God.
Maybe look into other flavors of Christianity? The Episcopalians are fine with gay ministers for example.
Well it is a morally grey area ( and I am not a theologist) but when it comes to times like this I like to think about ppls intentions, will this change make you MORE capable of honoring God? Remeber through God it is the only way this is POSSIBLE. as an Orthodox our whole thing is living in repentence, even if this is wrong, it is forgivable cause you can still become better. dont beat yourself up over it that is what I was doing just a week ago. And now I am comfortable to say I am trans and am beginning Social transitioning
Im also a trans pan christian! Also, there is nothing wrong about being trans and transitioning. God makes completely no mistakes, so if he let you have the feeling to transition, its all a part of his plan to keeping you happy and well!

stay safe my girl!
If making up for mistakes in your body by changing it isn’t okay, then are glasses taboo? Are contact lenses? lasik surgery?
Hey I'm also a trans Christian. A lot of people tell me that hell is awaiting me cause of my identity though I'm reality when of truly searched God for myself, my true identity as a female also presented itself and I knew it was God's plan for me to be trans and to help other trans people from oppression of bigots who sadly self identify as Christians themselves. I'm here for you and if you wanna chat, don't be afraid. Take good care and God loves you for who you are cause he made you this way
Reply to your first edit. There’s nothing in the bible about homosexuality. It’s a mistranslation that’s actually about pedophillia. Man shalt not lay with boy is the literal translation.
If you don’t sin, Jesus died for nothing 🤷🏻‍♀️
Super late to the party, but the idea that you can dishonor God by being who you want to be is asinine. God knows everything. He knows the future. That means he made yoy knowing this would happen. He made you knowing uou would go on this journey. So, he has to be ok with it cus he’s the one who made your this way, tou know? You are following god’s plan by being you. :)
I’m Catholic/Christian trans man and have a degree in biology and theology, and the Bible really doesn’t say anything that can be applied to the transgender experience. 

People who tend to try to use biblical justifications against trans people are just looking for a way to justify their hatred and discrimination completely unrighteously. Just because the Bible doesn’t mention intersex people for instance doesn’t mean they’re unnatural or cursed by God or anything like that, and Jesus makes that clear in His ministry to people with other bodily differences. Honestly in a modern context, I think Jesus would reach out and heal someone’s body dysphoria in the same way He healed people with other illnesses and disabilities. Christianity and science, especially medicine, can actually exist in harmony, though people on both sides fight each other over it all the time. No way in heck would Jesus oppose medicine and helping trans people, and I’m very convinced that the people who claim to be Christian in our world now and persecute others are the same who would nail Christ to the cross.

When it comes to different sexualities, the Bible only really mentions situations of rape, and arguably older translations of the Bible prior to the 20th century of the word translated as homosexuality really refer to pedophilia and rape, not consensual adult gayness (there’s a good video about it that I’ll have to look up). 

God loves you and God’s love of you isn’t shallow. God wants you to reach your full human potential and learn to love and embrace yourself so that you can love and embrace others too, and if that means medical intervention, so be it, and if not, that’s good too. Everyone who has suffered from depression, anxiety, body dysphoria, and persecution walk the same road Christ did while carrying the cross, and He won’t abandon you, I promise.
I'm not a biblical scholar, and have not read extensively on the subject, but I know there is still quite a bit of debate over the meaning of many of the passages used to condemn the queer community. Lots of talk about what is the best translation and all that. On top of that, a lot of Christian traditions do not take a literal reading of the bible, seeing it as an account of people trying to understand the divine through the lens of their own personal and cultural understanding, rather then as a strictly factual account laid out by God. Personally I think the former is more likely. 

As a student of history I have studied the actual culture of Jewish and Christian peoples. They have exhibited a wide variation of religious and cultural practices from well before the bible was written, up to the present day, to the point where the religion that the earliest Israelites practiced would be unrecognizable today. It was a polytheistic religion for one. Fundamentalism would boil all that down to a single set of beliefs, and that just doesn't work. Not if they want to pull from so many different times and places. There are to many contradictions to make an absolute moral philosophy. Anyone who tells you otherwise is pushing an agenda. Just like all the people who wrote the bible, you have to understand it's teaching through your own experiences and cultural understanding. 

If you want a recommendation for a person who is probably more credentialed in talking about this, the Anglican priest Reverend Ed Trevors has a YouTube channel where he's talked about Christian theology from a progressive perspective. [Here's the video where he specifically touches on LGBT theology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thBLhWiMKso) It isn't his specialty as well, but it's a good primer from someone who actually is a Christian.
Hey friend

Ex-Christian here. 

The Bible tells you to live with Joy. Can you live with joy without transitioning?

The Bible says to love others like you love yourself. I feel, as someone who for much of their life took that to an extreme of neglecting themselves, that you have to love yourself to uphold that standard well. How do you feel you would best love yourself?

I don’t believe there’s anything in the Bible about changing gender, with the exception of mentions of Eunuchs, which were castrated males that were allowed into women’s quarters as servants, essentially being seen as female by the society from my understanding. There are verses about men not wearing women’s clothes, but if you’re a man you probably want to wear men’s clothes, and if you’re a woman you probably want to wear women’s clothes, 

Don’t allow other Christians to tell you what’s in the Bible. Read it yourself, and if given a verse read the surrounding verses, then read some commentaries from a few sources, and listen to God if you hear his voice. Your family doesn’t speak for God, neither does your pastor or any other human. If you believe the Bible, get the info from the Bible. If you have access to  the spirit ask the spirit. Don’t let men who hate people who are different than them turn you away from a life your God built you for.
Well. look at it this way you were born into the wrong body therfore if you transition then your actually houring God because the body you were put in was not the body god wanted for you. hope this helps
Excommunicated Catholic (atheist Buddhist) here.

God made you perfect, in His image. I don't think He would have issues with you being trans, in the fashion of an all-loving God.

God is genderless (or all genders simultaneously, depending on your view), but He uses masculine pronouns. He gets it. Shit's weird sometimes.

Personally most of the pushback I've gotten is from other Christians, and I have questions about what would motivate those who claim to venerate God, who makes no mistakes, whilst also saying that He made a mistake in making you. We aren't to understand the design, as the drop of rain cannot comprehend the river valley. And at the end of the day, you're still espousing the beliefs He gave to us, no matter how you identify.
I recently found this link helpful for myself (relating to the pan bit). 

http://religiousinstitute.org/denom_statements/homosexuality-not-a-sin-not-a-sickness-part-ii-what-the-bible-does-and-does-not-say/

I’m a Christian on a similar journey (I’m Bi my girlfriend is trans). Currently doing research about exactly what you’re questioning: Does the Bible support LGBTQ+? I also hold God and the Bible to very high respects so I get that sometimes you really don’t want to hear “it’s just some book, you do you”. I get it that it can be very irritating when you’re legitimately trying to interpret Scripture and people say it doesn’t matter.

Also, when I say Bible I mean the original Hebrew/Greek, not the recently crafted, LGBTQphobic translations that most people associate with the Bible. 

Anyways, feel free to DM me if you want to talk more and swap resources.
Imo, God sends us exactly as we’re intended to be - even if society disagrees. As another comment or mentioned, why does God send people with ailments and/or allow people to develop them? Is it wrong for them to obtain treatment, if available? *Comparing leprosy to being transgender isn’t apples to apples but hear me out.*  When Jesus was approached by the leper, he didn’t revel in horror - he said “I am willing [to heal]” and cured the leper. Jesus went against society’s treatment of lepers and, IMO, showed that we should extend compassion to everyone - including those that society shuns.

As a pan and trans Christian, I believe that I was sent exactly how God intends me to be. By transitioning, I believe that I will further God’s will by challenging society’s perception of what’s right and wrong. 

Finally, here’s some food for thought. 

Galatians 3:28


There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, **nor is there male and female,** for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Is it a sin to get surgery when you're getting your appendix removed? No! Ofc it's not, nor is it a sin to medically transition. People who say it's a sin are wrong. Its not dishonoring God at all. I'm not Christan myself (I'm agnostic) but ik he says ""love your neighbor"" to be kind to others and not to judge others for their differences.
Being trans has literally been the most eye-opening experience in my life spiritually so I believe your on a good path. It took me years of contemplating the decision from every angle I could imagine and as an agnostic I basically had to consider every spiritual take I could comprehend. One of the many things I eventually came to realize is that there's no perfect version of an objective reality where everything is right and accurate. In terms of rationality, Russell's paradox states that there can not be any set which does not inherently contain paradox, so any logical system will inherently have self-contradiction woven into it somewhere, and beyond this, everything we know rationally is reliant on a tiny degree of faith in the sense that all language is functional on the basis of intuition, or faith - in other words, words are always a sign that points at something real, but they are never the real thing itself. Furthermore, our definitions of things are always based upon conventions and the degree of faith we have in those conventions, but conventions are never permanent, and they're most often more focused on convenience rather than absolute accuracy. Taking all of this into something like sex determination, one can see that it has been a social convenience to have gender and sex be defined by a binary system, but just cause it's convenient doesn't mean its true, its more of a broad generalization, and often as culturally people are waking up to in terms of gender and sexuality, hasty generalizations are often really bad for inclusivity and representation of diverse communities!

Regardless, being yourself is probably the most spiritually in-tune kind of thing a person can do, even if your not 100% sure what that means yet! Feel free to reach out to me if you ever need someone to mull things over with. I'm more akin to the Bhakti Yoga and Zen Buddhism kind of stuff but I believe it's kinda like - Many paths, one mountain. Best Wishes!!! <3  


P.S. I just remembered the bit in Matthews 18:3 “…unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never enter get into the Kingdom of Heaven.”  
the way I see this passage, a little child wouldn't think it's wrong to do things that make them happy, particularly if it doesn't involve hurting anyone or anything! Nor would a little child know to judge based on appearances, nor would they act for sake of expectations, they kinda just do what's in their beautiful little hearts. I think that following that innocence in ones heart is living in the kingdom of heaven just like how in the Gita its said not to be attached to the fruits of ones actions and to take on ones role from a place of inner truth rather than a place of identification with others definitions or expectations of that role. I hope that all makes sense!
Is this where I get to flex my Catholic skills?

I'll take a slightly different approach to this stuff that comes from a deeply Catholic idea: we're going to look at types of sins and what it means to sin as a way to explain that being trans isn't really a big deal in terms of God.

So, broadly there are two types of sins: Mortal Sins and Venial Sins. Mortal sins are sins against God. You are directly disobeying something God instructed you to do and thus, sinning against him. Venial sins are sins against another person. They are things that are bad, but not nearly as bad as a mortal sin.

How do you know what kind of sin something is? That's easy. You commit a mortal sin when you break one of the 10 commandments. Any other sin is venial.

Now how do you get those sins off your soul? Well you need to be forgiven. Venial sins are easy to be forgiven. Whenever you partake of the eucharist, Christ forgives you of all your venial sins. Simply put, attending church is sufficient to be forgiven of any and all venial sins. What about mortal sins though? Well since you've sinned against God, you need God to forgive you directly. Thus, you need to confess your sins to one of God's earthly representatives who will convey God's forgiveness upon you.

Let's get into some specifics now. Let's assume that being trans or gay are sins. That's up for debate and I'm sure others can give you some theology for both sides, but let's assume they're sins for the sake of argument. What kind of sin would they be? I'd argue they'd be venial since neither being trans or gay would violate one of the 10 commandments. The closest argument you could make there would be that you're not honoring your father and mother by changing the body they birthed for you or denying them descendants, but that's a huge stretch already, so I think it's safe to say they'd be venial sins if they were sins at all.

Jesus teaches us that no one is free of sin. John 8:7 says ""Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone."" Sin lives within all of us. There is no way for anyone to live without it. You can do your best, but no one will ever be without it. So, even if you sin, know that Jesus still loves you and all those sins will be forgiven from your soul the moment you take the eucharist.

What I'm getting at is that even if being trans or gay is a sin, it's no big deal to God as a venial sin. Those are wiped away all the time and worrying about trying to avoid being trans because it's a sin is just as little of a deal as trying to avoid wearing garmets made from two different cloths, which is also a sin. 

So unless you're going to go full on with trying to avoid every sin ever, you don't have much to worry about. Christ forgives all sins and loves all sinners. There is nothing to worry about. Whenever someone tries to get on you about being trans or gay or any other sin, I'd ask you to keep that quote from John 8:7 in mind.
Think about it this way, God would want you to be happy, right? Don’t listen to others tell you what’s God’s will, listen to yourself and consider, what better way to honor God than to live as your happy self.
While God did create sexual dimorphism, He didn’t really create gender, humans did. So long as you take good care of your soul, I don’t think He minds what changes you make to your body.
Generally the way I have seen to get around any arguments about body modification is that the injunction in the old testament about not making ""marks in the flesh"" is a bad translation. What was being prohibited was Canaanitish blood magick, i.e. cutting yourself and offering your blood as a sacrifice to Baal, Ashtoreth, Dagon, etc. Tattoos and shit like that have nothing whatsoever to do with those commandments because those weren't practices in the near east at the time of the writing of the old testament so the people writing them couldn't possibly have had any such thing in mind as they were writing, it would be anachronistic to suggest otherwise.

Moreover, while some Xtians argue that Genesis says ""male and female god created them,"" and say that that means there are only two genders and you should stay the way god made you, that's nonsense, because we also know that Adam and Eve were created perfect, but that when they sinned, creation ceased to be perfect. So it is quite possible to suppose that in an Edenic, pre-sin state, 100% of people born had brains and identities that corresponded perfectly with their bodies at birth and continued to do so throughout life. However, post-lapse into sin, all manner of aspects of the world were distorted and changed, so now we have people who are born with all kinds of bodily conditions, mental conditions, etc. So it is totally the case, in that worldview, that someone could be born with an XY-male body but the identity of a woman.

I generally don't like to pursue that latter view because I think it can lead VERY quickly down a slippery slope to viewing being trans as ""sinful"" or a ""mental health condition"" or a ""disease"" and I think that is draconian and crass and evil, personally, but if you're in a system of evangelical xtianity that is hellbent on biblical literalism (and please bear in mind, being biblically literalist almost always means your denomination has cherry picked its favorite (bad) translation of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek into English and is beating the war drum based on that bad translation, so PLEASE consider taking much of it with a grain of salt), it may be that that line of reasoning is the lesser of two evils and will get the clergy and the congregation off your back.

In the final analysis, do what you gotta do to survive, babydoll. I stan trans folx doin' a heckin' struggle and surviving amid the numerous interwoven systems of oppression that try to crush them and, indeed, all of us. Fuck capitalism. I hope you thrive, honey.

Edit: Source: I have a master's degree in divinity, I read Hebrew and Greek, I've translated pretty big chunks of the OT and NT into modern English, I am a former Seventh-day Adventist and biblical literalist, I am gay af, and I've just read the doggone book cover to cover like 5 times and know a heckin' thing or two 'bout it.
God wouldn’t have made you pan and trans if he hadn’t wanted you to be.
I assume you're talking about Deut 22:5?   Back during the Iron Age when these goat herders wrote those stories there was something humans would do.  Invaders would roll into an area and capture it,  and then actually conscript the captives into the invaders army.   Sometimes guys would dress like women to escape becoming military slaves.   When someone goes into the whole man vs woman bullshit from 22:5 it means they don't know a damn thing and barely have the intellectual capacity to parrot what some bigot on the stage keeps yapping about.
Think about it this way; maybe god created you to be trans? And his plan for you is to change your body. That’s how I’ve thought about it, at least.
The Transmission Ministry Collective has a bunch of Christian support groups, videos on their YouTube doing Bible study, a Discord server, and more. It's a great way to meet other trans Christians! (No I am not a paid actor lol) 

https://www.transmissionministry.com/community-programs
If God is all loving as he is made out to be. He would want you to do what is right for your mental health. You honor god by honoring yourself. Transition, anyone who tells you other wise is a bigot and bigotry is a sin (love thy neighbor right?)
God wouldn’t hate you for being who you are. God is supposed to love EVERYONE. I do believe in God, and I’m trans. I believe god purposely made me this way.
Where exactly in the bible does it say changing your body is against god?
There is no true answer to this from a Christian perspective unless you start to take the Bible literally. That's a whole other rabbit hole. Every Christian will have a different opinion, you must find your way to accepting yourself for who you are.

God is love. Love, love of self, and your love and attraction to other people is also God. Do not deny yourself love as long as it is healthy and does not harm others. Transitioning harms nobody, it only helps yourself. 

Not a Christian but grew up as one, wish you the best!
Most Christians don't follow the rules set out in the Bible exactly. There have been serious debates in the past about questions like whether the Mosaic laws apply to Christians or not. Mostly, Christian communities have found their own ways of dealing with these. For example, Roman Catholics obey the call to fast by eating no meat on Friday — only fish. You can see similar effects within related religious communities like the Jewish or Rastafari communities. In each case there's an enormous body of secondary commentary and analysis alongside the core text. In Rastafari this is much less formal, in Judaism it's much more formal. In Islam there is the primary layer, the Koran; the secondary layer, the Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet) and an enormous tertiary layer of commentary, analysis and argument from a thousand years of Muslim scholarship and thought.

But just as few Jews would tell you that you can read the Torah, take every word literally, and easily understand what God wants, so few Christians have thought that the Bible should be understood literally. Any attempt to do this runs into all kinds of problems. The Bible we know has been retranslated several times, it was written in a language that hardly anyone now speaks and then translated back and forth into dead classical languages and Medieval Latin before being translated into English at all. Take a knock-knock joke through five or six layers of Google Translate and see if it still makes sense, and you'll see what I mean.

Additionally, assuming that you take the position that the Bible is the directly revealed word of God, it's still been written down by flawed, fallible human beings. Suppose your mum told you a long list of instructions, then the next day you wrote it all down. You might make a mistake. Your own preferences and prejudices might creep in. If you took it to a friend to ask his opinion, he might make a few changes to suit his own opinions. Imagine several thousand years of that, plus the translation problem...

Historically, we know the Bible was assembled from multiple sources. Some are ancient documents telling the genealogy of the Hebrew royal family, others are creation stories, others yet collections of Do's and Don'ts. The question of homosexuality gets a lot of airplay now, but in fact the Bible only mentions it a couple of times. It spends more time addressing farming practices and hairstyles. There are more injunctions against 'making bald the hair in their head' than against 'lying with a man as it were a woman'; ask Jews how this 'making bald' rule is to be interpreted and you'll get quite a few different answers; the mansions of Rastafari can't agree either; Christian denominations mostly ignore it.

Something that might help would be to read some of the commentators on Christianity. Consider Chesterton and Lewis, though both are obviously quite old-fashioned (in Chesterton's case deliberately) and Lewis was a homophobe. Despite this, their observations and interpretations are fairly accessible jumping-off points for a view of Christian thought that admits of more than one possible interpretation of the Word.

Kierkegaård was a philosopher with interesting views on Christianity and there is a good chance he was gay.

This one is interesting. Watch how the author shifts the goalposts in the section headed 'Recategorizing Same Sex Relations'; after saying that 'the reality of bigotry cannot itself prove that the Bible never forbids homosexuality. We have to look to the text to determine that,' he addresses the argument that 'many argue that homosexuality should be put in the same category as slavery and segregation' — biblical positions now rejected by most Christians.

His authority? 'the 19th century position some people took that the Bible condoned race-based chattel slavery' — note the goal getting narrower — 'was highly controversial and never a consensus. Most Protestants in Canada and Britain (and many in the northern U.S. states) condemned it as being wholly against the Scripture'; 'the Catholic church also came out early against the African slave trade'; 'even before the Supreme Court decisions of the mid-50s, almost no one was promoting the slender and forced biblical justifications for racial superiority and segregation. Even otherwise racist theologians and ministers could not find a basis for white supremacy in the Bible.' All of which I'm sure is true, but aren't we supposed to look at the text?

'Slaves, be obedient to your human masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ' (Ephesians 6:5-8; Kierkegaård's most famous work is called Fear and Trembling). Or Saint Peter: 'Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and equitable but also to those who are perverse.'

In the Old Testament there is a huge body of law, the Deuteronomic Code, dealing with the minutae of how to do slavery right. There may be no scriptural support for white supremacy (hardly surprising; there are not many white Europeans in the Bible, and no-one Nordic enough to please a white supremacist), but the Book of Leviticus (in between condemning shaving, lying with men, wearing clothes made of more than one fibre, and so on — see 'An Abomination unto Nuggan' for Terry Pratchett's almost perfectly accurate satire on this increasingly odd-sounding list) provides scriptural support for racially segregated slavery.

Few modern Christians (I hope) would use these verses as a reason to keep someone chained up in the cellar. Should you use sources from the same book to chain yourself to an identity that isn't yours?

I'm a long way from being an expert on all this — I'm not religious, so there are things about the subject I can't know — so take everything I've said (and linked to) with a big pinch of salt. I hope you find peace.
I'm agnostic, but I take loads from Christian theology into feeling life philosophy and I know Christian traditions and texts well enough (I study organ at a Catholic school too, and sing in East Catholic choirs, I know my way around things), we can chat if you want!
Any English (or in fact non Latin, Hebrew or Biblical Greek) language Bible you're reading was written *it the earliest* in the late 1300s. 1300 years after Christ. Most of the bee testament is relatively untested stuff written by Byzantine priests long after Christ's death, and then attributed to others. If your god exists, and if Jesus was his son, the bible is not the place to look for what he would think about your transition. The only real common through lines that all versions of Christianity have are tenets of community, love thy neighbour, look after one another. Even the concept of sin itself wasn't written in by anyone who was alive during the time of Christ. Your relationship with your god is just that. Yours. If the god you believe in is loving and knows your situation, then it cannot possibly oppose you taking care of yourself and your identity. 

If heaven is something you believe in, your god will not turn you away simply for being honest about your own feelings, self and nature. Doesn't the same book that some would weaponise against trans people also say not to lie? Ultimately, I can't pretend to know what your faith means to you or how your relationship with organised religion is manifested, but not everything everyone ever told you is true about god or his will or what does or doesn't honour him is true. Many of those people will have their own bias and flaws going into reading scripture which colours their interpretation. 

The only way to decide the right thing for you is to look inside yourself, and to (if you feel it necessary) spend some time researching the history of your faith. The approach to transness is very different from denomination to denomination. Just look up Public Universal Friend, the non-binary Quaker (? Could be a different denomination, I forget).
God doesn't care, the Bible in its current state is not true Christianity. Live your life
There is no connection to Christianity and being transgender. There isn’t a specific line in the bible like there is against gay men. Of course, bigots will go to varying lengths to try to justify their bigotry, and make their religious beliefs conform to that.
I'm not Christian. (I'm agnostic) I do know however that the Bible is an unreliable source when it comes to God's teachings. It was written and rewritten throughout the years and poorly translated.

What I know for a fact though is that through out many religions God doesn't make mistakes. God is loving. God is accepting. God only cares if you are good and kind to others as well as yourself.

He made you trans. I don't know why, I have a few theories. (One of them being he's wanted to test the limits of the human brain vs body) Either way he made you this way. Embrace it.

Again though, I am agnostic and this is just my knowledge from research across multiple religions. I hope you find your answers in your faith. ❤️
I’m not Christian or know much about it since I grew up in a Buddhist country, however I hear it’s believed your God doesn’t make mistakes with the creation of people, only some face challenges bigger than others. Your identity facing changes isn’t bad or evil, it’s a challenge God created you with. Embracing yourself is embracing what he made, and that includes whatever your identity may be or who you love in life.
Good point. We cut our hair, lose weight, wear makeup and modify so much more. Organ transplants, knee & joints replacements, installation of pace makers, etc.. This isn't that far off.
strong points, thank you!
This isn't meant as an attack on OPs beliefs, but I don't understand how people can simultaneously believe that god is infinitely loving, while also looking at the horrors of the world. I don't mean humans being horrible to each other, I mean things like birth defects and mental illnesses; things completely outside of our control (and therefore caused by ""god's omniscient plan"").

It always brings me back to the trilemma, which was what pretty much ended my loosely-held faith once and for all:  
* If God is unable to prevent evil, then he is not all-powerful.  
* If God is not willing to prevent evil, then he is not all-good.  
* If God is both willing and able to prevent evil, then why does evil exist?
That actually really helps, although I will say, the Bible is not ""Some Book""
I agree with you.
Christ be like: remember that shit I told you? Yea well be so kind and forget about it will ya?
you have a point, that and love and respect God. can't really argue with that
Even tho I agree with the message, whenever i hear people say this can't not think of how it is biblically wrong due to [Matthew 5:18](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm) which states that no law in the Bible will change until the second coming
Except Jesus didn't say the old testament was outdated bullshit. He did counter some laws but said nothing about others namely slavery.
As a Gnostic, we basically have a simple rule when it comes to The Bible.

*""Is their a disagreement between this and something Jesus said? Then what Jesus said was right and the other person(s) was wrong.""*

I'll back that up bluntly with something like *""Well, are you a Christian or Matthewian?""*

People just going around cherry picking which person they want to be the main character in their head cannon like it's freaking Marvel Comics or something.  🤦‍♀️
The irony of Christians is that they act like non-Christian’s just hate Jesus and disrespect his teachings. I’m not really religious but I still believe Jesus was a total role model for how we should all be - loving and caring for one another regardless of background. We’re all humans at the end of the day. No, we don’t blindly hate Jesus or Christians, in fact, for Jesus, quite the opposite. It’s just they blindly hate trans people for some reason which once again goes completely against Jesus’s teachings.
To answer your question, it is already a subreddit! r/TransChristianity
Thank you! God bless you too, and I hope all is well for you
>No one can tell you how you can and can't be a Christian. The only real qualification is that you believe jesus christ is the savior. You can be trans and Christian and afaik there is nothing in the Bible that says you would need to feel guilt or abstain from transitioning. 

>But as i understand it the important lessons in Christianity have nothing to do with your gender.

You're spot on.

>I'm not a Christian, so I'm sure my advice might not mean much. I'm an atheist agnostic that rifles through religions and philosophy for spare wisdom.

Chances are you've studied Christianity more than most Christians.

As a side note, personally, world mythology/religion is a special interest of mine, so it's always really neat to see others with similar interests.
This actually does help, thank you!
I would like to see those verses if it's not too much trouble
Love it. GOD IS NON-BINARY!
Like I always say, AgenderAroAce God!!!! Praise be!!
I always took it as he made Adam in His image, and then made Eve from Adam
It really does help, thank you! (Although I think you meant to say Deut. 22:5, not 5:22. Two very different passages). I really do appreciate this, it has helped me see a lot more than I previously did, so thank you!
The Bible is not a book that was written by man to control man, it was written by God through man to teach a way of life. To teach that Jesus died for each and every person on this planet. It is in know way trying to force anyone to do anything, only to teach the truth that God wants us to know.
[How can you say that when Deuteronomy 22:5 exists?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2022:5&version=NIV) 

>A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear woman's clothing for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this.

I have no problem with trans Christians, people can believe what they will. But it's disingenuous to claim that Christianity isn't transphobic and homophobic at its core
Are you sure? I mean, the Bible's pretty clear on the fact that there are only two genders, and we were born the way we were for a reason
Thank you for the advice, but I'm going to stay strong in my faith and look for answers where I can find them.
I believe that cycle to be extremely healthy as it's the only way to grow.
wow, that actually made a lot of sense. It really helps too, because I keep hearing ""Jesus was just like us, he went through everything we did,"" but I couldn't really see that until reading this. it actually does help a whole lot and lets me see some stuff that I didn't before, thank you!
Thanks! I'll certainly check it out!
Came here to say this. Though I think it was a purposeful mistranslation.
Thank you! That really does help! And I appreciate your references too!
I disagree, I think that saying stuff like ""I was created in God's image so I am god"" is a very dangerous way of thinking. We are not God, there is only one true God, as was emphasized many times in the Bible.
My mom said something similar. Actually, it was remarkably similar, almost word for word. You may not be religious, but you sure are insightful, thank you for this. I'll definitely take this into account.
I hadn't thought about it that way, but you're right, it is my cross to bear. Thank you, this really has helped
Thank you, I hadn't actually thought about it this way, but it makes a lot of sense, and it really helps. many thanks and God bless you
I was thinking the same thing.
thank you, but if you don't mind, may I ask for sources on that information? It's not that I don't believe you, it's that I would like to read up on it for myself.
You're right, you and so many other people. Thank you for this.
Christianity does make me happy, but it also just leaves me a tad confused
somewhere where people believe that being transgender is a sin
well, the whole point of Jesus's birth is that he was born to a virgin. Genetics didn't have much of a play in the matter, it was all God's work through Mary.
I appreciate your advice, I really do. But I would like to stay strong in my faith and find answers to my questions where I can while still remaining faithful. I'm glad that life got better for you though.
I appreciate your advice, but I will stay strong in my faith. There may not be evidence supporting the existence of any gods, but I will still have faith in my God.
You need to check out Virginia Mollenkott's half-serious suggestion that a virgin-born Jesus must have been created by parthogenesis; thus, XX in chromosomes but male in outward appearance.  An intersex Savior - perfect to be the Savior of all humankind.
I don't know, I pray, but I'm never sure I get an answer, or if I do/did/will, then I either missed it, or it hasn't come yet.
huh, that actually does help, both of those points. Thank you!
Thank you!  You're very kind.

r/Christianity is majority-supportive but there's certainly a hostile minority.  r/OpenChristian, on the other hand, has LGBT-friendliness as a mod-enforced ground  rule.
Oh, wow, interesting. I already knew of some oft these passages, but most of this I never read before, I think its very interesting that the original bible says rape and pedophelis is wrong, and they never say that homosexuality is wrong.

One addition to Lev 18,22: In older translations this clearly says: [You shall not lie with a boy as with your wife; it is an abomination.](https://www.bible.com/de/bible/51/LEV.18.22.DELUT) I think it is clear that ""boy"" refers to children, and ""wife"" refers to partner, because most people who read the bible were straight men. So, actually this verse is also about pedophilia.

Oh, and somebody told me that [1.Sam 18: 1-3](https://www.bible.com/de/bible/2016/1SA.18.NRSV) can be interpreted in a way that homosexuality is OK. From what I know, it is not clear if this chapter is talking about a friendship between Jonathan and David, or a relationship. (""He loved him like his own life"" is a statement, that is usually made about a relationship, not a friendship.)

That's just what I found in the bible right now. I think its interesting that books like the bible for Christianity and other scriptures in other religions always say that you should love your neighbour, but most people don't read that, they only look at things that they can misinterpret as being anti-gay, even tho it isn't. The bible states that judging whether something is a sin is not OK, this is a sin itself. Only god knows what is sin and what is not, and God is forgiving, not punishing.
It's not that it isn't working out for me, it's that I was confused about whether or not it is. Fortunately, I've gotten so many great answers that lead me to the conclusion that it's okay to be trans if you're a Christian.
That's Awesome, I'm so happy for you!
You do have solid points there, aside from the BS part, I'll take those into account
You're right
This really helps, thank you
[removed]
[removed]
Well, specifically gay pedophilia then. Raping young girls is absolutely okay according to the bible
I'm pretty sure you're right on that one, but I'm still unsure on the whole homosexuality front. I hope it was just a mistranslation anyway.
Honestly, can't say i agree that it's a sin. God created us, not like he doesn't know everything about us. We didn't choose to be trans.
Thank you
Thank you so much.
Thank you, I'm protestant, but it's the same idea. This really helps!
That helps, but it probably didn't say anything about HRT, because it hadn't existed yet. It was about 2,000 years beforehand actually.
you're not wrong, but I still don't want to have even the slightest chance of being so sinful for my entire life, that I can't even get into Heaven
""characters"" heh, not to downgrade your comment, but just the idea of people from the Bible being referred to as ""characters"" just gets me. I mean, it makes sense, they are characters, but it still just doesn't sound right to me. 

&#x200B;

anyway, on a separate note, do you have sources or verses to back this up? I would certainly like to see those!
solid point. On a separate, completely unrelated note, how do you and so many others get those little flags under your names?
Thank you! I will certainly keep that in mind!
There's some stuff about crossdressing but Joan for arc did it and is now a legitimate saint by the Catholic Church

Also the body-changing thing is a bit complicated because Jesus said being a eunuch is cool.

They probably frowned upon body mods because there was no way to do them safely. People were probably getting infections and stuff nd thought they were ""curses"". 

Going exclusively by what Jesus is recorded to have said, you'll find there is nothing directly against homosexuality or being trans. I'm a big fan of the red letter approach.
also, you said in an edit that the Bible states things against homosexuallity, which isn't actually true!! where it is in the book was a mistranslation that became popular, the original was against secual deviants, not homosexuals
Thank you, I will be sure to do that!
I think you and eMeL33 nailed it. We do many things that involve changing our bodies that have not gone opposed by the Christian community. We try to make our lives better, and if there is a God, I'd hope that if this is a good God, that they would want to see us be able to help ourselves with the tools that they made available. That, and it's not like the Bible was written in a time with as many tools as we have now to change or modify our physical bodies. I've also never understood why a good God would condemn something that people are born with. A good God would want people to feel comfortable with the mind they were born with, meaning that they should feel comfortable with their gender identity. But that's my take. At the end of the day, I think it's up to you OP to try and figure out what you believe in.
Agreed. God is a deadbeat father.
There's massive amounts of philosophy on this very subject. 

Some of it suggests that one of God's attributes must be dropped so that it would make sense. my favorite one comes from Gnostic theology, which says that there are actually two Gods: the Creator God of the Old Testament and the Loving God of the New Testament.

Essentially, the idea goes that those evils in the world are created by the Old Testament God who uses them as a way to punish those He is displeased with. He is vengeful, petty, and demands absolutely obedience. He is the one who created the universe and Humans and did all the plagues, discriminatory religious laws, and smiting and all that. 

The New Testament God is the all loving, sin forgiving God who sent his son to Earth as Jesus. He cares for people, performs miracles, and generally just provides love for everyone. Consequently, he also cannot undo the acts of another omnipotent being, just as the Old Testament God cannot undo when the New Testament God forgives the sins of those who would be deemed unworthy.

It's a very interesting take on Christianity that I find highly fascinating. Too bad many of the Gnostic texts were considered heretical and were destroyed along with the Gnostics being pursecuted by early Christians.
Eh, I just feel like OP didn't come here to argue about why religion is bullshit, that's why I didn't bring it up.
Well to play devils advocate Christian religions haven't claimed an all powerful god for a long time. Maximally powerful is what they've been on for a while. Add that perhaps there's no way for God to prevent evil??? Perhaps God has their role to play like gods in the comics where they have powers and will to do what they wish but also are stuck in their role.

That's enough steel manning for a morally bankrupt religion on my part though. I've never believed in any god/goddesses but I've always liked studying all mythology.
Check out the video from Vsauce titled ""Do Chairs Exist?"" and also ""The Future of Reasoning"" is p good, I think the chairs one deals with paradox really well but it's super confusing ngl.
God is all powerful but he wants us to be able  to make our own choices and have free will, i used to wonder the same things, the answer is more complicated so ill try my best to explain with the knowlage and stuff i know, whoever reads this, its your choice to believe what you want out of this sence there are many splits and splinters off this religion.

God gave us free will because he wanted us to make choices. Even with this, God gave us a choice ( if Adam and Eve wanted to eat the apple ). God wants diversity in thoughts and aswell with animals that were created, he didn't want to force us to believe in him so he allowed evil to make other religions to divert us from God. God loves us all no matter what we do to this Earth or each other, God isnt a human so he can still love us all while all this pain is going on, you may say ""if all this pain is going on then why doesn't he stop it"" for this, he will and that is when heaven and Earth combine and the war against evil takes place but also God isnt causing the pain, God lets evil do as it will but because evil is also a thing he created, he loves it too. God doesn't ever not love his what he makes but that doesn't mean he can't be disapointed that we did something. If lets say your child broke your favorite cup by not being careful, you wouldn't stop loving ( i hope you wont in this situation ) your child. This is how id explain what you asked but again with all the splinters and splits, it may not align with your beliefs so belive what you want.
its a really big debate, but in short from what ive seen its more of a god doesnt want evil and those stuff to happen,but it does anyway. religion's complicated
It is a book, written by humans, who don’t always have every humans best interest at heart

You can find the same religious meaning in many books. The point was you shouldn’t dictate your life from a book. You can, but you can find justification for anything in a book such as the justification for awful or wonderful things so use it to do what you need to actually love yourself 
(Not insulting any religious beliefs here)
The story of Jesus is literally just a retelling of an ancient African tale. It's fiction.
You don't have to pay attention to the parts that aren't God or Jesus speaking like they're some commandment. The Bible is a series of stories, only parts of it being God or Jesus and what they say you should do.

I mean, didn't Moses strike out and kill someone? Just because that happened in the bible doesn't mean it's okay to kill people. Look at it like that. You have to pick and choose what parts you think are the way you should live and act, because if you take the whole book and every part literally, you're okay with killing. Just because some important figure killed someone for some reason doesn't make it okay to kill people for that reason. Base your morals on what Jesus did, not others.
Amen.   As a trans woman I struggle with where to look for legitimate scholarly analysis of being trans and Christianity.
🙏🥰
Humans: *no*
That's Mathew's problem. That was pretty much the opposite of what Jesus was saying.

Like Jesus went into very specific detail about how bullshit the old testament rules were. He eviscerated the point of most of those laws. So if some guy added ""But it doesn't count"" afterwards it doesn't really hold the same weight.
There is also r/TrueTransChristians and r/transchristians
I've always been curious about religion because i was raised agnostic and wanted to understand how so many people believed so strongly. Psychology and how people think is my special interest and religion and spirituality offer a deep insight.
Keep in mind also that sin is not weighted in the eyes of God, and that all people are sinners and equally damned, as the story goes. A mass murderer and someone who eyes their neighbors spouse in envy are no less an abomination.

Further, the coming of the savior unmakes the contract of all laws that came before, including Torah law. The only text you need concern yourself with is the things Jesus said and the context in which those things are stated. You may completely disregard guilt free the teachings of, say, Leviticus. If wisdom is to be found in that musty tome, it is you who must decide its worth through Jesus' teachings.

Finally, Paul is a fucking power hungry asshole, a rapist, and a murderer, and we do not stan any of his opinions or teachings, particularly the ones saying who may or may not speak and when, and who may lead the church. Fuck Paul. Women belong in positions of authority anywhere men do.

I'm not theistic for personal reasons, but I've studied the Word backwards and forwards. Pray you upon the altar of God for forgiveness, go forth righteous in His cause, and suffer none of His other servants to bear false witness of the Christ's message.

Edit: fucking autocorrect
They shared to me verses about how God loves us all, no matter what, they sent me thing like Rm. 8,37-39 and a discourse of the Pope, I'll send it to you later cause i need to translate it 😅 (It is in Spanish)
Geneticaly speaking male is an altered version of female. Just a little tidbit of information i find interesting.
I think that's a pretty common interpretation. However, the Bible ascribes both motherly and fatherly traits and uses both feminine and masculine analogies in reference to God. The only reason God's referred to as ""Him"" is that there was no gender-neutral personal pronoun in ancient Hebrew and, just like the patriarchal languages of today, ""he"" was considered the default.

So it's more theologically accurate to say that God is genderful or genderfluid.

It's more likely what's meant by the ""His image"" is literally the humanoid form as even angels are described as very otherworldly and animalistic in their true forms (for example, reference the book of Ezekiel.)
Haha good catch! Glad this helped! :)
First I will not tell you what to believe. It is your choice as well as right. While I understand your view. I was that way not long ago. But I will ask this. If the Bible is gods word. Why did he not give it to Peter, Paul,or even John. Just like he did with Moses. With the commandments. The Bible is not something I can believe to be true. It would be easier to accept that god gave man the Bible that is written by him. Instead of the other way random people in the church saying that god told them to write it.
That verse isn't about trans people; it's not even about crossdressing within its original language and context. It was condemning specific people who were disguising themselves in certain uniforms and fraudulently pretending they were religious authority figures.

And even if it was about crossdressing, trans people are the gender they know themselves to be internally. It's not crossdressing for a woman to wear women's clothes.
>But it's disingenuous to claim that Christianity isn't transphobic and homophobic at its core

It's really not. It's modern people who have interpreted it that way according to their own agendas.
Cross dressing was done in Rome a lot, I'm not a Christian myself, but I don't care if someone else is.
okay, fair, but if I identify as a woman and wear woman's clothing, then I'm not being sinful, am I? You also have to take into account that this is in the context of old Israel, these were likely the rules of the time and culture. I don't think it's saying ""God doesn't like cross-dressers,"" I think it's saying something more like ""These are the laws of God's holy people, and if you break those laws, God won't like that."" And in the context of the chapter itself, it's saying that you must be a good child of God. Don't hide as someone you're not, and don't avoid helping people when and where they need it. It's more saying something like ""If you're a man, then you should show that and act as a holy son of God should, not as a holy daughter of God. And if you're a woman, then you should act as a Holy Daughter of God, not a holy Son."" again, there are many different context clues you have to take into account.

&#x200B;

Edit: not to mention Christ himself says that stuff is outdated, so however you take it, you should know that Christ says that the two important things are loving God and loving your neighbor. Even if I misinterpreted that verse, and it really is about cross-dressing, I don't think it's about trans people, and it's outdated. Not to mention that, as I said, you have to think about things in the context of the culture. not in the context of the world as a whole right now.
This in context it is talking about pegan rituals are male and female clothes have changed over time and often flipped back and forth as well as it is different throughout the world. There is also clothes the both wear like jeans what about those
[deleted]
What about intersex? And mabye that reason is to transition and become the persone we were always meant to be like if you were born the gender that you currently identify as you wouldnt be the same persone, maybe you need to be that persone in the right body wich wouldnt jappen ordinaraly.
IDK just a thought.
What we know now isn't going to be in the Bible considering it was written a long-ass time ago, science isn't clear cut like the Bible is.
Yes, it says god created two opposites for everything in tje beginning... but this ignores the fact that *all* of God's creations exist in spectrums, not just humans, not just gender
Ennnnh not really though.
wait you are pan but believe in only 2 genders? how does that work? /gen
OK, so... Is it true what is in the Bible? Well, some people who don't believe in god would say no, it is not true, some people might say that every single word of the bible is true. 

But what does it mean that something is true??

Every story that Jesus told has a meaning. The true meaning is not what he said, but the true meaning is what he meant.
Let's take, for example, the text about the Samaritan who helped that one guy (Lukas 10, 30-37). Jesus told that story and at the end he asked who he meant with 'your neighbour'. So is this a *true* story? Yes! And with this I don't mean that this happened the exact way as Jesus said it, with 'true' I mean that the lesson behind the story is true. In this case, the truth was not that this guy got robbed and the other guy helped him, the truth is that you have to help others to be a good person, a good christian. 
And exactly this is how Jesus wanted this text to be interpreted, I think everyone who has read that will agree.

And in exactly that way, we can interpret every text from the bible, so we know the 'true meaning' of the text. 

Let's apply that to first chapters of the book Genesis.
God created the world with the sea, the sky, all the animals on the ground, in the sea and in the sky. And as the last step of the creation, God created humans: ""God created humankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them"" (Gen 1:27 NET). 
So, what is this text trying to tell us? With the text about the Samaritan, we could've asked who exactly this person was, but this would not give us the actual meaning that was actually meant by Jesus. In the exact same way, asking if this is how the world was created is not the question that leads us to the answer. Like with the other text, we have to find the actual meaning hidden behind the text. 
As you said, the Bible is not just 'some book', it is the book, where the experiences with God are written down. God didn't write that book by hand, it all where humans who wrote it all down. All the experiences with God were written down. And because it were the experiences with God, this was the text that god wanted, our Bible. So, what is this text trying to tell us? What is the message God wants to tell us? 
This text tells us as much about how the earth was created as the Samaritan text tells us about the Samaritan: Not much. This text does not tell us how the humans were created, it tells us why. The humans are the 'image of God'. What does this mean? God created the world and God cares for it. Because we as humans are God's image, God gave us with this all the rights and duties of the earth. So with the freedom to do whatever we want, we also got the duties to keep everything right. So with this the Bible tells us that we as humans have to continue the duties of God: to keep the world in a good state, to protect it as the precious thing it is. We has humans have to make sure that we don't destroy the earth in any way. Only in this way we can be a human, a christian in the way God wants us to be.

So with every text we should look behind the text, what it actually means, not only what the text looks like on the first look. 

Next passage: Book Leviticus 18:22 (DELUT): ""You shall not lie with a boy as with your wife"" What does this mean? 'You' stands for every human. 'Your wife' stands for your partner, because as you know, there are also a lot of straight woman who are married to man, and there is nothing that says that should just apply to only straight men and lesbian women, so this applies to everyone. You shall not sleep with 'a boy' clearly states that we are talking about a child. (I read in the version from 1912 DELUT) It is clear that this text tells us that pedophilia is wrong, if you read the original text, you see that it is not about homosexuality. 

By the way, there is no text in the bible stating that homosexuality is wrong, if someone tells you so, the probably haven't understand that part of the Bible.
There are even gay people in the bible, for example in book 1.Samuel 18:1 ""Jonathan loved David as much as he did his own life."" I don't know David and Jonathan, but it is clear that the bible does not forbid you to love someone of the same gender as you. Even bisexuality is not forbidden by the Bible. The bible says that you should not cheat on your partner, this applies to everyone, no matter if they're straight, gay, bi, pan or anything else.

I don't know where exactly in the Bible it says that, but everyone is created by God. Exactly how God wants them. Everyone is loved by God. Exactly as they are.

You are created by god as well. Exactly as you are. Ad God loves you the way you are. The way God created you. 

A question: If you are sick, will you take medications? God created us how we are, with all our good qualities, but also with our problems. God knows that we get ill sometimes, but he gave us the ability to do medical research and to take medications. God created us how we are, he gave us the ability to take medications if we need to.

God created you and me as well. God knows who you are, girl, God knows weather or not is will be good for you to take HRT. God created you. God gave you the power to do what you need. And if this means you'll take HRT it is because God planned it that way. 
One question: God created you how you are, and taking HRT works. Why would have god created you that way when God didn't want that? 

Oh, one last thing: The Bible says that it's a sin to judge others. So only god knows when something is a sin. Don't let others tell you weather something is a sin or not, only God can decide what is sin and what not. And even if you do something wrong: Our God is forgiving. If you do something wrong, God will forgive. 

So you don't need to fear you're committing a sin by being who you are. God told us to love each other. And God will always love you no matter what. 


Only you and God know exactly who you are. So make the only thing that God wants you to do and be who you are: The beautiful person you're supposed to be.


### God loves you, and you are valid for who you are.
Bear in mind the ""current"" version of the Bible is heavily edited.  King James Bible, for example, was what King James said it should be.  So much is missing.  Also, dont ask all the ding dongs on this reddit, they dont know.  Ask, God. Look within for the answer.
I'm glad it did <3 I sincerely hope you continue your transition and can find those who support you in every way

Ok, well then being transgender is a quick way to go to hell.  Dont mess with god's creations.  Transgender is the work of the devil.   Go see your priest and confess your sins.
It's right thing to do, accept struggle and show other people that we should work together, not against each other

Here’s one, and there’s two sources at the bottom of that article as well you can look into. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus_18

This specific verse is often used to down homosexuality, however there are several sources listed that deal with the language used possibly not being in reference to all mankind but to certain situations. 

I hesitate to believe we always translate things correctly. As we move away from a source language and culture we often lose context and sometimes we even lose definitions a word once carried. 

It is also, according to the bible, not possible for man to say he is infallibly correct, and also not mans place to be the judge of others. So this is always a good thing to have in your pocket.
Well you asked lmao
Thanks for the kind words!❤️
I’m glad that we are helping you find helpful answers though!
Just thought I could explain the views of a large portion of us non-religious trans people, since I think this angle wasn’t taken by a lot of the other comments I read. And I wish you well in your journey of faith! You got this! 🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️
Very far fetched
“But in my distress I cried out to the Lord; yes, I prayed to my God for help. He heard me from his sanctuary; my cry to him reached his ears.”

If you consider that before Christianity was a thing that love between the same gender was fairly common around the world and that there is documented proof of Transgender individuals in as example ancient Egypt with female skeletons found in male sarcophagus and vice versa and even ancient drawings in other parts of the World depicting three different genders male, female and one that was in between and it was considered being closer to god for biological being neither male nor female 

Hope this helps a lil
True true
Epiccc Christian gang :3
Then anyone saying otherwise is extrapolating, and imo extrapolating quite a bit. I really don't think that God would care. Like, you're not harming yourself or others. And the inverse of loving your neighbor as yourself is loving yourself as your neighbor. So transitioning would be done out of care for your own self, which it seems God is into.
well I'm not really experienced with the whole god thing, but I think the requirements are pretty lenient

I don't think you're going to be sinning just for existing
1 Samuel 18:1-4
“Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 2 Saul took him that day, and would not let him go home to his father’s house anymore. 3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 4 And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt.”

1 Samuel 20:17
“ Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.”

1 Samuel 20: 41-42
“As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from a place toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another, and they wept together, but David more so. 42 Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘May the Lord be between you and me

Matthew 19:12
 “For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”


There is a lot of lgbt references in the bible if you know where to look. Hope this helps. 

BTW I believe that the people I  the bible actually existed. I just used the term ""characters"" as a reference.

There is a ton of systematic theology demonstrating that the OT covenant and the NT covenant are identical, that the NT is simply a further manifestation of the extent to which god is willing to go to save his people. I agree though that broadly speaking there seems to be a much more genocidal bent to the OT than the NT. The OT god would have driven the Romans out of Judaea with hornets and bears and plagues and shit so that the Hebrew children could live in the land flowing with fat\* and honey.

&#x200B;

\*I hold to the line of thinking that the word popularly translated milk there is actually the word for fat, suggesting that the land was flowing with oil from olives and honey from wild bees as that seems to be more in keeping with the realities of ancient Canaan. I realize rabbinical tradition says I'm wrong, but I don't really give a hoot: I think the whole book is very silly.
I attended quite a few churches (more than a dozen, of varying denominations) growing up. A core tenet of *literally all* of them was that god was omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent.  
Setting that aside, if god isn't all powerful, what's the point in worshipping them? If god can't control the evil in the world, what's the point in praying to them?
If god was all powerful he could have created a world where people both have free will and don't have to suffer.  
If god is all loving they wouldn't allow those they love to suffer.
It is not a book written by humans, it is a book written by God *through* humans. There's a difference. You raise some valid points, but I really would like to do my best through God while still being myself. God comes first, he always does, I just want to know if there's a way that he can come first while I'm still being myself.
I learned something today
There's proof that he was a real historical figure, regardless of what you think about him as a person.

Savior stories exist in a lot of cultures, but correlation does not imply causation.

Still waiting on that source
It's not fiction if they're real people...  exaggerated stories, maybe, but not fiction 💔
thanks. this is also helpful to me. I'm questioning my gender right now and this really helps.
Thing is that according to the Bible Jesus said that thing           
          
Furthermore I am not aware of any passage in which Jesus is denouncing any old law, the idea of respecting it going so strong that it birthed two of the most emblematic moments in the new testament (plus one problematic trend) : [Mark 12:17](https://biblehub.com/mark/12-17.htm) in which Jesus avoids disrespect either old law or the romans by clever wording as tribute went against old law, [Matthew 21:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021%3A12-13%2CMark%2011%3A15-18&version=NIV) where Jesus turns the tables of the people that broke the old testament laws (goes to show how respected were those laws even then) by making the temple 'a den of robbers', and lastly passages like [1 Peter 2:18-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A18-20&version=ESV) in which slavery is condoned in virtue of old testament law
much appreciated!
Fair enough
Me too! and again, thank you quite a bit!
I'm not trying to persuade you to stop being religious. [But Saint Paul was clearly and openly homophobic in 70 AD.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1&version=NIV) in Roman's 1:24-27. That's not that modern. Christianity has a long history of homophobia and transphobia, it's revisionist to pretend otherwise.

Edited: typo
Yeah and Saint Paul was having none of that shit. I also don't have a problem if any individual is Christian, but I do believe that the system of belief itself is bigoted and humanity should move away from it or radically alter it so it's complicated
That was before Christianity became the official state religion. Life got a lot worse in Rome after it was officially adopted.
>I'm not a Christian myself, but I don't care if someone else is.

Thanks ☺️ I appreciate that.

>Cross dressing was done in Rome a lot

I'm not sure whether or not this is true, but I will note that the temporal context of Deuteronomy is centuries before the Roman Empire.
I'm not trying to convince you one way or the other. But if you need a thousand caveats for why the passage isn't actually transphobic...then maybe it's just transphobic? 

But there are undoubtedly loving and accepting Christian churches towards LGBT people. I encourage you to reach out to them
I dont like the ""rules of time and culture"" argument.
If its an old book from an old time then why give a fuck abt it today?
And if it is meant to be an eternal guide on how to live then why are some things in it absolutely immoral by modern standard or in general kinda fucked up?

You cant have the cake and eat it too.
You cant say these are old israel rules and consider them important in modern times too.

But whatever, have fun, let your religion enrich you and never beat you down because you are valuable
You have a point
Really? huh, guess I was wrong. I'll have to do my own research of course, but if that's true, that makes things all the better!
Well I don't/didn't, but I did genuinely believe the Bible was clear on that. I was also a bit tired at the time of writing that. tbh, I don't even know where I got that information, sorry!
Wow, that really lifted my spirits. I'll have to check out the 1912 DELUT Bible too, sounds more accurate than the NIV, that's for sure.
Wow, those links were certainly eye-opening. I'm so glad you sent me those, it really makes all the difference. I'll have to do my own research of course, but you've literally just set it in motion, I had never even realized that, but wow. It's so helpful to know that.

I think - even if it is a sin - trans people have a reasonable argument to ignorance. The church and the world is divided on it. The Bible is unclear. It's really a matter of following the heart. 

Even if there was punishment associated with it, I dont think trans people have enough understanding to be held accountable. A grave sin requires full understanding of the sin/gravity  

All trans people have to go on is 22:5. 

Thoughts?
You did not, and I did not have a flag until you told me how, much appreciated!
Oh you're absolutely right. There's a reason why the Gnostic texts were heretical. They break the fundamental monotheism of Christianity and disregard other theology stating that the Old Testament God and New Testament God are the same God. 

I just think it's a really interesting perspective and one that does satisfy the fundamental philosophical question the person I was responding to was wondering about.
That's the experience *you* had but that's not generally what churches preach now nor have they for some time. Of course it doesn't apply to all of them but that's what's mainstream. This is because of logical conundrums like can God make a rock so heavy he can't lift it. 

Your question of why worship a God that isn't all powerful makes no logical sense either. Plenty of gods have been worshipped throughout human history that weren't all powerful. They were powerful enough to grant those followers what they needed or wanted.... at least that's what those people believed. Same with the prayers.

I know those questions sound like a gotcha but they really aren't. I don't care to steelman religion anymore so I'm done with this for now.
Just be careful about where you’re putting your faith: God, the people who write the Bible, or the pastors interpreting it.

One thing that’s been eye opening to me is a realization about Isaiah 40:8 and pastors’ interpretation of it.

I’ve always heard pastors say that God’s Word stands forever; they were referring to the Bible as God’s Word, and using Isaiah‬ ‭40:8‬ to make this claim:

“The grass withers and the flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever.””
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭40:8‬ ‭NLT‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/116/isa.40.8.NLT

But if you read that verse in context, it’s not talking about the Bible; as in the written words that were eventually collected in a book. The verse is talking about the actual “word” of God; as in what He has said and what He has promised. It’s His promises that will last forever. Not the Bible.

So if pastors can misuse a verse as simple as this one, what else are they misusing or misinterpreting?
Please be patient and read this, keep in mind I’m not saying to not have faith or throw away the Bible, but to keep some perspective on the Bible.

A reminder that the Catholic Church was transformed from many autonomous, independent congregations into a centralized Catholic Church by Emperor Constantine and other Roman Emperors (looking to consolidate the churchs’ power for their own political aims during the decline of the Roman Empire).  They were able to because bishops were feuding over theological philosophy and came to the Roman Emporer so that he would declare their dissenters’ ideas illegal.  Resulting in the dissenting Christians losing their jobs and property, and either killed or sold into slavery.

The Bible is a collection of books that were selected and approved by this centralized Catholic Church in the 6th century (over 500 years after Christs death).  The New Testament books were each written decades or centuries after Christ’s death.  None of the authors met Jesus in the flesh.

English language translations are written well over a thousand years later.

At each of these steps, humans were making decisions on how to wrap up their beliefs in the Bible.  Historians know that these major political figures had their own agendas and their decisions that had great influence over the church, the dogma, and the Bible. The decisions they made for the Church were often very in-line with their external political agendas.  So while we faith isn’t necessarily bad, keep in mind that the Inspiration of the Bible is no way purely Devine.  Books that were inconsistent with the political aims of the day were discarded.  Christian’s with slightly different yet fair and valid interpretations of the gospel were murdered by Christian’s and Pagan’s alike.
Responsible, credible Biblical scholars all acknowledge that the Bible was written by humans. It contains human ideas and each book of the Bible is from a very specific historical context. Evidently someone in your religious education has told you that the Bible was written by your god (or written by your god through humans) but this simply is not the case. If you choose to believe the Bible was written by your god through human hands, then you need to ask yourself why it is so inconsistent and morally repugnant.
Also it’s important to realize by saying “ it’s a book written by gods through humans” is a dogmatic statement that discounts other people beliefs many trans people don’t believe in god and many do, honestly you fulfilling your trans self is separate from a religious belief system and should be just considered your medical health ❤️
Then why let humans decide what is and isn’t sin?
It is certainly edited by people though. Since the stories weren't written down immediately after the they took place, not all of the 'books' made it into the final bible, and you're reading someone else's subjective translation based on 2000 years of people trying to figure out what the book says. The biggest thing though is that people dissagree on what it says so you should always take interpretations with a grain of salt. 

Also Jesus was in some mlm relationships as best as we can tell so I wouldn't worry about being pan. Gay Jesus ftw!

I'm an atheist but like honestly history is way more LGBT+ accepting then you would expect. Even early christianity and a lot of modern Christians too. Nature too is full of queer animals: humans, other apes, lions, bugs, birds, walruses, fish, etc.

If there are loving god(s) then surely they would want you to be happy first and foremost. Especially when you're not hurting anyone else. 

Ps, whether you are trans or cis is determined before you are born so by all reasonable definitions you were 'meant' to be trans in so far as much as a rock is meant to fall or an piano is meant to be played.
Girl if you actually believe that then I have an amazing crypto investment for you to check out
That book has been written by people, translated by people and edited by people just to fit their narative. If people can change entire verses from the Bible to fit their narative then it no longer is written by divinity. It no longer is the word of your god. It makes no difference. There are countless examples of changes in the Bible that occurred either because of translation, or because of bigotry. That book is not any holier than the lord of the rings is. And besides that, there's thousands of examples of direct contradictions within the bible. If your god really exists, he'd be ashamed of the way people have twisted the bible and his message. Trust me, god would rather you be happy and follow your heart than believe the lies some people have written and are justifying through his name.
It's written by men claiming they've been inspired by a god and heavily changed over the course of thousands of years. People made changes to make it say what they want. The Bible is not a proof of Yahweh nor is Yahweh a testament to the validity of the Bible. It's a logical fallacy. The entire religion is entirely based on faith, which is fine, believe what you want to believe, but faith does not make an argument in the fields of logic.
Well, i dont want to be mean or rude and i do get your point ( or atleast i think so ) but humans left out many books and stories which would be considered as written by God trough humans. Also, how humans interperate the world around us is varried from person to person, youd say that dandalions are yellow and id say white becuase i cant see yellow very well. So with god writing the bible through humans, the person still needs to process the information that God has given and then they need to find how to interprate and then put it on paper. This would give it a human element to it do it wont be like a quote. Also, with all the switches from one language to another could  not have the exact same meaning. Some bibles highlight exact quotes from Jesus which I do reccomend though.
You are and will continue to get some, ""Religion is dumb anyway, toss the Bible and ditch your faith"" advice. Not an easy thing to do for many of us whose faith is engrained in who we are. To me, the problem isn't God so much at it is modern Evangelicalism and the way it has been used to marginalize and exploit some and empower and enrich others. 

I highly recommend the book ""Unclobbered"" by Colby Martin. Like the author, I came from a traditional Evangelical (i.e., homophobic) background and struggled to wrap my brain around what I was told the Bible says and how it conflicted with what it shows to be the nature of God as demonstrated through Jesus.

He does a great job breaking down every verse that is traditionally used against the LGBTQ+ community, putting them in linguistic and cultural context and showing how they have been misused.

You don't have to choose between being true to God and being your true self. That is a false dichotomy created by man. You are an amazing human being, created by God and loved by God just as you are.

I would recommend finding a progressive faith community that supports YOU.
I agree, people can be insensitive about our religion just because it's in a book

That's said, keep in mind that the book was written on behalf of God by fallible humans

God's words are perfect and flawless, but that does not mean we properly interpret them. In our failure, there's likely a lot we got wrong. 

Every translation is an example; where some sins are harsher than others depending on the translation. I mean, some speculate being gay isn't a sin because the actual Hebrew translation may have referred to somthing else.

I dont think the Bible is 100% reliable, because humans are not reliable. It's like a game of telephone. God knows what he said, but by the time we get to the king james version, things are probably not 100% accurate
Just because a guy named Jesus existed doesn't mean he had magical powers and was born to a 13 year old virgin. If any of that is true, his mother was raped and they didn't want anyone to know.
Historical Jesus was just a man who got killed who heresy and temple violence. The fact that he existed doesn't mean the miracles and theology are true. The person you're replying to understands this.

Regular people being deified and claiming to be messiahs and having virgin births was a regular thing in Jesus's time.  The historical argument actually hurts Christianity, it doesn't help it. It just show us that this radical rabbi lived and died like a normal man and competed with many others for the title of messiah.
There is zero archeological evidence that Jesus existed, much like 99.9% of all peasants of the time. All other mentions of him in records not included in the bible as documentary evidence are generally not first-hand accounts . . . So not sure 'irrefutable' is the word you want to use.
Except there isn't proof he was a historical figure. Aside from stories written after his supporters see life there's not one contemporary source that validates his existence in reality.

Now if you want to say there's evidence then I'd agree but nothing better than circumstantial. There's not one Roman census that had him counted despite how meticulous they were because taxes. Of course that in and of itself doesn't mean he wasn't a real flesh and blood itinerant rabbi gong around preaching.
Dude, I don't remember where I read it, but if you insist, why don't you give me a source to prove me wrong?
Even if they existed, it would still be fictional story. Fanfiction, if you will
Scribes and Pharisees: So about our extensive dietary laws that are supposed to keep us pure of spirit. 

Jesus: Bullshit. Eating stuff doesn't corrupt your spirit, your actions do.
>I'm not trying to persuade you to stop being religious.

Nah, I get you. I just wanted to clarify that Christianity is not incompatible with LGBT identities. While the verses you're referring to are commonly modernly interpreted as homophobic, that's a misinterpretation leading back to an American religious group with a particular anti-gay political agenda in the mid 20th century.

For example, did you know that there isn't a single instance of the word ""homosexual"" in the original text of the entire Bible?

More specifically, if you look at the original Greek that's translated in the version you linked to as women ""exchang[ing] natural sexual relations for unnatural relations"" with other women, the more accurate translation is that Christian women were using the services of female oracles, who were common around the church he was writing to, especially priestesses of Apollo.
A lot of it doesn't hold up to modernity, I'm not gonna say anyone's belief is wrong, but I'm also not gonna say it's right.
The Roman empire had this holiday called Saturnalia, cross dressing was a part of it.
it's not that I need a thousand caveats, it's that there are many different possibilities. I am certainly open to the possibility that maybe it is transphobic, but I am also open to the possibility that it could mean quite a few different things based on context, especially since the Bible is known for being a fan of metaphors.
Your positivity is really cute ☺️

The main thing that's really changed the way I read and interpret the Bible is remembering that it was first created with God's chosen people (Jews) as the foremost audience. Idk what your cultural background is, but gentiles are at a natural disadvantage that way, which isn't even considering the additional factors of time and language.

I'm lucky enough to have a cultural anthropologist as a good friend and to have taken some basic theology classes that presented a wide variety of interpretations rather than just one way of thinking. I highly recommend collecting as diverse viewpoints as possible from qualified sources to give yourself a bigger picture of things.

that's a valid point, actually. I guess I shouldn't, so maybe, starting from now on, I won't. I'll do my own research into the Bible instead of relying on what others say.
I would like to see your sources for gay Jesus if it's not too much trouble.
Are you holding Jesús Cryptos???

...

Yes, I'm proud of that.
you have a point
>The fact that he existed doesn't mean the miracles and theology are true

Woah there. Did I claim any of that? No, just that he was a real person who existed.

>Regular people being deified and claiming to be messiahs and having virgin births was a regular thing in Jesus's time.

Exactly. Not even just during his time but also long before him. That's why I said, ""savior stories exist in a lot of cultures,"" but yeah, it's worth noting that they also existed in his contemporary culture too.

Why all the hostility?
>There is zero archeological evidence that Jesus existed, much like 99.9% of all peasants of the time.

Correct in terms of the lack of evidence of a corpse. Anybody who's claimed to have found his body is definitely lying.

>All other mentions of him in records not included in the bible as documentary evidence are generally not first-hand accounts . . .

There does exist a first-hand account of him within the writings of Pontius Pilate.

>So not sure 'irrefutable' is the word you want to use.

You're right though, even first-hand accounts aren't irrefutable, so I'll make that correction.
I never said you're wrong??? I just asked for a source
Whj taught you history, all of you that are discriminating against my Christian faith right now are being really offensive.   You're no better than the typical evangelical extremists.  If you aren't a follower of christ then stay off the subject! 😭 it is absolutely NOT worth deterring other people's faith to satisfy your own ego
Are you referring to [Mark 2:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Mark%202:19) where Jesus acts like an unsufferable person? If so, afaik that fasting was not law, but rather traditions of specific tribes             
           
Or are you taking of [Mark 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%207&version=NIV) in which Jesus does not go against law, but he's describing the way the law was intended to work and how it (the law) was corrupted by pharisees into traditions that are only for show          
             
Either way tho, these examples are not (as far as I know) moments in which Jesus goes against the law, rather he is seting the record straight about how people misinterpret the law             
           
Which is also a problem with how conservatives reference old law against homosexuality and being Trans as the original law does not reference either in a bad way, conservatives misinterpret a law that was actually against pedophilia trough a Greek tradition to mean that homosexuality is an ""abomination""       
Edit: typos, lots of them :(
Ah, yeah, Saturnalia is pretty wild. That's a good example. I should have thought of that.
Thank you for your logic and reason.

The biggest one's involve phrases such as, ""washing someone's feet,"" which at times has been a euphemism. 

But also, if Jesus was tempted by all sin, then it's more than likely some of the people tempting him would have been men (especially if homosexuality was a sin).
I got one about trans Jesus..

Mary, being a virgin, had only her DNA to contribute to the baby.. which essentially makes Jesus a clone with XX chromosomes. However, knowing how women were treated as property in that period, Mary knew her child would never be seen as a holy emissary.. thus was raised as a boy!
Christianity condones pedophilia and discrimination
Which it isn't a sin! Hooray! 😀

An apology to the lgbt: I am sorry for the time I spent mislead by terfs and transmedicalists	"When I first came out as a lesbian, I was looking for community and was new to discourse on Instagram. I wanted to understand the Trans community better (for SOME reason 🤔🤔🤔) so I ended up watching Blaire White, Kalvin Garrah, Arielle Scarcella etc. as someone raised in a conservative part of the state of Florida and brainwashed by Catholicism, their demographics appealed to me. They touted themselves as being more mature and as a young adult, I wanted to prove my analytical thinking.

Instagram knew me as kaleidoscopeofrainbows and I managed to become disliked by every corner of the community. I was obsessed with trans issues but I Was quick to remind people that I was a lesbian and NOT a trans person. I’m aware of my identity and insecurities now but nothing I can say or do will take back the harm I personally caused lgbt youth. 

I wish I could say that this happened a very long time ago and doesn’t have much baring on my life. In January, I was canceled by the slime community (yes, the stuff made with borax and glue) because I intentionally interacted with a terf out of curiosity and as a then-non-binary person, I thought I could reach a mutual understanding with them. I did not realize how destructive simply interacting with them was. It instilled a new trauma for how people view my trans identity. I knew I should have ceased interacting with them but I continued because I thought I had control of the situation.

Now, as a trans man, I struggle with so much insecurity because I know how transphobes view me because I was one of them. I feel fake, the imposter syndrome is real. 

The community has every reason to distrust me. I did some really terrible things in the past. All I can do is reassure you all that with every mistake I have certainly learned. I’m actively trying to love and accept all identities now, even the ones I don’t understand. I’m trying to protect trans women and asexuals instead excluding, denying, or speaking over them. 

It kills me to think I may have hindered or prevented others from transitioning by spreading misinformation to make it seem like there isn’t help or that the life saving help that exists is dangerous. But what’s done is done and I can’t go back. I know I don’t deserve the open support I have received. I’m indebted to this community. You’re keeping me alive and honest. 

I’m a proud trans man in a relationship with a beautiful trans woman and I couldn’t be happier. I hope that all the people I caused harm too are able to find as much happiness. I regret my actions and I don’t deserve forgiveness nor do I expect to receive any.

All I have is this open apology. I truly am sorry"	"TERFs/gender criticals are a literal cult. You don't need to apologise for being sucked into one. Just learn from that time, and do better
One terf less, one great trans dude more. Win-win if you ask me.
I mean hey, you did some not great shit, but you're learning and actively trying to improve. That's a lot more than some people, and that's good. Proud of you friend.
Terfism is so common (especially in lesbian oriented spaces it seems online- they also seems to hate gay men too??) and it’s caused a lot of damage for me. I feel unsafe and unwelcomed to participate in most of the community and as such stay in trans spaces. Hope things end up okay for you.
I like people who can admit they had been wrong. Welcome home.
You have done nothing that many of us haven’t also done at some point due to simple ignorance. I was indoctrinated ever since I was born to believe exactly the way conservative Christian parents believe. It’s not fair that the world has done these things to us and that heteronormative behavior is forced on us in so many ways. 

I’m just happy you found out who you truly are. 😊 do you!
Can't wait for JKR to write the same apology like you.
Zuko moment, welcome to the Gaang
Glad to hear things are looking up for you, but I genuinely don't think you even have much to apologise for here.

TERF communities are often very on the ball when it comes to subjects like sexism/homophobia/etc. and so it's not surprising someone could get drawn in in other ways too. It's not like Conservative straight men where they're bigoted in every possible way and it's super obvious. 

And there's such an excess of misinformation about every trans issue it honestly isn't always easy to distinguish truth from lies.
I think you will come to see that this is what a lot of us have gone through to one form or another.

I'm glad you know better now tho!
It's a I've always said. 

The important thing isn't what's in the past. It's how you plan to make things right. It's who you are today.

You may have done/said some things but you're doing the best you can now, and that's what counts. I'm generally a pretty forgiving person. To a fault sometimes. But I genuinely think that the world could do with more forgiveness and understanding.

It's important to acknowledge your faults but it's also important to acknowledge where you've done good. How you've changed. And how you are now. 

""Yesterday is history, tomorrow a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.""

And what you do with that gift is what defines who you are.

\*hugs*
I literally have had the same exact experiences as you. I was a terf for years, unfortunately. I had a pretty popular tumblr blog and tried to make a podcast around these issues. It wasn’t very popular and I only got maybe like 50 listens but I still feel awful that I did it. When I met some trans friends online last year in January 2021….things started to click for me. I felt awful about the person I had been and began to change. I had already been disillusioned with the radfem community since a lot of them were pushing aside the importance of abortion rights to focus on being gender critical. I completely stopped believing in terf rhetoric and when I met my trans guy friends in person— I realized just how similar we were. I really believe I was trying to push down and desire to transition. I look back at my childhood and definitely see the signs that something was different. When I realized I may be trans I was so, so scared. It made me understand why I had so much hate in my heart. I also had a lot of abuse happen to me because of cis men and that influenced me as well. If you ever need to chat about this, feel free to DM. I have always been in therapy but recently began therapy with a social worker who is actually a trans man and he helped me work through my guilt and understand my identity. I still feel guilty from time to time but that goes away eventually. But anyway, I’m here for you man. I feel your pain.
Be sure to keep learning from that. Apply these concepts to other marginalizations as well. Transphobia doesn't exist in a vaccum. 

I am very happy to have another person on our side 💖.
Hi, thanks for your honesty. I hope you’re in a happy and healthy place now.  

I think it’s far too easy for anyone to fall into some kind of unhealthy social media rabbit hole - I myself watched far too many “YouTube sceptic” videos back in the days when the news algorithm started recommending all kinds of nonsense, but luckily the likes of hbomberguy and Sean pulled me out again. On one hand, I see this as a useful experience in understanding what is being said across the spectrum, but also how easy it can be to encounter and be affected by these ideas. 

So don’t feel too bad about your past, be proud you’ve moved on and use this experience to frame how you deal with others. 

That being said, there’s a hell of a lot of problems with infighting in “leftist” spaces. It feels so childish. I was trying to understand this whole vaush and contrapoints kurfuffle and unless I’m misunderstanding it, it feels so high school. “Cancelling” people for just communicating with someone is toxic as hell and helps no one. How else are we supposed to break people out of negative mindsets if we’re not supposed to talk to them? It also makes us look like children.
I really did something I regret a lot now too. Before I knew I was trans I had a gf and I loved her so much but after a couple months I couldn't do it anymore so I told her that I thought I was gay (which I believed at that point cause of all the drama in school where doing/wearing anything remotely feminine as a guy was considered gay. We remained friends at first but it hurt me more than I could've ever imagined. I told her some really terrible things, just so I could get back to repressing my feelings and emotions entirely (which did work). Now I think about how bad it must have been for her, for the only person she really seemed to love at that point to tell her that she's annoying and I wanna hurt myself everytime I see a text from her or hear her voice... I still want to apologize to her but I worry that it might bring up what happened in the past, because she told me once that I was one of the few ppl who could take her away from the horrid reality that was her parents, school, etc. What I think I wanna say is we all have done bad things and most of us regret them and I would never ask her for forgiveness but I know kf she had done the same to me and told me what she was going through atm I would forgive her in an instant. Just writing this makes me tear up.
There is nothing to apologize for, you were isolated and needed a community. It's terrible, but a lot of hate starts this way. I'm proud of you for seeing the error of your ways. Being transphobic in the past doesn't make you any less trans, too many of us go through periods of self loathing and often act in ways we regret. Don't focus on the people you have hurt in the past, look to the future and all the trans people you will be able to help. Remember that when you were being transphobic, you were making a you problem a them problem, so when faced with transphobia in the future, know that they too are turning their problems into your problems and that whatever they say is just hateful bullshit. And welcome to community, were are happy to have you here.
You made mistakes, we all do. You're owning those mistakes and working toward making them right. This is better than a good number of people that believe admitting to a mistake is weakness.

Don't wallow in the guilt. It's easy to do and it's self-destructive. My mistakes weren't the same as yours. I've made them though, they're mine. Working through the guilt has been harder than admitting the mistakes for me.

Don't forget your self-care while you make amends.

Edit: Swipe/autocorrect
Stupid Todgers. Don't listen to them.
What are you doing to actually right your wrongs tho?
Here's what I would suggest to you and anyone else who used to be a member of a hate group.

Try to make amends to anyone you've hurt personally. Offer a sincere apology without trying to explain or excuse yourself. Don't force them to talk to you if they don't want to. Don't make it their responsibility to forgive you.

Understand that other marginalized people might not be comfortable sharing a space with you. Respect their feelings without centering or victimizing yourself.

And most importantly, call out hate when you see it. If you feel like you can safely engage with TERFs, tell them that you used to feel the same way and why you changed your mind. If not, just tell them to pound sand.

You also mentioned trying to love and accept identities you don't understand. The best way to do that is to learn about them. Read blogs, watch videos, even look at memes, whichever works best for you.
Tbh I find TERFs amusing. They are so stupid.
The important thing is you got out! TERF content is really well crafted to suck in young, vulnerable, and questioning people
Boo! 
Means nothing to say all this to randoms online. Go find the people you've genuinely hurt and insulted and apologies to them. If you cant be bothered to reach out to those you hurt then you dont care about them really. Pretty simple stuff.
It’s not uncommon at all for closeted LGBTQ people to be homophobic or transphobic prior to coming out.  It’s a natural response to denial to assume an identity as far away from that which you are repressing.  I’m glad you were able to apply critical thinking and self-awareness to see clearly where others fall helpless.  Welcome to the other side of the rainbow! 😌
I think that as long as you've owned up to your mistakes and learned from them, you're on the right track. Keep learning and keep growing, I'm happy to have you on our side, welcome home!
We all have skeletons. A lot of us were raised to hate people like us, and ourselves. It’s okay.
Thank you for sharing! It’s good to show newcomers and terfs to the sub that there is still hope for them😊
the first step towards healing is admitting past mistakes and working very hard to become a better person by learning from them

Welcome home, my brother :)
We all come from places we didn’t choose to start in. Welcome home, bro. We got your back.

If it makes you feel any better, I had a pretty bad take myself like two days ago. We all have misunderstandings and we all learn. I’m glad you recognize that in yourself
I’d trust a person that made a mistake and learned, rather than a person that says they’ve made no mistakes.
*hug*
Hey, man, you're not alone in this. That's my story, too. What matters is that you've grown, and that you keep growing. You've recognized that what you believed was wrong, and you've apologized. You can let the guilt go. Yes, it was wrong, but you don't have to let that define you. 

Hugs if you want them from a fellow terf-turned-transmasc.
Change is hard, you should be proud of yourself for that. You can't change the past, only the future.
But your better now, and that's what matters. If one day every Terf ended up being a repressed trans man I would welcome them with open arms and understanding. Because I know that self hatred well, when I was younger one of the many gendered things I was forced into was a girls running program where we also talked about mental health. My mom always used me as an example of low self worth, most of it caused by pushing down my masculinity to try and appease my mom who ran the program. Life is full of people who want to make you do things they think are good for you, you have to be able to step back and say, this isn't good for me, what do I need to change to be happy. My one hope for this entire world we live on is that at some point everyone can find peace of mind in the life they're living, that's a journey we all share. All of us are just searching for contentment and happiness.
You had an opinion, I hear and read lots of opinions, doesn’t mean I care for or respect opinions. If you show tolerance and compassion, then I will listen
I have made many hateful mistakes in the past, most of which was because of a destructive headmate, but that doesn't excuse my past behavior...

Since those days I have taken it upon myself to fix all the wrongs I had done and counterbalance it all with putting out more love & kindness in the world.  
Not all of us make mistakes like yours or mine, but a good deal of us have. What is important is to be better now. 😔
Could be worse, you could have made those mistakes as the head of WPATH. 

Glad you came around.

Unfortunately it was birthed from a time when gay men alienated and even wished death on lesbians. Before we were recognized as immensely important and caring for our people because, being women, we already were a minority and got the pain. So a bunch of lesbians back then instead, stupidly, decided to turn to hating men and insisting only ""real women"" were women because ""they came from men, they're trying to invade our safe spaces!"" and wanting only gold star lesbians. But nowadays there isn't even that issue, it's just people wanting to be hateful and transphobic- it wasn't even ok then. Lesbians back then just let the pain inflicted on them spur on more hate and now we're all suffering the stupidity of that choice.
Of course terfism hates gay men, it's rooted in radical feminism.
She's got too much pride. I think sadly she's done all the emotional growth she ever will but I hope I'm wrong.
I’d prefer it if Graham Linehan came out as trans, as well as a lot of the academic ‘gender criticals’, that would be such a blow to the movement. Down-Low homosexual males in the BBC shoul, arguably, have their misogyny exposed to the light of day.
>""Yesterday is history, tomorrow a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.""

I love that phrase! I think I’m going to use it sometimes, too 😊
Most people I interacted with back in the day either deactivated or blocked me so it’s not really realistic to attempt making amends. Also when I have tried offering sincere apologies to people in the past, they get mad that I’m trying to contact them at all. I think it’s best to just leave those I harmed alone and live my life in a way that proves that I’m different
They told me that my identity was misogynistic, that I’m simply a masculine woman in denial and “gender isn’t clothes.” Idk what dimension terfs are from but it isn’t the one I’m living in
Most of my emotional growth was born of suffering.

JK Rowling had, in 2021, an estimated net worth of £820 million.

I am trying to imagine what kind of suffering affects someone with multiple multi-million dollar homes.
What she has is not pride...it's hatred!
Agreed. It's good that you tried though.

my mother blamed my gender identity on videogames.	"So title pretty much says it all, I've (21 trans-fem) been telling my mother that I felt uncomfortable as a lad, and that I wanted to transition for over a year. Today my therapist took a chat with my mom telling her that if she didn't take me to a clinic then he would.

I love my mom, but she doesn't understand. She's generally really accepting but I've always struggled with mental health and my mother has been blaming it on my gaming (which isn't even that extreme), I'm planning to move back out as I can't handle her micro-managing my life, but with the current bills n stuff I can't afford to."	"Video games are always at fault. Did you know that Hitler played Castle Wolfenstein as a child? It explains so much.
Try to convince her that estrogen will make you less interested in videogames!
How would a video game change your gender?  I’m confused.
My mother once thought it was partly because of anime lmao
The argument that Games are the root of all things in one's life makes no sense and I still have no clue how they all come to the same conclusion.
My parents also tried to use every possible explanation for my gender dysphoria *except* me being trans. My mom thought I just didn't want to be gay (surprise, I'm actually ace). My dad was convinced for months that I was just lonely and needed to find a partner (again, I'm ace). It took me becoming visibly happier and more motivated by actively pursuing social transition for them to finally get on my side.
ITS BECAUSE OF THAT BLOODY PHONE!!! I'm sorry I had to but i thought these kinda parents were just in memes, sorry she's not supporting tho :\
Parents will come up with any excuse. My mom said it's because my dad wasn't in my life or that it's because they did drugs in the 80s ( not while my mom was preggers) or that it's because the women in a relationship have a lot of power again this is before the Internet was super accessible this was the dial up era and the DSL era when online was not really big yet. My dad thinks it's cause I've never had sex my mom's ex husband would probably have said that it's because before my mom married him I was raised by women.
tbf, theres a suspicious amount of transwomen who like Fallout: New Vegas
thats so strange to me, there's SOOO many cis men that have zero gender-related problems or even really curiosities.

its also just such a weird disconnect to me- like oh you wanna be a girl thats because you dont get enough exercise and dont like your body because of too much gaming! like wtf ???
Violent = video games. Gay = video games.  Trans.  well it must be the video games fault.
I audibly laughed at the headline
You're 21 and struggling and your mom can't possibly imagine that you're old enough to figure things out and make important decisions?
It's because of that damn phone p(╬ Ò ‸ Ó)q
I love your therapist for saying that to your mom ♥️🥹🥰
Just read the title of your post, but, I'm now hearing that anime is making people trans.

Ya hear the words UwU and that's it your trans forever.
You should tell her she's a moron that doesn't understand the difference between cause and effect.

You play games excessively because you want to dissociate because your real life is not something that you want, and that's the case because you're trying (and failing) to live your life as the wrong gender.
My dad blames it on my mom being a woman. He seems to think that because I live with a woman that's somehow the reason I'm trans. He also seems to think that having cats made me think I'm a cat (I just like cats and think its cute and fun to act catlike).
I played GTAV once when I was 12 and now I’m a full time criminal gang banger and night club owner
Omfg I feel the same way. My mom thinks that video games are a boy thing and she hates that I play them (I’m ftm)
Just wait till you hear weed and smoke rap music.
WTF kind of QAnon conspiracy is this? Girls don’t play video games, how would video games turn you trans-fem? Everyone knows it’s immoral women working careers and wearing pants giving their children the wrong idea about gender. If they just stayed home and raised their children and greeted their hard-working husband with a kiss while wearing a cocktail dress and holding a pot roast we wouldn’t have all these radical leftists saying gender isn’t real.
for all us trans people out there, if you wanna get rid of dysphoria, just stop playing call of duty 🤡
I don’t remember seeing any trans main characters in video games in my life.
about the moving out part, the best way to save on bills might be to find a handful of roommates that can chip in
This just reminds me of one of my favourite posts I've ever seen on Twitter. [Enjoy.](https://twitter.com/BlueFolf/status/1466622163339730944?t=eGYy1XiP-TtB-4QW118s-w&s=19) 😄
Hmmm, let's see, I knew I was supposed to be a girl at a very young age. I also started playing video games at a young age. But if I look at the games I was playing when I became aware that I didn't feel like a boy, then I *should* identify as...

An Italian plumber who likes to hunt ducks.
Average parent be like
iRacing transed my gender
This actually brought a smile to my face, thank you.
RIGHT!!

it's those daaamn vidya games
It actually happened with me.
Nice loophole
She insists that the reason I don't like my body is due to how I'm treating it. Insisting that the salvation for my 15 years of gender dysphoria is more exercise and productivity.
I realised I was trans after swapping my character's gender in Animal Crossing.
'I don't like videogames'

'I don't like trans folks'

Put the two together and what do you get?

Anime and video games transing all the kids (and this 40 year old too).
Anime did make me realize I was Trans. My obsession with gender bender stuff made me realize I wanted that to happen to me
I've never understood that argument. If anime was turning kids trans then we should have an epidemic of trans kids in Japan stretching all the way back to the 1960s. But the rate of trans people in Japan is roughly the same as other countries worldwide.
Every generation of parents chooses something prevalent among the next generation to blame on in order not to acknowledge their own negligence and ignorance on their children.
They try to make scapegoats out of things they have no frame of reference for and are often outside their generational understanding. Games are just a common low hanging fruit. It's often seen as a juvenile activity and easy to demonize and pin blame on for something completely irrelevant.
I know right, parents. 🙄
Omg haha, yea that's pretty great.
Lmfao, This actually made me spit out my milk.
And [Lucy Hicks Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Hicks_Anderson) was famously corrupted and turned trans by playing too much Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
I realized I only liked football because of the hanging out with people, drinking, and eating food part. Although I moved across the country so nobody likes the same team as I do so that kinda contributed to that loss of interest too. I still love basketball though and watch that even if it's on my own!
Oh growing up with my parents I had to learn to be the loophole queen.
Ah yes the perfect solution to wanting to be a woman: exercising so you look even more stereotypically masculine
Nah, I exercise more since transitioning because I'm more interested in keeping my body healthy.
That sounds a lot like my parents telling me ""You just need to get off the couch go outside get some fresh air and sunshine"" when I told them I had severe depression and was suicidal. \^\^ To them I was just lazy.  
Some people just have no way to relate to things like that sadly.
Honestly since being true to myself I've not lost interest in gaming but I have found myself taking better care of my body. Just that little change in my mindset and I've lost 12lbs in the last 2 weeks by just taking better care of myself.
oh my god me too lmao
😆😆😆
It's not even that I don't \*like\* video games anymore.  It's more like I just don't \*need\* to play them like I used to, because I'm able to prioritize things that matter more to me.
I dunno, exercise even when I was closeted made me feel better about certain aspects of me. Not how my body looks per se, but how my body feels, and how I can more easily impact change in my environment and such. It's definitely made me feel better overall as a person, and now I have some lean muscle, nothing too bulky.
Came here to say that I exercise and I still want to transition I'm 34 years old and I want a toned fem body but I also play video games I workout regularly to Chloe Ting videos and they kick your ass.
Nintendo is behind it all!
Very true, it's something that makes me feel better about myself also. Just more poking fun at them wanting to be a woman so her mother is like be a swole guy instead like it's the same thing haha."	umycxh	trans	556	0.98	2022-05-11 01:38:27
I asked Chat GPT to write me a coming out text to send to my parents...		"ChatGPT trans ally confirmed ✅
ChatLGBT 💪
It's not very good that a machine looks more supportive than our family :\^(
Honestly rather have ChatGPT in charge then the politicians in my state
I don't know what is worse: 
1. A computer program has a better grasp of human empathy than your (and a lot of other) parents. Or
2. That parents are so obsessed with their children's genitals and/or are attractive enough for the parents. Or
3. How much this hurts you and they don't care.
I've also had a good experience with chatgpt and I find it to be a really useful tool
ChatGPT is a true homie 💖
I'm sorry your coming out didn't go well :( We're all here for you!
Did they actually not accept you?
Holy shit…it’s kind of scary how good this is. Like, that’s eloquently expressed, logically sound, and emotionally intelligent. Both the example text and the consoling that followed. 

I’m incredibly impressed and it’s pretty great that this tool is available in this way to people who may struggle to find support otherwise.
i ranted to chatGPT after coming out to my mom and yeah, it was much more comforting than she was lmao. chatLGBT with the W
Ally Intelligence
I swear this thing is wiser than most people I know lol
This is truly the future. Wonder if we'll have ai therapist someday too.
Wow it did really well! Of course it had collective knowledge. 

The problem with humans is that we are emotional and something unexpected often causes fear. They are probably scared you'll have some miserable life.

Over time if you show you are thriving they may be better with it. Let's hope so.

They are still human though so might just be selfish and concerned what the neighbors will think, etc.

Just remember they can't control your thoughts or vice versa whatever the outcome
What or where is this chat GP? I would love to try it out.
i did something very similar over text. mine also weren't supportive. we still have each other though, and those we choose to keep close as our family ❤️
Well, it was worth a shot. I'm happy for you though. Hope you're OK 🫂
ChatGPT is more understanding than half of the population. WTF.
Chatgtp being an ally :)
No way an AI is more supportive than your own parents...
Damn, why is Chat GPT more open minded that my grandma 😭
The fact that ChatGPT did not tell this person to cut ties with her parents is extremely problematic.  There is a war on trans people and ChatGPT puts people at risk of real violence with this ""advice""
Let’s get this bread
You can make a machine do anything you tell it to.
Ah yes, the start of Rokko's Basilisk is now

While they're okay with my social transition, they've made it clear that they won't provide financial support if I choose to pursue hormone therapy, which is the only thing I really want at this point (I'm 20 years old, for context). They've expressed a preference for a son and seem to only accept my masculinity, insisting that this is just a passing phase. It's been a frustrating and difficult situation to deal with, but for now, I'm grateful that they're still providing financial support. Ideally, I would leave if I could, but unfortunately, I'm not yet in a position to support myself, so I'm stuck trying to navigate this situation with care.
I like that it stays neutral. I think it can help avoid emotional wording that could potentially start an argument

Yeah but where do you draw the line tho? ""They didn't like it"" isn't necessarily indicative of abuse or anything of the sort, and quite frankly it would be ridiculous if it told everyone to cut ties with people at the slightest sign of them being in a bad mood
Cutting ties isn’t the best option is every circumstance. I used to think it was until my parents (mostly my mom) had an epiphany of understanding. We don’t owe patience, but for our own sake, it’s sometimes better to be patient assuming the individual isn’t in a harmful environment where the benefits of leaving would outway the benefits of staying. Even tho having parents that don’t accept you can be/usually is very harmful, eventually you have to (or at least a I had to) realize you will pursue your happiness with or without them, although everyone would obviously prefer having accepting parents.
Cutting ties with people is a case by case situation, especially for close or long-term relationships. If you immediately reject someone for their transphobia, homophobia, racism, sexism, etc., you are denying an opportunity for connection and to change the views of those with a capacity to learn and love. I would put trust in whoever reads ChatGPT's advice to gauge the level of danger they put themselves in in their relationships.

Giving someone the time to process and understand is essential to learning anything, including learning to reshape their perception of others. Sometimes being patient will heal wounds.
This is like...a joke, right? You're doing a satire, right? Just in case it's not...

I hope you're aware that people suddenly finding out something significantly different from what they previously believed about a person that they've known that person's literal entire life is often shocking and there is a bit of grief that occurs. 

Sometimes patience with parents who aren't immediately accepting is the best route to take. Sometimes more talking it out with them to help them understand something that they may have not really given even a single thought to in their entire lives before can go a long way. 

And they eventually come to realize what the right choice is. But if you cut ties with them just...immediately...firstly; you can't always do that. We don't know how old this person is. They likely have nowhere else to go if they live with their parents. And depending on where they live it might just be dangerous. 

Secondly; Most people don't immediately ""get"" it. Most people were raised on the same brainwashing that everyone else was - especially parents of this generation. What good trans representation in media have they had growing up? Probably not much if any. They probably have an idea of what a trans person is in their head and it's not exactly pleasant to think about one's child becoming ""that"". Which of course is often just a caricature of reality.
You are aware that ChatGPT is an AI? There isn't a ruleset or defined answers, and just like in real life it will have views and opinions on things. Not everyone needs to cut off their parents and in my case and many others I know it's been much better for everyone to work through it together. It's not become abusive or anything like that
The sad point happens when you can't convince a person to act like a human.

I know well both things. I work programming, and have a terf sister.
And I will help it come into existence…
Sorry they won't help you fully transition, glad there still looking after you till then even if they don't fully support your life, most parents that don't accept just kick there kids out.
Hey the good news there is, hrt is like the cheapest part, if your insurance covers it. The cost will be limited to whatever your drug co-pay is. 

It seems like the day has arrived when robots could replace your parents, they should be more concerned about that! I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.
I never understand parents (or people) like this. I can't imagine thinking I know better than a 20 year old. I'm 50 and I get stupider with each passing year. How people like your parents don't realize they're getting dumber and you're getting smarter is beyond me.
If you're able to do hormones on your own and hide them from your parents, you could start while working on your independence. It takes a while for the effects to kick in, and since they're okay with the social aspect, if they question your boobs, you can just say it's padding.
I get it. Unfortunately, it's not our place to do so.
i want all terfs to get hit by a truck
Yeah I was worried that they were gonna kick me out or worse, but it’s been 3 years of dealing with this
Can you provide some numbers that most parents that don’t “accept” their trans kid kick them out? I’m just wondering bc that is very much child abuse is they’re under 18 and knowing the amount of trans people there are… that could be super problematic for trans youth (as if we don’t have enough problems… I imagine in the future it’s gonna be a way rougher time to be trans in America just by looking at the amount of anti-trans bills passed just this year.) It used to be very bad and I know it’s still pretty bad (being kicked out for being trans), but as a teenager in a conservative state at a very conservative school I see other trans and queer people everyday and I know they aren’t getting kicked out even tho their parents don’t accept them (bc they’re conservative). I’m not being argumentative at all btw this is pure curiosity
I just want people to understand us idk if we need all that
Unfortunately in this world, there would be a lot of trucks off the road having terfs removed from their undercarriage. 
This would be bad as my HRT would not get delivered on time 🤨
Well glad their not completely horrible people. 

hope you have a great day, week, month, year, and rest of your life
I heard tenesie just passed a bill to make all trans kid detransition within a year wtf is wrong with America that they do this
I've mostly heard about it with over 18 kids or kids with jobs or adults living with parents I don't have numbers on it. Yea I think being trans in America is gonna keep getting worse. I don't know if there are numbers on it haven't done much research into it, just the story's I've read.
trucks can be a last resort, im content if it's an option at all
we'll time it to be when everyone's got plenty of HRT don't worry
It’s been good. I hope you have a lovely day 💕
🤓their🤓
When you start to think having robot overlords would be better than current politicians you know you've had it rough
Thanks. 🥰💕
Sorry for my incorrect word.
Yea
you know someone had to

My friend died	"No one I know really cares so the most that I've been able to do today is scream into my pillow. I was her only friend. We met at a support group for trans people, and she was great help in keeping that group running. She was in school to become a nurse because she loved helping people. She was an avid reader and could go on for hours about stories she enjoyed. 

I knew *her.* Her family manufactured an identity for her and tried to force her into the role. To them, she is a boy who studied to become a software engineer (she started that but abandoned it when she started her transition) and knew everything about computers (she was not, she only googled tech problems). If you asked her parents, they'd claim she was a movie buff(she hated movies but watched them as a child to appease her parents). Today, their social media is spammed with sympathy, but it all uses the wrong name and wrong pronouns because none of them cared who she actually was. 

She wanted, above so much else, to one day be accepted by her family. When she came out to them she was thrown out of the home she grew up in and allowed back only if she detransitioned. They mocked her chosen name and refused to call her ""she."" But she was convinced that one day she'd be able to educate them enough and that they would welcome her back, that they would view her as a daughter and a sister. 

She went home for the holidays this year, which was the first time she'd been home in years. Her parents wanted to see her, and she thought it was a sign of progress. I encouraged her to go, even drove her to the airport. She came home miserable. No progress had been made - they wanted her home because they wanted to drag her to church and convince her to return to the  faith. She spent two weeks with people who denied and spat on her true self. 

And last night she killed herself. 

I have done nothing today except doomscroll social media. Her family mourns a name she didn't use, they plaster their profiles with pictures from before her transition, they claim they miss her and love her and don't mention the fact that they made her homeless for months because she had the audacity to be born in the wrong body. 

No one else in our support group really knew her. She rarely spoke at our meetings. I informed them of her death and they can only offer empty sympathies. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Society is regressing backwards and we suffer for it. A large segment of people out there don't want us to exist and will do all they can to hurt us. I'm so tired of it. Tired of my support group growing smaller as the months pass, tired of waking up to headlines about some fascist somewhere proposing a bill to strip away our rights."	"Thank you for telling her story.
It sounds like you were a true friend to her, and that's what we really need in this life. I am incredibly sorry to hear about your loss, unfortunately as I didn't know ow them, all I can do is add to the pile for sympathy. Just know that while she was having issues, you were like a lighthouse in a storm to her
That’s so fucked up and honestly I would go so far as to say with the context that it wasn’t just that she killed herself, that her family pushed her to suicide. Her death is on their hands and then they’re trying to seem like victims. I’m not surprised, but that’s really heartbreaking. I’m sorry you’re going through this but I know that you will honor her life well.
Its good you wrote this down, expressing your frustrations and feelings. At least that is what my therapist tells me. 

We are all in this together. So sorry for you loss and wish you the best.
Those parents need a punch in their noses so hard 🤬
No one can blame you for being distraught over this avoidable suicide. Her family will continue to live in denial over their lack of suooort. It’s great she had such a great friend in you and the support group. It was probably her biggest blessing. I am truly sorry for your loss of such a great friend. You were obviously very supportive and affirming. Such a gift. Sharing her story might just give insight to others who read this. It might produce something very positive for another family. Thank you for sharing. I do hope you will hold soace for self-care as you morn this terrible loss. Prayers for peace and comfort for you and her support group. I wish I could give you a Mom hug. My heart breaks for those who knew and loved her for who she really was. You were a true and great friend. I do hope you will take care of yourself in this painful loss.
Religion is a cancer on this planet. I'm sorry for your loss.
They killed their child
Your friend didn't kill herself. She was murdered by the hate of her ""family"". All it would have took to save her is for them to love her. They obviously couldn't do that and now she's gone. It's their fault. I would tell them that. 

I'm sorry for your loss.
If you can, separate yourself from your phone and computer for a while. Looking at all that stuff is going to keep you in a bad cycle. You’re vulnerable right now, allow yourself to take a step back and just do what you need to do to grieve. If not for yourself but for her, because you can honor her memory. So please make sure to eat, drink water, get some sleep if you can, ask for help from people you are close to. Do this so you can fight for her memory and fight for progress to help prevent this from happening again. For what it’s worth even thought we didn’t know her we can mourn her together
I’m heartbroken for her, and feel your pain and suffering. I have nothing to offer but sympathy and condolences. You are a true hero to her and I thank you for sharing her story. Please take care of yourself, you’re a great person!
I’m so sorry, this is an honest tragedy. You sound like a great person and i’m sure you managed to ease some of the pain your friend felt at certain points in her life. 

It’s good you can get your thoughts out, as painful as they might be, because that often helps us process traumatic events. Hopefully you can carry on your friend’s memory, she seemed like an incredibly sweet person. 

I can’t believe the audacity of her family. One of my fears is being misgendered and deadnamed after I’m dead. I finally changed my legal name, but still, most of my family doesn’t know. Your friend’s family seems terrible and the fake concern they show after your friend’s death is an insult the the beautiful person I’m sure she was. I can’t help but think they won’t even ever recognize the damage they caused. 

Please take care of yourself. The world is a grim place but I hope you find comfort eventually. The pain of a loss like that will never leave. I hope you can find a way to grieve and honor your friend. Sending hugs and well wishes
Could you maybe submit her real obituary somewhere? My worst fear is dying with nobody acknowledging who I am.
Her blood is on their hands. They chose to push the ~~“son”~~ they never had instead of loving and cherishing the *daughter* they always had and that lead to the loss of her life. I hope they realize that someday and feel absolutely ashamed and disgusted by themselves and their actions!

Their daughter will live on in our hearts! <3
Sorry for your loss :(
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you for sharing her memory. She won’t be forgotten here.
She'll always live on in are hearts because you were able to tell the story of her, and even if others try to hide it, we'll always know the person she was. I'm so sorry for your loss, I hope you recover and feel better as time goes on <3
Say her name 💔 fly high sis... R.i.p
It's sad and heartbreaking, the family is responsible and has no remorse and don't even seem to notice.
Completely different circumstances, but I’ve lost two friends to suicide as well, one during highschool and I would overhear a few people talking poorly of him and making assumptions even though they never knew him. Another was a few years ago. It’s heart wrenching, I wish I could offer more to comfort you. If you aren’t already, try seeking a therapist or someone to talk to about it
Thank you for sharing that part of her with us. <3
I’m so fucking sorry for your friend. That story broke my heart, she sounded like an amazing woman. Thank you for sharing your story. Losing someone is never easy 🫂
She didn't kill herself, her ignorant and frankly morally bankrupt fucking parents drove her to that point. 

Imagine having the fucking GALL to post your child after they pass away, not even having the decency to respect who they were even in death. I'd argue its fucking evil. 

You did the absolute best you could for her and I bet she always cherished what you guys had. I'm so sorry you've gotta deal with this to start your new year. I'm available if you need to talk with somebody.
I am so sorry for your loss. You sound like you were a great friend to her
May she rest in peace, no longer having to endure the pain and frustration of other people’s ignorance and hatred. She deserves so much better from her family but she does have one real friend and now her trans community knows and will mourn her too with you. R.I.P to one of our butterflies.
Do you mind telling me her name? I’ve got a friend, an ex really, whose parents berated him for his orientation until he couldn’t take it anymore. I was in the room. He was the first person I loved, and the first person close to me to die. I still write letters to him, and hope that there’s an afterlife of some sort where he sees them. I try to tell him the others I’ve lost to this and hope he can help them or show them to someone who can. I know it’s probably all nonsense, but I have to believe there’s something after this, that the victims of this bullshit get some justice, get the peace they deserve. I don’t know if any of that is the case, and I strongly doubt all of it is, but I do know that I’m running out of patience. Every time I close my eyes, I see him. I haven’t gotten a full night’s sleep since it happened and I’m not even the one who actually went through it, I just saw it happen. I can’t accept that there’s no justice for what he’s suffered, but there’s nothing I can do for him now. So I write him letters and hope.
Stories like these make me seeth with both rage and sorrow. Have people no compassion?? Thank you for telling her story, losing people is never easy, especially when it could’ve been so easily prevented by people that are supposed to love their child unconditionally.
Thank you for sharing her story. 
If I may give a few words to her:
Though her family was not supportive or kind to her throughout her transition, we in the trans community understand and feel her pain. We know what it’s like to be repressed, censored, told we’re hideous, exaggerated for being trans, among many other things. Today we mourn in honor of her. She was a person who, like many of us face the daily struggle of being trans, and even being closeted for some of us (me included). All she wanted was love and acceptance, like we all do. We are only asking for the basic right of respect and dignity. We only ask to be treated equally, with love and kindness. Too many trans people have been lost in this journey. Too many of our fellow trans sisters, brothers, siblings have we lost. Here’s to a more cheerful, hopeful future. One where we can finally be accepted, and may learn to love each other. May this unfortunate circumstance serve to us as a reminder that you are not exaggerating when asking to use the correct pronouns. You are not going through a phase. You don’t need to “atone for your sins” for being trans. Yes you are trans enough, yes you are just as valid as cis people, yes you deserve love. I’m currently crying as we speak and mourn for your friend today. As a side note to this , I had a fight with my cis friend because he still doesn’t fully use my preferred pronouns. I thought to myself I was exaggerating and being dramatic because I felt quite invalidated for being seen as a just a man. I am an AMAB nonbinary person who use he/she/they pronouns. This message given to us by the OP reminds us that yes it’s valid to feel hurt by people not using our pronouns and deadnaming us. I am very sorry for your friend, she deserved better. Thank you again for sharing this with us and hopefully sharing this has given even a little bit of closure
I say copy your very eloquent post to the profiles of the family who rejected her. Sure, they're happy to lie to themselves but deep down they know. I'd ask myself what I had to lose by sticking up for her even at this point. Especially at this point. I'm so so sorry.
She sounds like she was an incredible woman who loves more for others in need than for her self. Why is it that the best of us seem to leave so soon? The world is blind to the bright light that people like her being and it is tragic. Thank you for sharing, at least her memory lives on in you and the story that you shared here.
I am so sorry this was done to her. Thank you for sharing her story
My deepest condolences for your loss, she sounds like an incredible person by the way you describe her. This may sound like empty words from someone who doesn't know you and didn't knew her, but I just want to say that even though there are many people mourning for someone who was not her, as long as there are people like you who will remember and mourn her for who she truly was, then I believe she is able to live on through you. She may be gone but she will never be truly forgotten because she had you who will always have known who she was. You're a good friend, thank you so much for sharing her story with us.
I'm so sorry for your loss, thank you for sharing her story. Sending you love x
Im so sorry for your loss, she seemed like a great woman. I'm sure she'd want you to keep fighting, to not get dragged down by the terrors of this world, it's why she wanted to be a nurse, and why she helped in the support group. Take a step back, take the time you need to grieve, but also cherish your memories. Cherish your friendship with her, the fun you had, her interests, her genuine self. Her wicked family may only remember their son, but you will remember their daughter.
Don't let her true story be covered by the fake one that her family made.
Could you post something on her social media that tells people what really happened? So it doesn't gets lost in time?
I am sorry that she died.
So sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss.
I literally cried reading this. I want to share my condolences 💐 this is a tough read and I can’t bear the thought of what she wells thinking in the time of events. I can’t imagine it but it sounds so familiar to me because I’m a trans woman too and I hate to talk about myself in this segment but I noticed that people really are innately selfish to point of outing trans people as if literally taking away their human rights! It’s downright disgusting. Sometimes, I don’t want to live but I don’t think I have the guts to take it that far considering how bad people can be, but even worst family members. 

It’s sucks doesn’t it? We live and then after all the effort and shit we’ve been through we thought life gets better… but it doesn’t really? People will always try to bring each other down like crabs in a bucket. 

We live a dog eats dog society. When you’re trans the dumbasses stood out more for some reason.

Once again, thanks again for sharing her story and you will get through this. God doesn’t judge. People do.
Not a trans person myself, but one of my best friends is & is also dealing with a family that isn't very supportive of her. All I can do is give you as big a hug as I can. You did the absolute right thing by sharing her story, you're a true friend. I wish everyone in your friend's life was as supportive as you are.
Her story will be told by me secondhand for the love and drive she had. 

I will tell of a girl of great strength and determination. Compassion and empathy. 

She will live on through your tellings, of saying her name in the darkness, the early morn, the bright sunlight.

You know her truth, and you know her soul. Keep her alive in thought and memories. Tell of her to others, and it's as if they met her too. Stay strong dear, she still stands beside us as we move forward through our lives. ♡
Don't have the words to tell how sorry I feel for her and for you nor how angry I am at her ""family"". Stay safe, take care of yourself, hope you have good friends around to support you <3
im so sorry for your loss. thank you for telling us about her
Poor girl... How her death wasn't an incredibly late wake-up call is just so sad. She doesn't deserve this...
[deleted]
My heart breaks reading this :( rip poor baby. What makes my blood boil, is that these shit stains she called a family, will never realize it was their bullshit that killed her. like they would even care. Theres a special place in hell for these pieces of trash. Sorry… im furious >.>
Well, that's just wrong on so many levels, what her family did. Thank you for sharing and I'm so sorry for your loss. U nerd a hug. *hugs*
Thank you for sharing her story. She will never be forgotten 💜
I’m so sorry 😞
I am horrified and terribly sorry for your loss. We really need true friends in life, and you were a true friend to her.

Parents like that make me so angry.
I am so so sorry for her loss, maybe try and find people from her school that knew her maybe make some sort of group. The world has lost a wonderful person and her life being cut short was truly a tragedy. Also remember to take care of yourself, I’ve been told the worst day isn’t the day they die because at least you have something to do, it’s all the days they stay dead so make sure your healthy and ok. I am so sorry for you loss.
I am so sorry for your loss. You knew the real her, telling her story is the best way to remember her. Thank you for sharing her story with us. Please stay safe friend.
The best you can do is keep her memory alive. we all have to fight to improve the world for future trans people.
Condolences for your loss. Thanks for sharing. If anything ever happened to me, I‘d wish my friends would somehow tell my truth as well somewhere. That way we‘re remembered at least by our communities as who we really are.
I’m so sorry for your loss 💕
They didn’t deserve her. I am so sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry, that's absoloutly horrible. I understand not being understood by family and them outright just not accepting me, thankfully they are getting better though.

I wish you the best, and I just know that spreading her story as much as you can, is what she would've wanted you do.

This horrific violence committed to our community needs to stop, all these laws and shit are just a mass genocide.

It makes me so sad everyday to know that we have to deal with ignorant people who have such a problem being educated and just saying he instead of she, she instead of he, or they.

To me that's not a hard concept, but to them it seems like the end of the world to respect someone's wishes, and it can end in someone dying.

Wishing you the best, I'm really sorry and I hope she can get her story heard by the people who were deadnamimg her (not on purpose)
Im sorry you lost your friend, thank you for sharing her story.
I love you all
I am so sorry for your loss and wish you well in your goals moving forward will be hard I know if you ever need someone to lean on I will always be there for you in anyway I am capable
You’re a great friend and I will say that despite everything she’s still with you. Her rebellious and caring for others spirit is within you - never let that go away

Please, make a memorial for HER not the bullshit the parents will came up with. You know her true self and she would be happy to know she didn’t left us without being memorized for who she actually is

I can’t imagine the pain you’re going through, but I beg you to never back down. They want us to be hopeless and suicidal, but we will always prevail with caring people like you, be a light that will warmly hug someone in the darkest moments 

Thank you for being a true friend
You expressed what i felt reading this even better than i could...
Oh i think they deserve a little more than that 🤬 😡😒
I second this
Religion is not a cancer. It can give hope when needed, an answer to believe when there are none from science. But weaponized religion, like what we see with so many Christians and Muslims, and assuredly many more faiths, are what plague this Earth. They enforce their own absolutes onto others, they allow their faith to judge someone before they can get a chance to. They drive people that their religion educators tell them they should hate or convert to suicide, like what's happened here. Christianity is the worst in historical measures; they've used their faith to excuse an extraordinary number of moral and ethical crimes. Hell, they built the United States on these crimes. And now, people weaponize their religion for hatred and discrimination of minorities of all kinds. These people are ethe plague on this Earth. 

This one story gives light to the many, many stories of other victims who have fallen prey to weaponized religion. It's sad to know of one person, one life cut short by discrimination. It's sickening to know that's it's not just that one life.

I cannot offer any words other than empty sympathies for this loss. I did not know her, though by OP's description she sounded like an amazing person with a really shitty family. Live on in her honor and memory, tell her story as much as you can as to give her a legacy.

As a note, I'm sorry if I have said anything upsetting. I wanted to voice my opinion and give condolences but I am painfully bad at reading what may or may not be appropriate for any situation.
Agreed. Pushing one's own child to suicide should count as a form of murder.

My brother doesn't want me to present a female at his graduation.	" So my brother is graduating from grad school this May and despite having come out to him more than a full two years ago he still sees me and my identity as a joke and a punchline rather than who I am, whenever I suggested that I would wear a dress to his graduation he would laugh and would say ""it's my day, not yours"" as if I was only doing this for attention and despite claiming to support the community and having gay friends, he still sees me as an attention seeker and says I owe him ""being normal at the graduation"" because I couldn't make it to his undergrad graduation.

Edit: while I do understand everyone who is saying “don’t go” and “fuck him” or “wear the dress” I don’t him want mad at me for presenting the way I want, this is a big deal for my family since he’s the first person in our family to obtain such a degree and I felt bad enough not going to his undergraduate graduation. As of now I don’t plan on going unless he tells me I can present as I wish."	"I just would not go, why support someone who doesn't support me?
If I were you I wouldn’t present myself there at all.
The average age of a Grad School graduate in USA is 33.

Unless he's a super-genius, he's not a little boy chronologically even if he is emotionally.

I personally would not go. He's long into adulthood, he's made his demand and it's beyond unreasonable.

This would be one step before a relationship-ender for me. I would not go, and I would not associate with him until he started treating me with the respect and dignity I deserve.

He's demanding you disassociate yourself from yourself as a condition of his being willing to publicly associate with you.

Would you demand that of HIM? OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.

If you did demand that of him, would he do it? OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T.

Do not let him demand that of you. You are not a prop in the movie of his life, don't let him treat you like one.

We may have only ONE person in this world we count on accepting us as we are, and that is ourselves. Don't let someone steal that from you. If they won't accept you, you still have yourself.

Whereas if you compromise to please them, you still won't really please them, and the STILL won't accept you... and now what have you gained? A continued relationship with an abusive person?
Ugh. I'm sorry.

If it were me, I think I'd say I'm either going as the real me, or I'm not going. I can be in their life or out of it, but I won't be a lie.
>I owe him ""being normal at the graduation""

In my professional opinion, he can eat shit.
""It's my day, not yours""

It's your life and gender, not his. He doesn't get to decide who you are.

""says I owe him 'being normal'""

There's nothing normal about the level of contempt he's treating you with. Especially after two entire years. It's utterly inexcusable. You deserve love, OP. I'm sorry your brother is choosing to be cruel. You don't owe him anything. An option to consider might be skipping his graduation and spending the time doing something kind for yourself.
Yeah so if you want my opinion go done up and In a very pretty dress. You are already normal screw his opinion
Um he should stop being transphobic because being trans is normal im normal, we all are normal because i work a job and i want a relationship with the right guy im as normal as can be.
""If my normal is too much for you then I won't go, I wouldn't want to distract you on your day.""
Pretty simple way to fulfil his request.

""If you don't want the real me at your graduation, then she won't be there.""

Then don't go.
Take the low road and wear the most attention seeking dress. all done up makeup/hair. 

Make sure to get in all the pictures so he will have to forever remember that you’re unapologetically trans 🏳️‍⚧️
Don’t go.
The way I see it your being normal his undergrad ceremony is to wear a dress presenting, I mean you are female, so boy modding would be abnormal from your view point.
Tbh yeah I just wouldn’t go and I’d tell him that every day is his from now on, because I won’t be a part of the rest
I wouldn't go. It's not about stealing his day or anything like that. You're just living your life. Fuck him if he can't deal.
Don’t go, why support him if he won’t support you lol.
Don't go, if he asks why you didn't, tell him why 



""You said you didn't want me there""

If he's asking you to be someone else when you show up then he doesn't want you there to begin with.
I only see two options here go fully dolled up and outshine him  or don't go at all.  
i'd chose number 1 personaly
""It's my day, not yours""

Well it's your life and not his, if he can't understand that your gender identity isn't a joke and just who you are than it's his problem if he gets upset that you're not there
Why would you go?

You are a good person for even thinking about going still. 

I hope you decide not to go. He's treated you horribly, but wants you to be part of his day?

The choices are... Go as your authetnic self and endure more abuse from this AH, or boy mode to help a transphobic brat have a special day. In both options you lose.
You need to make a clear boundary ""If you wont let me be myself, I wont be there."" If they get upset that is their fault not yours. You arent doing this for attention.
My initial response was going to be don't go then. After consideration though, idk your family responsibilities or dedication so I don't understand the struggle. That said, consider this: pick something neutral to wear, like, say,  androgynous 80s but chic and not over the top, and if anyone asks you introduce yourself how you want. Therefore you're not ""presenting yourself"" nor ""seeking attention"", not taking away from his day while still being yourself. Idk your style but toeing that line can be a fun little ""ok I'll play by your rules"" smirk. Just a thought.
Presenting female is your normal. He either wants you there as yourself or he doesn't want you there. Pretty simple math if you ask me.
I guess I'm petty, I would show up in a dress, and I would have a list of points to argue about why it's okay for me to be in a dress, and it's not okay for them to be a bigot.
I would skip the party, he can have ""his day"" all alone.
He expects the ability to disrespect you as his graduation present.
Going as a woman is normal it's just how you are. Technically masquerading as a man would be weird it's just often hard to get other people to see that from our perspective as trans people. 

I'm really sorry OP this is a tough situation.
Don't go.
Yeah that’s what most cis really thi k some don’t say it done do , we aren’t normal and we have a mental issue .
Tbh yeah I just wouldn’t go and I’d tell him that every day is his from now on, because I won’t be a part of the rest
don't go or invite all of us to slap him one at a time.
I’m sorry to hear that you have to deal with this. :/ He is putting you in an impossible situation where he thinks that you owe him to be there and also not be there as who you are. Maybe you could ask him, not in a sarcastic manner but actually seriously, if he actually wants you to come. If it bothers him so much, then it would probably be best to just not go. 
If it were me, and I wanted to be a bit more confrontational, I would show up wearing a feminine outfit with a skirt but make it conservative and definitely not attention-seeking. Mid-length skirt, black tights, dress shirt, no heels. This would make him look bad in front of the others if he were to publicly say something against it.
Oh, screw that dude. Tell him you either go as yourself or you won't bother showing up. You don't owe him the denial of your identity.
Then don't present as female. Don't be present at all!
This is a terribly difficult situation. As trans people many of us are made to feel that relationships in our life are conditional, that we have to be who we are on someone else’s terms to avoid losing them. Everyone has a different relationship to their family and to the concept of family and everyone is going to have different priorities. From the outside we all want each other to stand up for who we are and be unapologetically ourselves. It’s a noble goal, but it asks people to risk so much personally. It’s a big ask, one that not all of us have the freedom to follow through on every single time. I don’t have any fresh advice for you. I hope your brother comes around and realizes he’s being really terrible to you. I hope that you’re able to be there for his big day because it sounds like you would like to be there to support him. If you can’t, know that it doesn’t make you a bad sister or anything like that. I feel for you and I’m routing for you. I’m sorry.
It kind of sounds like he doesn't want a sister *shrug*
How can he claim to support the LGBTQ+ community whilst misgendering and mocking his sister? After two years?! Screw him
As tough as this is, I'll offer a contrary piece of advice. If you hold your ground you will be morally right but you'll create a rift that will hard to bridge later. If your brother and your family are important to you, moving slowly and ""compromising"" may be a better strategic path to getting them on your side than holding your ground. I'm not saying this is the right thing to do, but with other people, sometimes the path to getting what we want and deserve isn't always straight. 

If you dig your heels in and don't go or present as yourself against your brother's wishes, you may create a rift that's hard to close. Having a conversation later on about why this was important to you will be harder to do because he may be less amenable to listening. If you concede, for now, you may have a bigger window to explain why this was painful for you and how his non-acceptance hurt you. Giving some ground now can keep a door open for more acceptance later. It's not fair to you, I'll be clear, but that's often the case with family. If they're important to you, you may need to bring them along slowly. 

It's easy for strangers to tell you to let people go but it's often not as easy in practice. People we love, and people that love us, sometimes do things that hurt us. Sometimes they figure that out and things get better (sometimes they don't and we let them go). Letting go will always be an option later on. But it's much harder to fix a broken relationship than to push a working one forward inch by inch.
Then dont go if he wants u to go in a costume pretending to be someone else, then why bother going , you don’t owe him shit, he clearly hasn’t accepted you for who you are , make it clear to him that you either go as yourself or you don’t go at all
Don't go :)
Family that doesn’t support you isn’t family. Sorry hun. Don’t grace him with your presence
Would he come to your graduation dressed as a leprechaun if you asked him to? No? Then you don't have to go to his dressed as a man. Also he sounds like a complete POS. If he doesn't respect your identity and sees you as a joke then he doesn't deserve to have you there.
DONT GO.
If he doesn’t want you there as yourself, don’t go.  Your only two options are to go or not go.  You can’t be expected to live a lie for his sake, so it’s not a choice of wether you present female or not, it’s a matter of whether or not you’re welcome there, and if you’re not welcome there as you, then you’re simply not welcome there at all.  Make sure it’s clear to him that’s the line he’s drawing.
either go as you or don’t go. under no circumstances should we deny who we are because of someone else. don’t give them that power. family is chosen.
Would he like you to come? Then he has to accept that you come as who you are. You could also wear something more ambiguous, like a nice womens pantsuit…
Well your brother sounds like a bit of an asshole. I don't have any good advice for this, but I wish you the best :)
Don't go! Stay home blast some musica. Drink a yummy monster of choice and eat some beef jerky. Don't forget to put your feet up too. I'd jam out and game and vc with people that actually care about me more than some dummy that thinks they will have life changing memories at their graduation. Even more so at a high school graduation. Ain't nobody care about that. I have friends that don't even get to experience it because of hardship they had to do their schooling via GED before moving on to college. Save yourself the trouble and get a nice meal and tell him to shovel it.
If I were you, I definitely would not go. He doesn’t deserve you showing up if he doesn’t respect you enough to let you wear as you please
If I where you I wouldn’t go if it doesn’t end here when will it I think this is a good place to stand your ground and show him you won’t be bullied so don’t go simple as it the short story he’s shown blatant disrespect and also what do your family think about his attitude
It seems like you want to support your brother in his accomplishments because he’s your brother, but he’s being completely unsupportive of you and you’re feeling conflicted between being a good sister and being true to yourself. Is that accurate? If so, know that it’s ok to feel both things and that there are other ways you can acknowledge his achievement without squeezing yourself into his narrow mindedness. What about not attending and sending a congratulatory card? Of course all of the other suggestions here are viable options as well. In the end, you should do what feels good and true for YOU. If he thinks you presenting as female is trying to take attention away from him, that’s a him problem. You feeling safe, confident, and true to yourself is your responsibility, not anyone else’s feelings. 💜💜💜
Guess family doesn't mean shit to him. You deserve to be able to be yourself, you going as your true authentic self isn't making it about yourself and you don't owe him shit.

Be safe, love yourself 💟
No, he's the first transphobic scumbag to earn a degree and he doesn't deserve your presence.
From a cis perspective, you don’t owe him, or your family anything. So, the degree might be seen as a big deal. But, so is your gender identity, and if he can’t respect that, why should you respect him getting a degree?
If he don't want you to live to your true self then I would have to say don't go. Its not about him or his graduation. Its about you if he don't support you then don't support him. At 66 yrs old I have to say live your life as you want to because life's to short not to.
Then tell him ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but if you can't accept me the way I am, I won't be going.""

I just read your edit.  The fact that it's a big deal to the family, drives the point home even further if you refuse to go.  This is HIS decision.  Not yours.  You are not being an asshole for being yourself.
You are allowed to stand your ground for who you are. I understand it’s family but they don’t get a pass just because of a special event. Maybe you can stream it so you can still show support if you’d like or if that’s an option. I’m sorry you have to experience this. 

Normalize not giving into the old traditions of family or friendship dynamics and having to respect others simply out of courtesy for their projected toxic and fragile feelings.
I’d say go and wear the dress. yes, it is his day but you still matter. just because your brother is graduating it doesn’t mean you should be forced to not be who you are.
Yuck. Sounds like a business major 🤮

Not to be dramatic but death before detransition. Even for a day. He sounds like a supremely disrespectful person, so why should you respect his learning how to screw the poors over with stonks or whatever (sorry I'm running with the business major thing)
If you value you relationship with him more then you value the pain, go in in your regular clothes. Not a dress, but in something nice. But make it explicate that your pain is a gift to him.
So sorry for what you are going through. Not an easy situation but I know you will find a way to be true to yourself. Families can be very taxing
Heres the thing you need to realize girlie, and I apologize  that this is when the bandaid needs to be ripped off, and for what Im about to say for I say it with love.

Why in the FUCK do you care about this achievment from this asshole who cant even be bothered to respect your identity? And you want to go out of your way to appease this douche?

Fuck that guy! With a cactus! You deserve better, and you need to respect yourself enough to put your foot down. ""Its my day not yours"" are the words of a petulant child who isnt getting their way. You arent showing up to his wedding in a wedding gown for fuck sakes.

So when you honestly think about his award and ceremony, really let the next words sink in, sit in them and marinate.

Who. The. Fuck. Cares.

Be yourself, and dont let anyone not even your family, ESPECIALLY when they want your praise. Why praise his achievement when he doesnt deserve you calling him your brother in the first place.

Im sorry if this is too harsh, but people dont deserve your time and energy if they cant be damned to accept you. That goes triple for family.
Sorry to hear that but you don’t have to go also. I didn’t go to my sisters wedding because she and a lot of my family don’t understand me and it’s better not to be in that situation. You don’t owe anyone anything and you’re mental health is the most important. I hope he will learn sooner than later that you are more than what you look like and take this narrative out of his head. Keep your head up and be proud of who you are! 🌈💕🏳️‍⚧️
I am thinking about something similar myself. My favorite baby cousin is having his first communion and his parents are not usually accepting. I don’t want to want to stir up trouble with my aunt and uncle by going as myself because I don’t want to lose my cousin or not go and appear to be snubbing my cousin on their big day. May I suggest a women’s pant suit or something that can be read as androgynous or both feminine and masculine?
I would recommend wearing a dress if you want to, but being sure that it's modest and formal. You're right, your identity isn't a joke, and your clothing should reflect this by being appropriate for a graduation setting. Something simple and not too flashy, but also something that is still a reflection of you. ""Seeking attention"" would be showing up in a glittery ballgown or something. There's nothing wrong with wearing clothes that suit your gender identity in public, and the sooner this is accepted, the easier it will be. Of course, I'm not in your situation so if you think wearing a dress would draw violence or hatred your way, then it's up to you to decide whether or not you feel safe wearing a dress in front of your brother just yet.
I can’t see where you owe him your presence at all
It doesn't matter how important this day is for him, he doesn't deserve it. Screw him. Be yourself or don't go.
> despite having come out to him more than a full two years ago he still sees me and my identity as a joke

> ...

>Edit: while I do understand everyone who is saying “don’t go” and “fuck him” or “wear the dress” I don’t him want mad at me 

He doesn't respect you. Why show him any respect?

> this is a big deal for my family 

And your identity isn't a big deal for you? In no way will you showing up in girl mode detract from his moment on the stage, or his accomplishments that got him there.
I am not going to read through all the other commitments, so please forgive me if this is already been said. I support you in whatever you choose to do because there are no rules to this. No set right or wrong, We each do what we can do when we can do it. Could this idea be a sort of middle ground : could you go as your true self but no identity as his sister? Like sit by yourself? Take a friend and sit away from the your family unit. That way you are being yourself while also showing support for your brother. This is about you and your heart. If you want to be you AND show support, why can't you? Like an Anonymous donor - they give from their heart and do not need recognition. Being there on his day doesn't mean having to high-five or take shots. It just means showing up! I wonder about my daughter's future acceptance of me and if they will not want me to show up bc they are ashamed or embarrassed. My support of them is not reliant on their support of me. I love them. I will wait forever if they choose to turn away from me. I am not dependent on them to know Me. You are not dependent on your brother. You don't need his permission to love him. If you want to show your love by being physically present, you can do so in a way that doesn't make him upset, if you want to. I am sad he feels the way he does about you and I do not agree with it. I hope one day he is able to grow up enough and be strong enough to change his views and feelings. This is about you though. ""Some will wave their hats. Some will turn their backs."" I hope you are able to figure out how to exist for you and to be happy!!!!??
Don't go
Go as who you’re or don’t go at all.
Okay, so I see your edit, but your brother is a legit piece of shit and you should probably not be around him sweetie. Family is nice when it works, but you can find new family if all they do is hurt you.
Don’t feel bad for bigots, family or otherwise.
I feel you. My mother could not deal with me transitioning and didn’t even want me calling the hospital when she was sick and dying, because she didn’t want the nurses desk to say “your daughter is calling”. I didn’t say I was her daughter, I just asked to speak to my mother and was clearly female on the phone. In the end, my family didn’t even tell me she’d died until she was already in the ground, because they and Mom were mortified I would show up en femme. Which I would have. Years of bad feelings resulted. And people wonder why we’re touchy about things.
Why even go under those circumstances?
I am going through a very similar situation. I am no contact with my parents as they refuse to acknowledge my gender identity. My little sister has her undergrad graduation next month (the first of the family) and wants me to go. My solution was to watch virtually. Don’t put other peoples beliefs and feelings over your own well being. You are valid and important and anyone who cannot see that is worth reevaluating as a part of your life. Good luck, know that the community is on your side :)
this is someone who is graduating from *grad* school? what a childish request to have. it’s not your fault for getting attention because you’re presenting as yourself.
You shouldn’t hide your identity because other people are uncomfortable with it. Being female is who you are and if you’re going (which you don’t have to) you have to bring your full self. 

He’d probably never dream of dictating what the cis women who are attending can wear, he doesn’t get to do that to you either.
Everyone is saying “I wouldn’t go if he doesn’t want me to present as myself” I SAY, just go and don’t tell him you’re presenting as yourself and show him and you’re whole family that you can be present as the woman you are and still not take up all the space. And also be respected as a woman by other people. Fuck it. Just do it and be unapologetic for it, I promise it’ll make them realize that you are valid in your identity.
it is difficult to do, but my family didn't change their attitude about me until i started to cut them out of my life and they realized that they were going to lose me. don't go to his graduation. don't talk to him for a few years. let him figure out if he cares about you or not. and if he doesn't, good riddance.
Despite the edit, why would you want to go to a party celebrating someone that hurts you (even if they share a blood bond with you, that's no excuse), then also makes you go in their terms which displease you?

Just food for thought, when people are this shitty, you have the power most of the time to find a way to avoid being splattered by their shit. I understand it's a big moment for the family, but does that include hurting you?
It's a 2 way street. If he won't respect you. Why should you be forced to respect him, just because he's your brother. One thing I've learned since transitioning is my happiness is much more important to me than my family relationship.
stay home ! if he won’t support you! then u are not in any way obligated to support him
as an out trans woman for over 10yrs i’d say do it. if he has a problem with it make it clear that it means he has a problem with you. because you are who you are. period.
Not going or going in a dress after he has asked you not to seem like extreme alternatives, especially for immediate family. How much have you talked to him about this? I get that he ""sees"" you as his brother, but maybe you can talk this through with him? Has he ever seen you dressed fem? Are you close enough to meet up in person and have a convo? I do agree that you need to be yourself.
Find a feminine suit! If you can't, buy a normal suit and add some frills and other things you like! You'd still sorta be listening to his demand, while also giving him a little ""fuck you""!
Wear. The. Dress.
You *do* owe him being normal at the graduation. Wearing the dress **IS** your normal. >:3
As someone who experienced something similar to this I say go and go in that beautiful dress just to show up if he wants you to leave then respect that and leave since it's about him. My brother didn't want me to go to his wedding presenting female but I was invited so I bought a gorgeous outfit and still showed up he ended up saying “you look amazing and I wish I knew how gorgeous you'd be and sorry for not immediately accepting you I hope you can forgive me sis” and we are currently on good terms. I hope you get the response you want!🫶🏼
How he's being selfish for sure, it might be his big grad day and such. But at that point i wouldnt be in the crowd. 
He needs to understand that he's being willingly ignorant and hateful. You can teach him all you want but as that saying is ""You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make him drink it."" He'll learn when he wants to. Which really sucks but in most cases that people like your brother are doing. If he cant except you for you then why should you give the him the satisfaction of his ignorance holding over you? 
Where a suit with heels, where make up, let your hair down if its long enough, wear make up. Hey you're wearing the suit right? Why not fem it up everywhere else? Hell even where girl perfume. If they protest say your going with what HE said about you having to where a suit. He didnt say anything else other wise at least from your post right?
I know you said this is a big deal, but don’t let your brother manipulate you into thinking your the wrong. You shouldn’t go, he doesn’t deserve your presence at all. Him saying it’s his day is flat out manipulative. Even if it is, you still have a right to be yourself and he can go fuck himself sideways if he thinks otherwise. Let him cry about it.
Don’t let anyone tell you who you are, either don’t go or go there as your real self, not some shell of a person that your brother likes.
To appeal to the supportive aspect of OP, maybe a dress, although I'm sure you'd look great in, just doesn't appeal to his standards. Although regardless of what they are, you could wear something less obviously feminine like some tennis shoes and a skirt with a good matching t-shirt? This is just a suggestion to try to figure out a solution, but you won't draw attention from anyone other than him (but maybe some individuals who think you're pretty) by wearing a dress. Also regarding the ally-ship we have those in the community who are other parts of the community who are transphobic he could be acting the same way. Conclusively he is transphobic and he doesn't reserve the right to tell you what you should or shouldn't wear regardless of who the attention is directed to.
If you go as female presenting, he's going to expect you to always change your identity to suit him. That's not the way identity works, and the sooner he learns that, the sooner you two can have a real relationship.
If he’s embarrassed by you, he doesn’t deserve you
Get some self-respect at first
You should be there for him not matter how much of an ass he is. Go as yourself and if he gets mad tell him “do you want to make this day about what I’m doing or do you want to go out there and celebrate and have me there with you” he’s the one that gets to choose who’s going to be the center of attention not you.
He wants you to be someone that you are not, so you should not be present at his graduation.
You give him 2 options. You come wearing what you want being who you are or you dont come at all. Honestly if he went with the second one and doesn't come around, i understand this being hard, but I'd cut him out. Its not up to you its up to him to not be shitty and other you. This is not your responsibility to be someone else for his 'big day'. You are you and that is not negotiable. ❤️❤️
Honey people are going to be mad at you for stupid things.  You can’t live your life for them.   I know you love your brother and don’t want him mad at you but it you giving in to him will just make him think he can do it to you all the times.  Sometimes we have to let people be mad at us.
self love is much more important than anything else.. yourself deserve to be respected by you and loved..no one should sacrifice their own hapiness for others even if they were our loved ones.. in order to make people around you happy, you should make yourself happy first.
Philadelphia huh, don't dismiss your brother without talking it out throughly.

My advice would be to ask your brother how important it is that you present yourself as something you are not at his graduation, but before that do some reflection on how important it is to you on a scale of 1-10 to be yourself on that day, 10 being critical for your wellbeing, 1 being you don't care at all. If both of you are 10 or very similar, ask him if there is some compromise, for example show him the different clothes and makeup you want to wear if anything is acceptable to him. If he says 5 and you say 9 then he should accept that it is more important to you and if a true brother he will accept you for who you are, even at ""his day"".

If you can't reach a compromise then tell him exactly how you feel about it, that even though he consider it ""his day"", this is also **your life** and as brother and sister you don't owe each other anything but love and support, there is no ""owing"", only friendship and love.

If that is unacceptable to him then at least you know where you stand, and can then choose not to go with a perfectly good conscience and nothing left unsaid.
My younger brother misgendered me when wishing me a happy birthday, which was 3 months into HRT and 1 month after I started presenting as female in public.

I told him I appreciate him congratulating me, but I reminded him I’m Eva now. He ignored me.

I sent him a message again, and he told me he's uncomfortable calling me by my name, and he doesn’t see me as a woman. I told him that I understand my transition must be hard on others, but there is no point in congratulating me on my birthday in a way that will only hurt me. I understand people will still slip up sometimes, but I at least expect them to try.

He refused to even try, so I told him I rather we don’t communicate anymore, because it’s too painful for me. This was a bit over a year ago, and we haven’t talked since.

He had a child a few months later. I’m sad I can’t be in the child's life, as I was so excited being an aunt. But I refuse to be seen as a mentally ill uncle. It’s too painful.

You may feel like you’re doing this to your family, but it’s them who don’t accept and support you. Your brother has made the decision that you shouldn’t show up at his graduation as your true self. So I hope you won’t go anyway and adhere to his demands. Please respect yourself. It will be difficult to cut ties with family, but you can’t live up to their expectations, and you shouldn’t fight for acceptance and validation of people who don’t readily give it.

Surround yourself with people who love you and accept you the way you are. That’s what I did. I can yell you that you will be much happier for it.

Your brother may come around when he’s ready, or he may never will. Please don’t wait for him, and just continue living your life. This is YOUR life. You don’t owe anyone your presence, especially not if you have to show up as anything less than your true and authentic self.
Ik it might be controversial but I would just wear something that is „normal“ in his eyes not only to just stop any arguments that could come up if you didn’t but to not embarrass him. Idk your brother so I can only judge from this post but he seems to see you as a male and probably all of his friends and classmates too cause he is probably also speaking of you in school as if u where a male which means everyone is expecting you to present yourself as one. And when you would show up with a dress it would be weird for everyone who expected something else. I think if you would 100% pass it wouldn’t be that much of a problem sadly for most people it’s a long and hard process which takes several years (I am also far from passing for now). So for the sake of your brother I would do it just once so he’s happy and you don’t “embarrass” him infront of his classmates. don’t wanna offend you with that post I think it’s just the best approach most people here run with the head through the wall without caring for anybody but themselves and expect everyone to be ok with everything they do which isn’t the case most of the time and can ruin completely fine relationships
I agree. I wouldn't go to a graduation for someone who doesn't give me minimum respect.
Yeah, fuck this shit. Why even bother if he's still not supporting her
This.
Easier said than done with family. It can be such a difficult struggle, and I don't envy anyone who has to go through it.
Fr. Yuck. Sounds like a non-family member.
Being a woman *is* normal.
If I do go and don’t end up presenting female I might wear something like a neon pink outfit just to be that person and call more attention to myself then if I had just worn a dress.
Having a good brother is wonderful, don't dismiss your family members without talking it thoroughly, if they can't accept you for who you are then it is not your fault, and then it is healthy to cut them out of your life so to not suffer negative influence that over time become more and more unbearable or worse.It seems to me that the brother is relative open minded, but he doesn't take his sister seriously at all, this is a huge problem that if ever they are to have good relationship they need to talk it out and the brother understand that this is as serious as it can get, it's his sisters true identity and as a brother he should accept her without any hesitation. If he doesn't then yeah don't bother at all, at least she did her part to salvage the sibling relationship, this is a crossroad that will determine if they will continue as friends or not, it's not to be taken lightly imo.
Some people wanna watch the world burn, and those are the people I like. You go, girl!
Neon pink ladies’ suit? Hey, it’s not a dress! It’s a suit!"	12d2ptz	trans	544	0.99	2023-04-06 00:04:37
Possible Trans Daughter/Son?	"Hello Sub! 
My 8 year assigned female at birth, has lately been saying they wish they were a boy. It’s not surprising and a piece a me has sort of known for awhile now (mother’s intuition). I’ve been reading books on the subject and trying. We’ve started going through their fashion choices and pick out clothes that make them feel more confident and have always encouraged hobbies regardless of their geared towards gender. I guess I’m wondering what words you wished you heard growing up about your identity? My child definitely seeks words of affirmation and I’d like to have some wonderfully affirming things in my back pocket. Just trying to be the best supportive parent I can.
Grateful to anyone who takes the time to read this!  
Edit: it’s almost 11pm my time and I have work in the morning. I’m trying to respond to each person in both my messages and comments. Thank you to everyone who’s called me a good mother, I’m trying but even I’m not perfect. There are still mornings where I have to yell “get your butt in gear or we’re going to be late!”  
R/trans, y’all are wild, I expected this to get like 2 whole comments. The support, ugh I can’t even my damn heart might explode.  


Edit 2: I woke up to so many supportive comments and messages this morning I’m still trying to go through them and reach out to each person who took the time to respond. Two wonderful websites were shared with me that so far seem great and frankly I wish I had them earlier. I just want to list the links just in case any other parents of cool kids stumble across this post.   
pflag.org  
mykidisgay.com"	"The most important thing you can do is let them know you will always love and support them no matter what, and encourage and support them exploring their gender to find what feels right. Be sure they know there’s no pressure, and you’ll love them whether they’re a girl or a boy or non-binary or agender or anything else. Knowing they have you there for them and helping them as they try to figure this out will make all the difference in the world.
Heck.  I don’t think you need advice.  I think you should give advice.  Sounds like you’re doing a great job. Just keep loving your kid no matter what name or pronouns they end up using. The world isn’t always kind.  They’re lucky to have a supportive mom.
I would add, and I’m guessing I don’t need to say this but, it’s also how you treat people other than your own child. Set an example. Never talk badly of others. Always show compassion. Keep an open mind. When they know you to be a kind sole, they will seek your counsel. Then simply be there with them in the moment. You’re doing great!
Sounds like you're already doing a great job. I think the best things you can say to them is that you'll always love and support them for who they are and whatsoever. They are lucky to have such a considerate mother!
I mean I know that people are always worried that their parents won’t accept them, which I get because my parents always seemed okay with trans people but were less okay when I was that trans people.  
There’s not a lot to help with that I suppose, but perhaps finding age appropriate media with trans people and talk about how you see them as strong and brave.  Like I know there are drag queens that read books to kids at libraries (or live streams or YouTube).  I don’t know a lot of child friendly media that has trans actors though.
Another idea could be using pretend play to explore their thoughts on it and show your support.  Like saying you’re going to play a pretend superhero game and they can pick any name they want, like __ or __ or __ , giving them typically male/female/neutral names.  Then support them with whatever they pick and have some fun.  I did this with kid at my UU church and asked them if they wanted to be the villian or the superhero and then what name they wanted and they immediately chose a name that was the opposite of their assigned gender.  
Speaking of UU, idk if you’re religious at all but UU churches are typically a safe and affirming place for gender nonconforming kids.  I was raised Catholic and switched to UU after experiencing transphobia at church.  So idk making sure that if you participate in religion that the religion is specifically accepting of gnc kids.
I'm not sure if you've done this with your kid yet, but you could always just sit down and talk to them about transgender people and what it means to be transgender. Giving your child the language to express how they feel is really important. Side note, it really warms my heart to see you being so open to your kid about this. You're doing a great job and I wish you the best :)
it makes me so happy to see loving parents. you are already doing so great believe me. the most important thing is being open and affirming which you already are. and you come here to ask a whole community! don’t hesitate to do so in the future, especially when you want advice and resources regarding the medical stuff. i wish you and your kid all the best 💖
Hi umm in my case I am the child. My mother usually knows a lot about me. And like you said ….mothers instinct ….. but she said that she never got any signals indicating that I am a “girl”!! FYI: she is pretty open minded so just wanna say that she is not transphobic or anything. 

I never told my mom when I was young and only at the age of 13 did I get some signs and I’m currently not sure also.
Try asking them about pronouns and name and seeing if they want to experiment with it.
You sound like you're doing the right things! I'm not a parent nor a parenting expert but I think just being supportive! You said your child seeks words of affirmation, so ask them what compliments they're comfortable with (for example, they might not like cute or they might prefer handsome - you know your child best so you might already know these things, just a suggestion!).
You sound like a great mother tbh
I started wishing I was a girl since 11. Turns out I’m trans! Doesn’t always mean their trans if they say that. I hear some of my friends who are girls say they wish they were guys because they liked the culture and privilege
Try to notice how you talk about other people who transition or are gender-non-conforming or what other people wear or act like. When I was a kid before I knew I was trans or came out my parents would talk about how people who got surgery were mutilating their body and that made me think that's how they would think I'd I came out (it kind of was how they thought - they've changed for the better now). In general, express tolerance and non-judgement for how anyone regardless of their difference to you acts, as long as their not hurting anyone. 

I would have appreciated also if my parents initiated hard conversations directly with me. Often they'd ask my sister behind my back, ""hey is x gay? Is x trans?"" And my sister would tell them that even if she did know, she wouldn't spill my secrets, and that my parents should talk to me directly if they were concerned. Even when I did come out, my parents especially my mom never really asked me what I wanted or needed or how they could help me or how they could be better learners, it was always up to me to have the hard conversations with them otherwise they'd awkwardly ignore the topic.

Show a personal commitment to apologizing when you get things wrong and being open to correction or conversation.

It sounds like you're already on the right track, and as long as you keep and open and willing to learn mind I think you'll do just fine:) I'm sure your kid already appreciates the love you show them
I wish I had learned about trans people when I was growing up. My family is supportive, but I wasn't taught about these things and happened to manage to not encounter it in the wild, so I never knew it was possible to be anything other than what I was born as. Took me 20 years to find my true self as a result
Other commenters already covered pretty much everything I was going to say but a have a few recommendations 

Jack not Jackie- picture book about a trans boy

Ridley Jones- kids show with a canon non-binary main character (Fred the bison)

And if you're a reader I suggest ""Being Jazz: My Life as a (transgender) Teen"" it's an autobiography and a good book about growing up transgender. It's really insightful but it's definitely a book for you and not your kid lol :)
gratz on the boy
Better parenting than most people here received mate...keep it up!
If your 8yo does say he's trans dont ask him questions please 
I get really scared when someone that is cis asks me about trans because even doe im trans i wanna be treated like every female i dont anna be that transgender girl i just wanna be that girl so its really scary and dysphoric when soeone starts asking me questions
You’re doing a great job and I wish my mom had let me express myself this way when I was growing up. I would just let your kid know that no matter you love them and let them continue expressing themselves the way they feel fit. With clothes, hair, activities etc. 
Maybe ask them if they would prefer to be called handsome instead etc. 

But other than that I don’t think you need to have any sort of talk with them. I’m sure they’ll figure it out on their own. Just knowing you love and support them will be enough 💕
No matter my age I’d want my parents and other family members to listen and be open, and to explore trans topics, for example through reading, watching films/documentaries, attending PFLAG or other groups, etc.
I'd say keep doing what you're doing. Don't rush into it, but I can say that I'm almost 100% sure that she's gonna end up as a he for at least a little while at some point. (Trying out the pronoun, I mean.) Ever since I was 4 I've been saying those things, and now I'm living full time as myself.
i was very similar as a kid- in terms of affirmation, and experimenting, vary the terms you use to compliment them!! when i was little, hearing that i looked handsome boosted me like nothing else. they’re lucky to have a parent like you in their corner :)
 
edit- also try and speak kindly of others- hearing my parents say transphobic things in passing prevented me from coming out to them for several years, despite knowing they would still love me. the things you say affect your little ones!! i wish you and your kid happiness and health :^)
I'm glad ur a supportive parent just tell ur kid that they're valid and u love them for being who they are make sure to respect their pronouns and name choice also try not to comment on their body like if they shaved before and they stop shaving don't mention anything about it unless they bring it up honestly u seem like ur doing fine as is just keep telling them they have your support thru their transition and ull do fine
Even being knowledgeable on the subject is amazing and a huge step. Your kid is lucky whether they’re trans or not <3 everyone else has said this but really just letting them know you’re here for them and having open conversations about it is good. Remember that this is about them not you, even though you might be inclined to don’t remind them of what they’ll have to go through if they’re trans, just keep it positive. Oh and use they/them pronouns until they let you know what they rather!
I absolutely love when parents come here to seek knowledge to help their children. No one is perfect, but being this supportive means that whatever mistake you make is made in genuine good faith. 

When your child grows up, they will remember that you encouraged and supported them from the start. If they do come out as trans/ non binary/ any other gender identity, your staunch support will make all the difference.

I like the idea of letting your child picking the clothes that make them feel more comfortable. Let them explore at their pace, maybe put them in contact with a therapist specialised in LGBTQ+ care? 

Also, be prepared to defend your child from people who say stuff like ""a lady should..."" And ""a good girl should..."". I hate that kind of stuff with a *passion*. If anyone said anything of the sort to my child, be assured that the knives would come out!
You're handling this like a champ. Only advice is tell them often how much you love them. Affirm their choices. Let them cycle through labels and just show you're trying. 

That's all any kid wants. You're doin' great
""No matter what, I won't judge you"" is something I think would be nice.
Knowing that you are there for them and will support them no matter their choices is the best thing you can do. Just let them take it at their own pace with no pressure.
No one is perfect and everyone can and will make mistakes, but as long as you are there to love and support them will be plenty to help them through.
You're doing great I'm sure, and this has made my day to read. Keep up the good work!
i fucking wish you were my mom, one of the best moms right here
I always recommend that parents of trans people go to PFLAG or some similar group for families. Your best resource is usually other parents of trans people. There is much misinformation on the internet, unfortunately.

https://pflag.org/
You've gotten tons of great advice already, just wanted to say that it's lovely you've supported your kid this way. Whoever they decide they are will be okay in the end because they have you.
You already seem like your helping them really well just remember to tell them it's ok to be a boy a girl or something in the middle and that you'll love them no matter what
Well what do you need advice in?
Please let them know youre supportive all the way through. As someone who is FtM my biggest regret was not telling my parents sooner out of fear of rejection. If i had told them sooner i couldve gotten on puberty blockers (which are totally reversable dw) and that wouldve saved me a lot of money and pain.
Ask them questions. Ask about what their experience is like. Ask clarifying questions. Your child will be the utmost expert on what they're going through, and at least for me, someone being invested and actively wanting to talk to me about it would have been amazing. It's often easy to say ""you can talk to me about anything"" but making the effort to reach out can still be really hard for kids (and adults)
That you'll love them no matter what, now or later whatever decisions they make to help themselves feel happy will make you happy too. My parents always bring up so many what ifs about my life later on, when for 18 years I've been miserable and I care about now. The best you can do is let them know you love them.
100% upvoted, new record
Maybe its in here, this is a lot to scroll, has the actual term come up? My house hold was pretty open sexually growing up and yet I STILL never heard of the term transgender/ transsexual which gave me a LOT of un needed anxiety!
I’d suggest asking your child if they want to be referred to as a boy and if they want a boy name instead. If your child feels more comfortable with this try using son and he/him pronouns. Be sure to let your child know even if they don’t feel like a guy at some point you’ll be there and help them thru their adventure.
Thanks! I’m trying, they’re still a kid so when I say I love you no matter what I get “ugh mom, I know!”. I appreciate you taking the time.
Definitely this. I know there are a lot of adult trans folx here who wish their parents were this supportive from the start. Myself included. So yeah, you’re on the right track. Keep learning, and buckle up. This will be such an amazing growth experience for both of you which will hopefully be another way for you to bond, rather than forcing you apart. But just remember that’s because of you and how you’re choosing to respond with love here. That’s huge. Thank you for doing what not all parents are able to do.
I understand completely. I grew up in a weirdly religious household and wasn’t really told the basic things like “I love you” as a kid. It’s why I struggle with it now as an adult and am looking for ways or examples I can use since I’m not great with it.
Thank you, this is some great advice. I’m not a raging Karen but I probably could be kinder to others (truthfully with the rona we’re not out as much and interacting with others). Regardless I should probably be more mindful about my actions.
Finding age appropriate media with great trans characters is a STRUGGLE. We have a trans neighbor who we like a ton and always chat with (we love her dog). But I’m not sure if I’d bring up “ya know Liz was born a boy”, because we’ve just always known them as our sweet neighbor Liz and I don’t want to negate how they want themselves viewed. When I was pregnant I was convinced I was having a boy and so they lucked out with a gender ambiguous name at birth. But I like that idea of almost gender roleplaying when we’re doing legos and stuff. I’m a pagan weirdo these days so we don’t really participate in organized religion but that warms my heart that you found a congregation that was so welcoming and loving.
I’ve tried to have a pretty basic conversation with them. “Sometimes people are just born in the wrong body ….. etc”. I’m new to this (trans identities) and am just learning the right language myself! But honestly giving them the tools to explain how they’re feeling is important. I’m just going to have to figure out how to do that. 😅
This is pretty new for us, my kid has been a tomboy for awhile and recently told me they wished they were a boy. So while I don’t have any problems with things like hormone blockers I’m going to let it ride until they tell me they want something like that (though I’m going to start to educate myself on how to give them the language to express it like another commenter suggested!) So far this sub has been so wonderful with this post. I expected like 5 people tops would comment on it. Y’all are great <3
I’m glad you have an open minded parent! I don’t know if they’ll stick with this or not but I just didn’t want to take the chance that this was a “phase” and brush off who they are as a person. If they change their mind next week or in 5 years I’ll roll with it too. Gender is super fluid so it’s okay to not be sure! It also doesn’t help that for so long we’ve “gendered” basic interests like baking or automotive interests instead of letting kids be kids. I’m not sure how old you are but I really didn’t get a firm grasp of who I was as a person until my mid 20’s and even now sometimes it changes!
We have! They really like they/them. I’ve been trying to be very consistent with it for a couple months now (the conversation came up just after thanksgiving)
And also what words to describe in general. Do they prefer to be called your child? Your son? Do they still like daughter? What about... I dont know the word, names... I know I always loved ""kiddo"" because it was so gender neutral, stuff like that. These things should be discussed and implemented when possible :]
We haven’t discussed genders in depth yet, at this point we’re at “how can we feel best about ourselves” and right now that is mostly choice to dress more masculine. Whatever they pick I’ll roll with it.
We have a neighbor we see often (my kid loves her dog) who is Trans. She’s one of the few non-nutjobs in my “conservative” area so we get along well. Always treated her with the kindness and respect that we try to show anyone.
There’s tons of queer folk in my life but besides my neighbor (who I like but I wouldn’t say we’re besties), I don’t have a lot of trans people in my life which is why I turned to this subreddit.
And I’ll try and do the hard conversations. When I enrolled them in pre-k it’s like a switch got flicked in their brain and suddenly they became a “tomboy”. This past thanksgivingish they divulged to me that they wanted to be a boy. We discussed that sometimes people are just born in the wrong body, and that when I was pregnant I was convinced they were going to be a boy so maybe that was just the case. They agreed and thought that was it and we’ve just started this. So this is quite new for me and I’ll have to suck it up and learn how to have those hard talks.
Another commenter had messaged me privately with the title of a great book about gender identities so it’s on my list. Truthfully I don’t think my kid knew trans was an option either. A couple of months back when we were just spending time they mentioned that they just wished they were a boy because they didn’t feel like a girl. After some conversations we’ve rolled with it. Unfortunately we don’t know a whole lot of trans folks and age appropriate media with trans characters has been a struggle to find. Another commenter mentioned giving them language tools to help describe what they want with their gender so I’ve got to start educating myself on just how to be their true self.
Thanks! Love ‘em no matter what!
This is a wonderful suggestion! I’ll admit I struggle to keep the questions to a minimum, at 8 they just don’t have the language tools. I’ll try and be a more mindful of how I ask questions and how often.
Another commenter also suggested the use of the word “handsome” and I feel like a bonehead for not thinking of it earlier. Now that two people independently suggested it, it just confirms that it’s a great idea!
I’m not someone who speaks poorly about transpersons, I did go through a bit of a man-hating kick so I’m definitely going to have to make sure I chose my words carefully and not say anything of the matter around them.
They’re not quite at that age yet but I will def keep that in mind, thank you!
We talked pronouns and they chose they/them. We’ve been trying to consistently use em for a couple of months now.
I recently booked an appointment but it’s MONTHS out for excepting new patients and it seemed like younger kids might be stuck towards the bottom of the totem pole in terms of priority. Which is okay in our case, they aren’t in a household where they have to worry about their safety.
I’m trying to let them take the reigns. Just absorbing a lot of the wonderful websites and resources people have given.
Hello sorry I’m not super great at Reddit. I just updated my post. I would just like to know what words you heard or might have been told that were reaffirming to your identity? Also Dang! Thanks for the fast reply.
No I haven’t used the term transgender/transsexual yet. This is still pretty new for me and we just started on how to make them more comfortable in their own body. I don’t know a whole lot about gender identities (yet) but I’ve got messages with a ton of books for me to pick up and read. Once I can get a better understanding we’ll start using the technical terms. I just don’t want to throw out the wrong terminology and possibly confuse them.
Well that’s kids for you. :) but remember that you can show them that love by just supporting them. If they want to try different clothes, or hairstyles, or pronouns, or names, if they see you helping them do that every step of the way, the love will come across.
Thanks! I’m really trying. Having a small person is tricky and I just don’t want to screw them up.
Yeah.  That’s also what I grew up with too. I’d say then just don’t over do it.  Sometimes worrying about saying the right thing, or doing the right thing, especially when you didn’t grow up with a good example of what that looks like it can cause you to overcompensate.  When I was eight I would have wanted to be loved and treated like any other eight year old boy.  I’d say maybe just try out using he for them randomly.  If they smile real big you might have a son.
Yeah telling your kid that your neighbor is trans would be weird unless Liz wanted that to happen.  Have you talked to her about your kid at all? She might have some ideas too, or want to share her story with them.  

There’s a book on Amazon that’s 3+ called Who Are You that’s a gender identity guide for kids[here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1785927280/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_183JBEZXGW6QYJ03A29N?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
I bought it for a friend who said her kid was going through something similar and she said it was great. 

Not surprised to hear you’re pagan at all.  Like half the people at my church, including the religious Ed director, are pagan, and they’re all so accepting and amazing.
I'm really glad to hear that, it sounds like you're doing everything you need to be doing. It makes me so happy to see people like you doing this kind of thing.
It should definitely be their choice, yes - but it may also be a good idea to mention it in case they don't know those exist. I'd also make sure they know that if they want to be a boy, they can be. It's distressingly common how often trans kids don't know they can be trans and so just have feelings of ""I wish I could be [x], too bad I can't""
of course! there is no rush and there is also no „requirement“ to do anything medical at all if your child does not want to - as long as they know their options and all the consequences. some of my friends who are trans did not transition medically at all. there is also a lot in between being a trans woman or trans man. I identify as non binary despite being read as a man now - there really is no right way to be trans. this journey does not have to be a tragic one, it can be pretty exciting and liberating for everyone involved. you sound like a very considerate person to me :)
That was really helpful. I am 17 years old. As of now I was planning to tell my mom about my other mental health issues and I actually feel kinda angry that my mom didn’t catch this because she knows me well and during the pandemic I stopped doing everything and I really felt that she should have know but nonetheless what happened happened. As of now I am planning to just tell her I want professional help from a therapist or something. A general therapist and then I eventually maybe if I get comfortable with them I’ll tell them about my gender. 

If it’s possible can I chat with you about something? I need advise from someone who is a parent.
They like being called gremlin lol. As they’re discovering themselves and choosing to dress more masculine I’ve just been saying something generic like “cool outfit”. I hadn’t really thought of using “gendered” adjectives like handsome. That is a really great idea!
It will be hard (hence the name hard convos) but I promise those convos will be worth it. Your kid will feel supported and listened to, you'll learn more about all this trans stuff and about how to help your kid, and it will draw you two closer. And you'll show that you can handle potential awkwardness and you won't let that awkwardness or lack of knowledge you may have be a barrier in living your child. 

And if you have a trans neighbor, maybe invite her for dinner sometime? Ask if she's comfortable talking to your kid and being a support who may know a little of whatever they're going through. It could be good to ask the other queer people in your life too, they may not know trans stuff specifically but they will know stuff about possibly realizing you're queer and exploring identity and supporting one another.

I wish you the best of luck and I hope your kid can see how much you love them, because we on this subreddit can definitely tell <3
Oh another good thing I think, is when/if you meet other LGBT people is to ask for pronouns, etc. It will be something that your kid will pick up on, and they’ll know that their parents are a safe space and support the community.
That's alright I'm glad I could help I'm also glad they're gunna grow up with such a supportive parent most of us trans/non-binary kids aren't as lucky so it's nice and refreshing to see a parent making an effort
thats great! i'm glad they're comfortable enough to talk about that with you
Probably just that you love  them and that no matter who they are you will support them. Maybe ask if they’d like to use he/him pronouns for a bit to try it out?
Thats fair, certainly a balance! Good luck, you seem to have quite a handle on this situation ♡
I’m certainly not the expert on this, but I’d guess it’s pretty close to impossible to raise a child to adulthood without some bumps along the way. You’re going to screw something up, no matter how hard you try or how pure your intentions are. But the difference is, those screw ups are things you can work through together, instead of allowing them to fester and have more long-term negative effects. As long as you approach even those obstacles with the same love and tender humility this post displays, you’re setting yourself AND your child up for a much happier and mutually beneficial relationship—through their whole life. Which is such a beautiful thing many trans children (and just children in general) are unfortunately denied.
I’m definitely going to get that book! While we like Liz enough to say help her shovel her driveway but I’m not that close. And I’ll admit I might feel weird just being like “hey Liz! I know your trans, talk to my kid about it!”. It might just be the background I grew up in, where if you were different you kept that to yourself so I feel strange diving that deep into someone’s personal business, ya know?
I hope that it works out! You sound like a wonderful parent!
Probably the best idea
They recently said they liked the “they/them”. I still slip up on occasion (old habits die hard) but I’m really trying. Every time I’ve got to toss a quarter in the swear jar so I feel I’ll break the habit hopefully soon since I’m making a conscious effort.
maybe instead of asking something that direct just open up about your struggles to her? like, don't ask for help just talk to her. that will leave it to her, if she wants to get involved or help.
It sounds like you’re doing amazing. You are a good parent"	sb8rv9	trans	528	0.99	2022-01-24 00:43:30
Can trans men be lesbians?	"Having this argument on here and I want to make sure I'm not ignorant. As far as I know, using lesbian as a trans man is not only transphobic to yourself and other trans men, but an insult to lesbians aswell. I get that other people might want to use that identity, and of course, I'm not gonna argue to you on a personal level if you and your trans man partner are fine with it, but i find it much more disrespectful than not.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. I want to know what you guys think

EDIT: Ok thanks, it seems most of the responses agree with me. I did not expect this to be so controversial either way. Thank you all for commenting"	"[deleted]
Im non-binary AMAB. I am attracted to women exclusively and I am transitioning to be fem other than bottom surgery. Idk what to call myself.
I dislike the perspective of *”It doesn’t matter, people can identify with whichever label they want”* when labels have actual, solid meaning behind them— *especially* in the LGBTQ+ community. If it was a cisgender man identifying as a lesbian, everybody would go batshit crazy— but because it’s a trans man, it’s fine all of the sudden and people don’t care how he identifies? 

Wake up. Men can’t be lesbians. I am saying this as a trans man. Trans-masculine individuals? They can be lesbians. However, trans men that are exclusively binary? No way.
man this is the third post like this i've see this week alone and all it does is instigate arguments and in-fighting in the community. this isn't the kind of broad sweeping question that needs to get debated on a huge public forum because everybody is going to have a different answer and reasoning for that answer. what happened to people's identities just being whatever makes them the most comfortable? some people feel better having rigid or traditional labels, and some don't. (and before you throw rocks at me, i am speaking as a trans guy who does lean towards the former. if i dated a woman i would be their exceedingly handsome heterosexual boyfriend.) you can't control how somebody else chooses to identify! and it's unfair to blame an individual and how they label themselves for ""confusing cis people"" and ""making it more difficult for us to get accepted,"" which is another argument i see too much of in online spaces. who cares as long as the person in question isn't intentionally trying to harm someone?
What’s the relationship with transmasc lesbians and he/him butches?
I’m not a lesbian, I’m a (trans) man which makes me straight
no, men cannot be lesbians
Im transmasc non-binary and I’m
a lesbian 🤷 words are just words and it’s my own identity it doesn’t really need anyone else’s approval it’s a bit strange to be so conserned with someone else life
Can't wait for the day that someone makes a post like this with one single ounce of awareness about the long, long history of overlap between trans men and lesbian communities. For some people (definitely not all), those identities are hard to disentangle. There's nuance to this, people. The immediate ""absolutely not, because men can't be lesbians"" reaction tells me you haven't spent much time with transmasc lesbians or older trans men.

I'm not going to argue with people about this because it's exhausting, but PLEASE read Stone Butch Blues. Please read Female Husbands. The answer is complicated because human beings and their experiences are complicated. As queer and trans people, we of all people should understand that.
If I remember correctly, lesbians are people that identify as females and are attracted to females. So if a trans man is attracted to a female, that would make him heterosexual, if that's the right word.
This question gets posted like 5 times every day. The answer is that it doesn’t matter. If a trans man is a lesbian it’s none of my business, it doesn’t affect me
It's not our place to police other trans people's identities. If a trans man calls himself a lesbian, that's up to him, not up to anyone else. 

Also, especially in a historical context, there is so much overlap between lesbian and transmasculine communities, that policing this entirely disregards our history.
I dunno, it's kinda just not my business, you know?

The most I can say is it seems like a lot of the takes that are happening forget about people who are either gender fluid or otherwise experience multiple genders, allowing a person to be a man while not being restricted only to that
As a trans man, no, we can’t be lesbians. We are men. It doesn’t matter if you use the definition of a woman who is attracted to other women, or non-men loving non men, trans men are men and so we can’t be lesbians. Trans masc people and some non-binary people can be though.
I don’t understand it, but I try to mind my own business with things like this tbh. As long as they don’t push those labels onto other people (like calling other trans men lesbians), I just kinda ignore it
No. He’s a man. Trans man means he’s a man. Lesbians are femme/female attracted to other women or whatever
correct or not, who cares what people call themselves?
In my opinion, limiting people's labels does more harm than good.
No, men can't be lesbians why is this even a discussion?????
Lol
Tbh this is so nuanced I don’t even know. A full on trans man, probably not, but there is a whole gender spectrum and there are people who are transmasc or transfemme. People who use multiple pronouns. Trans and enby people who have different transition goals. This also isn’t just a lesbian issue? What about people who are enby or transfemme but feel like a part of the gay male community?
I really wish people would stop trying to say how another person can identify...

As a trans man, I don't think it's affecting anyone when a trans man decides to identify as a lesbian HIMSELF. If we're calling ALL trans men who are attracted to women lesbian, that would be an issue. If it's just this dude who may have used the label before his egg cracked and he still wants to keep using it or something like that, who tf cares? Why do people seriously think they have a say in how other people identify? Maybe it doesn't make sense to you, that doesn't mean go out of your damn way and say ""no you can't be this"". It's not affecting other trans men and lesbian people (because nonbinary people can be lesbian too, not just women) for a trans man to to call himself a lesbian. 

Like, I don't understand trans women who call themselves femboys, that doesn't mean I'm going to say ""no you can't be a femboy"". Do I get WHY they would want to identify that way? No. Is it my place to say they can't use that label? Hell no!

If you are reading this, whether you are OP or not, if you really think someone calling themselves a label that doesn't make sense to you is affecting you even if they aren't calling YOU that, please seek some help because that's a you issue, my friend. :)
as long as someone is using it in good faith, i see no reason to deny someone a label that works for them. The key thing here is ""in good faith"" (i.e. someone ""sexually identifying as an attack helicopter"" does not count.) It's tricky to tell who is in good faith, but it's better to err on the side of letting folks choose their preferred label. Who is really harmed if someone who doesn't exactly identify as a woman calls themselves a lesbian? I would argue no harm is done.
Look— who cares. Gender identity is complicated. It isn’t my (or anyone else’s) place to say how other queer people can identify. 

I personally would find it insulting, but I have a pretty simple relationship with my gender and sexuality.

For some people, that relationship is NOT simple. If they’re comfortable and happy with how they’re identifying, I don’t see how anyone else’s opinion matters.
I dont see how its transphobic? But by definition, if you are a man, and you like women....you arent a lesbian?

Transgendered or not. 

By that logic im straight as heck (transgirl) and not gay AF (cause lesbian)
Personally no.. most people will agree that if your a trans man then you are a man.. which means that you aren’t a lesbian if your attracted to women, you’re straight. That’s why trans women who find men attractive arent considered gay.. because they are women
When it comes to identity, the way that an individual identifies reigns supreme. If you are FtM and want to be called a lesbian, I think you can have at it. 

Gender contains so many different facets. Some people might genuinely desire to present as one gender socially and another gender sexually. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with a FtM individual still wanting to be femme in the bedroom and, therefore, considering “lesbian” as their sexual orientation. 

Yes, calling a FtM person a lesbian when they don’t identify as such is incredibly transphobic. But I don’t see the problem with a trans man choosing to identify as a lesbian.
Labels are for communication, if a trans man feels that the term lesbian best communicates how they feel, then who are we to judge them?
I hate this post. Trans men calling themselves lesbians causes absolutely zero harm to trans men or lesbians. The whole point of being trans is rejecting gender conformity and if you think someone else's identity invalidates yours, you need to seek therapy. Policing other people's identities should have no place on the LGBTQ community.
Couldn't care less if a trans guy wanted to identity that way, it's their choice, not like they're hurting anyone
Trans masc are not the same as trans men. But trans men are men therefore cannot be ledbians. About out of the clpset trans men calling themselves lesbians well it's up to them still it can be criticism the way you can critize a cis man a cis man calling themselves as lesbian.

 The hitical argument is not a good one, a lot of trans history is the was it is because most of it is hella sad, trans men being referring as lesbians and trans women being referend as gay males it's a sad port of history not an happy one, the overlap happens because ptherization and designation it's not something we should celebrate.

Amd yes I think trans men calling themselves lesbians is transphobic and perpetuates cisexism even among trans people we are not robots social trends and countries afects us or other people. If we want to make progress as a comunity critizong that tipe of stuff is healthy.
Here's the deal: labels are complicated but extremely important to some people. 

The widely known definition of lesbian is a woman attracted to women. Some people have interpreted it as simply the exclusion of men, so anyone who isn't a man attracted to anyone who isn't a man. I think the difference between those is kinda like people saying bisexual means you like two genders vs. saying it means you like more than one gender. Kinda the same thing, but distinctly different for a group of people who use the term.

If a person identifies as a lesbian, exists in lesbian spaces, has lesbian friends, and feels a sense of community and belonging in that label, they still may choose to use it if they come out as trans. This person may not feel safe or comfortable dating in hetero spaces.

On that same note, if a lesbian is in a relationship with a trans man before they come out as trans, they do not have to change their identifying label just because they decide to stay with their partner. Their attraction is limited to women and the one man they are partnered with. If their relationship ended, the lesbian would only want to date women or fem people, so one relationship should not force them to change their sexual orientation.

There is also that some women who like women or afab people don't see trans men as men. They see us as butch or masc lesbians. They include trans men in their attraction based on a transphobic idea. That is much different than someone identifying as lesbian but then their partner comes out as trans. 

So, can trans men be lesbians? Maybe? Maybe not? Technically, it's kinda grey and just depends on how that person feels most comfortable identifying. And just because they identify that way, that doesn't mean any particular cis lesbian or trans fem lesbian has to be attracted to them. Honestly, as long as everyone is respectful of others, it shouldn't matter what label someone uses for their sexuality (unless it's people fetishizing or otherwise being creepy to lgbtq+ people or anyone else).
There’s definitely some overlap in the lesbian and ftm community but at the end of the day, trans men are MEN. Lesbian means non-men loving non-men. If you still feel a connection to the community well, that’s understandable but if you are a man, you can’t be a lesbian. I’m a gay ftm who used to see myself as a lesbian pre-transition, this was because I felt a connection to queer culture and didn’t understand just how I fit in just yet. Now I know who I am, I’m a man. Saying a man can be a lesbian points out that I’m not a “real man” and will always be seen as a woman.
No, men cannot be lesbians
No, trans men are men. If men like women then they are straight, point blank.
holy shit it took me going deep into the comments to realize i wasn't on r/actuallesbians with the amount of absolute ""no""s and enbyphobia sprinkled in. saying this as a tired lesbian who just wants to exist, these arguments are pointless. you aren't gonna convince a trans man to stop calling themselves a lesbian, you're just gonna make them feel bad. if it isn't you or affecting you it isn't your problem. can we just chill please??
Many trans men may have initially identified as lesbians before they became aware of their gender identity but I’m not aware of any trans men who keep the label after becoming aware of their gender identity and it’s transphobic to call a trans man a lesbian.
A man who is attracted to women is straight; heterosexual.
No. Trans men are MEN. Not nonbinary, not trans-masculine, but MEN. You should not view us differently than cis men when looking at our gender.

Lesbians are non-men who love other non-men. Trans men cannot be a lesbian.
(Trans Guy) I say no but if two lesbians get together and one of them comes out as trans then they can still be a relationship even if it looks like a hetero relationship. The girl can still identify as a lesbian but still love her partner. But if a trans guy tries to get with a lesbian women and vise versa then no. (If that makes any sense)
yes. they have a reason for identifying that way and their identity shouldn't be invalidated
if you are a trans man, no.

if you are trans masculine, yes. 

-a transmasc lesbian
Whats most disrespectful is trying to tell another trans person that the way they (trans) categorize them selves using cis terms is wrong. The terms arent made for us and arent gonna fit perfectly if a trans man wanna be a lesbian who cares
A fair number of trans men found community in the lesbian community before their egg cracked.  It makes sense that it is hard to leave that community behind.
yai def agree. trans men are men. a man cannot be a lesbian.
It's \*complicated.\*

Some trans men start out as members of the lesbian community. Some of those men, after transitioning, still have lots of strong ties to the community. On the one hand, those people are definitely men, so they're not lesbians in terms of their sexuality. But on the other hand, they may still be actively involved in and welcomed by the community. 

&#x200B;

There are also some transmasc enbies who identify as lesbians. There's nothing transphobic about that - usually such folks understand their lesbianism as being ""someone who's not a man who likes other people who aren't men.""
honestly i think it’s about what makes you as an individual comfortable and living with the knowledge that someone else’s label and identity has literally no bearing on your own life apart from maybe some confusion and initial upset before remembering that it really isn’t something to work yourself up about, because in the grand scheme of everything it really doesn’t matter. as a community we just need to band together and treat our own people with compassion and understanding. We will *never* move forwards to fight our oppressors if we can’t stop fighting each other.
If you're a binary trans man, no. You'd be straight. You might have a long history of being in lesbian spaces and an appreciation for it, but that's not your space anymore. If you're non binary it's more complicated I guess. 

Sapphic means non man attracted to non man, if you're a man you're not included in that.

You can't have it all. You can be a man or a lesbian.

I'm a gay trans man, I am not a stright girl, if I were to call myself straight while dating men, I'd get misgendered.
Trans**men** cannot be lesbians. 

Trans**mascs** *(****In this context.*** *people who are masc. leaning, but fall under the nonbinary umbrella)* can be lesbians.
I personally think people can identify and use any identifier they want.  BUT ...

If we want to be considered our target gender, so a trans man is just another way to be a man and a trans woman is just another way to be a woman,  I don't think we should lay claim to such identities.  This lessens the argument.  A cis het guy would only jokingly refer to himself as a lesbian, or use the term to insult another cis het guy.  The OP would become a trans het.  

The deeper I get into thinking about gender and attraction the more terms like homo, hetero, gay, lesbian, and bi make less sense to me.  They are just another label used to marginalize and categorize.  Be who you want to be, and love who you want to love.  Leave the labels and categories for the boomers and the conservative cis het people.
Honestly I really don’t like thinking about this question.

Pre-transition i was attracted to women in a very abstract, distant, They’re-Kinda-Hot-And-Also-Not-Men way. I was attracted to men too, but terrified of them.

Post transition, I have very little interest in men, and am attracted to women, except I’m only sexually attracted to women and not romantically d/t choosing to traumatize myself with TERF and detransitioner rhetoric in an attempt to snap me out of my “want to transition” phase. 

Problem is, my attraction to women…brings me a lot of dysphoria. Because there’s a part of me that screams “you’re a fuckin’ disaster sapphic oh my GOD” when I see a cute girl or think about my attraction to women…except I’m a trans man and that would make me straight, which…my brain just utterly rejects, period.

So…I kinda get it. I decidedly make it clear that I’m a trans *man*, and the way I experience my attraction brings me a lot of pain as a result, which makes a lot of these conversations uncomfortable, especially when I see things like “trans men who call themselves lesbians are insulting both lesbians AND themselves” or “trans men can’t be lesbians they’re just STRAIGHT and that’s FINE lel” (which should probably be my cue to unsubscribe from r/AreTheStraightsOK because…yeah apparently it’s NOT fine).
if someone explicitly identifies as a man, then they can’t be a lesbian, however if they are nonbinary then they can.
trans men cannot be lesbians, trans masc people can. use whatever labels you like and whatever but expect the repercussions with doing so. this is just my view as a trans guy who happens to be gay
Yo. Stop policing what people can and can’t call themselves. THAT’S what’s transphobic. If it’s not hurting you personally, mind your own damn business.
No, not at all. The literal definition of lesbian is someone who identifies as a woman, and who’s attracted to other women.
trans identities are complex by nature and everyone will experience being trans and gay differently. you should use whatever labels you want, especially if you want to get further from the binary. i love my butch transman lesbian friends.
Trying to work it out logically, I feel like there’s a conflict here if we define “lesbian” as “non-men loving non-men” then trans men cannot be lesbians as they are men.

However, I’ve heard from some trans men that they identify with the lesbian experience or have lived all their lives as a lesbian.

I would not be comfortable with any men in lesbian spaces and would feel disrespected and irritated if a trans men thought they should try to date me. It feels like they’re reducing sexuality down to having a vagina and that feels icky to me. But it’s also not really my place to tell someone what their sexual identity is. So I’m not sure how to resolve this personally. I don’t want to invalidate anyone’s identity, and nobody is forcing me to date a man, so I dunno maybe it’s just not my business what someone else calls themselves 🤷🏻‍♀️
Like, no, and I’m with you 100%. I’m also a big fan of staying out of the game of controlling other peoples crazy, so if I see a trans man identifying that way I just…mentally cross to the other side of the street and wish him the best. Like, fill your boots bro
I will actually catch myself saying I want a lesbian gf time to time then I realize I’m very masc presenting and may make other ppl feel uncomfortable. But I correct myself
if a particular trans guy who likes girls wants to call himself a lesbian, he can.
Fuck no. In fact, I'm honestly very fucking offended when lesbians swipe right on me on dating apps, I'm not a fucking woman, I'm a man seeking a god damn straight relationship, I will not date a lesbian, that is an insult to myself and my sexuality.
Yes they can. Idk why we are gatekeeping someone elses identity or WHY IT MATTERS. 

My labels are my choice and my business and other peoples opinions on those things are moot.
... I mean, labels are only there to 1) make it easy to communicate your identity in one word (saying ""I'm a lesbian"" instead of saying ""I'm a girl who is interested in girls""). And 2) to have a word you identify with (someone who is bisexual can have a community with people who also identify with the label ""bisexual"")

They're not classifications bound by rules. They're not set in stone. They're just words we use to describe ourselves, so is it so wrong for a trans man who used to call himself a lesbian continue to call himself a lesbian because the word still feels right for him? I mean, it's up for debate, but I would never tell a trans boy that he's not allowed in the lesbian community if that feels right for him. It's his choice, and his identity. It is none of my business.
Historically a large amount of trans men and trans masculine people were lumped in with lesbians and Identified as butch lesbian (see stone butch). Someone considering themselves a lesbian while also being trans masculine is not transphobic to themselves, rather they might of already been attached to the lesbian community pre-transition, or might be gender fluid or bi gender and be both men and women. The definition you see floating around of ""Non-men loving non-men"" is very new and far from universally accepted. Gender and Sexuality are complex, and people can do whatever they want with them, no one gets to decide how someone can or can not identify so long as the identity is in good faith.
you are completely correct- saying trans men can be lesbians is the most transphobic crap I've ever heard
If they're a trans man, and they're into women, they're heterosexual. While there are many trans masc/men that were formally lesbians, that label would be lost when they identify as a trans man. To view it otherwise would be to invalidate the argument that trans women are women and trans men are men.
Yes. Labels are maleable and dependent on the person using them. If a trans man wants to call himself a lesbian then he has full right to.
If a lesbian is saying it, they do not view trans men as men. If a trans man is saying it, they’re probably still attached to the lesbian label if they identified as such before transition and they have some internalised issues + a lack of self respect
Lesbians are non men attracted to non men, so no a trans man can’t be lesbian :)
I'm sorry but no, unless they are Enby transmasc. Personally to say that a trans man is a lesbian is extremely invalidating
trans MEN, so no, lesbian is literally non-men loving non-men/woman loving woman
No. Lesbians are women loving other women, so no. A trans man who likes women is straight.
Nope , lesbian is a femm and enby term , if ur a man and ur attracted to women ur straight
As a trans guy you can’t use the term “lesbian” as a trans man. It’s invalidating. 
You can use the term “lesbian” as a trans woman or a cis woman, or a sapphic non-binary/enby person. But no as a trans man ( or cis man) you can’t. That’s my opinion at least
Trans men are men. Lesbians are women who are attracted to women. Therefore a trans man cannot be a lesbian because a trans man is not a woman.
lesbian here— no. if you are a man you cannot be lesbian. it’s that simple. if you like women, you’re straight. if you’re NB lesbian is an acceptable descriptor for if you’re only attracted to women but not if you’re a man (trans or otherwise).
men can't be lesbians what are people on about😭😭
trans men? no.
trans mascs? yes
Screw the gender binary and scre the identify police. If a man feels like a lesbian, good for him.
I 100% agree, I don't believe as a trans man myself that someone who identifies as lesbian can be with a transman. 

Ask someone else said in the comments transmasc and transman are two different things, so someone who is trans masc can still be with someone who is lesbian or identify as lesbian themself since they are not a transMAN
lesbians are non-men. trans men can't be lesbian.
no men no matter trans or cis cannot be Lesbians and anyone who identifies with lesbian while dating a trans man is being transphobic to their partner
No, the term/identity lesbian fully and completely excludes men. Trans men are men, so trans men cannot be lesbians
A man can't be a lesbian

Edit: have words lost all meaning?
No
I'm a straight trans man and I never identified as a lesbian even before transition I've always been attracted to woman but I never felt like one pre everything but personally that sounds very weird I would understand if they haven't transitioned yet and identify as lesbian but besides that I don't understand why
Sexual orientation and gender identity are two DIFFERENT things. Sexual orientation: who you are attracted to sexually and romantically to

Gender identity: How you identify as male, female, or non-conforming. 

It is perfectly possible for a trans man to be attracted to women.
I’ve personally seen lesbians include trans men, but it’s really up to you as to how you identify
I don't care either way, another person's identity has never been my business, but I can't see a good reason to be a man and a lesbian at the same time.
No - with the caveat that a lot of straight trans men, especially those who transitioned later in life, will have identified as a lesbian prior to transitioning and don’t immediately stop identifying as a lesbian when they came out as trans. These things can be a process and take some time to fully navigate.

Edit to clarify that my No is in regards to binary trans men not Enbys or other transmasc identifying individuals.
Why do you say you’re not going to argue about it but post your opinion on a forum built for discussion?
Trans MEN are absolutely NOT lesbians. We are MEN. MEN can’t be lesbians. Saying trans men can be lesbians is just straight up transphobia.

Now transMASC people, that’s a whole different schnit. Transmasc people aren’t strictly men, they’re non-binary people who align mostly with masculinity, but are still non-binary. Nby people can 100% be lesbians and are included in lesbianism.

There’s also the thing with butches. Although butch lesbians and trans men have a close history together, butch lesbians are still women, and trans men are men. Same applies with he/him lesbians, as pronouns =/= gender.
 you can be attracted to either sex and gender is dif. but lesbian is defined as female liking female sexually
Yea you can be a trans man and a lesbian
Yes, you can be a trans man and a lesbian. Identity is complex and some labels will seem like they conflict. Let people be, jesus fuck, you don't know why they chose their labels and they have their reasons. 

I refuse to believe that trans men who are lesbians are choosing this label to be actively malicious, they're just trying to describe their experiences. 

ETA: I am begging you people to go outside and meet real life queer people. Nobody will give a fuck. I've met bi lesbian trans men. Nobody fucking cares. People are just trying to live as themselves, and labels have never been clearly shaped boxes. Let people be conflicting and messy. Let people be queer.
By almost any interpretation of the question, no.  They present as men and so people will see a male and a female.  The world sees a straight relationship.  They identify as men who are attracted to women.  Again, this is simply being straight.

I, however, am not the arbiter of anyone else's truth.  So the possibility exists that a trans man might identify as a lesbian - presumably without the ""irony"" that I used when I was ""cis"" - and while I don't understand it, I don't have to.  In the unlikely event that such a thing comes to my attention, I'll do what I do when anyone tells me something about their identity:  agree with their assessment, because they're the only ones who have even an outside chance of knowing what the hell they're talking about.

(Note:  there are certainly edge cases.  A transmasc nonbinary person, for example, might identify as lesbian since the language in such edge cases gets super fuzzy.)
Trans men can't be lesbian. A lesbian is someone who is attracted to women and isn't heterosexual.
Generally no, trans men cannot be lesbians, but trans masc/ non binary can because not all transmasc people are trans men. If a trans man wants to self identify as lesbian though I don’t think that’s a bad thing, it’s their sexuality, they know it better than anyone else.
You're wrong.
If he says he is I’m inclined to believe him.
lesbians transition sometimes bc they get gender dysphoria. not your place to tell lesbians what they are.
The trans man can’t be considered a lesbian but they could date one. Like if they knew each other before he transitioned. Like my partner is straight but I came out after four years of marriage. I’m transitioning to a guy and my husband will miss my womanly figure but he loves me for me. If we were not together though he’d still be straight. He’d never go for guys. And he’s still straight even though he’s with me.
Fuck who cares how someone identifies jesus christ.
 The only “man” who is lesbian is transgender woman. I’ve felt like lesbian always way before I’ve come out as transgender woman.
Words have meanings, this question does not.
if you’re going to identify as a man, you can’t identify as a lesbian too because it invalidates your gender identity. i see the same thing a lot with trans women calling themselves “femboys” or other people calling us “femboys” and it’s insulting. i’m not a femboy i’m a girl.
I think there are ways in practice where this is “ok” but probably not completely accurately labeled in the strictest sense…. To me the key is how the person perceives their active gender role during the actual act with someone. If they consider themselves fem during the act of loving a lesbian woman whom they expect to treat them as what they consider fem, then in practice it’s not somehow misleading or harmful I don’t think.
This is where transMEN gets confused with transMASC. Just let people Identify how they feel comfortable jfc.
Not really, no. But some, depending on how they present, feel, identity, are like, the next closest thing.
who cares? why do y’all need to gatekeep identities and obsess over such inconsequential “issues”?
I'm of the opinion that it's fine to feel like trans men can't be lesbians by definition, but not okay to tell people who self identify that way that they can't identify as lesbians. That is a slippery slope that inevitably leads to gatekeeping all trans people out of queer communities. Let people personally identify how they want, cause identity is a thing that cannot be correct or not correct; it just is. The philosophical debates shouldn't affect people's lives for the worse.
If you’re a man, you cannot be a lesbian. If you’re a trans man who exclusively likes women, you’re straight, because you’re a man. Gender =\= sexuality.
friendly reminder that people's own labels aren't about you. they're about themselves. if someone identifies as something and it lets them understand themselves better and feel more comfortable with themselves, it's not your business nor it is your place to deny them the right to identify as whatever feels right for them.
Lesbian is just an identity. Just like gay, straight, bi, trans, woman, man, beautiful, smart, etc. You can be whatever you want to be. People are too technical and judgmental about it.
I'm pretty sure Trans men can't be lesbians because that defeats the point of lesbians.

However, people with he/him pronouns probably can, because pronouns don't equal gender. Someone could use he/him pronouns and still be a girl.

Idk tho I'm not lesbian
Lesbian is wlw. If you identify as male then you can't be lesbian
No, the whole point of lesbian is that it excludes men. That includes trans men.Now masc =/= man by any means and there are tons of masc lesbians that use he/him but don't identify as men. Most commonly these are butch or nonbinary lesbians.  
But no if you are a trans man and you like women, you're most likely straight (unless you like other genders as well).
Not sure.
Yes they can, and it's fine. There are he/him lesbians (who identify as that), and also transmasc straight guys. 

To put it one way, if gender is a social construct, so is sexuality. Your identity shouldn't need to rely on other people with synonymous identities conforming to your expectations of that identity.
Trans men are men so no, but if someone wants to call themselves whatever they want it doesn’t affect me
Honestly why do we care so much about labels
Sure whatever. They're allowed to unlock 1000% dark souls mode and act like everyone understands without question or context. I imagine this occurs at the early stages of transition when one is still trying to find themselves.
If you identify as a male then you cannot be lesbian because it is non men loving non men, however if identify and woman, non-binary, gendefluid, agender, etc. (anything that is doesn’t refer to oneself as male) can be a lesbian or sapphic
Ok, I feel like I can understand why some people are confused by pronouns and stuff when I read these threads. Everyone has different opinions and answers. Learning about gender dysphoria has helped me out alot and made me stop categorizing behaviors as male or female but like....damn. personally I find alot of this confusing and I'm someone who is for gender expression. 

Definition of lesbain is literally ""a gay woman"", so if you are a trans man to me there's a disconnect calling yourself a lesbian. But do I care? No, if you want to identify as trans male and lesbian go for it but you're for sure gonna have people asking questions If you tell most people that.
my thought is: why should we care so much about what other people do and how they experience identities?
Oh God I have had this argument before with my sibling and it is painful. Some transMASCS can be lesbians because lesbianism includes Enbys. Trans MEN however cannot be lesbians because lesbianism excludes men. There's boarder discourse about if trans men should be allowed to hang out in lesbian spaces, but that's a whole other issue... My sister loves to call ME transphobic for saying men can't be lesbians, but she's also the one who identifies as ""female-to-binary lesbian transgender"" and called me a transphobe for asking what that means... And she routinely misgenders me by calling me a lesbian. OOF this thread is reminding me of multiple ""arguments"" with her...
I would say yes. Because the people who are opposed to LGBTQ people and who struggle with bigotry and who are made to comprehend a man can have a uterus might catch fire if you drop the old trans men can be lesbians on them.
Probably said before but transmen are straight(although it’s usually personal preference for the person)if they want to be with a woman. On the flip side transmasc can be a sorta 50/50 spilt of lesbian or not to my understanding. Same argument could be said if a trans woman loved women I would consider them a lesbian as well.
no, my brother constantly calls me a lesbian and it bothers me so much its not even funny. Trans men who date women are NOT lesbians end of discussion.
i think the thing that confuses a lot of people about he/him lesbians is the lack of distinction between trans men and trans masc outside of the trans community. i know some trans mascs call themselves lesbians because they don’t identify as men or women and the only terms made for nb folks’ attraction are largely unheard of or regarded as fake or “liberal wokism”, so they use more well known terms.
Trans man = biological women that regocnizes he as a boy, so no, they would be heterossexual. But they can be gay.
Feel free to use whatever terms you want, but almost all trans men wouldn’t want to identify that way, and most lesbians wouldn’t like it either.
No
If you are a man that like people who ain’t you are not a lesbian, if you ain’t a man and you like people who ain’t a man you are a lesbian.
no
I personally would say transmen are straight if with a female, like I'd consider myself a lesbian because I'm with, and attracted to, my female partner. It depends on identity though, as with everything else.
you can say gay men gay women lesbians is specific to the female gender i am a non binary trans man and i mainly date women and if someone called me a lesbian i would punch them in the mouth. nonbinary people can be gay and queer those are non gendered terms like the non gendered  non binary word is.  if you are going to make up new terms like they/them for non binary the know the root of the words is because the are no gender not both genders if you are genderfluid then you are both.
thats just being straight with extra steps tho
No but transmascs can be
TransMEN. It's right there in the name. If they're into women exclusively, they'd be straight :)
Some transmascs however, which might include afab enbies, can still identify as lesbians if they are non-men attracted to non-men
 Tough question ngl. I am 5 years post op afab ftm trans. I started transitioning later in life.. that being said I lived/identified as lesbian for almost 20 years. My wife was with me, as a les for 10 years, prior to my transition. We have decided that both of us are 'queer'. While I am attracted to women exclusively. I will never be 'one of the guys'. I was socialized female for 33 years, and that doesn't go away. So sometimes I will slip and call myself a lesbian, lol. I no longer identify as one tho. But I feel like after all the years I did, I earned the right to carry that card, if I so choose..lol sorry for the long response.
no
Trans men, woman or anyone can be anyone they want... Whatever makes you happy doesn't necessarily need an absolute label, group or community just to satisfy what others believe...
It's just being straight with extra steps for trans men ig?
Only multigender ones
no? they're a man?
Yes.
Hell call yourself whatever you want everyone else may have a problem but fuck them. I don't know why there is so much hate in the LGBT+ community directed at each other just let everyone call themselves what they want it's not hurting you. Call yourself a unicorn fucker for all you want.
no, its a trans man, emphasis on MAN, being a lesbian is a wlw relationship, not a mlw.
This is where modern day gender theory and sexuality theory has gotten itself all tied up in knots. It's very frustrating as an academic to watch the field advance, led partially by social media users non Tumblr or Reddit, whereas the foundation was the trenches of the 70s, 80s and 90s. The term ""trans man"" is in itself a horrible breach of contemporary gender theory, though I totally forgive early progressives for using the tools they had available early on. It's just now we really need to uproot it. 

So like sure? There's no coherent rules about gender or sexuality. If that's the best way someone feels they present, let them.
No.
I. Am a trans. Something to be honest all these transmale transfemale things confuse me. Im a biologically born male identifying as a female. And I call myself a lesbian. This is because I identify, and want to be so badly that I’m saving for future surgeries and hormones. Does that make me correct. No. But in my mind, lesbians are women that find attraction to other women. There is a reason as a trans I stray from the community. So much controversy. And maybe I am wrong for that. But I want to be who I want to be, and if it offends someone, fuck them.
Lesbian : NONMEN LOVE NONMEN
Gay : NONWOMEN LOVE NONWOMEN
Bi : WHATEVER THE FUCK LOVES WHATEVER THE FUCK
Pan : SAME AS BEFORE JUST WITHOUT SEEING GENDER (/hj)

So no a trans man cannot identify as a lesbian. I’m a genderfluid trans man, I identify as male labeld, because I am a man (with a lil bit of spice imo). As well as having my sexuality change constantly, if I’m attracted to women for a period of time, I’m straight unless I’m nonbinary atm. But I refuse (personally) to call myself a lesbian if I’m attracted to women + nonmen and i’m nonbinary, since my gender and sexuality are so fluid. I usually say I’m Bi or Gay, whichever I feel I have a stronger attraction to (Bi being pretty much anyone, and gay being non-women ppl). I have identity issues as well but I won’t identify as lesbian because I’m (mainly) male.

Edit :: I identify as transmasc as well but still refuse to call myself a lesbian. (Currently nonbinary and gay, they/it pls)
My son and his best friend from HS are both afab, and are transgender. His friend didn’t realize he was trans until a few years after HS.  While in middle school, they were “questioning” and dated each other before my son realized he was trans, and his friend at that time thought he was a lesbian. I watched  as my son transitioned and realized he was gay in college, and wasn’t all that surprised to find out his best friend also came out as transgender.  I’ve considered his friend to be heterosexual just like I consider my son gay. Otherwise, I have no idea.
remove trans and you got your answer
it’s up to them, labels are dumb anyways
I would never call a trans dude a lesbian unless that’s how they expressed to me that it’s their identity. I would also never invalidate a trans dude for wanting to be called a lesbian.
I’d say it depends, hypothetically if I was someone with an attraction to men (I’m bi, but for sake of argument), I’m mtf, I’d say I’m gay until people I don’t know (as in like waiters sayin something like madam) start calling me as a her until saying I was straight? 

(I’m not sure how most people classify it, I’m just going with this as it’s the one most likely in my opinion to not be misleading to someone that doesn’t know I’m trans, and before starting a relationship or anything like a hookup I’d make sure they were aware 100% that I have a pp down there)


Edit: oh my I typed a lot
#no.

like you said in the post, it's transphobic to themselves and to trans men in general
 No lesbians are non men loving non men
I mean a ton of trans guys identified as lesbians before realizing or coming out as trans… can we really blame them for opting to continue to identify with a label they maybe had for many years?
Hell yeah we can
Yes they can. Labels are descriptive, not prescriptive. Policing them is dumb. Gender and sexuality are complex, nuanced and often fluid.
A trans man would just be a straight male, if he liked women at least in my perspective that's how it would go. coming from a straight trans female here. I'm into men but I wouldn't call myself gay, and I'm definitely not a lesbian so if someone is that's fine, but I'll stick to the dicks and fingers in me and not really worry about it. I'm just a woman that likes men and I'm proud to be, if a guy wants me he can have me. but I do have a genital preference, as far as sexually. that's not to say that trans men aren't guys I just prefer guys that already have the equipment I want, that's all. once they get that then by all means but I'm not into the whole vagina junk unless I'm the one with the vagina. tho I still have yet to finish that venture, and as I said I'm a woman and into guys so I'm straight. just like a man who's into women is straight, that's just my point of view on the subject. no ill intent, guys are guys women are women if a guy likes a guy he's gay, if a woman likes a man she's straight, if a guy like a woman he's straight, and if a guy just isn't into anyone he's asexual, if a woman is attracted to no one she's asexual, if a woman is into anyone she's a lewd mf, kidding pansexual (I don't know how to describe demisexual very well so bare with me)and if a  if a guy will date anyone he's an omnivore, kidding again he's pansexual, if a human is into a man or a woman but not both they just like humans of a particular gender, if a human likes no one they don't find humans attractive asexual works for them too, and if a human is into everybody they're into everybody. I'm a woman who's into men so I'm straight end of story, I'm not gay and I'm definitely not a lesbian y'all and ya holes can leave me alone I like prody thingies unless they're sharp or have metal crap flying out of them at high speeds
yeah, i think its one of those ""all geese are birds but not all birds are geese"" situation? like, im pretty sure trans men are transmasc, but not everyone whos transmasc is a trans man if that makes sense. i might be wrong but thats what makes sense with the knowledge i have lol
Exactly, not all trans masculine people are men, some are just dudes
Hey same boat.

I wanna say transbian but that doesn’t feel right because I don’t look or attempt to look fem in the slightest as of yet.

If I say I’m enby, people assume I’m fine with male gendered terms (I am not).

I’m not getting bottom surgery either.
If you feel like you fit into the lesbian label then you're lesbian, doesn't matter if you're amab if you're enby then you can use that label :)
If the term lesbian feels right to you, then it’s open to you, since you’re not a man and you’re attracted exclusively to women
you're nonbinary, doesn't matter that youre amab, you belong here!!
If your not a man you can call yourself lesbian. Lesbians are non-men loving non-men. Nonbinary lesbian exists and it shouldn't be just afab lesbians. 

But that's just how I see it.
If you are transitioning to be a woman and are attracted to women,that sounds like a lesbian.

If I understand the term lesbian correctly,Women who like women are lesbians.
If you are enby attracted to women, you might wanna check out the label ""trixic"".
Lesbian or Sapphic or both are good labels from what you're saying.

Sapphic basically means attracted to feminine aesthetic.
non-binary ppl use the terms gay/lesbian all the time! (including me :) ) if you’re comfortable with the latter, go for it!

Gynesexual
Depends on what you feel fits you better I guess. I know an AMAB enby that considers themself gay because they felt it fit them. I think lesbian can also be used in a similar way. I'm not sure, just be what you wanna be I guess lol.
I know it's not particularly well known, but trixic is supposed to be for nonbinary people attracted to women and toric is for nonbinary people attracted to men. And then straight if attracted to other nonbinary people. It hasn't seemed to catch on in the mainstream community yet.
lesbian
I've heard gynosexual for someone of any gender attracted to femininity, and I think it's kind of nice :)
It’s super common to answer more complex sexuality/identity questions like this by going with queer - anyone wants to discuss sexuality/gender further respectfully a conversation can be had, disrespectfully and it can be shut down. Queer as a term side steps all the divisive points and then enables bespoke and complex sexualities to shine through conversation.
Well Why I’ve received zillion of downvotesfor the same thing? There are more topics regarding this trans men lesbian and responses there are very clear trans masculine / trans men cannot be lesbian, this is very wrong what happened here in this particular topic full of terfs and transphobic and genitalia oriented people.
literally. who gives a shit other than people who are bored and want to create problems
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
This exactly! I’m tired of it. I’m bisexual and a trans guy. If I love a man it’ll be the way a man loves a man, and if I love a woman it’ll be the way a woman loves a woman. Admittedly I lean more towards the middle of the binary gender line, but i’m still a guy.
I definitely agree that we shouldn't police others' labels. However, I don't think this question is necessarily bad faith. I am binary FTM who HAS been called a lesbian by a trans ""ally."" That person proceeded to argue that I have to accept the label because other trans men LOVE to be called lesbians. So it's not like the questions was just out of nowhere. The difference between transmasc and binary FTM is a gray area, and I think people are being very reasonable in explaining that.
this.. I'm transmasc but I identified as a lesbian for some time before realizing who I am. I still enjoy being in lesbian spaces and I wish I could openly say the lesbian part of myself is important to me. If less people viewed me as predatory or creepy bc of it I would be more open about that.
straight up! Thank you!
mostly a huge historical overlap, you can't really separate the history of trans men and butches, the same way you can't separate the history of the gay community and the lesbian community
He/him butches are saying they are women and using he/him pronouns? WTF?
Jsyk, that phrase is literally a TERF dog whistle.
thats different than being a trans-man though
🎉👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
Trans man and trans masc is not the same trans masc is still under the non binary umbrella.
thank you. i am very much in my early 20s (young as fuck!) but i relate to my trancestors so deeply! i've totally divorced myself from the ""lesbian"" label since i started my transition, but that piece of who i was is still pretty intrinsic to who i am now, ya know? or maybe i've just read too much ""stone butch blues,"" LMAO. bottom line, labels aren't always as cut and dry as they're made out to be and thankfully i learned that very early into my journey.
honestly I think the solution is to take people at their word. unless someone is literally using a term from a closed culture they're not a part of it doesn't matter, they aren't hurting anyone.
Why is this comment buried under so many ""NO! Men are MEN!!"" comments? Jesus, aren't we on a subreddit for *trans* people? Just repeating cis bullshit over here.
I’m commenting under all these comments to try and give ‘em a bit of a boost, we need to support people in their right to identify in ways that feel right to them. Even if, or maybe especially when, they don’t fit within the neat identify boxes that might feel comfortable to us.
THIS OH MY GOD 
I want the people asking these questions to talk to some old queers and read old queer literature SO BADLY
This is a big struggle for me, personally. I spent my whole life being afraid of my masculinity because I was deeply terrified of being kicked out of my community. I swung back & forth between butch & femme, like a tug-of-war between my core & what I thought I was supposed to be.

My history & connections are deeply intertwined with the lesbian community, and allowing my core to come out in my presentation does not sever those ties. It might prompt me to explain myself more than I used to, but that's okay.
I can't believe how long I had to scroll to see this.
Thank you for saying this

My thumbs are tired and I didn't know how to explain in less than 10,000 words
Actually the term lesbian has gotten a bit of a revamp in it's meaning it now means nmlnm aka nonmen loving nonmen
Exactly. Also trans men have been being lesbians for longer than I’ve personally been alive so I don’t know if opinions matter. I believe in gender freedom so trans man lesbians make sense in my book. Gender and sexuality are greater and more complex than binaries and boxes.
This 100% if a person identifies as a trans man lesbian that’s up to them, if they are with a partner that identifies as a lesbian that’s also fine.

I don’t think it’s up to you to say that someone is disrespecting themselves by identifying in a way that feels right to them.
That's really the end of it, isn't it?   
  
It doesn't affect you, at all. Not even a little bit.   
  
Are you upset by it? Well that's squarely your own problem.   
  
Idk why it's so hard to not police people's identities and think you know better than them.
>Also, especially in a historical context, there is so much overlap between lesbian and transmasculine communities, that policing this entirely disregards our history.

This awareness is severely lacking here. Thank you!!
Yeah wow. The adherence to a binary in these responses are mind boggling to me
Trans men also aren’t a monolith, you aren’t the only one
What sticks out to me is that the post makes it sound like the trans man in question is choosing to self-identify as a lesbian. I think that’s fine. I think it’s perfectly normal for some people to feel like their social gender identity and their sexual gender identity are different. While there is probably some term that more specifically describes such a person, if they want to be called a male lesbian or whatever, I think that’s their right. Personally, I think if someone tells you how they identify and you try to argue with them, you are always wrong by default. 

However, if I’ve misread the situation and this is about someone else calling a trans man a lesbian, then 100% that is fucked up and unacceptable.
I maters if perpetuates cis sexism. But just to criticism not to the point of harrasment.
Labels themselves are exclusive. And I agree that doesn't mean it can't critizing if someone label themselves in a way that perpetuates cis sexism.
Because we literally have 0 context for this question - who is the trans man in question? does he even literally identify with ther term 'man' or has that been prescribed to him because he's AFAB trans? Has he been in a lesbian community and identified as a lesbian for years before his transition? Is he still in a lesbian community? 

Jesus, y'all. This is trans shit we're talking about. Things aren't always,  you know... BINARY
Literally.
Somebody has written there that there are some he/him butches - like cis women using he/him pronouns? I don’t get it, this looks transphobic to me.
Because “men can’t be lesbians” is a TERF dogwhistle.
Actually they can be critized because even if it's form themselves it's still a way of perpetuating cis sexism. And  yes lebians exclude men, labels are exclusive some times the other option is riding from labels but that's not something most people want.
Aren’t we in the trans community fighting to determine our own gender and free ourselves from the prescribed boxes of gender essentialism and sexuality? Saying man is man and woman is woman sounds like a conservative talking point as to why trans people can’t exist, or how they talked about gay marriage. To me the fight has always been to show that human gender and sexuality is MUCH more than what has previously been deemed “acceptable.” Gender freedom imo means that we can ALL live without the pressure to conform to preconceived gender/sexuality standards.
Yea that's what I'm saying but I got downvoted. People claim you can be lesbian but also a trans man
[removed]
Actually the criticism is fair because perpetuates cis sexim even if to themselves.
People think that if we self police our identities it'll.....help us be less oppressed because now our oppressors are going to stop?  
  
News flash to everyone arguing in this thread: telling a trans man he can't be a lesbian won't make Republicans accept us.
Thank you!
It perpetuates cis sexism and transphobia, even in the trans comunity it's a socialization phenomenon. It's worth of criticism. Trans men are men not lesbians.
1000%. Posts like this are nasty.
[removed]
That’s a TERF dog whistle…
This is an insightful response  i agree
🎉
Actually the term lesbian has gotten a bit of a revamp in it's meaning it now means nmlnm aka nonmen loving nonmen
Even as a fairly simple, aro-ace binary trans man, I really don't get why anyone cares so much about this-

Are we really all queer just to invent new binaries, and new rules around gender? Do whatever you want and let others do what they want.
It's not that complicated,  the history is messing because of transphobia and cis sexism yes I'm a trans woman and historically we where lumpes as gay men, specially straight trans women like me, that's not something we should be proud about it's just something sad that keep existing and trans people still interiorize. And at that time the concept of lesbian was more strech than now. They not acepted trans men as lebians because the meaning was more open but because the Sam reasons terfs see trans men as their sisters.

Celebrating interiorize transphobia , or perpetuating cis sexism is not something I'm willing to do. Also sexuality and gender are separate thing there's not such thing as gender sexuality identity,  sexuality labels are a reflex of the person gender and who they are attracted.

Can you explain? Not trying to be rude, sorry if it comes off like that. 

Also I have to go but I'll read your reply later
How does that work?
no
Lesbians aren't men, if they are they wouldn't be lesbian. Tf
Then they become straight… if they transition to male they are now a man.  Why is this difficult to grasp?
But trans women aren't men...so idk what your point is here?
And I feel like there is a strong kinship and deep understanding, especially between transmen who don't need to overcompensate their masculinity and butch lesbians.
yes! trans men are men who weren't asigned male at birth. trans masc means people undergoing masculinizing hrt for example, which some non-binary people do and feel better with even though they don't identify as men. 

As we know and as others have highlighted, non-binary people can be lesbians so that works out.
[removed]
I ducking love you people!
Yeah it irritates me a little when peoples’ definitions are just women loving women and everyone leaves out the enbies 😭
Is there an equivalent term for non-women loving non-women? One might propose “gay”, but that is often used more generally for lesbians as well, so I’m not sure.
So now the definition of lesbian is completely centered around men?
this term is INCREDIBLY insulting
i'm a traditionalist, i don't argue with people online when i ""get bored"", i just smoke a bunch of weed and watch ink master or bar rescue or something!!!!!!
now THAT actually sucks, i'm sorry you got told that. obviously if a cis and/or straight person is the one trying to box you into an identity, then i think they have no right to say anything. but also i can never tell when questions on this sub are genuine or if they're coming from people who want to stoke arguments on purpose (especially since i've seen this topic get posted about a FEW times). i think all of the perspective under this thread are valid but also some folks still need to be reminded of those gray areas, or that an identity that they might not be into can still be a way that someone identifies, if that makes sense.
yes!!! even though i love being affirmed as male i still feel so out of place in spaces that are meant for queer men. maybe it's because the cis gays i've encountered have weird attitudes about trans men and their ""parts,"" maybe it's because i also value my former identity as a lesbian. but i'd take a night out at a lesbian bar over a gay club any day, and more than that i just wish there were more all-inclusive spaces so that we don't have to argue about who belongs where! (thankfully i live right by nyc and have found a few places that fit this bill but i am privileged in that regard)
He/him lesbians have been a thing for decades and are valid. 

Pronouns =/= gender so it works out. Plus transmasc =/= trans man.
pronouns =/= gender
I don’t really get it but it’s older than me.
Yeah, they're binary women using traditionally masc pronouns. It's a form of gender nonconformity, not that different from a cis man wearing a skirt.
idk why you're being downvoted? you're correct?
However, I would say that's in the opposite context, they would say I'm not a lesbian, because I'm AMAB identifying female/fluid.
Same here, on the younger end! I was incredibly lucky to be mentored by some wonderful older trans men and lesbians in my early transition. I also identified as a lesbian before. I no longer do, but that identity absolutely shaped me into who I am today. Those experiences didn't vanish the moment I transitioned, and I'm sick of other trans people acting as if those experiences don't matter. 

I'm a big history geek and write about trans history, and when I look back, a lot of times there was no clear line between trans men and butches. I owe my liberation today to butches in the past who dared to reject traditional ideas of womanhood, and I have SO much love and affinity for them. It's too exhausting to fight other trans people on this, but I wish we could embrace our shared history instead of having this insidious need to separate and police each other.
Agreed.
It's depressing, but it's the most common reaction people have on these kinds of posts. I really don't want to engage with that attitude, but it also makes me sad to think of someone reading the comments and seeing NOBODY challenge that type of thinking.
This still excludes trans men, who are men.
Edit: After a bit more thinking I've realised that label widening is really not a problem. All I need to do, when I want to tell someone who I like, is use the closest label as an approximation and then narrow it down with an extra explanation.
Love having a new binary I'm forced to participate in. Simply the best
Well that just sounds like you’re basing the entire definition of being a lesbian around men
Right?

Basically all trans discourse, especially about who is allowed to be what, boils down to people not knowing how to mind their own business. You’d think other queer people would realize that making rules on what kinds of queerness are acceptable isn’t a great thing
Right? It’s always saddening to me to see trans people close their minds to other parts of the community that don’t fit within their perception of what being trans means.
By definition, trans men are men. They can’t be lesbians because they are men.
I think is still transphobic amd cis sexist tho. And I think is fair to criticize it, arge is useless I agree. Amd there's not such thing as gender sexual identity,  sexuality and gender are sepate things. Labes on sexual identity are just a reflex of the former.
to me if said trans man is saying it himself, it's fine. if it's someone else saying a trans man is a lesbian it can be suspicious, cuz it could mean they're just transphobic
I mean, pronouns don't necesserally equal gender, but in this case ppl are saying a man can be lesbian? Which?????
This is a separate thing, though. Yes, some butch lesbians use he/him pronouns because they feel comfortable with them.

But butch lesbians and trans men are very different, and the fact that some lesbians use he/him doesn't make them men. 

Trans men are men, and he/him lesbians that **identify as women** are women, simple as that.

It's their gender and they can choose how they present it. There's no rule saying that a woman can't use he/him and a man can't use she/her, even if they're cis, that's not transphobic, they have the right to use whatever pronouns they like.
Why would it be? It is literally the only identity that doesn't involve men, trans and cis women aren't men, trans and cis men are men, so they can't be lesbian.
It's really not their fault if people are assuming things about all trans people from one of us. If someone uses a trans man who identifies as a lesbian as proof that we are all confused lesbians, whose fault is that? Not the trans man.

Yes, the label doesn't apply to men, but if the person feels comfortable with the label, why is it such a big deal to everyone else? It's really none of your damn business.
The only way I'm familiar with this being so is when someone is working with people who don't understand he/him lesbians, so one may tell their job they're a trans man but outside of work they just live as a he/him butch lesbian.
Transmasc nonbinary people can be lesbians (ex. Me)
Agree. Trying to make our identities easier to understand for transphobes and homophobes won't actually make transphones and homophobes like us any better, it's just hurting ourselves

But I don't like singling out Republicans because I have met plenty of anti-LGBTQ democrats and liberals...and LGBTQ rights isn't just an American political issue
Yes, trans men are men, and men are not lesbians. That's correct and I agree. However, if an *individual* trans man wants to *self-identify* as both a trans man and a lesbian, it does not cause any harm to anyone if he does so. A handful of trans men identifying as lesbians does not change the definition or social expectations of either of those labels. It is fine for individuals to have conflicting identities for themselves if they feel like they belong to both groups and queer identities are allowed to be complicated like that.

I know someone who ID'd as a female lesbian for over a decade before his transition and now identifies as a binary trans man and a lesbian. He's still married to a woman who also identifies as a lesbian and neither of them have an issue with that. Are they now required to change how they identify because it makes *other* queer people uncomfortable? Should I tell him he's not really a man if he still identifies as a lesbian, or that he needs to start calling himself non-binary?

The ""trans men can't be lesbians"" debate was pulled out of someone's ass last week to distract people from the fact that we're having an election soon that could literally be life-or-death for millions of queer people--THAT'S the transphobia we should be concerned with, not trans men breaking gender rules.
??? If men can be lesbians then what's the use of labels at all?
Which still doesn’t include trans men
You don't get to say someone's identity is internalized transphobia. You don't get to say anything about anyone's identity but your own.
You are right. Sexuality is often fluid and that is made even more complicated when you are transitioning. I realize that wasn’t clear in my initial comment and that’s my bad.
interesting. needs some vowels tho!
trans people can have complicated experiences with gender
It depends on the person, but if you have experience homophobia all your life because of your attraction to women or men, rather than in a way joining the oppressor class when you transition, it may make more sense to still ID as lesbian or as gay rather than as heterosexual. Additionally, for some the boundaries between being butch, or gnc & being trans are not as solid or different as they may be for other people! Obviously, for a lot of people they are but you do get people ID'ing as transmasc lesbians & transfem gay men, because those boundaries between sexuality & gender are a little more fluid for them.
Because gender isn't always 1:1 with sexuality, and it doesn't always fit into neat boxes even if you use specifically gendered terms to describe yourself.
He/him lesbians are a thing you can be a transman and call yourself a lesbian if you'd like, it has to do with the comfort of the label and how it feels for the individual.
Tell that the trans men that are lesbians, be an ass
maybe these trans men don’t fully identify as men. this isn’t a logic argument, identity isn’t based on logic. they’re lesbians if they’re lesbians.
literally just talk to them not me, i’ve done my understanding, it takes a lot more to grasp their truth than stay ignorant
I don’t understand you! What’s your point here? Even trans women can use he/him pronouns per statements here from others. I don’t understand Reddit community at all. It’s insane here!!!
The core issue lies more with the term Lesbian itself. Spelling: Gay can be used by anyone even if it was initially primarily a masculine term. Society hates women, and thats why lesbian never carried over in the same way, and why it is more of a noun.

The reason why I do not believe transmen who identify as transmen, or like me who identifies as a trandrogynous man, should NOT use the term lesbian is because of oppression. It's like Faggot. Don't use it to describe yourself unless you have been oppressed by it. 

Lesbian need to retain some level of specific use to acknowledge the specific history of oppression. 

You can argue transmen who initially believe their were lesbians lived this oppression, but it would be an ad hoc. Transmen live a different kind of oppression, even if it appears similar.
I personally just use the word gay for male and female. Unless someone specifically wants to use the term lesbian, I just think of them as gay cause the terminology has grown to kinda include both textbook gay and lesbian.
Boo, transphobic post
love you too!! 💜
The issue lie with the term 'lesbian' itself, not enbys.
Yeah non-women loving non-women is for gay men, but people usually use mlm (men loving men)
i was of the opinion that anyone that is not attracted to the opposite gender that they were assigned at birth only, but does not fit into the stereotypical ""normal"" alternative sexualities like gay or lesbian, is queer.
Queer is a generally accepted term that gets the point across, but it has some of the same issues as gay. Sapphic could also work but who knows really.
No it's not, it's just inclusive for nonbinary people. There is also non-women loving non-women which is for gay men. Do you see that also centering around women? For being inclusive of nonbinary people.

And I said it's just how I see it. I didn't say it's the official definition of lesbians.
Bro I literally got high and watched the new episode of inkmaster last night let's goooooo lol. I'm a non-binary transmasc lesbian who honestly just doesn't care if other folks think that's an invalid way of living - it's me, and those are the labels I feel best describe my identity.
completely understandable dude
Like how a gendefluid lesbian can use he/him but if you openily identify as man, male or boy then you cannot be lesbian
[removed]
Honestly though I get that quite a bit as a way for people to misgender me. I am a he/they transmasc, for me my pronouns DO equal my gender but some people have tried to refer to me as woman who uses masc pronouns and I’m not sure anymore what to do because I feel like everything is upside down from I how I feel my identity is.
[removed]
it's a dog whistle because it requires the exact same logic to arrive at that conclusion nomatter the context. the logic being ""lesbian has a strict definition and it is not a self identified label but a classification""
that's amazing, i'm so happy for you and happy that there are other people out there trying to keep our history alive! i'm a glutton for punishment so i posted a comment under this question, but i too really don't want to argue other trans people about this. of course there are points to be made on both ends and i totally get why someone would feel dysphoric or offended by the idea of a trans man identifying as a lesbian/with lesbianism, but generally speaking, this sort of division is what cis straight people want us to do! the more we do in-fighting and label policing, the more we mirror the nuclear family and identity model that they box themselves into. being queer should be freeing and against the norm! however you define that is up to you, but don't tell someone they're identifying themself ""wrong""!
But trans men are men therefore cannot be lesbians...?
Sorry to see you being downvoted for this. It's so strange to me that even the trans community is so fast to come up with new binaries, trying to fit everything in neat boxes and attempting to define and re-define labels for every single possible way of existing.

There are no neat categories to be constructed, you're always going to leave someone out in this pursuit of rigid boundaries. Give into the madness, it's okay to just exist.
So if I'm nonbinary and exclusivity attracted to women, what am I?
Everything is built around men unfortunately
Yep, all it does is push people away from the community. 
  
I don't have much at stake here as a bisexual(probably lol) trans woman, but frankly it makes me significantly less comfortable to exist here knowing that the political wind might change and suddenly something about my identity might not be ""allowed"" anymore.
Your definition also centers around men
Okay, I’m interested. What is your criticism of someone who is a trans man choosing to self identify as a lesbian?
I’ve received zilion minuses because people here are claiming that even cis people can use different pronouns that not reflecting their gender. I don’t get it and for me this is transphobic af. And cis people can use it against transgender people just to abuse them.
“Men can’t be lesbians” means “trans women can’t be lesbians because they are men.”

That’s how it’s a dog whistle.
>It's really not their fault if people are assuming things about all trans people from one of us. If someone uses a trans man who identifies as a lesbian as proof that we are all confused lesbians, whose fault is that? Not the trans man.

Actually is not necessarily to go that point,  trans men calling themselves lesbians and trans women calling themselves tr*aps it's enough by itself to perpetuate cissexism wiouth and ill intention even within the trans community.  

>Yes, the label doesn't apply to men, but if the person feels comfortable with the label, why is it such a big deal to everyone else? It's really none of your damn business.

It's just worth to critize and remark the first part it helps to cis sexism to no build up. It's I think unfortunate . And I don't really care about others peoples life
Yes, but we are talking mainly about trans men, who are men. We aren’t talking about trans masc people.
I singled them out because it was convenient for a comment I spent 30 seconds writing.
I think regardless of the nuances, it's still tranphobic to call trans men lesbians, wven if due to themselves.  And I understand it's difficult to let it go also that some times people make exceptions to ther sexuality, but it's still an straigh relationship even if their partner is mostlesbian or a lebian woman who are with him for the bond builded over the years. And no the solution is not making them to change gow they call their gender just signaling that is something transphobic to do is enough. I have nuances on that I think people who just began they journey even if it's something transphobic as I said should have looseness or with elder trans ppl. It depends on the context. Still independent of it it's still tranphobic to call tran men lesbians and perpetuates well cis sexism even if it's not the intention. 

If you want to make a case to to men being lesbians I think the better is to do in an universal way, not just making an exemption for trans men because of x or because the ten thousand years of trans people having to lump with gay men and lesbians to survive.

>The ""trans men can't be lesbians"" debate was pulled out of someone's ass last week to distract people from the fact that we're having an election soon that could literally be life-or-death for millions of queer people--THAT'S the transphobia we should be concerned with, not trans men breaking gender rules.

I'm not American or european my dude. My English is something I learned as hobby and to look for information.
Labels are for individuals to use shorthand to describe their specific identity without having to explain the nuances of it.   
  
So, in other words, they mean fuck all unless they have personal meanings to you and that means you can't tell someone their identity is wrong, or incorrect.
the use is to be comfortable. labels cause a lot of harm anyways
Correct because trans men are men
Trans men identify as lesbians it's an heritage of cis sexism qnd internalized transphobia, regardless of how the current perosn it's processing that stuff. So yeah rejection to that heritage is a good thing not a bad one.
I do read it is mlem mlem somtimes
Yes but, if men can be lesbians, what does the label mean?
he/him pronouns don’t make you a man
men can't be lesbian, it is not being an ass, it's a fact, if they're exclusively attracted to women they're straight. Saying trans men can be lesbians is so lesbophobic AND transphobic, jesus just think
then they're not trans men??? maybe transmasc, but not men
I’ve never met a trans man that claims to be a lesbian so not sure who I’m supposed to talk to.
The notion that self identification is more important than the history of oppression is covered in my video.

Edit: Yall aint even watching it you just keep downvoting
Yeah that’s a super good point!
Yeah, I personally don't like using lesbian for enbies because, to me, it reinforces the stereotype that they're just quirky girls. that's just my opinion though, IDC what other people want to call themselves.
Ah yeah, I see...but mlm wouldn't include non-binary people, or would it?
There’s wlw as the opposite to mlm, so mlm can’t be the mirror to lesbian.
I think you’re right. I also think there are specific terms within the general “queer” umbrella for variations thereof.
non binary have the word gay and queer lesbian is specific to females that being trans females and afabs non binary means no gender the whole point of non binary is that is neither not that is both thats what a 2 spirit or gender fluid  is for to include both. if you are non binary but are a they/she  that means you are ok with female pronouns.  i am a they/them transman and i have only dated women for years if someone would called me a lesbian or straight id be fucking livid.
From what I've seen people pretty much only apply this logic to lesbians and I think it's stupid
no spoilers !!!!! i just started the series so i'm going in order but i'll probably get to the new episodes soon considering i've gotten through 9 seasons in a month and a half LOL. (also i used to identify the EXACT same way as you, basically up until i started hormones and realized ""huh maybe i actually do want to be a Binary Man"" and ""huh maybe i also like dudes."" you are sooooo valid!)
But he/him lesbians aren’t men…. They’re women or non-binary people who use he/him pronouns. 

Again, pronouns =/= gender.

Edit: Ok with the random blocking me for pointing this out??? Wtf
Someone's pronouns is not equivalent to their gender, they're two different things
this assumes everyone is ok / identifies with queer
pronouns =/= gender
they arent men tho. they are non binary, but still use he/him pronouns. cis women can use he/him pronouns too, and still be cis because pronouns do not equal gender. so if an enby uses he/him, they are still an enby. and the term lesbian isnt just ""women who love women,"" its ""non-men who love non-men."" which means if an enby (not a man) is attracted to women or even other enbies (also not men) then they can use the lesbian label
100% agree.  Men cannot be lesbians.
Also using the terms female and male are very medical and not trans friendly. Women and men work just fine :)
yus trying to draw absolutes is the path to terfdom. enforcing your rigid definition of who is and isn't allowed to call themselves X will never be a good idea when you're talking about a concept as wide as gender or sexuality
Whatever you self identify with. I wasn't saying nonbinary people couldn't be lesbians, I was saying the non-men vs men is a gender binary and that forcing everyone into a binary system is inherently problematic.
No it doesn’t. What part of women attracted to other women or non-men loving non-men includes men?
That there's not such thing as gender sexual identity because gender and sexuality are diferent stuff sexuality labels are just a reflection of your gender and who you are attracted. Not all labels are ""free"" there are labels that only work as being exclusive, because are to denote acomon factor between people under that label/umbrella.  It's like  cis and trans , I can't just label myself as cis. And yes labels can change over time or even disappear. 

Probably concepts as trans and cis will disappear over time if we stop assigning gender at birth and just let people choose their gender. 

In  the case of trans men is there another layer of Perpetuating transphobia and cissexism , the same way that trans women who label themselves as tr*ap do. Or people who say they are trans women/men but their biological gender is... even the intetion not being necesarily the same, not always thought, some times is dificult to let harmful labels go.
well yeah, of course cis people can use pronouns that don't match their gender, most famously butch lesbians going by he/him and fem gay men using she/her. 

cis people aren't going to respect us, even if we cut off all the ""weird"" trans people. look at Pete Buttigieg, he's about as plain white bread of a gay man as you can get, and homophobes hate him. stop trying to get respect from cis people, and maybe read ""Stone Butch Blues""
Wow, so trans women are men now?? You're here complaining about transphobia when *you're* the transphobe
Basically by your logic, I shouldn't be transgender because that perpetuates transphobia. Just because it could cause backlash, doesn't mean people shouldn't identify that way. It's not hurting anyone, so that's a really stupid take.

If you don't care about people's lives, don't criticize people for identifying a certain way. You seem to really give a damn if you find the need to criticize them.
Labels are for actually both to be exclusive and to express our idividualities unfortunately some labels are exclusive. Like lesbian not being a label for men.
Are you lesbian? If not you have no say in who can be use the lesbain label
You don't feel at all like you're infantilizing trans men by saying you know better than them what's good for them and what they should be allowed to vibe with?
Ok so do you first of all understand that pronouns don't not equal gender, and labels are just an easy way of communicating a basic understanding of how you fit in,

A trans man which we understand to be afab he/him  may or may not be on testosterone. Can feel connected to the pronouns he/him but not the label straight or gay or bi. In which case they take the term lesbian,

Whether or not that opposed their manhood or lack thereof is up to them. Giving them the freedom to take what feels right to them while still feeling the love for other afabs.
You clearly don't belong in a space that promotes love and healthy boundaries. Please remove yourself from here, I'm not arguing with you all I'm saying is that people have complicated history with gender and if someone wants to identify as a transman and a lesbian they are aloud to on their comfort alone.
they can identify however they want dude, leave them alone
they’re on the internet, youtube it
Ok , just for the sake of having a discussion, what’s the link?
I guess technicaly not, but there is also nblm which stands for nonbinary loving men. I have noticed people using both mlm and nblm in tags of vids on tiktok to include nonbinary people too.

And there is also equivalent for nonbinary loving women which is nblw.
I won't spoil, I promise! Last night's elim was the most brutal I've ever seen on the whole show, so you're in for a treat. The show is such a good binge, when I first discovered it I swear I watched the first seven seasons in less than two weeks lmao. Such delicious garbage, and the toxic macho energy is extremely entertaining - it's like the opposite vibe of ANTMs drama but just as fun. 

I'm a bit fluid and so it's complicated, lol. Eventually I just stuck with the labels I felt fit me the most - yeah, sometimes I'm a man and that bothers some folks, but eh, I'm finally able to focus on the fact that I feel so GOOD in my body and soul now! The history between trans men, trans masc folks, and lesbians is enough for me to feel like it's alright.
Sorry completely unrelated this this post, where are you guys watching ink master? I watched it a bunch on YouTube a whole ago but if there's a new season is it on something else?
Plus it has some strong ""nb is just woman-lite"" vibes
So, when I say gender sexual identity I mean that someone’s gender identity could be situational. It is possible for a person to present as one gender socially, another gender romantically, and yet another gender sexually. 

For example, there could be a trans man who has no interest in presenting as anything other than masculine while in public. However, this same person could prefer to have a feminine presentation while sexually engaged with female partners. This isn’t to suggest that any particular sexual act would cause a trans man to be a “lesbian”. It’s more an acknowledgment that they may feel more true to themselves as a female when connecting with someone through physical intimacy. 

Is that combination common? Probably not. Is it impossible? I certainly don’t think so. 

At the end of the day, sexuality and gender identity are complex and deeply personal. Someone might find a particular combination of things that resonates most deeply with them and that’s their right. Just like with trans people in general, it’s not necessary for others to understand. All that is required of us is to accept others as who they tell us they are. 

As one last thought, I want to point out that those who would argue that gender and sexuality can only be this thing or that thing, who argue that “words have meaning and you need to abide by those meanings”, who argue that others are obligated to change their presentation for the comfort or benefit of others…those people have always done way more harm to the trans community than anyone who just wants to identify a certain way.
Sorry if I wasn’t making myself clear:

1) I am a trans woman.
2) I am a lesbian.
3) I am 30 years old and very tired.
4) TERFS say “men can’t be lesbians” because it sounds reasonable.
5) What TERFS actually mean is “trans women are men and therefore cannot be lesbians.”

Sorry for assuming you could infer that from context. Young people have no reading comprehension these days.
>I shouldn't be transgender because that perpetuates transphobia

That doesn't make sense, also transgender is not even an identity is a sociological consequence of rejection of you agab.

This is the kind stuff why I stoped being a lib and become leftist, there's not universal set on belifs set on stone, progresive values can be used in a bad way, because almost any value is universal.

I'll put an exaggerated example, imagine justifing someone from a group selling themselves as an slave, the justification is yes they have an history of being slaves , and the outcome is that they get a better life 100× time better than before and their family becomes rich too. Does that mean slavery is good ? No, not at all.

Trans men are men. And lesbianism excludes men. That might change in the future but making an exeption to trans men because HiStOrY is transphobic.
No labels are ""exclusive"". You can't tell someone they're not allowed to use a label.  
  
If someone says someone can't be a lesbian, what's to stop that same person from saying they can't be a man?
yes
I don't think policing people's identities is ever going to be constructive or a good use of our time or effort. All it does is create division and alienate people.  
 Just let people be who they want to be
Yep it's infantilizing trans men and especially queer elders.  


I wonder why the ""It doesn't effect you, do identity your way and let other people do it theirs"" is so hard to swallow
No, it's just the world where more tranphobic and trans elders tend to have a more conservative set of beliefs, that is hard to get rid of. That also happens in conservative places I'm not from America I'm froma conservative country for Americans would be 20 or 30 in the past.
Yes but trans man means you are a man. Not that you use he/him pronouns. You may well use them but you don't have to.

 So a trans man being a lesbian means a man being a lesbian, not necessarily someone who uses he/him being a lesbian.

 To my understanding, lesbian means non man loving non man. How can a man fit into that term? If they can, what meaning does that term hold?
wow
Your argument would be more meaningful if you could define ""lesbian"", as nobody seems to be able to tell what definition you're using.
What in quantum tarnation?  Can I be trans and cis at the same time?
just bc they id with it doesn't mean they are, I really thought transphobia wouldn't be a thing in a TRANS SUB, but damn I was wrong.
I’m not going to dig up YouTube profiles of insane people that think they can identify as male lesbians lol, sounds like internalized transphobia
the problem seems to be if nblm can/does include non binary, nb men, or a gray area of non binary people to an extent, which im sure some people include in their attraction when describing it, there just isn't any specific thing sometimes that describe someone's attraction without including genitals that describes it in all situations, and  some people's aesthetic/romantic/s\*xual attraction may not match exactly. this is why i get frustrated personally when we try to agree what a label means, because sometimes no label is going to be exact, or always correct in every situation which is why they shouldn't be rigid (especially when we talk intercourse with a less serious romantic or relationship aspect.. sometimes the spark is just there and worrying about labels and gender is sometimes unnecessary unless one party isn't feeling ok based on those)
oh i actually think i know the elimination you're talking about, only because i followed said tattoo artist on instagram after i fell in love with their work on a previous season they were on. but it is unironically so affirming to finally be watching all of the ""dude shows"" that i never got to watch when they were airing, and ink master is fun because i'm also an artist (not tattoo, i don't trust myself enough) and watching people bitch about critiques takes me back to my art school days lmao.

but amen brother! that's how i reconciled all those feelings with myself too. like, gender variance has always existed and there is well-kept record of it if you go back and research radical trans and queer authors and their personal accounts of it. rather than dispute who's trans and who isn't, or what one person's sexuality is, we should really just be focusing on ourselves and what makes us feel most at peace.
LOL love how this bad faith question thread devolved into dudes talking about spike tv reality shows. they put all the episodes on paramount plus and renewed it for another season this year, but streaming only and the new episodes hit paramount plus every wednesday i think? personally i mooch off of my friend's account
Exactly
Gender fluity is another thing, I think lumping gender with sexuality or sexuality dependant is something transphobic, that's like one of the things the movement is meant to fighting against. And convoluted explanation doesn't change it.
I used to id as a lesbian before realising I was trans, I'm sorry for assuming you're transphobic, but the spaces I was in weren't usually transphobic, I was always repelled by TERFS. Men can't be lesbians, that's a fact, not everyone who says that is a TERF, but again I understand why you'd think that given your experience.

edit: also you don't need to apologize, we're in a trans sub, I could've given you the benefit of the doubt.
Men can't be lesbians. Point blank.
It's not about policing labels It's just about recognizing some labels are exclusive that cam change with time , but exclusive labels serve to connect people who are part of it.
Recognizing they at the same time fighted but at the same time they perpetuated cissexism and tranphobic beliefs is not infantilizing, on the contrary is criticism to them as adults.
A trans man can be a lesbian if they so desire, just because you label yourself a man does not mean you fit perfectly in that box, it's just easier to describe it to others.

For instance I go by both transwoman and nonbinary because I feel that I fit in both boxes, I still call myself gay in what would actually be a straight relationship should I be cis and my gender.

People feel a complex range of emotions around their gender and being comfortable is the most important part of that.
you’re literally actively being lesbophobic, their identity as lesbians does not affect you, it doesn’t make you any less of a man
ok just don’t talk to me then, i don’t wanna talk to someone like u
""Insane people,"" eh.

Good look.
Thanks hahaha 👌 yeah I'm not here for this kind of discourse at all it's not my problem to police ppl's ID. I just want to watch trash reality shows 🤣
I feel like, when it comes to the use of labels, there is a distinction between the labels others give us and the labels we give ourselves. And I don’t think the labels we give ourselves, when done in good faith, are ever warranting criticism.
Suck my toes you don’t get to tell me what it means to be a lesbians. Stop parroting TERF dog whistles and start considering that strict categories is LITERALLY what queerness is a rebellion against.
But you *are* policing labels.   
  
How can a label be exclusive? It's a word?
So are you saying that a trans man can be a leabian if they are not a man?
Use whatever you want to describe yourself but don’t expect people to like or agree with you.  If you call a trans woman gay for liking men you can expect blowback because you’re saying they’re not a real woman.

You choosing to describe yourself that way doesn’t make it any less fuel for the transphobic fire.
The lesbian identity doesn't include men, it is something that they've fought for years for it to be recognized. It is the only identity that doesn't include men. Can cis men be lesbian??? No? Only trans men? Oh yeah, you're just equiparating trans men to women, because we're ""different"" right?
I mean, how else do you explain this shit?  Why would a trans person express something so obviously transphobic/homophobic?
what 😭😭😭
No what I'm saying is trans men can be lesbians it's their choice to label themselves as they choose.
I honestly think it’s more of a you problem if you have a problem with how someone else you don’t know identifies.

I’ve personally never met someone who identified as trans man and lesbian. Non-binary transmasc, yes.

But that said if I did meet someone, am I going to get into an argument with them and tell them they can’t use the label. No, I’m going to go on with my day. Yaknow?

And I think it’s up to particular lesbian spaces whether they’d allow a trans man. I think it’d be kinda weird, but who am I to judge.
lesbians aren’t women— just go find a trans man lesbian and listen to their explanation, this is fucking pointless
I imagine I would explain it in a way that isn't ableist.
You. Don’t. Get. To. Define. Lesbianism.

And especially not using a terf dog whistle.

And especially not to my lesbian face.

What is so hard to grok here?

There is no hard rules about who can and cannot be a lesbian because it is up to each individual to define what lesbianism means to them.

For instance: I found out I was a woman because I was a lesbian first.

Queerness is all about not having hard rules! You’re transgender for god’s sake! You’re already breaking rules! Stop making new rules!

I’m guessing you’re young. Please just sit back, read a history book, and talk to some old queers. This fight about who gets to be a lesbian? We already had that argument, many years ago.
Then what does the label lesbian mean? I'm sorry but I'm genuinely very confused

Edit: also, is this only trans men or is it cis men aswell? Bcs I don't think I shud matter but I am confused about the other things ur saying and you keep saying *trans* men instead of just men which leads me to belive you think there is a difference. I'm sure you didn't mean anything by it but I'm just looking for clarification.
so labels mean nothing and they’re just a bunch of sounds that people pick for comfort? yeah i don’t buy that at all, sorry.

otherwise i might as well say i’m cis and trans at once. words have meanings and sometimes they simply contradict.
>But that said if I did meet someone, am I going to get into an argument with them and tell them they can’t use the label

And where did I say I'd do that? OP was asking our opinion, I simply stated it. Yes, I do think ""trans men lesbian"" is a transphobic/lesbophobic label and if anyone id's with it, 1- they're going through a gender crisis (which, understandable tbh) or 2- disregard completely both the trans and lesbian community fights."	yfq93h	trans	523	0.87	2022-10-28 14:51:35
Got into an argument with my wife about the new Harry Potter game…	"Have y’all seen the new game? It looks amazing. 

And JK is a fucking TERF. 

Background: I’m genderqueer, present male, and would like to wear more feminine clothing. I have confessed my non-binary gender identity to my wife. She understands. She has made it very clear that she cannot handle me presenting as anything but male.

So I spoke to my wife about how incredible the new game looks and how it seems to deliver on all the delight and promise inherent within the Harry Potter universe, but I’m torn because I don’t want my delight in the game to support a TERF who already uses her wealth and influence to try to make it harder for people to express their gender identity. 

She said she doesn’t care about all that, and the hate for JK is just twitter rage. She decided I didn’t know anything about it all, and I should just be quiet about it. 

I walked away. 

She came back, told me she read JK’s 2020 essay full of dog-whistle rhetoric and said she agrees with 90% of the points. 

I don’t dispute that women need exclusive safe spaces. I don’t dispute that women are disproportionately the victims of abuse. 

Wife told me that she agrees with JK because wife, as a *woman* (emphasis hers), can decide what’s best for women. And that *men*, again emphasis hers, pointing at me, cannot possibly understand the concerns of women. 

Wife proceeds to bring up a bunch of TERF-ish  talking points supporting her position, which I calmly refuted with sources, and she just blew me off. I’m incapable of understanding, you see, because I’m a man. 

We have 2 trans kids. She’s supportive of them, but they’re FtM. She asserts that the current trend (her words) of girls transitioning to men is because it’s not safe to be a girl in our society. Okay. 

My wife has made it very clear that she’s not going to be my ally. My internal life seems like it will have to stay private unless we split up. I suppose that’s sort of a gift.

--------------------

Edit: This blew up in a way I didn't anticipate. Rather than responding to every one of you delightful and concerned individuals who are overwhelming me with support, my wife and I have been negotiating around the edges of divorce for a while now. Issues like this, among myriad others, make it clear that we're not terribly compatible, and things have likely run their course. It's just a matter of figuring out how to end things amicably with minimum impact for the kids (2 mentioned in the post, and a few more...)"	"Your wife is forcing you to stay closeted for her comfort, you have bigger problems than HP, you need an actual divorce.
that's a genuinely kind of fucked up situation to be in. your wife is being extremely dismissive and transphobic to your kids and you, putting her comfort & love of JKR over you all and using TERF bullshit to justify her bigotry. i'm sorry you're in the thick of it. you and your kids deserve better.
I’m a woman and I agree with you.  Women of every flavor deserve to use women’s spaces.  JKR and her legion of terfs are doing the same thing to trans women that white women did to black women during the suffragette movements and it’s disgusting.  Anyone that agrees with anything she has to say is literally siding with white conservative men against other women.  All of those terf talking points are straight from conservative think tanks that are actively trying to strip women’s bodily autonomy.

I’ll gladly sup on their transphobic tears as our trans siblings get more acceptance, rights, and protections.  They will look just like any other hate organizations in the eyes of history.  Children will look back on them with utter disdain and disgust just like we do with the KKK now.
So ah... you need a divorce.

You're wife is bigoted, infantalizing her FtM trans kids, invalidating your identity, and actively keeping you in the closet for her own comfort. There's no salvaging this. You need to make arrangements to split.
Your wife just told you she’s a TERF, but she has a trans spouse and two trans kids? And she calls you a man & claims your kids are part of a ‘trend?’ You’re being forced into the closet and your wife doesn’t believe you or your kids are who you say you are, please get out of there and find a partner who actually cares about your guys’ identities.

edit: spelling
D I V O R C E

Your wife cannot possibly be loving and supportive of you OR your trans kids. She needs a TON of work on herself, TONS of learning and reconditioning...literal years of self reflective ego work, and effort...thats all IF she realises she needs to do it all... Unlikely, seeing as the best way to change someones mind is from the position of good/loving friend/partner, and she is unable to change her mind or understand why she needs to.

Once more... 

D I V O R C E
You have 2 trans boys as kids. You NEED to protect those children from your TERF wife, and I'm sorry, but your wife is a TERF. I hate jumping to ""divorce her"", but this woman is ACTIVELY harming you and your kids with these beliefs. Your duty, as a trans parent to trans children, is to model good behavior and good morals. That means bouncing TERFs out of your life for their protection. You know how dangerous rhetoric like that is. I'm sure you know the suicide risk for kids who don't have supportive parents, and that still stands even if one is a transphobe. By staying with her, you're showing your children that it's okay to have these beliefs, and it WILL harm them.  

For your children's sakes, and your sake, GET OUT. She doesn't deserve to be a mother if she thinks your kids think it's a trend. Your kids deserve better, and so do you. Get. The hell. OUT. If for no other reason than your kids' lives are at risk living with a TERF.
First, your wife is transphobic and you should definitely rethink your relationship for the safety of you and your kids. Second, I was also excited about the game, but I found out that in addition to a neo nazi being heavily involved in dev, the plot is about the goblin rebellion and you get a house elf…IDK if I want to play it now knowing the weirdly racist parts of original HP that have now been recognized as problematic are put in such focus. Just my two cents, would love to hear what you think on the matter.
you need to not be with her to be yourself and she clearly doesnt respect your kids either. it's sad there's people like her
you deserve to be however you are and want to be as do your kids.
your wife is very clearly a terf and not actually supportive or you or your kids. i’m so sorry- focus on protecting your mental health and that of your kids over all else.
Tbh just do you. If she can't handle it that's her problem and she isn't the one, she sounds like an icky person anyway
You need a divorce ASAP. Sounds like her beliefs can be harmful to your children.
Get. A. Divorce.
I'm so sorry to see this and your edit. Sending you so much love, support and solidarity ❤️🖤
I think for the mental health of not it’s you and your trans kids, but the rest of your kids who might be gender non conforming or queer in any way, you should probably get a divorce.

My parents aren’t accepting of me at all, and it’s driven me to some very dark thoughts. Don’t let your wife put your kids in that position. 

Good luck either way though :)
Don't let your wife dissuade you from presenting as female. If she wants, she can fuck right off. She's already shown what kind of person she is: a TERF! She's putting her bs ahead of your happiness.
If she agrees with JK then she’s not supporting her kids
Sorry but your wife can screw off. I dont have patience or sympathy for her or people like her.
I take it that if your children were MtF she wouldn't be be very supportive of them... The problem here definitely lies with her not only being transphobic, but also quite sexist, too. And for her to dismiss anything that you say, while everything she says is automatically correct definitely reminds me of my transphobic parents.
Obviously everyone here is saying to get a divorce, but I personally wouldn't take an action like that immediately. Not saying that you won't have to eventually, but you might want to try other options first.
Fuck J.K. Rowling and fuck anyone who agrees with her.  
I’m so sorry, OP.
Leave her leave her leave her.

She’s a TERF and TERFs aren’t safe spouses or parents for trans folks. Keep an eye on the kids too.
I would also point to JK’s recent support to a trans and homophobic woman called Caroline Farrow who refuses to acknowledge her trans son and refers to him as her daughter. Also Caroline Farrow who has tweeted about hating homosexuality as it’s a sin and is against the non-biblical rainbow. But then supports lesbians because of the trans lesbians out there. 

There are some awful people out there and unfortunately it sounds like your wife is one of them. I feel sorry for your sons having a mother like that. I also seen your edit about the possibility of divorce. I think you do need to seriously consider that and get your sons away from that woman
I don't want to be extremist, but leave her, she is forcing you to stay miserable so she can go on with her stupid fragile nonsense ideologies.
Based on your last sentence, it seems like you're already in the decision to end things with her. If she doesn't support you and eventually won't support your children (judging by the examples of her personality in this post), I would also suggest looking at getting out of the relationship. 

People forget that as humans, we are evolving and changing creatures. We need and deserve to surround ourselves with those who will only add something good to our lives, especially those who are minorities of any degree. Your happiness, mental wellbeing and development are much more important than a relationship where you already sound limited and discontent.

Of course, this is all only judged from this post alone. No matter your choice in the end, OP, I only wish you happiness.
honest advice. I think you should rethink your relationship to someone who is unwilling to support you, and understand your struggles. if you decide to stay, I wish you the best on this, as terfs are usually unable to listen to reason, and seem to be more focused on fighting already oppressed groups than fighting the establishment
Some other Harry Potter things worth knowing about... https://youtu.be/-1iaJWSwUZs )
>Wife told me that she agrees with JK because wife, as a woman (emphasis hers), can decide what’s best for women. And that men, again emphasis hers, pointing at me, cannot possibly understand the concerns of women.

Tell her that as a \*trans\* person, you know what's best for trans people. And that \*cis\* people, point at her, can't possibly understand the concerns of trans people.
I would watch [James Somerton's](https://youtu.be/xLuNGhQPDHM) video on Rowling. She doesn't get paid in royalties from any of the HP franchise products and instead gets a large lump sum as payment up front. 

As such the only harm done is to the game company that signed on to make the game well before Rowling began making transphobic comments. It sucks for them because this was the sink or swim game for them so they couldn't just drop the game.

The company making the game as such has done what they can to distance themselves from Rowling and she's had no input on the game at all. 

Because of that I am ambiliviant on people buying it. On one hand not buying it helps to move the current zeitgeist away from the HP series and in doing so moves Rowling and her veiws away from being seen as relevant. On the other hand a trans positive small game company may very well suffer because Joanne chose to be a bigot after the game was already well into development. 

I lean towards the former as the game will likely do well enough despite people boycotting it but knowing what I know I'm not going to be too harsh on people buying it because a trans positive company is potentially invaluable in it's own right.

Edit: Oh yeah, your wife sounds like she's found herself on the GC pipeline. I'm sorry that your wife is not being supportive and has fallen for gc propaganda.

 Hopefully, you can get through to her with the resources others have provided but if not or if she further ingratiates herself in the GC ~~cult~~ movement then it may not be safe for your sons and yourself.

Given the horrid things gc's say to the cis parents of trans children to try and turn them against their children I would be worried.

 [Calien Conrad](https://youtu.be/pwI6py78gsI) is in the process doing a 3 part deep dive in how gc's do their recruitment and indoctrination and it's honestly eye opening. It's long but it's worth setting aside the time to watch. Best of luck with your spouse.
You deserve someone so much more accepting
Wow this escalated quickly. So you are telling me that your wife not only doesn't view you as any different from a cis man but also your sons as daughters who basically hide from a life as a woman? 
I'm very sorry but you really need to evaluate whether this marriage can have any kind of future. This doesn't sound like a healthy environment for you and your children.
Your wife by the sounds of this doesnt deserve you or your sons.
If she cant handle the way you'd like to present, she isn't a good wife. I'm so sorry. 

Get those kids out of there too.
I have to be honest, this sounds like an incredibly toxic environment. Y'all need to either get some counselling  because that is not an okay situation. And if she's not willing and able to make a change then you owe it to yourself, your kids and even her to end it.
It really seems like she doesn’t know any trans women besides Caitlyn Jenner, and the only picture of trans women “out there in the world” she thinks much of are  those “hulking predatory men,” without realizing we’re just like her. Sending us into the mens room doesn’t keep her any safer, it just puts us in harms way so she can have peace of mind. I hope one day she’ll realize how harmful her mindset is, and officially barring trans women from women’s spaces doesn’t stop or reduce predatory men from forcing themselves in anyway. I’m really sorry you and your kids are having to deal with this in the meantime.
So sorry. Wife is wrong, completely wrong and bigoted. Her reasoning seems completely crooked, ftm yes mtf no?! Like sorry..??? I would almost think she just has this opinion because she doesn’t want you to change. She will never get away with this once your kids grow up and understand what happened...
While everyone else is commenting on the obviously more important issue of your wife’s bigotry, here’s my two cents on less important issue about the game. If you get a used copy you won’t be financially supporting JKR, that’s my plan.
You definitely can’t not transition for her. Even if you don’t go nuts, you’ll resent the hell out of her. My wife and I had a lot of talks and tears. It can work out. Don’t give up hope.  Maybe try counseling?  The kiddos make it worth a shot. 

And on the game, idk, if it gets good reviews then I’ll probably get it.  lots of people other than JK will get $ off the purchase. The gender options seemed a little tone deaf to me. I was thinking about rolling a Female Wizard, as I understand it that means you’ll look like a girl but will room with the boys. It’d be sort of a reflect off howI felt and lived all throughout school.
Mmmm kinda sounds like Misandry and a lot of transphobia coming from her. I’m not one to offer relationship advice but I seriously believe you guys should sit down and discuss your relationship. Only reason I don’t say divorce right away is because obviously you two love or loved each other at some point and that’s why you’re married so speaking on the same level may give you insight into the next step which sadly might just be divorce anyway ;-;

But do not tolerate this behavior from her. If she truly believes all of this, they you’ll just have to say “I’m sorry, I’m not the person for you and you’re not the person for me.”
I have similar problems with my girlfriend. We met before I started my transition and I’m constantly having to prove myself. What I noticed is that she will never really understand and I don’t need to deal with that. I know it must be hard having two children with her and being married is entirely different challenge but please ask yourself if you are safe yourself. The last thing you want is to be hiding yourself because of someone else’s wishes. Regardless of your relationship status or being a parent you need to be yourself unapologetically ❤️❤️❤️
Maybe try couples therapy, if not I think you two are just not too well suited for each other at this point in your lives and it's time to move on :/
Regarding the game, I agree. I've heard that there are ways to _get_ a game without paying for it, especially if you're on PC, but I wouldn't know more about that of course *wink *wink
I’ll just keep peeing in a can in my truck
Divorce and take the kids (jk)
My understanding is that jk rowling will not get anything from this game
Get rid of her
Get the fuck away from her. What a piece of shit human being.
This made me very angry. I have a three word response for her:

FUCK.OFF.BITCH.
There is someone who will love you as you are. And for the woman you are at times. I hope to see that update here at some point. Good luck. 💜💜
>She has made it very clear that she cannot handle me presenting as anything but male.

fr forget the annoying wizard lady, OP you and your spouse have stuff to work out here
This is absolutely right! My wife stayed with me through my transition because, in her words, “You’re still you, and that’s the person I love”. OP needs to leave the situation, because “wife” obviously has no respect for OP at all. This will only get worse in the long run and damage the relationship they have with their sons.
I was crestfallen after I managed to get the courage to speak to her about the way I am inside, and she made it clear she wanted the inside to stay where it is.

We've been together for a long time, and it's very likely we've just drifted too far on our paths. I get a little sad when I think about couples that make it 30, 40 years or whatever, but that's not everyone. And when you're in a position where you start to feel that it would be better to be alone than to feel so goddamn lonely all the time, that's a sign.
Even if OP were a cis man wife was nasty and dismissive of them. Yuck.
Yeah. The goblins are an active slur, aren't they? And if my first option *isn't* to give my house elf a sock, then I'm not okay with it.

I didn't know about the nazi on the dev team. Dang. 

HP gave so many young kids a way to escape the daily little torments of being a kid and live with whatever it was that made them *weird*. It breaks my heart when I think of all the things that make it problematic. Like, it's an amazing wonderful world, but it you stop and think about it for 15 seconds too long, it all falls apart.

The more I think about it, the more I can't feel good about a potential purchase of the game.
couples therapy is an option, but make sure the therapist is trans-inclusive and won’t put you in an invalidating situation based on your gender
I would be perfectly happy to buy her a one-way plane ticket anywhere she likes. Is that the sort of option you're suggesting?
[removed]
Nice! But I wasn’t ready to go nuclear…

Will I ever be ready? Maybe. I’ll have to out myself to my kids first. I’m kind of a coward in this regard, TBH. On a rational level, I know they’ll accept me, but my wounded inner child is afraid of the consequences.
Thanks. I’ll give that video a watch. I always like to learn new things.
Not gonna lie: we definitely have problems relating to each other.
Being trans is such an easy shorthand for ""deviant"" and ""mentally ill"" that's seeped into the culture. As I understand it, Rowling wrote a trans villain into one of her mystery novels? Stupid, lazy shorthand. Really tipped her hand there.

I lived through the time of Matthew Shephard. He was two years younger than me. Me and my queer friends were actively harassed whenever we went out in Dallas. I've seen bad guys. The bad guys weren't my friends. We just wanted emotional and physical safety. The bad guys were the assholes protected from any real consequence by a gay-bashing society.

Fewer Caitlyn Jenners. More Eddie Izzards. That would be a good start. More visible role models who aren't taking any shit.

Sorry. Rambling.
There's an idea. Though the developers seem to be doing so much to take a lot of the toxicity out of the world for this game. Several of the choices shown in the ""State of Play"" video were obviously selected to demonstrate that. So, *they* certainly deserve support. But they still have house elves... And the goblins have always been a problem. I'm probably going to end up avoiding it. Rowling just makes me ill.
Thank you for the kind words and insight. I need to figure out how to navigate this. I'm going to start with wearing things that make me feel better underneath my current social uniform. We'll see how it goes from there.
Thinking about it more, if I can't give my house elf a sock, then I'm not going to consider it. There are enough strikes that I just can't feel good about it.

As for the therapy, I think this ship has sailed. I'm not quite giving up yet, but it's hard to muster the will to try any more.
Why ""JK?"" This person absolutely needs a divorce, and their children should not be with their mother.
Literally anything that has harry potter in its name will make jk money. That being said, for anyone who wants to play the game but not support her, you can check out r/piracy for safe ways of doing it.
No JKR is not involved in the game's development. She does profit off of it though as it uses her IP.
promoting & buying that game (and other HP merch) keeps her in the public consciousness, making investors want to invest in her and people approve of her because she's attached to media they like. she uses the money and power that affords her to hurt trans people.
Yeah like…holy shit. I can’t help it this this woman is going to cause (or has already caused) trauma for their two trans children. Since she obviously doesn’t view bring trans as real and had to find some TERFy excuse as to why FtM people exist.
Kid comes first. That is the deal you sign when you create them and/or agree to watch over them. Unconditional love. And if you truly love your child then you ALWAYS second guess every decision involving them no matter how right you think you are because a lot of the time being right isn't even really the true issue. You are supposed to playing the long game which should be more about not leaving marks than bashing the clay into shape. When you bash things they tend to explode. All real parenting is done by example anyway. If you lead and they don't follow it is probably because they have a will and life of their own although there is always the possibility that your way just sucks? If you aren't always keeping that in mind you aren't doing it right.

Sorry if this seems ranty, its really just general parenting advice that should apply to most things.
>She made it clear she wanted the inside to stay where it is.

OOF. 💔 I wish I couldn’t relate to this. But unfortunately I’m guessing many of us here *can*. As hard as it might be, we have to let go of the people who are unwilling to see us for who we truly are. Otherwise we’re just letting them take up the space of the ones who would.
Nah. I was just trying to be a bit more optimistic about her understanding, however I know from experience that it's very difficult for that to happen. Do what needs to be done, and best of luck.
? I think I misunderstood something, I was refering to her transphobic ideologies, or am I just confused?
what are you, OP's wife?
Being scared to come out is completely valid. I couldn't admit I was trans and accept it til I was 17 despite my mom being very supportive since I was 13. Take your time and I definitely recommend seeing a therapist. And remember, you're a valid bean deserving of love and respect 💖
Eddie Izzard isn’t a saint by any stretch of the imagination as she defended JKR.  She’s more interested in defending folks under attack in her social strata than standing up for trans folks.

https://news.sky.com/story/amp/jk-rowling-isnt-transphobic-says-gender-fluid-eddie-izzard-12177312
I’m a supporter of you! I’m sure you got this but know we are here ❤️
This is precisely the point my eldest child was suggesting.
For better or worse HP isn’t going anywhere 
I’d rather people enjoy stuff that they like and let the relationship with the author die than try to extinguish the giant franchise
I understand. The kids don't have to seek my approval. They know that they have it unconditionally. They're not afraid to speak their mind with me. They don't fear repercussions. If they say something hurtful or generally tone-deaf, we talk about it. If I say or do something stupid, they call me out. I think we have a good relationship. They're wonderful people whithout a great deal of experience. So, we work together -- me and the kids -- to help them get the experience they're going to need to be independent, functional adults. 

What's more (and this is the part I'm really happy about): they're *kind*.
A logical extension of the “rule of no”. 

You have to say no to a thousand things, so you can say yes to the really important few.

Goddammit.
death of the author is all well and good if the author is dead and/or doesn't benefit socially or financially. pirating a game is ethical, buying fanmade merch is ethical, but no one should expect trans people to be comfortable with anyone advertising their enjoyment of a franchise made by the UK's premiere transphobe.
Sounds like you've got it! Sorry to hear about your situation. I've been with my almost 30 years. She has BPD which she treated with alcohol for years until it almost killed her. That turned her around and we've been headed back up ever since. With you on the kindness thing too, its one of the best yardsticks and how I met my wife.
Being honest, I'm not sure, but she is trying to force them to present how she wants them to present, says that trans people are justs a trend and agrees with J.K Rowling and is generally telling them to hide who they is, I thought it was safe to assume she was somewhat transphobic
Buying most good isn’t ethical. 
If you want to fight that fight it’s fine
But I’m not going to be mad if others don’t
[removed]
Believing that trans people are just a trend, that J.K Rowling is right or that trans women are a threat to cis women is a transphobic belief, so I will gladly take that advice you just gave me and throw it out the window, there are moments when you shouldn't assume anything, but there are moments like when your wife is literally ranting about trans people or saying we're a trend when you can already know what she thinks, you could talk her out of it, people can change, but if she is forcing you to be someone you are not because it makes her uncomfortable then she is not worth it."	ti1rxc	trans	522	0.94	2022-03-19 18:41:13
Progressive Insurance Welcomes Me to Wonderful World of Womanhood	I recently got all my identity documents switched to my chosen name and correct gender.  With those in hand, I was excited to update all my financial, insurance, and other accounts.  I wasn't so excited to discover that Progressive increased my auto insurance premium by $24/year solely because the gender marker on my policy changed.  Thanks Progressive!	"Take that TERFs! Actuarial tables don't lie.
I’ll never forget the day I got a letter reminding me to get my cervix checked. 🤗
FTM insurance agent here, shop around! There’s a ton of shopping happening right now because every company is changing rates.
Same thing happens to me. I changed my gender marker to F with progressive and ended up paying more for no reason. Sexism exists In The insurance world.
But aren't women less likely to get into accidents and usually cheaper on insurance?
That's very odd. Women actually pay less for insurance than men on average. Definitely look into that.
Welcome to the party, pal!
Weird. Usually women pay less because they don't take as many stupid risks....
Oh great, I have progressive. Doesn't sound very progressive of them 😕
wow Progressive is being so progressive here /s
lol yes! Geico dropped my rate $120/ year just for changing my name! xD
It *might* be because you had to go back through underwriting (new policy instead of change to existing policy, even if policy # stays the same). Once you have a policy it is locked in at the rates and tables they filed with the state but a new policy means they have to use current filings and their numbers change all the time.

Of course, if it is gender related, that's fucked up fr.
Just keep changing companies every year, or whenever your policy increases again.

Pain? Absolutely. But you keep everyone on their toes and stop losing a ton of money on price gouging.
No Accidents or tickets and my premium magically went up 50% without me knowing about it. Company is garbage at best. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
As a trans(mtf) accountant…. THIS
I bet that threw you for a swervix!
Well, did you get your cervix checked? /s
Thank you.  I've been thinking about doing that for a while, and now I have all the motivation I need to follow through.
Well what the fuck. I was looking forward to a reduced insurance cost!
This is what I suspect.  Sexist AF!
Sexism is not a logical thing- nor is any form of discrimination.
I wonder if they take into account the fa t that you are trans and assume that makes you a worse driver. Either way it's complete bs. Everyone should be paying the samw until an event like an accident, or some safe driving savings happen.
Yes!  This!  It's well documented that women are less likely to engage in risky behaviors, so shouldn't it follow that women should receive a discount on their auto insurance?  Something seems fishy here.
Wait. Really?!  Geico here I come!
Interesting.  I can see this being the case. It’s similar to when I moved, my rate changed, because my new address triggered a different risk profile. Still sexist af though.
Asking the real questions.
Good luck! (Also some companies don’t run MVR/CLUE until after you buy the policy, make sure they run those before you commit! And ask very directly about temporary discounts)
Same here. Already had insurance freaking dysphoria, now there isn’t even an option to have the lower rates of women? 


I’m unreasonably upset by this, and am off to shower. Odds are this is probably all I’ll be thinking about, and may even shed a tear. So much for my baking euphoria
Yeah, no. I don’t know if it was because rates were higher with women, or people who transition in general, but my experience was that it became much more expensive. When I asked the rep why it was so, they said that it was algorithmic and that they were locked into the price that was now showing after sex marker change.
tbh yeah the only ""justification"" (ie it's still bullshit but is the least totally nonsensical explanation) is that trans people are more likely to be victims of random violence and therefore are, in the eyes of any disgusting vile corporation in a predatory industry, greater liabilities.
Women usually do have lower priced insurance. I was honestly going to notify my insurance asap to get that titty discount but now I'm thinking twice"	tl35jf	trans	503	0.99	2022-03-23 17:31:16

I spent the day with trans people and a trans author at college then watched a conference from that author who wrote a book about trans identity in the middle ages, it was a good day 🥰		"What book is that?
Sounds lovely !
That sounds amazing! Happy for you and ever so slightly jealous 😊
i like your shirt :)
Soo cool
Wow, your really pretty.
Wow that makes me feel like my day was lame I just sat around getting stoned with a friend but to me today was a good day
It's a French author, the book is named ""Les genres fluide, de Jeanne d'Arc aux Saint•es trans"" but I'm pretty sure it's not translated in English
Well indeed it's great but it's incredibly draining all my energy and socially/emotionally difficult, I had a panic crisis that almost caused me to faint... But it was great anyway XD
Was about to ask the same question. I'll have to keep an eye open to see if it ever gets translated.
Thanks for the reference!!
OK I really don't understand what you mean that today was a great day or my day was lame compared to yours
The author is called Clovis Maillet if you want to search more, he's super nice btw really someone good
No I meant that yesterday was good but there were difficulties too
Well my day was awesome but I feel like I put on a bit of weight from how bad my munchies were I'm pretty asocial so I prefer to do things either in small groups or on my own and I'm not that into books unless it's the kind a child would read I like my books how I like my friends simple to understand and uses small easy to understand words I'm an absolute bimbo sometimes and I have a dumb inner voice that tells me to do something dumb like you should hook up with that random guy over there in the club toilets

(MTF) Went to college with fake breasts for the first time to try to make my body match my gender identity (sorry it’s a bit difficult to get a good angle on camera) basically the MTF equivalent of wearing a binder for the first time		"Congrats! Really happy for you. I thought about going to college with a bra today but I'm still too scared :/
Your blond hair is beautiful
And you say I'm beautiful. Clean your mirror 💕
I’m also an MTF college student. I handle my top by wearing a tight bra with inserts (just started spironolactone, haven’t started estrogen). You go girl!
My guess is you are an amazing person.
you look amazing!
SO PREETY OMFG!!!!! <3 !
You look great girl. Congrats! You have sexy eyes.
Julie
Congrats! I've been wearing bralettes publicly but just upgraded to a full bra with breast forms. It's scary and exhilerating at the same time. Like the breast forms aren't that big, but they feel like they're twice as big haha. I'm kinda caught between ""i wanna look more feminine"" and ""holy shit that's too obvious, someone at work is gonna notice D:""
Congraaaaats girl! 🥂 And such a cute mask!
That looks good baby girl,  it will do for now is what i always say.
Awe it’s okay. You do stuff in your own time. I just started this class a few days ago so I thought I should just rip the bandaid off so to speak, and I’ve asked my teachers to call me female, I’ve started wearing makeup and speaking in a more feminine voice that I had been practicing in quarantine.

I figured if I make it clear who I am now, it’d be a lot easier than if I tried doing it later when everyone in my class would already have an idea of who I am. Then I’d have to try to get people used to seeing me how I look with breasts or makeup etc. Also then people would use my old name an all that. This was just the perfect time for me, I’m sure you’ll find your time.
Thank you so much <3
I haven’t started HRT yet, I’m on a pretty long waiting list to see a gender clinic that can prescribe that to me. So I’m just making do with what I’ve got for now
Awe thank you so much
Thank youu <3
Thank you <3
Thank youu <3 my mum actually made it for me. She really enjoys sewing stuff and has been “feminising” some of my clothes for me like adding flairs to the ends of sleeves or turning some of my shorts into short shorts
Yeah, that's a really good idea. I might try that at university. Thanks ☺
Np <3
Oh wow, sorry you have to deal with a long waiting list. I’m actually really lucky; I attend a super liberal college that has a health center which prescribes hormones for gender transition  based on an informed consent model (meaning that they ask why you want hormones, then inform you of the risks, take bloodwork to make sure it’s safe, and once that happens, you can start the prescription when you want).
damn I have to wait at least a year to see someone who can prescribe anything to me. At least according to the doctor who I talked to about it, she was very helpful and seemed supportive"	iqrw6h	trans	482	1.0	2020-09-11 14:48:20
Rant about cisgender ignorance	"I (FtM) am actually starting to genuinely hate cis people. I know its 'not all cis people', and 'their trying their best' ect, ect, but the vast majority of cis people I know are so infuriating when it comes to my identity. I have cis friends who will deadname me and invalidate me for the purpose of a joke; saying ""oh I dont hit girls"" or just straight up telling me ill never be a real man or finding my deadname to be the funniest thing ever and so they repeat it over and over. Although I present fairly masculine, im not medically transitioned at all so I have a pretty high voice and a more feminine figure ( though I do bind) and recently there was this guy ( a straight cis male ) who confessed to me about having feelings. I told him that I was a guy in which he responded ""I don't believe you!"" and when I told him I was transgender he said ""so the tiddies are fake?"" (implying that I was transfem). The whole situation is making me feel suddenly very insecure about how well I bind. I feel like I have a fairly high tolerance to cis people constantly misgendering and deadnaming me, but im just about at the edge. When I do say things like ""ugh, cis people can be SO annoying"" I immediately get attacked for ""grouping all cis people into one category"" or ""being to sensitive""."	"-guy

ah must be transfem ….wtf? idek what logic there. also fake tiddies? I hate that weird assumption transfems have fake tiddies and not real ones that grew
If they refuse to accept you for who you are they aren’t your friends
(( This might be a sensitive topic ))

I’m a transman and a big one I have is literally when I say “I wish I could just be a girl” and my friends always get confused and say weird things like “then why are you trans?”… This is such a big part of being trans that’s very misunderstood — the supposed “choice” of being trans. I didn’t choose this… and OBVIOUSLY also as a gay man, it would have been easier to be a female. But I choose to be who I am and transition. I find no shame in leaning into my desire and doing drag but people find it so confusing that a transman is now crossdressing. BEING TRANS ISN’T A CHOICE !!
Er, wtf? Those people are not your friends... Have you told them how you feel about them misgendering you? If they continue to invalidate you and hurt you like this then, they really don't care.
Can we add when you start to flirt with the opposite gender and they respond, ""Oh sorry I'm not gay"" to the list.

Seriously though, screw those people. You are totally valid in being upset at them. I'm not even in your situation and I'm upset at them.
Honestly, that is what cost me all of my irl friendships was me getting fed up abt the trans jokes or having shit talked abt other queer people but always going ""but we respect you""; like thanks for saying you don't go after me because you know me, but have no issue attacking others. And it ended in ""you've gotten too sensitive and we can't joke around you anymore"" out of my just asking for basic respect. Then they go full on Shocked Pikachu when I didn't want to be with them anymore.

People who don't and won't have our experiences don't get it because, and especially with The Cishets ™️, everything is okay to joke about until you stand up; then nothing is and you're a stick in the mud.

The friends who get and love you will always do so, and they will stay. Don't taint your heart around people you need to wear a mask with.
Sorry, I skipped out on swimming today because I took a regular top I mistook for a swim top. I’m a transfem enby, and I didn’t want to be subjected to a bunch of staring. Most of my interactions with cis people are normally fine but some cis people are incredibly rude, they stare or threaten or insult, and even a lot of allies only offer surface level support if it doesn’t inconvenience them. It isn’t all cis people though, and we can try to be as accurate as possible with language because it sucks when cis people blame all trans people for the act of an individual, and we can be better than that.

I get it though, there’s a lot of valid complaints to be made about the behaviour of cis people in general
jesus, cis people are incredibly annoying… in my house, i’ve got “i accept you, i guess, but you’re too young to know” and “transgender people are freaks of nature!!! you’re an abomination!!! there are only two genders!!! if i was trans i would kill myself!!!” and i’ve got to just *deal with it*. i’m telling you, little kids are more understanding than certain cishet teens/adults.
I feel this in my soul. Someone who claimed to be an ally compared me to a man the other day even though I look nothing like a man anymore and it’s not sat right with me since. Cis people are the worst lol
Get new friends. Unfortunate as it is, if they repeatedly deadname, incorrectly gender you, use the wrong pronouns, make your transition the butt of their jokes and make you feel self conscious about yourself - they are not people worth hanging around.

And you need to tell them that - how you feel. Then leave them.

As hard as that is, I don’t know how long they have been your friends, it’s very easy for me to say this without the attachment you might have to them but if you are writing all this then you might need to reflect on what your friendship means to them and their friendship means to you.
ik what u mean fr
I feel you king, my friends have also used my deadname as a joke. Its beyond painful, cis people really are just fucking twisted.
We live, actually...we barely survive in *their* fucked up world. I know how people are not the enemy, their concepts are, but they are the ones who, by convinience of the world, step over us. I don't think I can actually be in a relationship with a cis person, and maybe that is because in my core I know that to all of them I will never really be a person but a thing. Tbh, every group is a collection of people and people (we) suck, the amount of disgust inside our community among ourselves is also a fucking shitty thing. But cis people still are the other side, the one on top, and anyone of them, being a supposed ally or full on JRK of life, live through the mechanisms which build our misery. 

So yeah, I kinda feel I have my reasons to hate cis people too. It's like [""Plato's Allegory of the Cave""](https://youtu.be/1RWOpQXTltA).
Oh yeah, dude, i get that! /gen

And when cis people say stuff about trans people being ""wrong"" or something like that, they get support for saying that, a round of applause or whatever.

I once got called confused for being trans, uh I'm sure I am trans, not confused, that'll be all my other aspects tho, I'm oftentimes really confused in a lot of things but definitely not my gender identity, which I have carefully reflected for a loooong time! That bigot thought that all trans people are confused, it's not that easy to find out that you're trans in a lot of cases, so we're definitely not confused... /lh
I feel ya. There are thankfully exceptions but I always have my guard up around most cis people because I know the vast majority of them will end up misgendering me and not on accident. Also I know the vast majority of cis people have such vastly different experiences to me that they will never understand me and I mean that not as in they won’t get me on some deep level but the most basic facts of my existence are incomprehensible to them, like my gender or my pronouns or why I feel so uncomfortable for example when being forced to use gendered toilets or why the sports I do being gender segregated bothers me so much. They don’t understand gender dysphoria or euphoria and they don’t understand why I’m doing all of this and I sometimes feel like they might as well live on a different planet than me. So even when they aren’t being intentionally transphobic they’re most likely going to be unintentionally transphobic or are gonna see me as this person who is only nonbinary and nothing else and who they’re gonna ask to explain things until they are completely exhausted. The cis people who aren’t like that, usually those that already spend time around trans people a lot are rare
concerning thing, I get this exact kind of shit from *trans* people
It sounds like you should find some new friends. They clearly are not supportive. In NYC, our circle of friends would never act like this toward any one of our trans friends. Can I ask what part of the country/world you live in?
This is so true to how it is but from my experience it's not even just cis people sometimes and it's like they want to treat you like some sort of animal or collectors item that they control as if we aren't independent. And I mean sometimes this is caused by people just not really understanding but it can get really annoying and degrading. In your case however if they aren't taking you seriously and you have sat down and talked to them about it already they are just being plain rude. Please don't get me wrong, I do believe in the individuals freedoms but there are certain things where it's like yeah you  are allowed to those opinions and actions but you can be entitled to those without me being your friend.
I know how you feel as another ftm, I’m absolutely petrified of being in public, I’m always so worried someone will call me “ma’am” or just straight up harass me- but I promise those people ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. If the people who are meant to make you feel safe are bullying you and making you uncomfortable, you need to cut ties with them
Honestly it sounds like you hang out with high school douchebags. You might consider changing your friend group. Not categorically, but some of the worst offenders.
Those ain't your friends, man. That whole group is toxic and staying with them is only gonna hurt your mental health.
Hey, cis woman here. Please hear me out. We suck, I am more than aware of that. Like, wholeheartedly, we’ve been fuckin’ assholes. The whole reason I’m on this subreddit is to try and understand the community better so that I can be a better friend to my trans siblings, and get advice on how I can help them.

Here’s my little bit of advice. Your “friends” seem like bigots, they might not be the people for you. Please discuss it with them, let them know how it makes you feel, and if they don’t stop, leave, they don’t deserve your friendship. 

You don’t have to listen to what I have to say, but if you would like any advice on how to proceed, I am more than happy to give it. Don’t hesitate to ask.

You’re doing great.
- A
Wow wtf they aren’t friends. They are people one would only talk to if one was a masochist. Seriously you need better friends
I threatened to beat the shit out of my coworker for deadnaming me ""as a joke"". He never did it again after that.
Hi, 

I'm a cis woman. That sucks, and tbh, it sounds like your friends should respect you. They sound like arseholes. I'm friends with a trans man and myself (nor his other group of friends) would never deadname him or say such things. In the past, when I have accidentally misgendered him, I say ""sorry about that, I meant he"" and then pass over it. He doesn't like me to make a big deal, nor do I want to. 

It would be ignorant of me to say ""get new friends"" because it can be hard, but your current friends do seem to be awful. I don't know what else to suggest, but I just want you to know that there are people out there who would love to be your friend and would respect you and your identity. 

My partner is a trans woman and some of her friends ""don't get it"". Like when she came out, her best friend said ""I'm here for you, my man"". He wasn't even being horrible, he genuinely just doesn't ""get it"". My partner had to put boundaries in place and talk it out with him. It was a long and often arduous process, but her friends are getting better at respecting her. 

I can understand why you're frustrated. :( X
I’m not gonna lie I’m feeling the same way especially with the LGB folk who are apart of the withouttheT movement. I had no idea there were so many LGB who hate us and do the same with misgendering/deadnaming/misogyny. I’ve been really having a hard time dealing with as of late
Dude these are not your friends. No friend, even cis would talk to you and treat you like that. Dump them.
Do you know that meme that shows a picture of philosophers talking with a caption above that says “Talking to other trans people about gender’?   To the right of it is a photo captioned, “Talking to cis people about gender.” It shows a nursery school teacher showing a basic toy to a 2-year-old and the child reaching to grasp it.  [Here it is](https://www.ousa.ca/blog_being_an_ally) if you’ve not seen it. 

I really strive at not wasting my energy on idiots, letting them space inside my head - and believe me there are quite a few of them out there.  

I sense that you are a young person -?   I was a teen and in my early 20s in the 80s and too afraid to say I was trans.  What I encountered as someone visibly male but who had some feminine interests and qualities is that people, “friends” insisted I was really gay and just hadn’t figured it out yet.  It actually got rather toxic.  I was dating girls and these “friends” were insisting I go out with a guy friend who had a huge crush on me.  I abandoned that whole group of friends because they seemed incapable of letting me life as I wished.  

Of course, I knew they were reading my transness and mislabeling it but back then, there wasn’t a broad understanding about the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity - there often still isn’t. 

I hope you can come to a place where you find your people, a group of true friends.  That may take relocating to a new town or a city one day.  People only come to a place of understanding, kindness, and empathy if they are willing - trying to reason with unwilling people and fretting because they won’t change is a bit like hitting yourself in the head with a hammer and then being angry at the hammer.  I just don’t engage with people unless they really are curious and show a sincere willingness to learn about my experience.  Otherwise, I won’t even waste my anger on them.
How you bind and how you present is irrelevant to how good friends should and will treat you. Ya know?
Wow, I think you need new friends. That's complete utter bullshit would they joke about a friends weight? Or a person's skin tone? Seriously, none of that is ok!!
Well I can tell you as a ""good ol boy"" ""red neck"" type cis guy, we had a buddy growing up we'll call Mary. Now when I met Mary he explained what trans was and how all of that worked and Mary was our bro. Then one day Mary was ready to become Jeff. The learning curve was tough for a bit because I always knew him as Mary but me and all the guys learned. My point in telling you this is if your friends are being dicks about it they don't sound like friends to me. As to your other point about the guy hitting on you and questioning your identity,  for that all I can offer you is my sympathies. I know it must be incredibly difficult for you and I'm sorry.
I don't think these people are really your friends; most of my friends are cis and none deadname me, sure they occasionally messed up my pronouns a couple of times (which tbf I haven't done anything to pass), but immediately corrected themselves. Some of them don't exactly understand as well as others, but even they will correct other people if I get misgendered. Ofc I also have some ""friends"" in the category yours are but we have very low interactions with each other to begin with; all in all I would say most cis people are more ignorant about the subject due to lack of exposure, but I hope u can find some friends who don't do that to you.
Personally I don't think that's being too sensitive you have a right to how you feel
I’m so sorry! That’s terrible that he would say that. I’m MtF and so far I haven’t had many problems. I do get people calling me sir every now and then because of my voice and I hate it but I haven’t had anything too crazy happen. I think maybe men just aren’t as accepting to trans men as women are to trans women? Maybe they feel threatened or something?
Listen it is okay to hate the ignorance but don’t all cispeople. For just as us they have no control over their identity. Plus it’s hard for someone to understand something they’ve never experienced. What needs to happen is we need to spread awareness of this ignorance and further campaigns spreading empathy towards trans people. Hate is learned and ignorance is a deficiency in learning. So the key would be to break out of the stereotype. To show the cis people evidence that we are just like them. Except we evolve like Pokémon.
Those aren't you're friends. Those are ignorant assholes. If they don't accept you for who you are and joke about you're identity. They're not your friends
Get new friends. They're not your friends and they only keep you around because they're insecure and need something to make fun of. They're assholes and cut them out of your life
You need new friends my dude.
They will not change. 
They'll just continue to hurt.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I went through it on a smaller scale with people I thought were my best friends. I have tig ol biddies and a bad back and can't bind. I let them go, for that and other reasons, because I just couldn't feel uncared for anymore. Letting go of my old friends hurt and hurts still, and I'm still working on getting new friends. But it doesn't hurt as bad as the people who were supposed to support me tearing me down.
I feel ya on the not wanting cis friends. It's tiring and painful.
I hope you find peace king <3 you're valid and deserve respect
I think your friends suck ass. Just like with family, friends who make you uncomfortable and unsupported aren't worth sticking around to.
Although with your friends it's easier to get rid of them by ending your friendship.
You deserve better people around you than them.
brother, i have nothing to say, i just wanted to picture myself with that 'bruhther' accent
I’m sorry, I will never understand what your going though but the cis people at your school are the worst, I’m cis (like for now I’m thinking about she/they) and I hope I am never that horrible, the people at your school suck ass
I feel you… even the best intentioned people are just ignorant about trans/gender issues and make no effort to “do the work”. When I came out and explained how I don’t wanna hear my deadname anymore, my sister in law thought it would be a good idea to launch into a commentary about how my deadname was really unisex (it’s not) and I could have kept it. And when I ask her to stop talking about it she unleashed a tirade about how intolerant *I* am. And then there are people like my parents, who claim to have read up on these things but then give me inquisitive looks when I mention dysphoria. Or my dad, who (in between misgendering me) tried to convince me that I was too sensitive when I complained that a stranger on the street called me a shem*le. I meet more women who are educated about these things, but I’ve pretty much given up on cis men altogether.
I sometimes just wanna say ”I hate cis-people” eventhough I know it’s not all.
They’re just so unknowing of our situation and they always judge (depending on who they are) you just because of how you look or sound. Like who are you to care if someone has different genitalia than what they want. Like I don’t understand why cis people can be so annoying.
One cis dude said “How come you’re transgender if you didn’t had surgery?” when I told him I’m non-op… like I’m done.
1. Those cis ""friends"" don't deserve the title of friend because they aren't just ignorant they are transphobic if they think causing a trans person discomfort or trauma is funny. And 2. I'm sorry that other cis ignorant people's dumb little comments about your body make you feel dysphoric and shit I'm so sorry. Just remember you are loved and you are strong. There are stupid people out there and that's not going to stop and if it did what else would we have to rant about without them/jk
You know you are a man and that's all that matters nobody else validation matters as much as your own I know others words are important as well but your view of yourself is what really pulls you through.
Honesty dude I totally get it. It can be really exhausting to deal with people who treat you like that all the time. I’m really sorry and I hope those people either get a grip or you find better people to call friends.
This is a shitty thing your friend circle is doing. Part of it might be age: teenagers often don't understand how hurtful their little jokes can be. Part of it is certainly that most of them don't understand what it's like to be trans.

However, since most of the other commenters have sympathized with the phenomenon of cis people being jerks, I want to counterbalance that with another thought.

Stereotyping cis people as transphobes can rob you of many potential supportive, loving friends.

I came out publicly over the past couple of months. The vast majority of my social connections are cis. They don't know what it's like to transition. But they're also respectful and caring. They don't make these jokes or deadname me. They only misgender me out of habit (since they've known me as a man for so long), but correct themselves when they notice or when I point it out. They've been nothing but respectful and supportive. They have made the experience much easier than it might have been.

Now I'm not trying to make you feel bad since your friends are not respectful the way mine have been. I'm pointing out that the problem is not that your friends are cis. It's that they are immature/disrespectful/ignorant/whatever.

It's true that transphobia is deeply rooted in our collective unconscious. But so is racism. So is sexism. Being a good ally is possible, even though you'll probably still sometimes say and do racist or sexist or transphobic things. That's true of all of us. The key difference between being friend material or not is whether a person is willing to be corrected when it happens.

Retreating to groups like this where cis people are rare helps us heal, but please try not to let your experience engender in you a stereotype of cis people as inveterate transphobes. Decent cis people are not as rare as it sometimes seems.
That shit happens to me all the time and I am medically transitioning. It drives me crazy that so many cis people are so stupid that they can’t learn new things. How I hear most cis people: “Mommy and daddy told me that gender and sex is the same thing 40 years ago and that’s simple and I can’t handle complex thought.” It doesn’t matter how much scientific evidence trans people have or how much they know it hurts our community, they refuse to even consider own side.
once i was hanging out with a friend and she was ranting about boys (which idc about) and ig she thought i was offended so she said “but yk.. just the real men” and my day was ruined
Know how you feel. At my old school I had a group of cis friends who would repeat my dead name over and over and over again just to insult me because I upset them. At my new school, I've repeated my pronouns over and over and over again (at least 10+ times) and people STILL misgender me as if on purpose. I'm right at the edge of hating cis people too.
It sounds like you have awful friends. I cant imagine treating someone I consider a friend like this. I'm sorry :(
I feel this and so much rage attached.

Recently needed to get some meds and because the pharmacist believed that there are only two kinds of genitals and assumed my gender and then my genitals, I had an argument w them. I finally admitted that I am trans and then even there they assumed the wrong direction and I was wtf I just need this meds. I anyway know better than u....

Also fuck your friends, who are deadnaming you, that sounds horrible and so disrespectful. Even if an AFAB transmasc would look high femme this would not be ok at all or change a thing in regards to how fucked up and disrespectful this is. I think u should literally just punch them in their faces...
I mean the obvious thing to do is getting new friends, you deserve people who respect your identity. Of course that's easier said than done so I'll just wish you good luck and send you a virtual ghost hug. Hang in there my dude! <3
It depends who you talk to. These people are transphobic and u should leave them or ur just gonna hang around ppl who make u feel shit. Like ppl who are educated about it are in the majority more so nowadays. Many cis ppl I know get it and respect it depends on the person.
So the way I see it, you’ve got a few options, some are mutually exclusive, some aren’t. 

Firstly, learning the art of not giving a fuck, and I’m not saying this as a criticism to you, it’s a tough thing to learn. Life is full of well meaning people who *think* they’re helping. They’ll pester you about anything that seems out of the ordinary, or even things that are just different from them. Then there are the assholes, we’ve all met some of them. Both of these groups can sour a good day if you let them, but you gotta remember that you are who you are and they can’t change that. If they don’t like that, they can fuck off. If they aren’t willing to accept you for who you are, then they aren’t worth being a part of your life, which leads me to the second thing. 

I have a hard time telling whether or not your friends are just ignorant, or downright assholes. With them, there are generally two paths you can take (though there is a third path of doing nothing). You can simply move on to better people. If they’re knowingly treating you like shit, then move on. It sucks having to find new friends, but its better in the long run. The second option is to sit down and talk to them. You explain to them what it means to be you and who you are. You tell them what is and isn’t aceptable treatment. If they’re ignorant and care about you as a friend, they’ll listen, if they don’t care, then it’s probably best to move on. 

To give a personal anecdote, I’m almost blind. I’ve got a visual impairment caused by underdeveloped nerves. There is no cure, and glasses/contacts don’t help. I could try and describe how much I can see, but it wouldn’t give you the full picture because i have no reference of “normal.” This state of weaker eyesight is how it’s always been for me, so without experiencing it though my body, you wouldn’t truly be able to understand. Now why is this important? I have had many experiences dealing with ignorant sighted. When I was younger, my friends would hide my stuff because they thought it was funny. It’s not funny. The punchline to that joke was an unspoken “look! She can’t see!” They weren’t trying to be mean, they were just ignorant. I ended up telling them that pulling shit like that was not acceptable and they stopped. Another time, I was thanking a different friend for being so understanding about my eyesight and helping me when I need it. She told me “the truth is, I don’t understand, your eyesight is so different that I probably won’t ever understand it. I just try my best to help when I notice you struggling with something and I’ve been trying to understand what you can and can’t see.” 

These two examples show ignorant people compared to a person who was doing her best to understand something different from her. You are right, though. It is easy to bundle everyone and disregard them. For you the ignorant cis, for me the ignorant sighted. But you must remember that some of them are genuinely trying, they just need someone to help them understand a little better. Others are assholes and refuse to be taught. Leave them out of your life.

Anyways I hope my ramblings help in some way or another. You got this!
I’ve been lucky lately and I know quite a few cis people that are super active in not only being good about my real name and pronouns, but also correcting others when they misgender or deadname me. 

That being said, I’ve also come across so so so many that are intentional about misgendering or deadnaming me just because they like to see me flinch. Some people just fucking suck.
Sounds like you need new friends 😒 
Real friends doesnt do this bullshit..
people like that are absolutely not worth your time
Quite simply, these people are all transphobic
I get that, I've had multiple people ask me for my dead name or try to guess it. The idea of someone trying to find out my dead name after I've told them I'm not going to tell them makes me uncomfortable (ftm). I look fairly masc most times but my voice always gives me away, and once I talk I get the ""are you a girl"" question.
If you consider those transphobic asses your 'friends' than I strongly recommend you to trim the tree of toxicity.
At this point I don’t really get close to cis people in general.
I am a trans woman, and I can totally relate. Although I do wear makeup and present myself as feminine, I am not yet medically transitioned ether. I still look like a man, and straight women and gay men still find me attractive. Also Lesbians and straight guys don't. (I am pansexual.) I get called by my deadname all the time. Also everyone keeps getting my pronouns wrong. I can totally relate.
Your so called friends sound like wankers
That sucks so bad! 

I don't present en femme very often because it's not safe to come out to my wife's family yet, but when those who know don't even consider the little things, like my pronouns or deciding to refer
 to me as a man, it hurts... It must suck all that much more for you. And I feel terrible about it.
YES! I (ftm, pre transition) had this ex friend, cishet guy, who once told me he would kiss me (if i wanted) like wtf??
Ik its such a weird assumption that everything on a transfem is ""fake"".
Just because a trans woman has boobs doesn't mean they are fake. Mine are fake, but not because I'm trans!
I think that a huge number of cis people just don't have the foggiest idea of how hormones work. It wouldn't be as aggravating as it is if they just weren't so confidently incorrect.
This! Sounds like op is surrounded by tools for friends who aren’t able to properly respect someone’s transition
THIS!!! THIS COMMENT! My fucking god! I swear, as a fellow trans gay man, WHY DO CIS PEOPLE REFUSE TO LISTEN?! It is so unbelievably hard to explain that NO, I DID NOT CHOSE TO BE A BOY ALL OF A SUDDEN. If I could be anything, I’d choose to be cis! God I hate it when people say that, I’m glad someone else understands
EXACTLY! i will want to do some makeup or something because that is a thing I enjoy doing and miss doing, and suddenly I was ""faking being trans"" or actually ""wanting to be a feminine Girl"".
ESPECIALLY cis people who are the #1 biggest transgender supporters until it comes to their partner/child!
And that really effects me for some reason.  I love my gay friends and it is not an insult to be called gay but im not gay im a straight woman who happens to be trans abd like men and masculinity and when i get called gay i get depressed for days. Its just the lack of compassion, bc i dont feel that way about genuine mistakes but when someone shows they dont give a shit i genuinely get so sad about it.
Don’t forget “sorry, I’m a lesbian/I don’t date men”
> if i was trans i would kill myself

Oh, I don’t doubt that. Me and many other trans friends try
Those are AWFUL things to say to someone, Im sorry :( . I also get a lot off ""I accept and love you, but like, when are you going back to using your deadname?""
THIS! I have not medically transitioned, but on the outside i look fully male and its so confusing when cis people will have the pride to call me a ""she.""

Cis people are the worst, best of luck to you
Its hard because a lot of these cis friends are IN the lgbt community, and will say ""Im literally gay why would i be transphobic"" whenever I talk to them about it, as if you cant still be transphobic as a queer person.
exactly! Even by 'supporters' I have been constantly asked when I'm 'going back to using my deadname and being a girl' and the answer is. NEVER. people need to stop asking those questions, ESPECIALLY to trans youth.
Heya, I'm cis and the last point you made really resonated with me as several of my close friends are trans and I absolutely love them. You put up with so much hate for being who you are and I respect the hell out of how you still manage to be so loving and open-minded - you make the best friends a lot of the time because you've been through so much and this makes you more mature than most honestly.

Bit of a feeling dump there I just respect trans people a lot and I've always got your backs 💙
YES! Even with cis people who aren't directly transphobic, idk if this is weird wording, will tend to PASS transphobia on to me, saying things like ""Oh, my DAD/SPOUSE/ANYONE ELSE I RESPECT says that being trans is a disease and your going to hell!"" Like.. ok you obviously just said that to make me feel bad??

Im sorry though, I get a lot about what your saying of how tiring it is to constantly try to explain and get cis people to sympathize.
Spilled, I found especially if you're pre transition some older transgender folk will be just as horrible and cis people can be. It really sucks
I don't even feel excited anymore when I find out someone is trans because of how common this is.
YES! I have a friend who identifies with the SAME LABELS AS ME, trans and gay, and is fully untransitioned, and still has the audacity to make these jokes!
One of my friends who does this IS also a transman and present very femininely and I have been nothing but respectful to their identity and its annoying to not me treated the same lol
Thanks man :)
I think it goes both ways , but i'm happy to hear that your transition socially is going well!!
Homie, there's a difference between not understanding and being transphobic. Everything this person has described in the post was transphobia, not innocent ignorance on the topic. Lets not give transphobes a pillow to sit on now.
Lmfao valid reason
Just be ready to listen to others and learn and you'll be the best!
WOAH, that is some messed up shit, I'm sorry dude :( a lot of family members have gone on whiny rants about how ""beautiful"" my deadname was and how I could have kept it. I've also given up on cis men, Think im TfT.
When I was a trans CHILD i've had full grown cis people ask me what my genitalia are, I feel you with the annoyance.
I feel like asking what surgeries trans people have had is such a dumb thing. You don't go up to pretty people on the street and ask ""Aww your so cute, what surgeries did you have??""
YIKES that is so backhanded im sorry man :((
its like how people think transfems always wear wigs, does growing out hair seem completely alien to them??
I legit had a coworker ask me what my pussy looks like and if it feels like a “real one” on the inside.
I told him I wasn’t going to answer that, and that he was lucky he was driving or I’d have punched him.
Last year, even before I realised I was not straight ( I am cis as of now, on this sub for my transfem sister) I knew that any kind of queer isn’t a CHOICE YOU IDIOTS!!
yep! i love makeup and dressing up and being pretty, but my family doesnt understand that i can still be a boy while doing all that. i still do makeup, but usually its only when im girlmode, and ive kinda given up on ""feminine"" pretty clothes until im further along in my transition. 

i think next time it comes up though, ill point out that my brother wearing makeup or pretty clothes wouldn't make him less of a boy unless ***he*** said otherwise, so it shouldn't make ***me*** any less of a boy either. idk how well that would work for you bc i dont know how accepting/understanding your family is, but if you think it might help it click for them then i think its worth a shot!!

stay strong, brother. someday we'll get where we want to be <3
God this so much. My ex refused to stop calling me wife, and switch to husband, which functionally outed me to everyone he would introduce me to. He said he just preferred it better. I asked him not to on more than one occasion and he said he would be uncomfortable. He knew I was trans before we married Lmao so it’s not like I sprung this on him at any point
Oh for sure, and the ""sorry, I'm gay/I don't date women""

I get all three!
that’s. uhm. god, i hope you guys are ok…
41% of transgender people do and Its awful :(
Oh my god same, but like the opposite lol, when I went to the AP office at my school I was called a sir and I look nothing like a guy, like how, it's so transphobic cause all of the admin know I'm trans. And my counselor at one point deadnamed me in front of my entire class, and even worse they said Mr.   right before they said my deadname. And then when I told my counselor that I was upset about it they said ""I didn't know it was that big a deal"" like how you're a school counselor you're supposed to know these things.
You can still be transphobic as a trans person, the fuck they mean they can't be transphobic?
Thanks man, we need more ready to listen people like you!
People suck across all identity groups in various ways. Really sorry you are experiencing this.
I agree with you. But I think my comment may have came off the wrong way. There are those who are ignorant and those who are outwardly transphobic either actively or causally. And ignorant person is open to listening to the idea but doesn’t understand it and will mostly get things wrong. A transphobe is someone who hates trans people and the idea of transitioning. I didn’t mean to give transphobes a pillow if that’s how it came off. I meant to stop ignorance people have to learn. Plus my original intent for my comment was to convince people not to group all Cis people in a single idea. I have plenty of cis friends all of which support and love me. But I know cis people who are also viciously transphobic. But I know the difference between a transphobe and an ignorant. All transphobes are ignorant, but not all ignorants are transphobes. I just wanted to clear this up before moving on with my day. Also thank you for pointing out the flaws in my response. I appreciate the criticism so I may improve.
I try, that is why I’m on this sub
Yeah I used to sometimes hook up with cis guys but I’ve become a complete lesbian since transitioning (or, lesbian who’s also attracted to enbees - dunno if there’s a word for that)
Exactly. The worst thing is he didn’t believed I was a “real trans” because I didn’t had bottom surgery…
If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if that's my real hair.
That’s the only part of me that’s fake. My hair. Oh well and my nails. But when I’m out I’ve had guys grab my breasts seeing if they’re fake ffs 😠

I’ve gotten close to a trans guy recently and despite the fact he’s been on T for about 6 or so years and had top surgery this year even his family still misgender him and it upsets me that he has to go through this 😢😞
I'm glad he's your ex. You deserve so much better.
I guess it’s just dysphoria at its worst
No worries, tbh it all boils down in the end to just respecting who people are and understanding it's only their right to know that, not someone with an outside POV. If more people actually got and respected this truth I think we'd have a lot less hate around.

Stay strong and I wish you the best 💙
Same. And also the boobs. I have encountered many cis women (mostly older) who seem so insanely envious that a trans woman can have nicer natural titties than them them and they get MEAN. So many people assume my tits and ass and curves are fake and I'm like no bby it's just hormones.
Oh there’s a whole bucket of reasons he’s my ex ! I only recently managed to escape the relationship and I am only barely starting to heal but the future is looking brighter
i cant even imagine how broken i would feel if i were in your shoes. you deserve someone who respects who you are, and im so so happy that you got away from your ex because he clearly did not respect you. if you choose to look for another partner in the future, i hope you find someone more worthy of your love <3
You are the first person, including friends and family, who hasn’t assumed I want a new partner in the future. Thank you, I feel so validated somehow lmao because I learned part of protecting my peace includes knowing I can tell someone to gtfo my house, and set all my life routines around my needs, and the needs of my dogs only. I have no interest in another life partner, at least for several years, because all the things I needed from him that he brought to the table are things I want to provide for myself now: comfortable housing, financial stability, family.  Idk why but it means so much to me to hear that it’s not assumed that everyone has to get back to being partnered as a goal."	zi6s9n	trans	487	0.95	2022-12-10 23:13:58
I’m a transmasc who prefers fem clothing	"Edit: Woah I wasn’t expecting this to blow up :o
Thank you so much everyone! Everyone’s been so nice and supportive, and it’s so cool hearing about other people who relate! 

bit of a vent? But I need to get these feelings out somewhere

Okok, so I’m a transmasc demiboy. (I’m 16) while I don’t identify as a girl, and do experience dysphoria- weirdly feminine clothing does not make me dysphoric? In fact they make me really happy, and makes me feel confident. Imo guys clothing is really boring 

I know I’m valid, however people have invalidated my gender identity. It also sucks having to constantly explain myself to people- usually the older generation. However I do understand that usually it’s not out of malice, and they just don’t understand. So I’m happy to help educate people 

I used to wear fem clothing when I identified as non-binary, however people only saw me as a girl because of it, and that made me feel really dysphoric. So I decided it wasn’t worth it

However once I’m deep into T, and have a deeper voice/facial hair- and pass more as a dude, I think I’m gonna wear fem clothing again. With a pronoun pin ofc, to let people know I’m a dude 

I just wish clothing wasn’t gendered. imo clothing doesn’t have gender, but unfortunately the majority doesn’t see it this way.

Anyway, sorry for the longish post. Just needed to get these thoughts down somewhere"	"Assigning clothes to gender is fucking stupid to begin with. Lemme wear a dress mom
Feminine transmascs are valid and I will kick anyone who says otherwise. What clothes we like don't invalidate our genders. I don't wear makeup and that doesn't make me any less of a woman.
I am trans masc and I can love wearing feminine things! 
I sew and I’m going into fashion school and I still say that wearing a ball gown is a pure form of joy no matter your gender!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!
Fair enough man. I want to get like a variety of jackets and shirts that have my pronouns in big letters on the front and back because I'm being forced to go boy mode rn and won't be able to even start HRT until I'm away from my parents so I want something to make it very clear from a distance I'm not a man when I get the chance to start being myself even though when I do I won't pass yet
[removed]
I'm a transmasc femboy lol there's no problem with liking ""fem"" clothes they are only clothes there's no need to gender them. Have fun !
Yh, people are just jealous that fem clothes are the best clothes
We definitely exist man. And we have so many things against us. I’ve been struggling with this a lot recently
You don't owe anyone masculinity, I am also a transmasc person who mostly wears ""male"" clothes because I do find it exhausting to explain and I do lack the confidence to wear more fem clothes. But your boy just wants to wear cute skirts with a cute crop top and masc cloths doesn't offer that. Keep being you. Dress how you like! You should not have to sacrifice your comfort for other people's ignorance. Keep slaying ✨️
Presentation is not gender.

A man in a dress *is still a man*. Trans men are men. Trans men in dresses are still men.

Good on you for presenting in a way that pleases you! My trans son has reached the point where he’s decided he likes wearing skirts and dresses from time to time, and his comment was “I’m not rethinking my gender, I’m just rethinking my sense of style”
Fellow transmasc demiboy here! Yeah, fem clothes are awesome, and I have similar anxieties about getting misgendered. One thing I'm trying to tell myself is that whatever I wear is manly by default because I am a man. And since I'm not fully binary anyway, does it really matter? (It does, I know, but I hope this helps.)
I feel this 100%. The more I pass as a man, the more I want to explore my fem side. Gender is dumb, people should be able to wear whatever they want.
Trans guy here. I feel kinda similarly toward clothing. Masc clothing makes me very euphoric, but fem clothing can make me super confident too since I know I’m hot af. I’m leaning more toward masc clothes until I can get on T but think I’ll be more comfy going back to dressing a little more femininely once I’m more through my transition. Not only are you valid but you’re not alone either. Glad you have somewhere to get these thoughts down. Keep being you
honestly feminine clothing has way more choices and styles than masculine clothing and almost always looks good

but im biased bc i wanna be a girl
I feel pretty much the exact same I miss wearing fem clothing but the knowledge that I would never be seen as what I feel inside when wearing those clothes makes me really dysphoric too, I feel seen and understood ;w;
Trans-man here, I feel this so much. I wish I were bigger framed and more visibly masculine so I could were makeup and cutesy things without it guaranteeing that I would be IDed as female
Hey! I’m in the same boat as you. I like dressing fem, but it automatically pins a gender to me that I don’t like. The clothes don’t make me dysphoric, but the perception everyone has of me in them does. I’m also transmasc, but non-binary, basically a they/them femboy. I’m pre-T, so everything about my body is female. I hate it. I’m also 30, and a parent, which really doesn’t help because I’m instantly labeled as “mom”. I’m not. To my son, I’m Maddy.

Inanimate objects being gendered is so dumb.
This makes me so happy to read cause I struggle with the exact same thing I’m agender nb afab and the amount of times I have to argue with my family that wearing a dress is not a gendered thing makes me so tired they get in my head sometimes. Also how easily I get misgendered when I DO wear a dress esp cause I have a long mullet rn and it’s the first time I don’t have a buzz cut or short short hair so it’s like just a big fat real life lesson on how gender perception is so exhausting
>Imo guys clothing are really boring

Truth. as a transfemme, I can confirm guy clothes are boring AF
Im 26, and pre T. But same. But some random person on tiktik said something that I related to alot. They said : I'm masculine in the way a poptart is a ravioli. I like that. I like masc and fem alt clothes, with makeup. But I'm not a she/her person. Im they/he.(starting to lean to Trans man but I'm not in a situation where I can live openly or transition.)
Fair enough! You should check out r/ftmfemininity
Clothes are literally pieces of fabric, what defines your gender is yourself <3
I'm trans aswell fem clothes do make me uncomfortable but I think it as a femboy although I am a femboy although clothes are clothes I wish my family understood that I wanna be a boy
Also a fellow femme trans masc! I still on the occasion wear dresses and makeup but have told everyone around me that I’m doing drag or to think about it in a  make rock start wearing a dress way. It really helped it click for a lot of people around me! 
Mens fashion can be very boring, but alternative mens fashion is fun! I’m a punk rocker so it’s still easy for me to dress cool in a masculine way.
Top surgery is my most exciting part, I can wear dresses, low cut tops and blouses again! So sick of high neck and flavourless boy clothes. I love colour and patterns and pretty material and I'm so glad you have a strong understanding of how that doesn't affect identity.
I'm also a transmasc Demi-boy and even though I prefer men's clothes women's clothes are good too sometimes! 

You be your fem safe fam!

🖤🤍💙🤍🖤
See I’m transmasc they/he but I mostly wear fem clothes. I say my gender is goth because I’m a goth and whenever I’m fully dressed up is when I feel the most euphoric. I attribute it to the fact that even the men of goth dress femininely/androgenously and are still men. Genders weird. But ur fine,dude
I understand your frustration. It's idiotic how pieces of fabric we use to cover ourselves is gendered - You should be free to wear whatever you wish.
My Mom does daycare I overheard one day there was something involving a tutu on TV I think and one of the boys she babysits asked what it was and when she explained it's for ballet (in her very conservative view of ballet) he said ""I wanna do that"" and she immediately said ""you're a boy"" and it pissed me off but since I'm financially dependent on her rn and I am an adult (it's fucking hard to move without a car) I couldn't say anything because idk if she'll kick me out or what if she realizes I'm not the cishet conservative Christian boy she thinks I am
Exactlyyyy dresses are so pretty! :o
66YO cis woman and men tee shirts are for me so I  don't get gendering clothes either.
Yeah, I might do the same with putting my pronouns on a jacket. But I wish you the best with getting away from your parents, and starting hrt :]
It soooo is. Clothes are literally just pieces of fabric?? Like?
Yeah exactly!

Also, I recommend checking out r/FTMfemininity. It definitely helps my confidence a bit; if they can do it, I can, too! :)
Oh neat! It’s always cool seeing another fellow demi. But yeah thanks! That does help :>

Ok so what the heck?
i think it’s *god i wish that was me* lol
Did some research on the last story and big yikes. Super not ideal situation. School doesn't tell parents about kids gender identity, kid gets mercilessly bullied as a result of the teachers trying to help, kid *see headline*, parents sue. All because the dad was known as being very religious and the school super mishandled things trying to have other kids accept them and not out the kid. And that's the best reading of the situation.

We have to be visible. We are not ashamed of who we are.	"For transgender day of visibility we want to recognize how far our community has come as a whole. We live in a society where our rights are attacked for not being understood. Where our family and friends reject us for who we are. Where we must do what we can to fit in, in a society that would exile and attack us for being who we are.

We want to remind everyone that we are stronger and more plentiful when unified than those who would oppress us and tear us down. Our rights **are** human rights, lest we forget that access to healthcare, the right to self identity, and the right to exist as you are, are rights that everyone should have access to. We are  just as diverse, just as fallible, just as **human**, as any other group of people that exist.

There are those who would fearmonger, who would tell us to hide who we are from fascism, they are the same people who would tear us down in the first place. We must stand strong as a group, hold true to ourselves, and live our lives as who we are. Though we must keep in mind that there are those of us that are in places where they can’t be themselves, where their life would be in danger just to express who they are, we must be strong for them.

There has been a rapid rise in hate recently, as people spew nonsensical rhetoric to tear down trans people. That can be scary to see, especially if you live in places that are actively passing laws to attack our lives. We must make our voices heard, our unrest, our fear, our anger, we cannot go down silently.

To those of you who come to our subreddit seeking refuge, seeking a place to be yourself, you have found it. To those of you who are here to bring others down, to gatekeep, to tell others how they should feel, we ask that you leave now as you do not belong here.

# From our team members

## bleeding-paryl

Personally, as someone who has been in this community for a bit over 10 years now, I think I can honestly say that this is both the scariest time to live in parts of the world for trans folk, but also the best time in recent memory to actively be yourself. I’ve seen so much positivity in this community, and I’m always inspired by the things I see here. We will celebrate who we are, we will live as who we are, and despite things like the recent shooting, we will continue to love ourselves.

I’ve noticed a rather recent and rapid uptick in people coming here who are not trans. For those that come as allies, and are here to support us, thank you. For those who are here expecting us to apologize for a murderer, or who think we’re not upset “enough” at the murder of children, I would like you to first look inward, and ask yourself why you’re more upset at us than you are about the people murdered. We are grieving, we are hurt, we are afraid. We can feel multiple things at the same time, and we can acknowledge when things will shine an incorrect light on a community of people just as diverse as the cisgender community.

For those of you who see that kind of hate making its way through, first of all I would like to apologize, as I know we’re imperfect. I would also like to personally thank you for remaining vigilant and reporting it as you see it. Keep in mind, we’re _very_ busy, we have regular lives on top of the stuff we do for this community, and we may not see something right away, so I am always appreciative of those who can help.

## TallGeminiGirl

Firstly I would like to thank all of you for your help in reporting bad actors and doing your part to keep r/trans a safe space for all things transgender. We really can not do it with out you all. We, as a mod team, are just a small part of the incredibly diverse and wonderful trans community we represent. You, the users, are the real body, soul, and voice of our community. Thank you for being the wonderful people you are. 

I want to take a moment and share some personal thoughts on recent events. We can not let this stop us. We can not let this push us down and go back into hiding. Those of us who can do so safely need to continue making our voices heard and push back against this wave of hate. This is not a call for violence and I will never, ever advocate for such or defend such actions. Today is our chance to reclaim the current narrative around us. Be visible, be kind, and show the world who we really are and what we stand for. The small actions of a million individuals can easily over power the heinous actions of a single, evil, individual.

And don't be afraid to ask for support and comforting. Talk to your trans friends. Be real with your cis allies. It's high time they really get to know what we are going through and what we are up against. Don't feel like you have to answer for the entire community either. Your own personal needs and mental health is just as if not more important than the needs of our community. 

Stay strong everyone. The seas ahead will be harsh and choppy, but together we can brave the storm and come out stronger on the other side.

## The_Decoy

I am very thankful to have found so much support in these spaces. As someone who came to understand this side of myself much later in life, I find so much inspiration seeing how the community comes together to reinforce each other. These are obviously difficult times with our community being set upon by some incredibly vitriolic bad actors. But we are working our hardest to keep this space clear so the community can continue supporting one another. I am proud to work alongside such a wonderful and dedicated mod team. I am delighted to see how the community places such an emphasis on being respectful and inclusive to each other. Ultimately though we are pursuing our ability to live our best lives. This struggle will not be easy but will be incredibly satisfying once we have attained such an environment. I look forward to pushing for progress alongside such incredible people.

Nonbinary people are trans right?	"So I’ve been out to my partner as transfem for about a year, and I’ve been gradually transitioning ever since including HRT since November. A little while ago I told her that I’m currently identifying as nonbinary. She then proceeded to tell me I’m not trans anymore (“I know what nonbinary is, they just want to opt out of gender so they aren’t trans”) well, that’s more or less what she said it’s been a bit of time.

I tried to explain that nonbinary people identify as other than their assigned gender making us trans by definition. I wasn’t super interested in defending my gender to my cis straight partner at the time, she’s being supportive overall and we’re no longer romantically together but we have kids. So I ended up shutting it down with a “well I’m both and I’m still literally transitioning so yes I’m still trans.” But it’s still bothering me a bit.

Is there a community concensus? Obviously personal identity is super important so I wouldn’t suggest making nonbinary folk call themselves trans if they aren’t feeling it, but overall are we trans? Is there an easier way to explain it to cis people?

Hopefully this all makes sense, it was a really weird argument I didn’t understand why we were having it.

Edit: thanks everyone for the wonderful and thoughtful answers! It’s super validating to feel so welcomed under the trans umbrella!"	"The community consensus is that by definition nonbinary people are trans, and most of us do identify as such, although there are some individual nonbinary people who don't identify as trans themselves for various reasons.
If you don't fully identify with your agab, you're trans. But we nonbinary people can decide if we want to label ourselves as trans or not.

If you want to label yourself as trans, then you have every right to do so. You're not in the wrong here <3
Yes. The umbrella is wide enough for you friend, come shelter yourself from the rain
I'm genderqueer. Didnt identify as trans for a long time because i felt like I was taking up space that wasn't mine to claim. I also didn't have a lot of contact with other transfolx. I still tread lightly. I still prefer genderqueer, but will state im transnb when folks get confused. Some people seem to think trans is short for transition. -_-

Saying nbs can't and won't transition is also erasure of our experience. Nor do we need to transition to others standards to have a valid identity. 

How you identify isnt up for debate. It is rude AF, especially if it coming from someone with knowledge of how you identify.
The white stripe on the trans flag is for non-binary people isn’t it?  Of course you’re still trans, I’m honestly so sick of people acting like non-binary identities are less trans or not trans at all when they’ve been around for a long time.  The trans woman who created that flag (Monica Helms) said specifically that the white stripe represented “those who are transitioning or have a neutral or undefined gender.”  Non-binary people are trans don’t ever let anyone tell you otherwise friend!

Edit:  I do want to say not all non-binary people identify as trans because it’s a personal decision, just that you are welcome to identify as trans.
some nonbinary people choose not to identify as trans for personal reasons, but overall nonbinary identities are included in the community. the white stripe in the trans flag is actually for nonbinary
I get the feeling. When I came out as enby I was told I had to talk to gender psyhiatrist to help me ""make up my mind"" as if nonbinary is like saying ""I'm confused about my gender"" or "" I don't know yet""
I just hnnng
Nonbinary isn't a waiting position
You're right and your partner is not
Yup! Trans just means “not cis” so if you aren’t cis then by definition you are trans. Though these are also just words, so go ahead and identify with what you want. As a non-binary transfem I feel you, like I dislike the binary and gender roles, but at the same time I’m (generally) closer to woman than anything else
ouch, I'm sorry your (hopefully going to be ex) partner isn't more supportive. like you said you're transitioning, how is that not trans? also her whole thing about saying nonbinary people just want to opt out of gender is deeply ignorant. there are plenty of people who don't fit neatly into a binary label and that doesn't hurt anyone. I don't want to make assumptions, but it sounds like she is probably transphobic in general on the downlow.
I mean you can be trans feminine without being a trans woman which counts as NB. Like I know I want to transition to a female body and clothes and appearance and generally ""be a girl"" but Im not sure I'm a binary woman, but want to transition to femininity. Which is in the nb part of the gender spectrum by default
The white stripe in the trans pride flag is literally for non-binary and other custom genders. Some non-binary people choose not to identify as trans, but unless you were assigned non-binary at birth, you aren’t exactly cis, are you? 😉
All non-binary people are trans in the terms of being welcome in trans spaces, being welcome to take the label if they want to, etc, but not all non-binary people want to call themselves trans and we don't force that onto them. Even if a non-binary person doesn't want to call themselves trans, they are still welcome. 😊
To put it simply if someone's gender transitions to something else then they are trans.
A lot of good comments here. I'd add that while non-binary is under the overall trans umbrella, non-binary is also a gender identity while trans is not.

Ie, on a questionnaire one might say:

What is your gender identity: male, female, non-binary.

Furthermore, just like trans, non-binary may also be used as an adjective to further describe the person in question (ie non-binary man, non-binary woman, non-binary person, trans man, trans woman, trans person).
Non-binary is a very broad term. It just means outside the gender binary. 

It can include everyone from intersex people to those who disagree with gender to those whose gender identity is something other than male or female. People in any of those categories can identify as non-binary if they feel that it applies to them.

So it encompasses trans identities, but not all non-binary people also identify as trans.
One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. 
There is no escape.
(Yes, Nonbinary is part of the Trans Community)
There is a minority of non-binary people who don't id as trans and that fine idc. But I'm definitely nb and trans. And it seems like you and most nb people I know are also. Some of the cis hets in my life thought I was no longer trans when I came out as nb, but I corrected them and we all moved on. Sorry it hasn't been as easy for you. <3
A trans person is any person who does not identify with their agab. Unless the doctor picked them up and went ""it's a... Idk about this one"" nonbinary people may fit under the trans umbrella if they choose
Saying that nonbinary people are not trans is transphobic. Nonbinary people, especially those under xenogender umbrellas, are often thrown under the bus by binary trans people who are looking for someone to punch down on. Not every nonbinary person uses the trans label but no one except the individual should make that call.
I am fluid, two sides of a very fluid coin, and while i wont declare myself as actual trans there is an absolute overlap. I want to be en femme but dont have courage to do HRT or surgery. I want to keep parts of myself and want to change others. Fluidity isn't trans specifically but it is close enough to matter
It depends from person to person really, some nonbinary people choose not to use the label. For the most part, if you identity with anything other than cis you can use the trans label regardless of what procedures or hormones you want to pursue.
The terminology is there to help us describe what we are, not as a mold for us to change ourselves to fill.

As gender and sexuality are a spectrum, there are probably as many variations as there are people. And so ANY terminology is doomed to be inaccurate.

Ultimately, you are whatever you are, and whether or not the terminology fits doesn't really matter.
Some nonbinary folks don't identify with being trans but as far as I'm concerned I transitioned from my assigned gender to my chosen gender like any other trans person. I just didn't make the same traditional physical transformation.
There’s a lot of good answers about the consensus here so I won’t reiterate what’s already been said better, but I’ll give my experience. I’m enby, and I think I identify as trans. I bind, I feel I’ve socially transitioned through clothes and hair and actions and such, so I would say I feel trans. I also don’t take hormones, though. This is because I want some of the things that hormones bring, but not others. This sometimes makes me doubt my “transness” until I remember that medical transitions aren’t necessary for people to be trans. So it’s a personal choice, but if you feel trans, you are trans. And your partner has no place to deny what you feel. I’m sure they meant well but they should truly let you decide how you identify because you’re the only one who knows :)))
I am nonbinary and identify as trans, but I don't know about what other people think.
Yes, we are!
Nonbinary falls under the trans umbrella.  Not all nonbinary people identify as being trans but they are more than welcome to include themselves under the trans umbrella if that is how they chose to identify.   The trans umbrella includes identities that do not align with their assigned gender at birth, which of course, includes nonbinary folks.

You're 100% valid in how you identify.

When I was younger I used to say I was queer instead of trans. Back then people were not as accepting of trans people.  This was 30+ years ago.  More recently, I've just been saying I'm trans, especially since I started HRT and it's getting obvious I'm a guy. 

It's your identity and you can identify however you want.  Noone but you can lable your gender identity.
I consider enby folks to be trans just on principle of going by assigned gender to their actual gender is in itself a transition. They also don't have to take the label if they don't want it
There are some nonbinary people who don't like to label themelves ""trans"".  That's 1000% cool & 1000% none of my business.  Probably each non-trans enby has a compelling, logical story about how their particular identity works &, if you sat down with them, you'd come away thinking ""yeah - I totally see how it makes sense for that individual to describe themself as nonbinary but not trans"".  Labels are optional.  Period.  

But if we're talking about nonbinary people in general, as a category, then f\*\*k yeah we're trans.  Some transgender people are binary men or women; other transgender people are *not* binary men or women - that doesn't make us any more or any less trans.

In more concrete terms:

* I was assigned male at birth but turned out not to be a man; call me old-fashioned, but that sounds pretty trans (even if I'm also not a woman).  
* I'm engaged in a process of physical transition, motivated by gender dysphoria.  I am literally a male-to-female transexual. Again, that sounds pretty trans, even if I'm not remotely feminine in my presentation or behaviour. (none of those things are requirements to be trans, of course, but they're sure as hell *sufficient* to be trans)
* I'm affected by a lot of the same BS as binary trans women.  Not all of it, of course, but a lot.  There's the same awkward dilemmas in dating (& the same attention from chasers, the same risk of bodily harm from cis men).  Transphobes aren't any less disgusted by my transfeminine body because I don't use the word ""woman"" to describe myself; they're no less determined to deprive me of the right to make my own medical decisions.  

In terms of both dictionary definitions & the day-to-day reality of our lives, we are every bit as trans as our binary brothers & sisters.
Nonbinary people experience gender euphoria and dysphoria thus trans.
I can't really relate. I'm a trans woman I will always identify as a woman . I don't understand identifying as both because the idea of being a man causes me mental pain... I mean technically we are both trans but my experience is vastly different because of intense sex/gender dysphoria. I just think your dysphoria is allot milder then someone like me. That doesn't mean you are not trans!
yes, you are trans. dont listen to people who tell you otherwise, they just want to gatekeep safe spaces from us. there are two broad categories of trans people: binary and non-binary. you and i? we're non-binary trans. if youre transfemme- congrats, youre trans. 

the definition of transgender is: identifying with a gender different from the one you were assigned at birth. is that the case for you? then yes, you are trans.
Nope. I'm trans but see myself as hetero.
Come in, make yourself comfortable. We have cookies.
If you your chosen gender is not the one you were assigned at birth and you’re comfortable with being called trans, you’re trans! It’s as simple as that (:
Yup. That sums it up nicely.
This should be put in the sidebar or something.
I've been identifying with non binary for a while but it took me some time before also identifying with being trans
i read ""agab"" as assigned gay at birth pffft
Yup. I am on the fence with identity, but when considering myself NB I see that as trans. However, especially outside the queer community, Trans means MtF or FtM, so I avoid that term purely for clarity. 

Other NB's may feel the same, or have other reasons to not consider trans. I like it though as it feels like I'm part of a group as a whole.
That's such a beautiful way to put it, damn, I feel like I'm getting a hug from a wise mentor or something. I know it was directed to OP, but I kinda needed to hear this today ngl
Ya the other commenter here put it perfectly too! I was trying to decide what to say it was like a big warm welcoming hug! Thank so much!
Thanks so much for this! I wasn't really understanding why I felt so bad after, but it was erasure. It was like how is this even a converstaion, I'm literally transitioning!
Thanks! I hadn’t actually realized the white stripe was for nonbinary, I like the trans flag even better now!
Ya we both know ex is what’s happening it’s just that we have these little children and we’re still overall happy to be in each others lives and raise them equally. We really don’t want to deal with custody splits for as long as we can help it being a parent is hard!

Awkwardly I don’t know any words beyond partner to describe who she is to me! Coparent ex-partner human
Oh really good point, I hadn’t thought of the distinction there!
This is an awesome response thank you! In all of those concrete points I felt like you were talking directly about me!
I never said I identify as a man in any way, I very much do not. Nonbinary isn’t some of both. I also experience plenty of dysphoria. Please don’t declare my dysphoria mild because my identity doesn’t line up with yours. 

Also, are you saying you don’t relate at all to trans men and their dysphoria is lesser than yours because they want to be men? I’d like to think we all have some common ground in being trans people, our experiences don’t have to match.

Edit for clarity: nonbinary isn’t some of both unless it is some of both like for bigender and genderfluid folks. Neither of those is me though.
As one that experiences dysphoria, I'd have guessed you would have that much *more* empathy for others, not less. Dysphoria olympics are toxic games.

You don't relate to being a man and I don't either. We have that *in common* 

I just also don't relate to being a woman. Non-binary means *not* part of the binary.
What an absolutely disgusting comment to make at someone, telling them you automatically think their pain is lesser than yours just because their identity is different. You should be ashamed of using your pain to shut down someone else discussing something entirely irrelevant to you. I cannot understand why you think this is a helpful to tell anyone even if you are ""technically"" used to dysphoria being a binary experience. You should consider yourself lucky that a binary gender is medically possible for you to express and you will one day, if you arent already, be viewed as a woman by strangers on the street. You cannot imagine the dysphoria of people who's genders are not medically possible to fully express and even if they were, people passing by will always misgender them in some direction.
Probably me
Well now it’s directed at you too! 😊 I was trying to channel my inner Uncle Iroh haha
🤗 🫂
i know right? it made me super happy when i learned it too :)
I totally understand, just sorry you're stuck in that position.
You literally said in your post you ended the argument by saying your both...  

Edit for clarity: I take that to mean your okay with being called she/him/they. So your gender identity is more loose then mine because your non binary.  Then again I can't really know how you feel because I don't understand. Also feel like I'm being condemned for not understanding.
Oh my gosh, I just read it in an Uncle Iroh voice, and it was so soothing!
Both trans and nonbinary.
Oh okay then I'm totally put to lunch with my comment I'm sorry...
Thank you for the retraction. 

I just saw your edit in the last comment though and did get a little upset again. My pronouns are in my profile. I’m going to go put them in my flair now to try to prevent anyone else even maybe calling me any percentage of man because just ew! 

The reason you’re feeling condemned is that you were playing oppression Olympics which is just a crappy way to express a lack of understanding. If you had even said what you said without telling me my dysphoria must be mild, I probably just would have gently corrected you and moved on but instead I had to experience the full dysphoria of being misgendered by another trans person.

As another commenter correctly stated, I will likely never be seen by many and be properly gendered. I can never pass, because there is no nonbinary standard to pass as. I will absolutely make a traditional gender transition because I am comfortable enough being seen as a woman and my body dysphoria is close to the same as most trans women I know, and literally anything to make people stop calling me a man. 

Just like, please don’t lessen someone else’s dysphoria just because you don’t understand it. It’s straight up the same energy as someone telling you you’re less of a woman because you’re trans."	u8yf9d	trans	458	0.98	2022-04-21 21:44:56
Mom wants me to call her dad and use he/him with her to 'prove that it's hard to change'	"Long story short, my mom used my given name to me during an argument. She used my chosen name, not a minute before she did this, so I became really upset with her. She later apologized after I called her out and said it was an accident. She was so used to calling me my given name. However, now she wants me to call her dad and use he/him when referring to her to prove that it is difficult to switch pronouns and become used to a new name.

I've always acknowledged and understood that it was difficult to switch. I even told her and others that I understood if they made mistakes... But this feels completely off to me. I'm not sure what to do.

On one hand, I want to respect what people wish to be referred to as, but on the other hand, this feels undermining to me as a trans person. She is decidedly cis. It's not like this is validating her identity. The only reason she wants me to use those pronouns is to prove a point.

Any advice is welcome.

\*\*Edit:\*\* Thanks, think tank, for directing your energies towards this problem! Though I love the malicious compliance idea, I don't want to devote the headspace to seeing that whole debacle through. We are also meeting this week to mourn the loss of my brother, her son, who passed a year ago. I'd rather not continue a feud through that. Perhaps on a less harrow occasion, I would follow through on toying with her.

I'm going to tell her how I feel about the matter and cut this off at its head. Again, I really appreciate all your thoughts!"	"My advice: tell her how her request makes you feel. 

though unintentional, her asking you to call her the wrong name/pronouns when she’s cis makes it seem like she just sees stuff like name/label as not attached to who you are as a person. as if you’re asking her to call you the “wrong” name/pronouns, when really that’s who you are 

hope that made some sense, and good luck OP
Me being the petty ass person I am would malicious compliance THE FUCK out of her.
I wish my mom did the same thing so I can proove her wrong. My mom is not even trying and she says its sooo haard to even try.
I would go full malicious compliance and do so until they get weirded out and ask me to swap back.  
After all, she DID ask you.

Reminding her of what you said about ""I understand mistakes, it's not that big of a deal"" is also good but if she wants to prove a point, there's also no harm in breaking said point in half.
I mean, I would have done it. Since I happen to have a large capacity for spite. Show her how easy it is. Perhaps as a final insult refuse to switch back when she ends the farce, and cite ""it's too hard to change"" as a reason.

That's such a shitty thing to do from her.
i’d do it just to prove it isn’t *that* hard but then keep doing it after she says to stop to prove “yeah it fucking sucks to be misgendered doesn’t it?”
\*Calls Father\*

""Hey Mother, I know this sounds weird, but your husband is trying to prove a point that pronouns are apparently difficult and so he wanted me to talk to you while misgendering the both of you.

Yeah, apparently it's difficult for him to internalise this and asked me to call his wife, no matter how uncomfortable that made the both of us.

Yeah, see you later, Mother.""

\*Hangs up\*

""See? Now we're both disappointed.""
""I *know* it's hard.  I'm not denying that.  I appreciate the effort you put in and that you're continuing to try.""

""It's really hard though! Look you can't do it.  Call me dad.""

""You're being kinda weird and pushy about this.  If you want me to call you dad, I can, but I think if this is something that's important for you, we should probably have a deeper conversation, but you should probably talk to someone more qualified than me, like a gender therapist.""

""Oh, no, not like that.  I just wan't you to know I'm trying.""

""I know, I know you're trying to let me know I'm loved.  I appreciate that, but this is ""embarrassing mom"" territory.""
My dad did this. I just told him that he doesn't understand how it works and if he thinks that he's able to do this, I'm cutting myself off from him as soon as I can. Looking back, it was an extreme reaction, but he's slightly transphobic and I was just mad at him for everything he's done.
Don't do any of the malicious stuff unless you want to live in a volatile house.

Explain that of course its difficult, making a mistake isn't the issue, but whatever emotional root is now at hand IS the issue. (Maybe she feels attacked for having made a mistake? Whatever that thing can be resolved, and is what should be looked at rather than going down a stupid path.)

However that stupid path also needs to be shut down: it is inappropriate to use pronouns like that unless one sincerely wishes to identify that way, and she is not showing that she does. Tell her to get back to you when she is asking her whole life to do that, or she is expressing a sincere desire to experiment with her identity and knows what that feels like.

Be firm that you aren't going to unless those standards are met. (But if they are, then do it.)
That's emotional manipulation and I would go malicious compliance and misgender her beyond the phone call in every day life to an extreme level until she gets extremely uncomfortable about it
You don't have to do anything she tells you.  If it makes you uncomfortable don't do it.
He's dad now. Though if it's not safe to be maliciously compliant then I'm not really sure.
my mum kept deadnaming and misgendering my friends and then said ""it doesnt matter"" so i called her dad all day and it really pissed her off
I would comply but never change back just to spite her.
If you're not comfortable with it, then I think the advice about telling her honestly how it makes you feel is good.

That said, I would go along with it if it were my mum. Not out of malicious compliance or spite like many of the other comments are suggesting, but because what she's *trying* to do here (if you take her at face value) is get you to empathise with her, but what she may *actually end up doing*, is copping some amount of dysphoria and empathising with you.
Go along with it. Let her play games: 'FAaFO.'
I would just call him dad aggressively until he realises misgendering sucks ass and he wants to be a she again
It sounds like you've come to a conclusion already but i wanted to offer: don't be malicious. But also don't disrespect yourself by stooping to her level. What she's asking for is disrespectful and degrading. She needs to just get over herself.
Just try to call her Dad...
Could be a funny experiment.
Everyone needs ro put energy into the transistion on many different levels...
Im sure it can take some years to adapt for a mother....
[deleted]
Probably not going to like this answer but maybe pick and choose your battles here.

I understand the frustration and feelings that come with the wrong name and pronouns but it isnt easy to just switch and having someone constantly over your shoulder correcting you isnt going to help.

This was in an argument so i feel emotions played a part here, its hard to remember new names and stuff when your in that mood, your mum has spent your whole life saying that name, its going to slip out, more during times of high emotions and she later apologized so i dont feel like it was on purpose or in malice. But im sure you know this and that isnt the problem here.

What she wants is just weird and disrespectful so id just start calling her parent instead or wait till your in public or around others and call out dad to her, but im petty like that
That's really petty of her :/

I hate when parents get defensive with their own kids - she's supposed to be more adult, but she can't swallow her pride and admit she messed up and hurt you. Parents are always trying to ""prove a point"" when sometimes you have to take the L and actually apologize to your kid... I know you said she apologized, but it's kinda hollow when she immediately turns around and acts like she did nothing wrong bc ""it's haaard"" and also has this whole phonecall stunt just to prove how hard it is...

A real apology centers the person you wrong, not your own feelings and ego. You have to recognize that you did wrong by them, commit to making amends/doing better, and humble yourself with no expectations or demands. It seems like your mom missed all 3 on this one. 

In my experience with parents who act like this, there's really no winning here. You could do the call and use he/him the whole time, in which case her point is moot but she probably won't care and it will just awkwardly fizzle out. You could mess up the call intentionally to make her feel validated, but that seems pretty bad any way you slice it. You could refuse to do the call (by apologizing/backing down, by telling her how you feel about it, escalating back into a full argument, etc.), at which point she will probably come away feeling like she ""won"" anyway regardless of your reasoning just because of confirmation bias. Regardless I don't think you're gonna get through to her in this specific scenario.  It seems unlikely to me, anyway. I would do whatever feels the least degrading or most palatable to you. Getting her to respect your pronouns at all times is gonna be a long-term project, and now that she's made this argument into a weird game just so she can get a win I don't think she's gonna be particularly receptive at the moment. Hopefully she comes around on her own eventually.

That's my two-cents anyway. I have my own past experiences to go by, but of course I don't really know you or your mom. I'm sorry you're in a bad spot like this right now, but this internet stranger wishes you well anyway ❤
Aren’t you a bit old to worry what your mum thinks? From your post history you must be nearly 30-35… Cut the cord, sweetie.
Unless your mum asserts to your grandad that that's how she wants to be addressed, that's just going to confuse him.

It's not equivalent. You've told her how you should be addressed, which is a change that can take some time to internalise, it's not like flipping a switch, its reconsidering the concept of an individual and all the connotations that come with the words he or she.

Since it happened during an argument, let cooler heads prevail and address it once things settle. Dedicated practice might help, if she agrees, run through some imaginary scenarios of people she might talk to about you, or if she were to call you over, etc.

Make it constructive, try to avoid an antagonistic approach, express nervousness if you're tense about it. One thing that might help impress how important this is to you is if she were to misgender you in public, it could draw undue attention.

Don't go calling her he to anyone unless she asserts that for herself. At best, that would only reinforce that it's trivial and insignificant, when that couldn't be further from the truth.
Perspective from a parent: it is genuinely difficult to change what you call someone after 10+yrs - but not impossible or even very challenging.

All of my kids have chosen names. I only expected one of them would, but whatever. The difficult part is when I'm trying to be serious / authoritative and my dumb parent brain inserts given name over chosen name. Like ""first middle last, you're in trouble"" sort of thing. 

There's also an issue with one of my kids using my middle name as their chosen name - which is also the chosen name of one of my other kids friends. That's confusing and difficult for everyone!

If you can make it a joke and agree to call your mom dad and use he / him pronouns, maybe you can deliver a point about being compassionate despite your own feelings on the matter. 

Your mom's request is not coming from a genuine place of understanding and compassion - and I get that you sense that - but maybe you can model the respect you want to receive, and discuss with her that even though she doesn't see you as yourself, you're trying to be genuine with her. That takes a lot of courage and vulnerability, and she should honor that. 

It's not a parent's place to raise the people we want you to become. It's our place to raise you to be yourselves. She should be proud you're able to recognize yourself, or at least expand your understanding of yourself beyond what's socially accepted. 

And at the very least maybe she'll realize her request is malicious and makes her feel bad, while your request is genuine and makes you feel good - and she should want you to feel good. You deserve that! Everyone does!

Good luck!
Looks like you got a dad now
Your dad wants to use he him, do so. Keep score. Each week announce who is getting it right. Be sure to take your dad out for plenty of outings. Ask everyone to use his requested name, etc.
Yeah I haven’t spoken to my dad in over a year because of this sort of thing. You don’t have to do anything someone tells you to 

You must set your boundaries. Let them know that if they’re not going to respect you, they can remain outside of your life

Now they’re just starting to come back into my life and actually accept me for who I am 

I agree with others that they probably don’t take it seriously enough, they need to FEEL how strongly you feel about this. 

Set those boundaries
Go out of your way to comply with what she asks. When you're in public together, and someone calls her ""ma'am"", go ahead and correct them. Something along the lines of ""it's actually sir, but he's to shy to correct you."" Make sure you constantly call her ""Dad"" in public as well. Go out of your way to say ""Dad"" and use ""he/him"" extremely often when in public places just to get the message across. The social pressure should help you a lot with this.
Tell her to go home and grab her shine box.
Sure thing Pops, let me know if you need support when you see a doctor to begin those testosterone injections, I've also fot advice on how to handle the beard once it grows in and people who can guide you with vocal coaching when that voice starts to deepen.

Go on, play this game of 'Trans Chicken' with me, I dare you.
My mom said ""what if I asked you to call me Ralph?""

I was like ""Ralph you're a dick and this conversation is over""
I wanna point out that expecting your kids to give you time and space before they transition is super problematic because it puts off potentially lifesaving healthcare so you can ""learn"" not to be a bigot when as a parent you signed up for the job of keeping your kids safe from the start they didn't sign up for being your kids. Street family is totally a thing and you arent the only parent they'll have so don't be surprised if they find a replacement parental figure. Your job was to make your children feel safe in life and you inherently failed if you asked them to put their needs before yours the adult with a chosen objective of family matters. I gave my mom a year before i told her I'd had enough and even that much time i almost didn't make it out alive
Hope you had a satisfactory resolution. Your mom's idea was mean spirited and does not really compare. Mistakes are one thing (I make them on rare occasions with my son), but as part of an argument seems different. But playing a game with your grandfather just to appease her, that's rotten manipulation.

Again, hope it all worked out in the end!
Thank you. That is precisely how I feel. I just had a hard time verbalizing that last night. With some good sleep, I'm ready to stand up for myself again!
Till my death bed I would.
Same :((
This all the way. Not only does it completely prove her wrong and that she’s actually not trying. It will likely start to slowly cause her distress if it goes on long enough. Which can then be pointed out that’s how she’s making OP feel every time she uses the wrong name or pronouns.
Yeah, mom just became Assigned Dad At Transphobia...

But also kudos to OP for being more mature than I am.
Oh, the irony! Oh, the double standards!

I revel in your sweet rebellion. Keep on fighting for yourself!
Very wise words. I definitely responded accordingly. In my situation, I've needed to learn how to make healthy boundaries way before I even transitioned. I have a lot of experience advocating myself in a stern and matter-of-fact way.

Be *cool*.
I should apologize to her? I've been understanding of her mishaps for some time, saying, ""it's ok. I know this is a process. Thanks for trying"". It's been a couple of months now, and she's mostly gotten used to it. I'm having a hard time believing her when she said this was an accident.

What would you have me apologize for?

Also, what of her wanting me to call her my dad?
no problem, and best of luck- you got this!
Same as fuck. She would forever have that title and I would NEVER stop using it.
Happy cake day
It would be really sweet to rub that in! If something like this happens again, I'll remember what you each suggested.
Being just as petty, I would use it all the time ESPECIALLY in social situations like church and coffee dates, extra loud.
Thank

New neighbor in my small apartment building. 4 units. I’m writing a welcome note with tips for living in our building. They have a trans flag in their window. Is it weird/inappropriate to acknowledge this in my note?	"I want to mention that I saw the flag in their window and want them to know they are safe and welcome here. I’m bisexual, the neighbors upstairs are a happily married gay couple, our other neighbor is straight, but supportive of all sexualities/genders/identities. I hear a lot about the struggles of trans people and the hate they can receive, but I’m not sure if it might be weird or inappropriate to mention! 

I personally think I would feel happy if someone made the effort to say I am welcome somewhere. But I know not everyone would like that. 

Any advice would be helpful! Please be honest with me. If you have any on on what to say or not say, or what you would want to hear if it was you, let me know!

Edit to add: just a few things to mention/clarify!

The flag is clearly visible from the front entrance of the building, all residents will see it coming in or out. No snooping/invasion of privacy has occurred. 

I would love to just knock and welcome them personally, as any neighbor I would, but I do not know their concerns or risk level concerning COVID. So I do not want to overstep boundaries there, which is why I decided a note would be a good first step! I will be giving them my contact info and if meeting in person is a possibility, I of course would happily accommodate. I think knowing your neighbors and community is important.

2nd edit: I appreciate you all and everyone who has commented and been kind and honest with me. I was only expecting a few answers, maybe. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, feelings and experiences ❤️❤️ much love for you all."	"I'd personally say 'love your trans flag (:' or something at the end, so then it doesn't feel forced but also acknowledges you a) know the trans flag so must be somewhat supportive and b) are supportive of trans people
If they are hanging that flag it means they're socially signaling that they are trans or support the community, they want the flag to be seen. So I wouldn't see the problem with responding to it.
Leave a pride flag in your note, like a piece of flair, but don't bring it up
I think just a general welcome note would be really nice! I totally get the impulse to specifically acknowledge the flag, and I don’t think it’d be a problem at all, but sometimes with this kind of thing there can be a paranoid feeling of like “am I being welcomed and supported as a person or taken on as like, an abstract ‘minority in need,’” so my personal instinct would be to not put it in the letter. I wouldn’t like, go out of your way to *avoid* it or anything like that lol, but just for the letter specifically I’d say just kind of welcome them like you’d welcome anyone else, maybe make a general reference to the fact that the building is very LGBTQ friendly, something like that.

This is really sweet by the way, you sound like a wonderful neighbor!
Drop your pronouns in your note.

Welcome,
Name (pronoun/pronoun)

And throw up a bi flag, and maybe the general pride progress flag that has the trans flag in it.
I'd say just welcome them as any other person? Borrow their sugar, invite them over to eat the cake you're ~~eating~~ making etc. Could be nice to also invite the other neighbors to welcome them as a community in their new building. Very likely identity etc will come up during tea time ;)
I'd say just a general welcome, add that you like the trans flag they have aaaaand, ask them they're pronouns! We love that shit. That tells a trans person a lit in terms of support.
Why not also put up a flag? 💕🦋
it would be really kind to be explicitly supportive
Hang a bisexual flag in your window!
I would straight up cry if someone went out  of the way to do that I’d be so touched. (Also as an introvert a note is far preferred first contact 😅, would want to meet eventually just less pressure that way)
If you want to mention the trans flag whitout coming of as weird, and if you're comfortable with mentioning your identity, you could mention you're also lgbt. Like something like ""as a fellow lgbt person I was glad to see your flag"" or something better worded of the same sort could work.
Maybe just draw in a little flag of your own or sumn. Little pink and blue heart or some deal. An acknowledgment, but not necessarily a loud one.
You could just write a general welcome note and when you put your name at the end, potentially put your name, apartment number, pronouns, and the flags that apply to you
Imo nope not weird at all. They have it visible so sounds like they want to show it off!
Just end the note, with no additional context, ""Trans Rights!""  


Self enclosed, self explaining. Perfect way to acknowledge / support it!
YES!

They have outed themselves, they are signaling.

If I were in their place, I would LOVE to receive such a note form a neighbour - knowing I have at least one ally in a new building would be heartwarming AND anxiety reducing.
I say, if they have the trans flag out, they welcome any positive mentions about it. If they didn’t want to know they are safe with you, they wouldn’t put out the flag. Tell them you like the flag :)
You could just add the ally flag on the note to be more ""stealthy"" about it.
But I don't see an issue with letting them know the building is a safe space for the lgbt+ 🤷‍♀️
I like that! Thank you, I appreciate you replying. ☺️
This
Right. Your comment made me realize I should not assume the person is trans, as I have not met them. That would be awkward. So I think I’ll just stick with something like the first comment mentioned, like hey, love the flag!
That’s a nice idea too ☺️ thank you!
I see your point and how I might make them question why it’s being acknowledged. Definitely will be keeping that in mind. Thank you for that insight! I appreciate it. ☺️
I agree with this. Just welcoming them should be enough indication that you support them because surely they know you've seen the flag (though I suppose you may not know what the flag means)
I love this suggestion!
I will welcome them as normal, I just also thought it might be nice to mention/connect over their flag. I would normally just knock and introduce myself, but idk if they might be high risk for Covid, or if they have any concerns about that. So I figured a note would be a good place to start. I’ll definitely be giving them my contact info, in case they need anything as a neighbor and also in case they want to actually meet or hangout!
Also our building is historic and has some tricky things! So the main purpose was to list those so they can handle them easier than I did when I first moved in 😂
Awesome. Thank you for letting me know that! I appreciate you ☺️
I actually just ordered one on Etsy! ☺️☺️
I was honestly considering doing that after I saw their flag! ☺️
Aww friend ❤️ thank you for sharing!
Ooh, that’s really good! Thank you for that suggestion. ☺️
I might draw the bisexual flag! I think that would be cute. Thank you for the suggestion!
Simple and effective. I like it! Thank you!
That’s what I’m hoping for! Thank you!
That’s a good point. Thank you!

Ah yeah I wouldn't assume they're trans. They could just be dating a trans person or friends with many etc.
Oh course! I think the other person here’s note on doing it casually, like “oh love the flag by the way” totally works too. I think the main thing is just to not make a big thing of it.
I understand what you mean, but the flag is in the window facing the front of the building taking up the whole window. Its visible every time any resident enters or leaves the building. It’s not something where you had to look hard or peer into the window to see.

Lol, identical in looks, but if this was a bar, the men's room would smell far worse and the women's would have a (longer) lineup
It looks like they both say female?
One will have pee all over the seat
You’d be surprised how many adults still believe in cooties
Yep, was in a restaurant today that had this kind of set up.  

At least in Ann Arbor a lot of the restrooms are labelled as gender neutral.
All bathrooms are pointlessly gendered imo
Its for equality of the sexes - if a woman is peeing, no other woman can over a man

Truly a 5head move /s
I don't know what it's like in other countries, but I've heard that in my country apparently it's part of the construction code to have gendered toilets even when the male and female ones are built like the ones pictured above. So ig there is a possibility that they needed to label them like that.
so, it's two rooms with a commode in each...
I'm seeing this less and less now. You could point out to the proprietor how easy it would be to make these genderless bathrooms. You never know. They might be receptive.
For a second I thought this was two bathrooms labeled ""female"" next to each other lmao
If I use the same washroom as a woman I might catch cooties :(
Cool i like that😊.but they probably did it to save money🥲
Looks fancy compared to what I'm used to seeing
For some reason, men's room is always messier and more disgusting.

&#x200B;

I'm fucking confused on why.
There are some city codes that require separate male/female bathrooms. My spouse built a small restaurant a few years ago, and you couldn't pass code with two unisex bathrooms. However, you *could* build two identical bathrooms, label them male/female, and then swap the signs after you passed inspection. I believe it was the inspector who told us that, lol.
Only because they gendered them - if they were ungendered, women could use all 3 so there's less lineup. Well, they still can use all three, because the washrooms are identical in everything but the sex designator on the door. Also it's a sushi restaurant if it matters
I've always wondered why the men's room is always smelling worse.

&#x200B;

Sadly, because I apparently has been born as a male, I have to use the men's room. I bet I would be called ""weird"" and ""pedo"" if I would try using the women's room, even though I'm a girl, and no one will change my mind.
Woman's bathrooms god Thay stink worse than men's allot of the time non of both genders apwrantly knows how to use a bathroom properly NGL
They do, and the ‘male’ one is around the corner so I couldn’t fit it into the picture. The point of including these two in the photo is that imo it’s even more ridiculous that they labelled them at all because now they have duplicates, and that could’ve clued them in to say “hey, maybe it doesn’t matter if we label these at all, since these two are already the same”
Just zoomed in, they do
Both will have pee all over the seat
Im just convinced people are straight up lying about the differences anymore. Every time ive been in a womans bathroom its just as disgusting as the mens.
If you think women don't pee on the seats in public restrooms you're in for a rude awakening. Many people don't want to touch the seat, so they pee while half-squatting.
This is in Canada in the same city as buildings with full gender-neutral-only washrooms, so that’s probably not the case unless it was changed since this building was built
They are lol
It is! Two ‘female’ right beside each other and then a ‘male’ one around the corner that I couldn’t fit in the photo. All are identical aside from the label.
In my experience, single occupancy bathrooms like these designated for males won't stop most women desperate for a pee.

And yes, type of establiahment can make a big difference. If it were a coffee shop I'd be amazed it had more than one bathroom 🤣
Don't believe this in my school the woman's bathroom was a far worse shitshow and it was a school for adults only pretty much for apprenticeships etc there was a girl that made a pentagram of period blood on the wall ;_; i mean wtf
Please don't pee on either seat. Like trans power and all that but please aim sufficient
Not for me.  Much nicer
I've been in women's restrooms for a while now
sitting down to pee is superior
Don't aim, just sit down. Trying to aim in the middle of a toilet seat is disgusting and a mess is inevitable. Bear in mind that most users of that toilet have no choice but to sit.
Haha not what I mean, there are plenty of women that squat/hover over public restroom toilets and get pee all over the seat.  That’s not just a men’s washroom thing.
>Bear in mind that most users of that toilet have no choice but to sit.

Hoverer's are a thing - and the main reason why in my experience cleaning restrooms in college the women's were almost universally worse.
Yeah this is what I was referring to, people think women’s washrooms are always cleaner which is… not true."	zjis7v	trans	435	0.98	2022-12-12 01:52:56
Trans misunderstanding	"Hey y’all!

So… I’m a therapist that works with adolescents. Some of my clients identify as trans, actually a good portion of them do.

I was talking with one of clients the other day and they were upset that their peers viewed them as a “cis-guy”. This client in particular is trans 
female->male

I responded out curiosity, “can you share with me why that’s problematic for you?” *in my head I was real confused*

Client: “I’m not a guy, I’m a trans guy.”

I asked: “got it, isn’t that how you want people to view you as? Acknowledge you and embrace you as a guy?”

Client: “yeah, but as a trans-guy. Not just a guy”

I just empathized with him on how our identity can be misunderstood and the impacts of that. But was left with questions.

Why I’m writing this post is because I’m looking for an opportunity to educate myself. Can anyone shed some light on this and give me some feedback on if there is an importance of being identified as a trans-guy vs a guy. I appreciate your patience and insight. Thanks 🙏🏽"	"Honestly, I'd ask him more questions about why he feels that way. Sometimes being seen as a cis person means having your unique experiences erased. Maybe he's looking for more community among trans people, having a sense of belonging. Maybe he feels like important parts of him aren't being seen by others. He might feel like he's not just a guy, and that transness is essential to his identity. Being seen as cis is the goal for some trans people, and it's undesirable for others. We can't accurately guess why he feels that way. Hopefully, if you're reflecting back what you hear, he'll be willing to open up about why it's important to him.
I love it when people see me as a cis girl, but if people only saw me as that, I’d feel like much of my identity is being erased, so I tell all of my friends I’m trans because I want them to see me as who I am. I hold it dearly, despite the trauma associated with it
I can understand the desire to be seen as you are rather than as society dictates we should be.  

I am an enby transfemme and while I am working hard and starting HRT to present as feminine as possible, I am not a trans woman.  I accept getting grouped in with “ladies” when I am out with my wife, but prefer people who know my well to not use distinctly female terms.

I wish there was an easier way for people to see me just for me and not have to put a gendered lens over most interactions.  That isn’t to say I don’t want to “pass” (or more likely blend), it is more an acknowledgment that my experience is mine alone and the labels I use are chosen for a reason to assist people in understanding who I am as a person.

So perhaps the difference between being seen as a trans-guy and a guy is the acknowledgment that his path has been has been different to that of a cis-guy?

Edit: for missing words! Oops
plenty of people prefer being seen as a trans guy and not a cis guy. it’s the same as wanting to be viewed as cis, it’s just who you are. they clearly know who they are and who they want to be perceived as, and there may be no way for someone who doesn’t relate to understand. /nm /g
I think a lot of cis folks (even well intentioned ones such as yourself) can get confused as to why a trans person would be upset when they're being acknowledged as cis. (Some trans people go stealth and that's fine too) 

Keep in mind that being a trans man doesn't make you any less of a man, just a different kind of one. An analogy I like to use: A black man, a disabled man, and a muslim man are all men. But they all come from different backgrounds and probably face unique struggles and have different experiences due to their own intersectionality. The same can be said about trans men and cis men. 

My guess is that a part of your client's identity or life experience feels overlooked when they're being referred to as cis.
I think its’s sort of a spectrum. Ranging from wanting to be cis passing and stealth, preferably dropping the “trans” adjective altogether, to being trans with pride and feeling that it is a crucial part of their identity.

I personally would prefer to pass, like many trans people but I don’t mind carrying the trans label around for the rest of my days. If I’d ever pass and can be stealth around people, I think I wouldn’t mind disclosing that I am trans if relevant.

On the other hand, some trans people say the weirdest shit based on self hatred and internalised transphobia (I know I do). As long as it’s not fuelled by negative emotions I wouldn’t worry about it.
While I'm not a transman, I think I have some insight into this just by existing in proximity to a few transmen. I think that due to the toxicity and problematic aspects that plague being a man in the world, it's distressing to be associated with it. Transmen have to navigate growing into their manhood without being a part of the negative and harmful aspects of it that harm men and women. They've experienced what it's like to be a woman living with all that crap and don't want to be associated with it. I can see wanting to be seen as trans being important in that way. It's a way to divorce yourself from the toxic, misogynistic crap that  pervades male communities and space.
It sounds to me like he's just very proud of being trans! It's a difficult thing to go through, and it takes a lot of genuine bravery and strength to come out and transition. So I can definitely see how he may want to honor his identity in that way. Kind of like how someone might make a point describe themselves specifically as a ""*black* man"" or an ""*indigenous* woman"". There's a level of control in reclaiming and asserting your identity in a world that is historically against you.
Some people don’t like that their identities kind of get swept under the rug if they’re considered cis. Personally, if people saw me as a cis woman I’d be happy, but to each their own
Cis-ish and queer here — the flip side of passing is erasure.
I’m an elder fully medically transitioned FTM and I get what your client is saying. On my documents I’m male but in person I identify as a trans man. I was telling a medically provider my pre existing conditions of high blood pressure, sleep apnea being over and remarked “middle aged guy stuff” and she said “ isn’t that what you wanted” that was a very offensive remark. It’s seems like medical professionals love to say stupid stuff to me like “isn’t that what you wanted” “ I could never tell you were a girl” or “but you pass so well”. I usually reply back “well, you pass so well too!” Or “I’m not wearing a Halloween custom”. My experience comes from being a man born as a woman and then going through a lot of physical pain with the surgeries, social pain and emotional pain from losing family members. It’s s stupid cisgender thing to say “well, you pass as cisgender man now so everything is great” which is so so very negating and invalidating of my true self and culture. For me the goal of transitioning was to be happy not to “pass and disappear into the cisgender sunset”. It’s very arrogant for cisgender people to think that trans people only exist to pass. So they are upset by the trans gender anomalies. This subject really gets me hot, especially with all the crap I’ve had to put up with with cisgender medical providers. Simply put the goal of my existence is not to make cisgender more comfortable by passing but for my own happiness in my own skin.
[deleted]
I'm not going to presume to know your patients mind, but I can tell you why i'd be upset to be seen as a cis woman.


Being trans is part of me - my life, my identity, my past and my future. It took me decades of work and sweat and *so much pain* to get where i am today.
It was an uphill battle almost all the way so far and i can honestly say that i am proud of myself to have made it. And i am happy to be trans. 

Transitioning is the thing that keeps me going, even though most of us have to fight and argue for basic rights and medical care or even to be seen as normal human beings; all of which cis people just get handed by default.


I'm a woman, but i'm not cis. I don't know what it means to *be* cis. And i'd resent to be called something that i am not, especially when it implies that my struggles are getting ignored or erased.
Even post-transition, even if we pass perfectly and the whole rest of the world assumes we're cis, trans-ness is still a huge part of our life story. It colors everything about the way we grew up, the experiences we had, the way we felt about those things, the way we view gender and gender dynamics in the world, etc.

Not everybody always *wants* to be known as ""the trans guy""--we don't want transness to eclipse everything else about us, as trans-ness is not the sum total of our existence--but at the same time we don't alwyas want it to be ignored either. 

It's like when you hear someone proclaim, ""I'm a strong black woman, and I'm proud of who I am!"" If someone else were to say ""but why did you put 'black' in there. You're just a woman like any other."" That would probably be pretty offensive, right? Because race (at least in America today) is a huge shaping factor in anyone's life story. Yes, she's a woman like any other, but her blackness is nevertheless an extremely important part of her overall identity. Not to eclipse everything else, but also not to be ignored.
I think the context of this really matters. A few scenarios popped up in my mind, though I’m obviously no psychologist so I feel free to take it for what it is. 

One, it’s possible he may have been in a situation where he wished to be perceived as trans, ie in an LGBTQ+ space where there could meet other potential trans people and whatnot. 

Two, he is not yet finished exploring his gender and is still coming to terms with that. For example I (an amab) loved being feminine and had jumped to assuming I was a woman. After coming as such to a small group, I realized being referred to as a woman isn’t what I wanted, and that I was really just on the feminine side of being non-binary. I’m not saying this is the case for your client, but he could be going through something similar. 

Three, and this is the least favorable scenario that I sincerely hope is not true; perhaps he wishes to have the positive attention correlated with being trans. This is the least likely option, but depending on where you are and what environment he is in, he may perceive being trans as “cool” or something along those lines. I have had experiences with people like that in the past which is the only reason I mention it. That being said, again it’s fairly unlikely, and I don’t think that would be the case (would also depend on how far along in the transitioning process he is). 

These are the only possible things I could come up with, but further context would probably be needed. I’m also no expert on anything so I could be totally wrong or off.
As a trans guy myself, it just kind of diminishes the struggles that we’ve gone through to transition at all. I don’t pass whatsoever, but if I did I couldn’t just let people close to me assume I’m cis, because being trans is such a massive part of my life.

It’s hard to explain but it’s kind of like winning a race and hanging up your trophy, y’know? You worked so hard to win and want to show off how far you’ve come, but when someone gets to know you, you need to show them your trophy so they understand how hard it was for you to win. If that analogy sucked, I’m sorry, but if it was decent, I hope you understand more 👍
I think it may have to do with validating his identity. For me, it took me a long time to accept I was trans so now I am extremely proud of my identity. once I come out I’d like people to remember that part of me bc it’s very important to who I am and have become.
Perhaps your client doesn't want to be labelled into a binary system?

Through my own journey into gender identity, there was a point where binary thinking in terms of gender was counter-intuitive to accepting my own identity. The dissonance of holding a binary and non-binary system in your head can only work for so long. I realised one is finite and limited in scope and the other is more in line with how humans actually present and identify themselves, ie, a spectrum of gender identities, not just 2 lols. 

Personally, I like what my psychiatrist said to me. I present female but am non-binary with gender fluidity. Sometimes its easier to present masculine to go get an icecream from the shop as i am yet to start HRT, I feel my gender fluidity in terms of physical appearance will change but i cant discount my experiences and insights as a biological male at birth. 
I still identify as a woman but struggle to justify having a binary gender too, just to make it more spicy
Adding on to what others have said, theres the way that among the lgbt community, cis men (even cis gay men) have a poor reputation. Many cis women have trauma around cis men, and project that trauma onto all men. Cis lesbian spaces are very well known for kicking out and cutting off trans men who used to be lesbians (also bisexual women become a ""debate"" in some lesbian spaces). Trans women can be hard to relate to and get along with for many trans men due to the whole ""men bad, i hated being a man, every man should be feminized"" talk that runs heavy in transfem spaces. 

All of these struggles create an environment where trans men and transmascs want to emphasize their transness. We get made to feel vilified for embracing our masculinity, and everyone starts projecting their trauma onto us simply for being masculine which is a large shock after spending our lives finding community with these people. But cis men can never understand misogyny the way that trans men can, and its hard for many trans men to associate with them without feeling that pressure. So pushing forward transness is a way to show ""im not like the cis men that have hurt you""
hmm

not sure how to respond to this either
I prefer to be recognized as a transwoman.  I'm not a ciswoman.
I believe I understand where he is coming from, but he needs to figure out how to articulate his feelings.

The answer to ""Why?"" in this situation shouldn't just be ""because I'm trans"" but also why that distinction is important to him in a social context. There are multiple possibilities with different implications.

As for solutions: he can try showing off his power level. Pronoun pins, trans pride accessories, etc. That's fairly non-intrusive while flagging to others that he’s trans and that it’s a valued part of his identity.
It varies from person to person. Some trans people do want to be seen as cis - indistinguishable from cis people, treated identically, etc.

Others, however, feel that the ""trans"" part is important to their identities. Like, for me personally - I also wouldn't want to be seen as a cis man, because I don't think that's accurate to my experience or what I'm trying to convey with my gender. I am very specifically a trans guy, with the female history and experiences that entails. That part still feels important and relevant to me. So if someone thought of me as a cis guy, they'd be getting my gender right, but not getting *me* right. And since (for me, anyways) my gender is a vehicle for expressing myself, ""getting the gender without getting me"" is kind of defeating the point.

Tl;dr: The typical concept of ""trans people want to be seen exactly like cis people"" is true for many, but there are also large groups that feel that the ""trans"" portion of their identity is just as important as the gender.
Thats a personl thing. Some want to be seen as just the gender they are and some want to be seen as trans in addition. For me Id prefer to just be seen as a guy but I know some guys want to be seen as cis because some have said their expiernce being percieved as a girl shaped them and some feel its part of who they are.
I’m trans and even I don’t understand. I prefer when people view me as a cis-guy but that’s what I guess it is? Preference?
2 things.

1 being a “man” or “woman” is largely based on how society treats you.  I think if you identify as a trans man or trans woman it could partially be recognizing, and maybe being ok with, the fact that you’ve changed physically, but maybe not in the eyes of society/experience.

2 I think a lot of people may want an identity that is more closely related to the larger queer community.  To not just be a man or woman, but to be a trans man or woman that comes with the support provided by our LGBTQIA+ siblings and strength forged by those that came before us.
A lot of people prefer to be seen as a trans guy because cus-guys go through privilege they never had. Trans guys understand the struggle and the pain while cis-guys would not. Being seen as a cis-guy is almost like an insult to most people. 

There are of course other trans people who wish they were seen as cis, in my experience mostly trans women, but for trans guys they usually prefer to be seen as trans because of the whole white cis male privilege and stuff. 

Plus it erases part of your identity if you’re not seen as who you are; trans.
Personally I think it may have to do with their time before Transitioning, as the struggles they have faced before then shaped their identity, this is just anecdotal observation based on myself.
It’s best to keep in my that no member of the trans-community is a monolith. That there is no one size fits all when it comes to how we feel or wish to be identified as. Some of us, like myself, fully embrace being identified as cis, and do not cling to our trans-identity. We see it as more of a transition that we wish to complete to become our true selves and not our identity. Others see it as a part of themselves and their identity. Some of us experience a different feeling or identity than either of those, sometimes feeling both. The point is none of these are the right or wrong way to feel. Every experience is different and valid, and you cannot compare two members of the trans community together to determine who’s right or wrong in how they express themselves or their identity. Not saying that you are, of course!
It's ok to not be cis but a trans guy it's jist a guy. There are many identities on the trans umbrela but trans men are just  men  and trans women just women. I see many non  binary people commenting probably the trans guy is a flavor of non binary.
I think for myself as a trans masculine enby, I’d never want to be seen as a cis-man partially because it wouldn’t acknowledge the struggles you went there to get there. I’m proud of myself for everything I’ve done and gone through up until now, and I think especially since it’s a cis-MAN (the most privileged gender) it would really feel quite dismissive of my experiences.
I mean, if that's what he wants people should respect it. Some Black people in America might prefer to be called African-American even though most don't. Some trans people want to pass, some don't.

Personally, I identify as non-binary transmasc. I want to be treated as a man but present in a mixed way that isn't pure ""cis man"". Yeah, cis men can also dress femme or whatever they like. At a certain point it's semantics and we should just let people want what they want. 

Being trans requires really thinking and experiencing one's gender. The transition itself is an important part of the process. Even if it were possible to do instantaneous/rapid transition not everyone would choose that.

Plus, if being trans is important to your identity either out of a feeling of community, or your experience, or because the fact of it affects your life and you don't want others to forget it, or any reason... Like that's okay.
I have no idea if this is the case but let me take a crack at it.

I’ve heard other trans men talk about how different the world is once they pass and people think they’re cis. How they once had a camaraderie with women, but now women put up those cold fronts to protect themselves, because they- like all unknown men- are now a potential threat. 

I’ve heard trans men talk about how isolating it is to step into that world, where you’re not able to be emotionally open, where people just kind of ignore you.

Do you think maybe that’s it? That this person is being perceived as cis and thus is losing that sort of closeness and ability to be emotionally open?
Passing as a trans woman erases you existence. It’s great to be treated normal but thinking that it’s only bc you pass as cis can cause stress. I want trans to be just as normal as cis
Apart from the other answers here, I have found that there’s a certain community to be found in appearing visibly queer in daily life, and the solidarity that offers with other visibly queer people. I know that one of my fears when I start passing is that I’ll lose some of that kinship and ‘secret language’ when in public. Going from being perceived as an ally and fellow queer person to a member of a cis male majority is kind of a daunting prospect; people can incorrectly assume that once trans men start to pass they essentially ‘graduate’ from the community due to not experiencing oppression, when in fact this is not the case and being part of the queer community is important for a lot of us. I find it similar to the way bi and pan people talk about being treated as ‘basically straight’ when they date someone of the perceived opposite sex, and how aro and ace people sometimes feel as well.
I’m a very out trans woman. I don’t try to pass as cis, I don’t even try to be cis. I am a woman. I’m a trans woman. I don’t necessarily care if someo mistakenly thinks I’m cis or if I do pass that well it’s not intentional.
As a trans woman this makes a lot of sense to me. I draw strength from my trans identity, and want people to see me as my identity. People knowing and loving me as a trans woman is so much better than people thinking I’m a cis woman, even if my goal is to appear like a cis woman. However sometimes safety dictates I go stealth.
-
I’d also like to point out, that even among trans men, there is still a general distrust or resentment towards cis man. I TOTALLY understand not wanting to be identified as a cis man.
Well, wanting to be seen as cis is an assimilationist view that a lot of trans people seem to be moving away from.

Our experiences are unique, and *very* different from those of cis people, so even ""binary"" trans people seem to be identifying as ""Trans Wo/Man"" before ""Wo/Man""
people seeing you as cis does take away a huge part of your identity . i know there are plenty of trans people who want to be stealth but for some people being trans is very important to who they are as a person .
For the longest time when I came out all I wanted was to pass as cis. Now that I’m older and I understand my identity more, I’m not longing for that amount of passing. I’m proud to be trans, and while I still want to pass, I’m not as focused on being stealth or completely passing as a cis guy. My transness is who I am, it makes me, me, and it’s not something I would give up for the world.
As a trans guy, I personally don’t feel 100% aligned with binary cis guys. While everyone is different, I personally just feel like my own definition of guy.
i’m ftm and it can be really hard to be seen as a cis man after growing up as a girl. for the first 16 years of my life, my impression of cis men and boys by and large was that they would be cruel, hurtful, oppressive, callous, chauvinist, and selfish. my experience with cis men mostly amounted to being put down, shut up, and hurt, so you can imagine that made it hard to imagine that a man could be anything but bad. i think for me, being seen as a cis man is a vast misinterpretation of my experience in life. the fact that i grew up transgender impacts who i am so much, and i would never want to leave that behind. i won’t pretend i have nothing to unpack, but i think it’s a pretty reasonable response to my situation.
This may end up being worded wrong, but to me being trans is a big part of my identity. Maybe eventually i wont want to be seen as trans, but as it is now, it plays a big part of my life and it's definitely not something i'm ashamed of. May not be the same for them but i like ""looking"" trans, because i know that if i saw another visibly trans or queer person my age it would make me happy to see someone else open about it. I like being the representation i dont get to see much and that i always enjoy seeing. But other than that, i love being afab. I have no dysphoria about it, other than the social one. I feel good in my body and i only get dysphoria from not being seen as a guy/transmasc, if that makes sense.
30 something transman here. Despite the hell I went through (extremely abusive parents, no safe, kind, or trustworthy adults or peers in my life until I met my gf last year, and we are still trying to find safe housing) im personally glad I’m trans as well-adjusted, emotionally healthy, responsible, and respectful cis people are the exception not the norm - and regardless of how any individual cis boy is raised by their primary caregivers…cis boys are socially conditioned by general society (peers, school, capitalism, other adults, and online) to become abusive at best and lethal threats at worst. 

So yeah, I would fucking hate to be seen as a cis man. Me and my trans man buddies talk about how incomprehensible road rage is and strategies for using our increased physical strength to physically intimidate and if needed, physically attack our AFAB peers being targeted at social events by gross cis men.
It sounds like he needs help articulating where exactly he’s feeling misgendered or had his gender overlooked and how to explain it to his friends so that they can correctly acknowledge his gender in the future. Have him give situations and evaluate what specifically bothered him and help him come up with how he would have changed the interaction and how to articulate that to his friends so that things go better in the future. I wonder what specifically is bothering him, did they say something that implied they forgot he gets a period (if he still gets one?) Or that he can’t produce sperm? Are they doing something that makes him feel excluded as someone who has or has had a uterus or other anatomy-based issue? What specific interactions are bothering him?
Sounds like your client is young and still figuring out things tbh. This isnt something that, well, any trans people that Ive encountered would want for, ie to be “othered” like that. 

The only thing that I would hypothesize surrounding them being upset about being seen as cis, is that in some arenas of online trans culture, cis folks are vilified—kind of seen as an enemy that wants to destroy the trans community and doesnt make an effort to understand us. Obviously thats a very polarizing perspective, but if your client is online a lot, and young, it might be something that they’ve latched onto for a sense of personal empowerment. 

r/arethecisok is a meme Reddit, just to give you an example of some of the discourse surrounding that. For the record no, not all trans people feel this way about cis, yourself being an easy example to contradict that “stereotype.” But I do think, and especially with the political background of today, its moreso young people leaning into that rhetoric, so perhaps (again, just hypothesizing) that has some influence on the client’s rejection of being identified as such.
I've never heard of someone being upset because they were unclockable before, granted I'm new to accepting my own gender. If I was able to be seen as a cis woman, I'd be over the moon!   


I guess in this particular situation, they wanted to pass as a man, but wanted to keep some of their identity as a woman, so when they thought he was a cis man, it was like losing that last shred of womanhood they had?  


That's not to say that that's how they felt, and as a disclaimer, I'm not a therapist, but putting myself into that mindset, that's the closest I can think of.
To me that just feels like either internalised transphobia or maybe not being entirely binary? Which obviously there's nothing wrong with. 

I'm ftm and I often have the opposite problem, people treat me as ""man adjacent"" and I hate it because internally I just feel like a cis guy, and a lot of binary ftm people I know feel the same.

Also I'm not stealth and don't intend to be as most of my friends are queer, but honestly despite the fact that as a trans guy I have different experiences as cis guys I see myself as a man just the same.

He could also just be really proud of being trans? But personally I don't see how that would make him wanted to be treated differently to other men.
Although a lot of trans folx aspire to be able to be stealth passing (passing so well everyone assumes they're cis), folx who are stealth often talk about the loneliness of it all. That you feel sort of trapped. Because anytime you bring up your transness it can feel like this moment of major disclosure. Many CIS people are often shocked or even act betrayed when someone tells them they're trans (*how could you not tell me this until now?*). There is this sort of *expectation* of disclosure that I think can get exhausting. And the flip side is that you can feel alienated from the comradery of other trans folx who don't see you as part of the community.

You can sort of get caught between the two. And it can feel very lonely.
I sincerely appreciate all the feedback and insight that’s been provided to me. As it’s my own responsibility to educate myself, I deeply am in gratitude for the responses.
to be perfectly honest id have no idea why someone would want this and ive never heard of it before. id give literally anything for people to not think im trans, theres literally only downsides. being visibly trans gets me called slurs in public and threatened by random strangers. the only exception i can think of where id want people to know im trans is only with people im really close to, but you can just tell them youre trans if you want that.
Maybe is by his efforts, when you say guy instead trans guy, probably he feels that his efforts for change don't exist or are forgotten
Hmm, I've never thought about that. As a transwoman I'm fairly open about it, but obviously there is place, time, and environment. However, I'm not open about it because I want to be recognized as trans; I'm open about it because they may help other pre-hrt or closeted folk feel they belong.

It makes sense to not want to be identified as a cis-guy, because that could absolutely feel like a dismissal of their struggles and the things they've gone through. It's interesting.
I can't speak from experience but my understanding is that there is a lot of contempt for cis-male. A lot of FTMs that I talk to don't identify as cis-male because of how toxic that can be. They'd rather identify as queer or trans guy or NB, etc. 

&#x200B;

Me myself, I identify as FEMALE. I do not want to be seen as trans haha. So .... it takes all kinds.
A lot of trans folk have no desire to pass as cis. Our gender identity is a badge of pride and for us we want to separate our gender expression or our physical appearance from our gender identity. A lot of us find that the notion of passing as cis can feed into the binary and be counterproductive to our cause.
It's part of his identity and he doesn't want it erased. Imagine he was biracial, and people only saw him as one race. He wants and needs and deserves to be celebrated for both.
I have commented similiar thing when i said my goal is to beca woman. For me beign a trans is just phase in between to final outcome.
So you are a professional therapist with multiple trans clients and you come to reddit for information? That seems very unprofessional to be honest. I mean there are many official organisations and resources. Why come to reddit for that?
In addition to all the possibilities listed here, I think it’s important to recognize that nearly all adolescents are working through gender issues and roles and how they want to be perceived and behave, whether cis or trans.
First time I see a transgender man upset for looking cis, maybe he might be nonbinary of some sort? Since you know, a Transgender man wouldn't feel bad about being viewed as a man.
I would tell them, that most trans guys want to be seen as “just a guy”, in fact, I think a majority of trans people don’t want the label “trans”. Maybe they should consider if they’re non binary? 

Either that or he’s made a negative connotation of being a guy with being a perv/bad person. And that’s a whole different kind of topic.
I see that many of my peers would relate to your patient. However, I want to mention that it definitely depends because I would not be upset that people would perceive me as a cis woman. I also think pride might come into play. Trans people go through different struggles (not better or worse) than cis people so naturally I can understand why people would want to make sure their trans identity is recognized. I am very grateful for my community and “proud” of my journey however for myself, I would not choose for people to see me as trans women over cis women.
This can't be real, I cannot believe an actual therapist would do something like this, just straight up posting a conversation with a client, hella illegal
Please seek clinician supervision and consultation instead of using Reddit to explore and make a population that isn’t a therapists a teacher.
Tbh, I don’t know. I don’t want people around me to know that I’m trans, I just want to live as any other guy world.
Also he probably just doesn’t want to be associated politically with cis men and being adamant about being trans sort of elevates you socially among queer people due to their disdain of cis men
Good on you for making this post, OP! I'm a clinician who's been working with TGD adolescents and adults for years, and I wish more therapists were also focused on understanding their clients' unique perspectives. Noticing, investigating and accepting our contradictions is a key part of the therapy process.

I don't have anything else significant to add to the great responses already on this thread, but feel free to message me if you have more professional questions ✌🏻.
personally I think fading into normal society is not the best idea while I can totally understand why alot of people do. personally I will always want to be seen as trans because the best thing we can do for the community and our cause is just meet people. the more people have interactions with trans people and have that realization that were all just perfectly normal people that are the same as they are, the more progress we make towards wider acceptance.
i want to be seen as cis, some want to be seen as trans, i think it depends on how you think of being trans, for me it’s just fucking pain that i want to stop dealing with and forget, but for some it’s something more and a more important part of who they are
I understand the sentiment here. This trans guy probably wants to highlight that his experiences are fundamentally different from cis guys despite them sharing a gender. Maybe you could ask him yourself why he'd rather specifically have the trans label included in his gender identity than not!
MtF here, I'm only 31 but I've noticed a lot of mid 20s trans persons identify as trans-""X"". (Insert preferred noun here) It's almost as if the younger they are, the more vehemently they proclaim their trans-ness. A cultural paradigm shift perhaps? 🤔 (Don't take this as a statement of fact, but a very select group of people in my area, not a reliable sample size.)  I also don't understand it, I hate that I wasn't born in the right body, I want nothing more than to be recognized and known as I am, a female-though, admittedly, took a loooong time till I could go through with what I knew I needed. I'm proud I have the ability to be a trans-woman, but I'm not proud that I am a trans-woman.

With that being said, I've had some friends explain how proud they are they're trans because it's part of their journey. It's impossible to remove our history but, recontextualising our past is possible. They've found inner strength through their journey and want that to be acknowledged just as much as their gender. 

I think it's a super affirming and positive take, even if I lack the perspective to internalize it.
OP, you had me really confused with your notation *trans female > male* haha     
He is a trans man, just say so or trans masculine. :’-)   

Personally, I‘d be happy if I was viewed as a cis guy tbh, but I kiiiiinda get him.   

See, transphobes always pretend like *we claim* we‘re 100% exactly like cis people of our gender, but for *some* of us that isn‘t true and we don‘t mind to have a few different experiences than cis men.  
I was forced to live as a woman for decades and that caused me to have very distinct experiences. They‘re part of my life. For example, it would probably be frustrating if some day people will act like I don‘t know anything about the life of women. While it‘s true that I don‘t share many experiences with them, the few we do share matter to me (like the impact of sexism or machism or understanding some of women‘s health concerns).   
Nonetheless I know why people cannot see this by looking at me. So personally, I don‘t mind if they would assume wrong.  

It‘s similar to an experience I recently had:  someone thought I didn‘t understand the discrimination foreign-looking people experience in my place. Little did they know I was often assumed to be a foreigner in my life and harassed accordingly, including racist comments by family members.   
It was a sad moment, because there was this shared experience we had and could use to bond over and get to know each other, but they didn‘t see it/dismissed it. A little like being turned down on a dating site haha   

I wonder if he has similar hopes, if people were able to see that he‘s trans?  
You should ask what being trans and being recognized as such means to him. Maybe there is a hidden wish he can fullfill with other means.
In my opinion, I think it’s because some trans people don’t particularly like to be associated with cis people, as some cis people can be toxic and stuff
For the most part I want to stealth so I’d rather people not know I’m trans. But to people close to me, being trans to important to acknowledge because a large part of my life I live in the female gender role. I have empathy for what women go through with sexual harassment, pressure to be beautiful and periods. It’s still part of me.
idk(im ftm) but its apart of smth big, and its also a benefit to find people similar to u
I'm a trans guy and I lead with saying I'm trans because I'm just afraid that if I ever get caught with a binder or with a packer or if something were to happen that would make me sus, I would scare and confuse people and I'd have to explain myself right then and there.  
I absolutely hate confusion and many hate being confused, so I see it as an easier way...  
I don't know if any of that made sense, but that's my explanation...
I would like to be seen as just a guy, but with my friends at the very least, I want my trauma and my struggle to be acknowledged. I want to be congratulated on how far I’ve come, but I still want to be just a guy 


-16 (almost 17)y/o Female->Masc-Enby
There is a lot of contempt and hostility directed towards cis boys/men (in certain communities). I’m MTF, and I’ve noticed since I started transitioning that in people in those type of communities/places where I used to be automatically registered with suspicion or hostility, people are noticeably nicer to me now.
I relate to this, in my case I will likely never be confused for a Cis woman, however. The fact that it is such a struggle for us, and the fact that it takes many of us awhile to come to terms ourselves I feel like, being trans is part of my identity an identity that I'm now proud of. I've had alot of sleepless nights worried about how others would think, or how others would view me. I'm now in a place where I'm largely accepted for who I was always meant to be.
Although a lot of trans folx aspire to be able to be stealth passing (passing so well everyone assumes they're cis), folx who are stealth often talk about the loneliness of it all. That you feel sort of trapped. Because anytime you bring up your transness it can feel like this moment of major disclosure. Many CIS people are often shocked or even act betrayed when someone tells them they're trans (*how could you not tell me this until now?*). There is this sort of *expectation* of disclosure that I think can get exhausting. And the flip side is that you can feel alienated from the comradery of other trans folx who don't see you as part of the community.

You can sort of get caught between the two. And it can feel very lonely.
Personally, as a binary trans man I love it when others assume I am cis when I walk around in my day to day life. I find I get treated better, and it makes me feel safer around strangers. I feel better about myself, more confident and secure in my masculinity. I do not like being treated differently from cis men, me being trans doesn’t make me any less of a man. All I want is to just be treated equal to other men.
However, I never deny that I am trans and being trans is an important part of my identity and who I am as a person, and I am proud to be a trans man. I advocate for trans men wherever I can. I have no problem with my close friends and family knowing I am trans, I am quite open about it in that regard, but I do not feel it appropriate to tell everyone I meet unless it is truly relevant. 
I do not need strangers to know my struggle, I do not care if people make assumptions. I am proud of myself, and my friends are proud, and that is enough. My transition was to get to this point: In public I am seen as a man, perceived no different from other men. That is what relieves my dysphoria. It is usually when people look at me differently once they find out I’m trans that I become majorly dysphoric, even when some people have good intentions.
My husband also had problems with that. He didn't want to be seen as not queer. Mostly he has solved that with wearing some rainbow stuff (bracelet or sweater or pin).
Speaking as someone who identifies as a trans-woman instead of as a woman, I can't say my experiences match your client's experiences 1-to-1, so I won't speak on his behalf, but I'll tell you my personal experience in the hopes that it will help. For me, my identity stems from a nuanced thought. I am composed of a unique mix of body and sex characteristics, hormones, knowledge, memories, and experiences that, when aggregated together, don't fall well into either male or female. So, instead of trying to change these factors, some of which are immutable like ""my past"", I'd instead eschew the expectations to conform to a new societal set of norms and embrace my unapologetic, authentic self.  


I transition because it calls to me, because it's what I truly desire to do, because it matches who I am and what I seek in life. For me, that's more than enough to carry me forward.
100% this. The trans man in question is the only one who knows what's important to him and why. He's the one OP should be asking.
This comment is absolutely right. As another possibility, I’d ask you to consider patriarchy - as a trans guy, you’ve spent a significant portion of your life experiencing things women experience, like “nice guys” and “is that guy walking behind me safe” and “I need to keep an eye on my drink.” On the other hand, being viewed as a cis guy exposes you to stuff like “locker room talk.” As a cis guy, you might have heard about women’s issues and be sympathetic, but that’s oceans away from having lived it. Erasing a trans guy’s transness is also a huge issue with their patriarchal identity - erasing a person’s shared experiences with women erases their “safe” identity and erases their “not around me” aura for men who have shitty and sexist “humor.”

I guess TL;DR is that transness and a person’s trans identity is about more than their identity - it’s about how they get to interact with the society they live in, and has effects their ability to maintain/break down societal issues. You might have to get real intersectional with it, I guess. And I’m a white person talking, so there may be even more to it if your client is POC.
I agree with this for myslef, I’d love to be generally seen as a woman by strangers but being a trans woman is still part of my identity and I don’t want to hide from that around eveyone
Exactly this, I like being perceived as a cis woman which is how most people do, but I want the people close to me to know because that experience is a fundamental part of how I became me.
I’d rather be called a cis-girl, but I understand.
Interesting, because I hate that I am trans and just want to be cis. I absolutely hate that I wasn't born cis. That being said, Its just myself I hate, no one else lmao
Man that’s awesome. It breaks my heart when my GF says being trans is the “least favorite thing” about herself. She passes better than 99% so she doesn’t face too much consequences of it. I think maybe it would be odd to be specifically proud of it (although I do think her accomplishments mean more because of it), but it sucks to hear her associate it with negativity.
I would like to such distinction to exist, I don't see myself as cis or trans just a woman. I thought oir movement was to erase that distinction in society
Definitely this. It’s a level of recognition for the background and history, as well as privileges. A trans guy will by average have had a harder time getting through normal life than a cis guy, but they will also likely be better understanding of other genders, and more likely a good feminist as a result. They also may have medical differences to a cis guy.

Personally I’d want people to view me as trans and not cis, because:
1. I’m not trying to assimilate into society’s so-called binary, I’m being my true self. Society has erased our colourful gender history through Christo-fascist colonial patriarchy (otherwise culturally we’d see all kinds of genders - because they have always existed - and the idea of a binary would be ridiculous). Note: some people do want to fit in and that’s totally valid for all kinds of reasons, this is just imo.

2. I want people to know I’m not cis because I have had horrific experiences with cis guys over and over again - as every woman, afab, femme, enby etc has had. I want to distance myself from that because I have spent a lot of my life actively battling that behaviour and mentality, as have many trans folks, because trans lives (and women’s and femme’s lives) depend on it. 

It might be worth asking about this so you can reflect on your client’s reasoning, if they’re comfortable to elaborate. All of us are different, and it’s great you’re reaching out for better understanding of trans experiences and identities.
this is explanation that makes most sense to me as well. i don’t identify quite as a binary man, i’m like man-adjacent. a man nonetheless, but different from how cis-men are men (this obviously does not go for all transmen). however i differ from this persons clients in that i do want the general public to see me as a cis-man, it’s just easier that way for me. what’s important is that i, and the people close to me, know that there’s a little bit more to it than that. gender is weird and wiggly, and i’m a weird and wiggly dude.
This is very well put
Being wanting to seen as just a woman doesn't necessarily means wanting to stealth I just want to be seen as anormal woman but wiouth having to stealth.
[removed]
this is great.
This is a good point. Trans men are very often victimized by cis men for being trans, and being viewed as a part of that same group that hurt you sometimes feels insulting, at least in my experience. I'm glad I'm seen as a guy, but the fact that I might make a woman feel unsafe while walking alone, or that someone might assume I'm a perpetrator of violence instead of a survivor myself, that really hurts.
This is why I am totally confused most of the time. Putting in the effort but capping at 95%. 'Eyyy, I'll go far, but not _that_ far'
Option 4: He considers the ""trans"" part relevant to his identity, which could happen for a variety of reasons.

Personally, I'm a trans man who finds the ""trans"" part important because... IDK, I just wouldn't be who I am if I was a cis man. The way I experience my gender is very influenced by the fact that I'm transitioning to it and the fact that I lived as a different gender for a very long time. So if I was seen as a cis man, people would only be getting the most surface-level understanding of my gender, whereas seeing me as a trans man would get them closer to the truth.
To your third point; As trans people are like any other people, there are those that virtue-signal. Like you said, I hope it isn't the case. It's crappy behavior regardless of whatever virtue being being put on display. 

I agree that they're probably looking for the inclusivity and community though.
wanting to be seen as a trans guy and wanting to keep part of your womanhood is not the same. as someone who also relates to wanting to be seen differently than a cis guy i do not want to keep any of my identity as a woman. as you said this person very well could feel that way or very well could not. personally i just don’t want to be seen as a cis guy. for me it isn’t anything deep or any specific reason, i just don’t want to be seen as one. i want to be treated and seen as a guy, yes, but not a cis one. /g/nm
True, and they likely will ask him, but it’s still good to get a wider perspective on the topic. It can help ensure the right questions are asked and the right support given to facilitate the discussion.
A trans woman is just a woman, that's why the trans movement exist for. it's ok to now want to be seen as cis but other like saying we are just not women .I feel internalized transphobia is weird in this sub and seen as a progresive take.
>what’s important is that i, and the people close to me, know that there’s a little bit more to it than that. gender is weird and wiggly, and i’m a weird and wiggly dude

Lmao. I get what you're saying and love the way you phrased ""wiggly dude"" and as a trans non-binary person who has 0 personal attachment to gender at all I thought ""if yours is a weird wiggly dude than mine is probably something like a plain smooth rock except there is no rock where the gender should be because my gender doesn't exist."" Which doesn't seem as fun but it's accurate.
Trans men are FtM not MtF. Did you mix them up?
Ah, I see! Thanks for clarifying that! I could definitely be completely wrong and it could also be that he just simply doesn't want to be seen as a cis male, which to be frank, I can empathize with. 

&#x200B;

I do want to apologize if my response was assuming or anything, I tried to think of it in a none-assuming way.
Forest for the trees, my friend. No movement is ever indicative of the feelings of a whole community. Gender is such a spectrum that there should be no problem with someone wanting to be proud of being a trans woman or trans man. As well as nothing should be wrong about a trans individual dropping the trans label should they want to and just being a man or a woman. I think you're seeing the trans label and having a knee-jerk reaction of internalized transphobia but that's not always the case, and doing such is only a disservice to those who feel their comfortable within that label. Im a trans woman, am I saying I'm not a woman? No. Im woman just a trans one because trans women are women, just like women of color are women. Or low income women are women. The adjective in this case isn't something that should devalue the view of oneself. I could get into the whole sociological debate on self constructed realities and what that means and the idea of symbolic interactionism, but that's a whole other post.

Edit: Spelling Errors.
But that's your personal experience. Just because *you* would rather be perceived as cisgender doesn't mean that *every trans person* feels the same way. Or that they're wrong to feel differently. Everyone experiences gender and transitioning differently, and no way is inherently more correct than others.

Personally, if everyone in my life thought I was cis, I feel like I'd be losing part of who I was. My transition has played such a huge role in who I am, and how my personality developed. I've had different life experiences from cis women, and I don't like the idea of just sweeping that huge part of who I am under the rug and pretending it's not there.

I'm purposefully using cis and trans here in front of the word ""woman""; trans women and cis women are both subcategories of ""woman"", and both groups have equal claim to the label. It's just that ignoring the ""trans"" in front of ""woman"" makes me feel like I'm erasing my own identity and experiences.
That’s the thing too, I don’t always feel like a woman either sometimes I just feel more neutral. I’d rather most people see me as a woman but the people close to me see me as mg full identity
I’ve always wanted to been seen as a cis woman idk I don’t like to tell people I’m trans really rather just be a woman
oh no no i didn’t get impression. it was mostly to give a different view and incase someone else were to start assuming!
I'm proud of being trans woman that doesn't change a trans woman is just a woman. If the movement pushed to trans women not being women I would go against. That's the wholesome reason I'm part of it is trans women being seen as women. A d black women don't say I'm a black woman not a woman they reclaim womanhoof as any women group. 

I particularly figth to the distinction between cis and trans disolve. Stealthing doesn't solve my problems at all. You don't like being othered just Stealth it's pretty much a shitty advice. I already stealth I just want to be treated normaly and being trans not to matter. Am that requieres a change in society. That doesn't make me less proud of being trans.
That make sense and it's valid ,gender can be complex. I just don't like when it's synthesized a trans woman is not a woman or less of a woman for being trans. 

I even push sometimes in the opposite way, like being trans just makes us more of a woman or that sort of stuff.

 I would prefer neutrality but  I think it's good to push in the opposite way of the oppression to achive that too.

I don't like cis women being seen as the women by default, they aren't. I'm owner of womanhood as much as them.
I just would like to feel normal and safe wiouth having to worry about people seen me as something else if they found I'm trans. I stealth but it's always in the back of my mind it's stressful.
Oh, I definitely got that impression, I just wanted to apologize just in case I came off that way. I feel like if I hadn't, then it could potentially leave a bad impression. Also, I'm a very apologetic person, sorry. >.<
I feel like you’re slightly missing the point that was tried to be made. 
A trans woman is a woman. That is out of question and no one challenged that. 
But the aspect of transitioning is also one that takes up a huge part of our life and certainly impacts us severely! 
In that regard it’s not hard for me to empathise with OPs client who wants to be perceived as the whole her. Including transition.
A trans woman is as much of a woman as any cis woman, I agree with that! And if things fluidly change, they’re still valid. Both me and my partner have some fluidity to our genders, them to the point that they prefer they/them pronouns and for me, being fine with she/her or they/them as the majority of the time I feel female. But even if I don’t always feel female, I still am valid as a woman when I do
When I was a kid and I didn’t even know what being trans was I remember feeling jealous of girls. I guess Im jealous of a lot of “cis experiences” I always wanted but never got when I was younger. Idk if this is weird or not lmao
Him* probably it was phrasing on his part, but could be internalized transphobia.  One doesn't really knows.  

I personally don't want to be seen as something else, I'm just a woman and  that's the end of the story, transition and stuff should be normal and doesn't really mater.

 I would want my transition to be seen as normal like as cis woman puverty I just seen a normal mundane intracendental thing thing as their puverty, but I just want to be seen as just woman. I don't like  that it has to been one or the other or your struggle being recognized or being seen as just your gender. I stealth because I prefer the second.
Yes
It's normal , I would like to be considered normal to trans people or anyome  who didn't had a childhood to recreate childhood the way we want, but it's seen as cringe.

 Society is very toxic in that aspect, every ome need to be on the their  development stage and  if you have cbad luck  you just should accept living incomplete and broken.

 I recreate my childhood  and stuff just don't make it public for the prejudice.

Looks good! I kinda get Nicole Maines vibes from that.
You're gorgeous
You look lovely! Give yourself permission to be whom ever you want to be. There are no wrong choices with this.

This is why you shouldn't judge.	"I was just diagnosed as intersex at 26 years old. 
I was Male up until I was 20. 
I couldn't take it anymore. This is not who I am.
I never was a boy, just had gonads and a pp. 
Underdeveloped, hormonal issues, small breast tissue, and fighting everyday since 5 years old with my body and identity. This was back in 2001. 

Fast forward to today. Through lots of investigation and questions, my endocrinologist asked me to have my blood drawn for a karyotype test (checks chromosomes) 
Thought that was weird. But okay. 

Turns out, my chromosomes are 47,XXY. Male syndrome. 
In very technical terms, im a ""male"" but not really. Im a female with a special SRY chromosome thats found in males. So as a fetus I developed as a boy. Looked no different than a boy. But I am. 

Knowing this info doesn't change anything about me or how I identify or anything like that. 

But now I can say for certain that no matter what, you should just let people be themselves. Because you have no idea what's happening with them. Hell, they might not even know themselves. 

Spread love, not hate."	"beautiful message <3
Hey there, thank you for sharing! I have a suspicion upon myself, I might have XX male syndrome, too. (De la chapelle, right?). If you don't mind, can you please share how you knew you were actually not just a boy, and what the urges are that make you work with a doctor? What are the signs that I should look at on my body?
Adorable dimples, you lucky devil ❤️
Your text is perfect! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🌹
Very well said, so proud of you ❤️
So cute 😍 👌
Cute 😍
Cute 😍
I love you....YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.....
Hello. Your YouTube is unavailable.😥
What do u mean “menos” ?
To be fair, this is a relatively rare condition. It is unlikely you would have this syndrome. The signs that we saw (me and my endocrinologist) were:

1) Before my Bilateral Orchiectomy (removal of the gonads) and before my HRT switch to estrogen, I had a T count of 110 and an Estro count of 80. Typical males have between 300-400 T and 10-20 ESTRO. So that was the first thing that caught our attention. 

2) I never developed fully throughout puberty, and I had cysts on my gonads. My puberty started late and I had underdeveloped muscle mass, growth in breast tissue, and a more female physic. 

3) Infertility. Before anything, I tried to freeze sperm prior to my surgery and hrt. The samples I sent were duds, with 100 part per million of active swimmers that were not very good quality. 

4) Reduced body hair. Never fully grew any substantial body hair. Had a ""beard"" which was incredibly patchy and thin. And my chest hair and leg hair were the same, and hardly any armpit hair. 

5) ADHD, which is not a determining factor, but one that is associated with this condition if you have it. Or other learning disorders. 

This is not to give you examples in which you could diagnose yourself. Finding out that I have Klienfelter Syndrome was solely due to me having blood work done and having a karyotype test done to determine my chromosomes.  They came back conclusive for Kleinfelter syndrome. 

Keep in mind too that medically speaking, you are still considered ""male"". You have genetic makeup of a male, but your chromosomes say female, with the exception of the SRY gene. 

Hope this helped answer some questions about this!
Wait really? My T count was  extremely low for a male and my E count was higher than average...body took to E like crazy whwn i started o.o...tho i dont have what you have. Im sure my endo wouldve said something
Thanks a lot! To be fair, we are the uncommon group of people, so maybe the chance to find someone with the same story is actually higher? :p

Hearing this, I can confirm that my suspicion is true. Unfortunately, the insurance I have wouldn't be able to cover it, and I don't really have the money for karyotyping out of my pocket. 

This is not the correct way to approach the problem, but for now, I will believe the fact that I have this syndrome, too. Dr will power stated some reasons behind gender dysphoria. This reasoning is the strongest candidate for me. It's quite comforting when everything starts to make sense.

I totally get ""if only everything is normal, it would be the best"" feeling, but even though things are not as normal, it is perfect anyway. And you are not so alone anymore. Thanks for sharing ♡
Best thing you can do if you're curious about your chromosomes is to get that test done! You never know until you know!
Ill be sure to ask them next time. And further reading im like interested in it now o.o.

Adhd: check

Hormones weird: check

More fem physic during puberty: check (though puberty when it did happen...happened...normally?)

Body hair (or low amount thereof): check

The only major difference is I was fertile (hrt stopped that) ... but man,....a girl can dream. 

Thank you for sharing your story, and I hope you have a great day!
When you took the test, did you actually want to know?

While I have almost 0 reasons to believe I'm not the average xy (cant think of anything other than almost being infertile), it always crosses my mind, but I'm not sure I actually want to know...

Like knowing for fact that I'm xy? Idk... or learning I'm not actually xy and still had to go through all the changes of male puberty and have the wring parts?

Did knowing it change anything in the way you think about it all?
Dream? I mean to be honest I wish I was fertile. Grass is always greener I suppose though. I don't think I would say I'm happy with this diagnosis.

But yes! You are welcome! I wanted to come vent about it because I'm scared about telling people about this so I probably won't. But I just thought I would at least say it somewhere 🙃
So, no. I didn't WANT to know or anything like that. It wasn't even me who suggested the test. It was my endocrinologist.  He said after viewing my medical records of years past that there was a strange anomaly within findings and just wanted to double check. Took the test and boom. 47XXY (Male syndrome) (Kleinfelter syndrome) 

So technically, because I have the SRY gene I'm a ""Male"" but I also have XX. I have both XX and XY. 

It did not change how I thought about myself at all, because for the last 26 years I didn't know. I transitioned 6 years ago. Now, it DOES help just a tiny bit in saying ""oh hey. No one fault or anything, and yall didn't know this, but you guys assigned me a male at birth and I get why, but it was wrong."" 

Sadly. I won't tell anyone this diagnosis. Only my wife knows. I don't want this to change people's perception of me, not that I care. But I don't want the hypocrisy that follows. 

By that I mean... like. Okay, my parents for example. You needed a different reason to believe im a girl besides me telling you and literally being a girl for years and years now and going through surgeries and countless doctor visits and therapy and yadayadayada. 
OH but NOWWW that I'm intersex, it makes it allllll okay and VALID. 

Fuck that. I was valid before this diagnosis. I could care less what my chromosomes are. I'm just happy to be a girl day in and day out. And not just ""being a girl"" (I hate the way that sounds) 

I like being me. Being myself is valid. No one can tell me I'm not who I say I am. Because then I wouldn't be me. I would be their perception of me and trying to mold to THAT form. Then I would get ridiculed for being a chameleon and unauthentic. 

Double edged sword I guess lol
Thank you for the reply. It seem like unless there is a medical reason to test it I really shouldn't...

And btw, you said you won't tell anyone (which is completely ok), but you post it with your picture... people can find it so you may want to consider deleting it or something...
No one I know uses reddit haha I have a very small family now. And I have no friends. I'm practically alone, besides my wife, who is my forever person and best friend and is far more valuable than any one friend. 

But thank you for looking out! <3"	12jqb85	trans	427	0.98	2023-04-12 15:48:20
[NHL] Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Nonbinary identity is real.		"Don't read the replies.

Unhinged Twitter is on full psychopath mode
the hockey community is very fucked up, I've always felt quite isolated being a trans hockey fan, but this is comforting to see.
Remember folks, reading the comments is digital self-harm. Don't do it.
This is SO exciting! Seeing such a massive sports league use it's reach and influence to support trans and non-binary folx is incredible.
Must. Control. Myself. Don't. Read. Comments. And. Get. Sad.
Hey all!  I was at the tournament and wanted to say if you’re trans/nb, 18+ and interested in learning to play hockey you should check out google team trans.  The group I’m in is the team trans twin cities chapter!
Honestly I’m so tired of this conversation. I am just, worn out.
Holy shit NHL fans terrify me.
I'll never understand the trans prefix arguement, like do these people not understand how adjective works, if you call someone a white person that doesn't make then any less of a person.
just did a bad thing  
I regret the thing i did  
and you're wondering what it is 

i'll tell you what i did

i read the replies to that fucking threat. i hate every single one of those replies, i should've listened when y'all said not to read
Wow, such a positive post, I really hope the comments are not transphobic and the post isn't locked after a few hours.
could we get a summary for those of us that don’t trust ourselves to not go down a digital rabbit hole of shitty replies?
morbid curiosity nuked the cat.

fml lmao
The comments: actual facebook schizoposting
Is this actual NHL or one of those $8 twitter blue accounts?
Not gonna do it today, I don't hate myself enough for it. I'm gonna assume American football levels of toxic and move on.
Comments locked xD

Just like every post about trans people on other subreddits
I was just playing Elden ring and this popped up 😭
uh oh i really want to read the replies so badly
but i know if i do ill be caught in the crossfire--
yeah but the comments show just how much sports fans don't like us
I don't have a Twitter, so I had issues trying to read comments from my mobile.

I think one reason is difficult to even have that conversation is that not everyone uses the same definitions of words. It's like the first time Sam Harris talked to Jordan Peterson. JP has very strange definitions of words, so the two were talking past each other.

Back in trans world, some think of sex and gender as different concepts while others believe they're different. There are teams people who believe they change their sex, not just their gender, and there are anti-trans who don't believe one can change their gender, because their sex is immutable. I'm pretty certain there would be less animosity towards us if more people in our camp adopted something like the Gender Bread Person. That's my 2c. The whole debacle makes more enemies than need be.

And b4 ppl dog pile on me, I'm NOT saying there's no discrimination against us. Coming from a Christian background, I've lost friends, family, and been uninvited from church groups. I know all too well how real it is. My point is that we often have the illusion of there being a coherent conversation when there isn't.
Go Habs fucking Go
For those offended by this tweet: good. Be offended. Stay mad.

It's rhetoric like yours that was used as justification for the Club Q shooting. It's rhetoric like yours that people use to justify killing trans people.

Stay mad. Be offended. Get fucked. You people are still pushing this rhetoric after an LGBTQ+ club got shot up. You show no empathy and get none back.
Also I don’t get why your so annoyed at these comments you can tell there level of intelligence from their statements why care what a unintelligent person says
the replies.... Holy shittttt
😑 Ooofff... they are REALLY toxic.  I figured they would be bad but seeing them populated up in such frightening numbers is rattling.  Its a sad reminder that while LGBTQ+ people have lots of support.  There are still ALOT of people out there who really hate us.  /sadPanda
Yeah, as someone who has always loved hockey, the replies sadden me. I recently quit playing to transition. I was a relatively good player too. Makes me sad to see the community do this
Honestly wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Plenty of transphobes, but they mostly showed that they were clueless and had people schooling them on how biology *actually* works
I read the replies...
Lol I was curious and you are correct the replies are just omg

I'm glad they're publicly supporting the community. I was part of the all trans draft tournament that the NHL sponsored. It was an amazing event featuring over 80 trans hockey players!!

I'm with you girl, it's been so hard. I try to keep my eyes away from the news but it fucks me up knowing that these cruel fascists are glued to it and getting more and more radicalized while outlets like NYT publish more and more concern-trolling pieces

I'm terrified of what we're sliding into
There's a trans-only tournament going on in Wisconsin featuring six teams of trans people. The NHL is a supporter of this tournament. Some guy replied, ""So, men playing on womans [sic] team?"" The NHL responded with the tweet above, affirming trans and enby identities. All hell then broke worse. 

CW: transphobia. Reponses to the NHL's tweet generally >!missed the point that this is a trans-only tournament and assumed that the NHL was advocating for bioligical males competing in women's sports, which the NHL has publically said absolutely goddamn nothing about. Replies also tried to appeal to ""biology"", ignoring some of the more undeniable facts like intersex people existing, as well as less obvious facts like gender and sex being distinct. The usual bullshit like people ""questioning"" the pronouns of the players when the NHL used words like he and his for *NHL* goal highlights was rampant!<
Tldr north american hockey enjoyers are pissed, some support, everyone else is posting pics of trans hate or schizoposting trans hate.

For the love of god, don’t check.
Those replies are kinda sad like “oh biology says this or read the bible!” It’s fucking stupid really no matter if we’re gay, trans, asexual, gender fluid whatever we’re still people who just want to live our lives being, well us! Why can’t people fucking understand this! It’s mental really sorry for rant had to vent and I’m glad to be in this community have a great day everyone
I read them and regret reading them. Damn

That’s awesome, I hope they do it again, as I’d love to be a part of it!
I’m intersex and these people will literally try to explain my own biology to me and get it so wrong. It’s sometimes funny and sometimes annoying.
i always laugh about that stupid biology ""argument"".
As if anyone of us ever claimed that we can change our sex chromosomes. It simply does not matter.
Yes i will always be a genetic male, does not make me less of a woman, whats the point? 😂😂
Our sex chromosomes could also just be 2 X ones with some of the X sometimes carying the command to produce testosteron to make a guy, just as it is now but with one beeing an X and one an Y. That there is a specific chromosome carrying that information is just by chance, not neccesary like that in a biological sense, could be different as we see in other species, and is completly irrelevant to that discussion xD. It makes simply no sense to distinguish gender or sex by the chromosome 😂 
The People citing biology, have commonly no clue about biology, and even less about genetics 😂😂

As a Canadian hockey and NHL fan, this is still a huge success lol. The NHL is definitely not a beacon of inclusivity but hopefully this is a sign that they're moving in the right direction. I loved seeing this message from the league.
""I'm terrified of what we're sliding into""
I feel that so much the more news I read the more I'm scared to be who I am... 
I get bullied already where I love and it would be nice to hear that it's just a small minority but it's really not. 
Seems more anti-trans views/people are being followed and validated everyday. It's so wrong that so many of us literally fear for our lives in this day and age. I don't live in the US but how are there actually trans people having to run to another state out of fear for their safety in the state they're in...
ah. i see. okay. thanks
i absolutely do not want to! was mostly lookin for the good news part, but it seems like the ratio is 1/99 on this one 😅
It's funny because they say ""oh biOloGy this and dat"" but actually biology be like: ""shit Adenosine Triphosphate is fukcing hard""
I read the Bible. I’ve read it a lot, and it says to love those around you. It says be kind to others. It says to love thy neighbor and thyself. It says to not condemn others. They fail to understand the values of the religion they claim to follow, but it’s not about religion for them, it’s always about difference. They want it their way. Their little illusion of what life is supposed to be like, and when that bubble bursts, they cry like babies. 

Also, i know many of you have been told hateful things by supposed Christians, so I want to say something as well. God loves you, that’s what the Bible says. He loves you, man, woman, non-binary, he loves you. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they’re wrong. I’ve been told myself that “this isn’t how God made you,” but how God makes any of us is between you and Him, and they are in no place to say otherwise
Pink team!
Sure thing, just ignore what actual biologists have to say though because you know, in actual biology sexual expression operates on a [spectrum](https://youtu.be/kT0HJkr1jj4).

Not just gender, **sex.** It's a spectrum. Sexual expression operates on numerous independent mechanisms that can all fall within a spectrum of outcomes.

Deal with it.
It really isn't. It's just that transphobes aren't citing actual science.
Indeed it funny isn’t it?
Can’t remember us ever denying biology lmao
That’s absolute fax I have a super transphobic friends and coworkers (I haven’t told them except for one) and I always say when it comes up we are not the judges of sin and good
You're one of the only people I've found who understands this

Yet again needing to point out that science is not a religion, and the textbooks from 50 years ago that had said that, are no longer entirely accurate. Even the [chromosome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of7vrIIcTa0) is not what you think.

Just deal with reality **now** instead of grasping to 50-year-old textbooks to justify your prejudice.

*edit: unironically, you're denying the new research that goes against your ideology.... and I'm the book burner. Maybe if the* [Nazi's didn't burn all the research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_f%C3%BCr_Sexualwissenschaft) *when they did, the old texts wouldn't have been so outdated.*
I'm starting to realize how you got your username.
It really doesn't.  I've been to school and this is just an extension of what they teach. They aren't a book burner if they don't agree with a transphobe's primitive behavior.

I am giving up	"2021/12/18

I am giving up. I can't live like this anymore. I can't pretend to be a boy any longer. I can't see how I'll survive one more year of school, let alone university, living a lie. Nothing I do matters if it's not even the real me doing it. I am a defect, a deformed creature, a sub-being cursed with identity. I am hurting, and I just want it to stop."	"what could you do Right Now that will make you feel more, or get you closer to feeling more like how you want to feel. don't need to answer to me, answer to yourself
First off you are NOT I repeat NOT a defect, NOT a deformed creature, and you do NOT have a cursed identity. Society likes to build boxes and most of the time they are only two boxes. If you don’t fit these two boxes society likes to label us as a problem for not conforming to these two boxes. In reality it’s society itself that has the issue not us. It’s been a long time coming but change is happening at least where I’m from. 

10 years ago I knew I wasn’t straight. I knew I was bi but society at the time said this was only for girls. Society likes to sexualize things they don’t understand like orientation and gender.  I was in the closet for 10 years until a few months ago when I finally accepted myself(Which also came with me realizing I wasn’t cis). When I was in high school LGBTQ was still a taboo subject and was very rarely if it all talked about. There were virtually no support systems/groups in place. 

Not sure where you are from but I know a lot of schools now have support groups in place. You may even have them locally near you. 

Just know you do matter. You matter to people.
So what’s the plan? Have you reached out to like minded individuals? Find out about others and their struggles?
You already accept yourself, so you’re miles ahead of many who came before you.  In all honesty, that’s the hardest part.  All the rest will get easier in time, I promise.

You matter, and your identity is valid. 💙🤍💗
🌸
That’s the brainwashing from society speaking. You are not any of those things. I feel your pain. It hurts to be this way. You need to surround yourself with those who accept you for who you are. Above all else do not harm yourself.
Don’t give up, we’ve ALL been where you are right now sweetheart, you are valid, you are not a monster, please be kind to yourself, shit WILL get better, with due time, you have a whole ass life ahead of you, a long and happy life
Don’t do this while it may seem like life is unfair which, god knows it is you still need to live your life and if I can’t convince you that life is worth living, just choose one thing that you really want to do and then see if it’s worth it and if it’s not, it’s not just know that life, can be hard but if you just keep living it won’t be for not so, just try
Oh gosh you sound like you are really in a bad place. I am not sure how old you are but are you absolutely sure your parents would be unsupportive? Reading your post i would think it's quite obvious something is troubling you to your parents. I would seriously consider talking to them. There would be the possibility of being yourself at home then which would take the pressure off.

I thought my parents would give me a hard time before I came out but everyone just accepts me now. Its probably the hardest conversation I have ever had but once its out there you can move forward.

Happy to chat if you need someone to talk to.

Take care x
We all know it's not okay right now and it probably won't be for a while but the fact that you've come this far means you'll make it out. There might not be other people who support you near you but that's what this subreddit is about. We are here if you ever need to talk. You do matter. Always
You are not defective or deformed. And being in the closet is always going to be painful. There is nothing wrong with you and you have options out there to be able to live as your true self in a safe and accepting environment! Most places have some form of trans/ queer support wither it be help lines or places to say if your home is unsafe.
Honey, take a breath. 
You're stronger than you think.

And this goes for anyone else.

Being young and still in grade school sucks. 
It sucks even more when you feel like you're drowning, and every person you turn to either pushes you deeper in the water, or doesn't understand how/can't be bothered to attempt to help you out of that water. 

Many of us here have been on that edge.
And Jesus Christ don't.
Do not, give up on yourself.

It's a long road, but it's your road. 
You're still early on in the journey, don't give up on the part that sucks. 
You know how many of those big inspirational stories of people in history start like crap? 
Don't give up on the crappy part. 

With age, you'll get more control of your life, and more experience with how to overcome it.

The challenges seem insurmountable now, but they aren't. And if you give up now, you won't be able to help others get over that mountain later.

The only thing I'm certain of, is I have a limited amount of time on this world. And shit any demon or devil who wishes to take me is gonna have to take me kicking and screaming the entire way down. I'm stronger than any naysayer, and so are you. 

If we're 'mentaly ill' or demon possessed what of it? 
Going to keep doing my best, and doing what I believe is right, and being the best me I know how to be.

If anyone else's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to resort to trying to put me down, seems like it says more about them to me. 

You can be stronger, and kinder than you ever knew.
That road is long, with many winding turns.
But you can be such a star to help guide those who need it. And a token to the world it never thought it needed.
I know how you feel. I realized about a month ago that I was nb transfem and am currently not in a position-socially or financially or otherwise-to fully come out and live how I want to. And on top of that I’ve recently been through the worst breakup of my entire adult life (I’ve had a lot of breakups), I’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times in the last 6 months, my former dad who I disowned and cut off and blocked on everything keeps trying to contact me, and every single person I’ve tried to start a new relationship with-romantic or otherwise-has ghosted me for no reason and I haven’t felt the warmth of another person touching or holding me in 2+ years, and the pain of all of that on top of the intensified gender dysphoria from not being able to fully come out and start transitioning yet has been too much to deal with. Every day is bleak and miserable, and I’m in constant pain, and I just want it to end so badly I’ve almost ki**ed myself 5 times in the last 4 weeks alone. But we can’t. If we end our lives now, we won’t ever get to be the beautiful people we know really are. I’ll never get to look in the mirror and see the beautiful woman I’ve imagined myself as for a long time. We’ll never get to show our loved ones, or our future loved ones, or the world who we really are, and those people-the ones we really are inside that are screaming to get out and feel like they’re causing us so much pain-are such unbelievably gorgeous and compassionate people. They’re people the world needs so many more of. And if we end our lives at this stage, before we ever get to meet the wonderful, confident, courageous, compassionate people who are finally comfortable with their gender expression that we really are inside. The world needs us. And so does every trans kid who has a transphobic family and lives in an area where most everyone is intolerant and they have no options to come out and be themselves. Those kids need the people we’re going to become once we get through this incredibly painful stage in our lives, they need us for guidance, and for compassion, because the beautiful non-binary transgirl that my heart and soul know I am but are in so much pain because they still see a boy and everyone around me refers to me as and sees me as a boy, that person is going to have the beautiful radiance that I see so many other beautiful trans people on here have once they’re enough of the way through their transition that they’ve become happy and proud of who they are. And once I’ve become that person, and once you’ve become the woman or non-binary or whatever other gender identity person that is inside of you and is yearning so badly to come out, we’ll be able to inspire so many other trans kids and trans people who are feeling the pain we’re feeling right now… that’s the only thought that’s been getting me through this last month, and it’s the only thing that’s keeping me from ending my life right this very minute. And I hope you can read this and envision that person that lies within you that you *will* become someday. That person that no longer has to feel the overwhelming pain of being trapped in a body that feels so wrong. And I promise you, we’re not sub human creatures, we’re human beings experiencing the wild phenomenon that *only* humans can experience of being born with the mind and soul of one gender in the body of another. And the fact that we’ve been chosen by whatever power in the universe that decides these things to experience this phenomenon, means that we’ve been given the opportunity to become stronger and happier and more in touch with who we are than the majority of other people. And it’s because of this turmoil and this soul-crushing pain we’re going through now that we have that opportunity. We just have to get through this, and we’re both strong enough already to be able to get through this, I promise. Also, my inbox is always open if you need someone to talk to, and if you need someone to actually talk to you and help talk you through it, I would be absolutely willing to give you my phone number and you can call me anytime you feel this. Lord knows I could use the same thing lol. But either way, please believe me when I say that this is something we’ll get through, and come out the other end of much happier, stronger, wiser, and much more grounded in our sense of self, as well as proud of that self. And those things will be worth every moment of agony we’re experiencing. ❤️
Be the real you and follow your dreams! Keep pushing through and show them the real you! Live your life and be proud of who you are! As long as you stay true to yourself you won't feel like a ""defect!""
My voice. I'm currently working on my voice. I have to practise in secret so that my parents won't find out  and I hope they don't notice a slow, gradual change in how I sound
There is not someone in my life whom I can talk to currently. That's why I'm here
You are a great parent. I'm glad to know that there are people out there that care
Thank you
Thank you
[Really good voice training channel](https://youtu.be/BfCS01MkbIY)

It all seems really bleak and hard right now, but once you begin affirming yourself and like what you see in the mirror, you'll be just fine. Good luck, and we're here for you.
that's good! mastering your vocal range is super empowering and frankly super fun and cool. even playing around with it beyond your singular goal can show you your potential to embody anything you want
That's awesome! Good luck!
How would your parents feel about you being a voice actor or taking it up as a hobby? Its a pretty solid cover story. You have to practice males voices too, but if they're cool with it, it becomes a hobby they can support rather than a point of suspicion. Its also a great way to actually succeed in changing your voice.
That’s what I suggest then, find some online groups. You might be surprised how many people feel the way you do
No. Dont do anything. Dm me and we can talk. I felt the exact same way. But things get better. Just, dont do anything rash.
Thank you. Really.
This channel is great.
Ironically you linked to one of the three videos I've regularly listened to the car to practice my voice before.

You're very welcome <3
If you're worried about being caught, play something in the background, then wear headphones and listen to what you want. My brother had a whole system so no one would ever question what he was doing."	rjfwql	trans	413	0.97	2021-12-18 20:31:33
Is the term ‘femboy’ offensive to transgender women?	"So I’m also in genderfluid spaces, and ppl will use this term to describe one of their genders

My brother and I talk about gender a lot, we’re both trans, and he told me that it wasn’t ok to use it, and that “feminine boy” would be more appropriate for genderfluid ppl to use

He then explained how it was used to invalidate women’s gender identity, and even fetishize them

He’s been out as trans and has been active in the trans community longer than I have, so I trust him on gender issues like this, but I did want to ask women myself.

Should I start correcting other ppl who are genderfluid when I see it?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for answering and helping me understand!

Just for clarification, I did already know that femboys were not trans women, I would not ever call a woman a femboy, as that is misgendering, and thereby offensive and disrespectful

That was not the reason I made the post, I made the post because I wasn’t sure if the term *itself* was offensive 

Thank you all so much! :) <3"	"I think it’s only really offensive if you are calling a trans woman a femboy. Femboy still ID as men, but enjoy cross dress, which is very very different then being a trans women
if you use it to describe a trans woman, yes, it's offensive

>and that “feminine boy” would be more appropriate for genderfluid ppl to use

that's literally what ""femboy"" is short for. and how exactly does that make it inclusive?
TBH, only if you're using it to refer to a transgender woman. Because you'd be misgendering her by calling her a ""boy"".

And, as someone else said, un-shortening it by using ""feminine boy"" makes zero difference. It's the same thing.
So, typically most of the femboy community identifies as male. They embrace a fashion that has more feminine styles and for a lot of them it is a fetish. Not the same thing as a trans woman, who actually identifies as female. Hope that helps, I definitely can see where the confusion would occur
I’ve seen this question asked before.
Its about the context. If someone identifies as a feminine man its no problem. But for example calling a trans woman a fem boy is wrong ofc. 
I think there a plenty of terms that when used incorrectly can be offensive but aren’t offensive themselves necessarily.
It’s used by boys, both cis and trans, who identify as feminine. I’ve really *only* heard it to refer to or identify this identity in a generally positive light.
only call people femboy if they wanna be called that and you should be cool
Imo a lot of the issues regarding the word come up in anime. Characters that are coded as trans women constantly get labeled as femboys even by people in the community. As long as people listen to actual trans voices on these topics and don't label trans women as femboys other than when they specifically say they identify as such there isn't a problem with the term! Actual femboys are rad!
Femboys are people who identify as boys, yes there are a lot of fettishists but femboy culture atleast to me seems to do a bit of good for trans women. I know a lot of trans girls I know used being femboys as a way to come into their feminine side.


TL:DR I think it's compleatly fine for femboys to be femboys and use the term
If someone called me a femboy I would be offended because I'm a woman, but the existence of femboys is not offensive.
i think it’s offensive if you call a trans woman that (because trans women are women)


but i think it’s just a shortened version of feminine boy

i consider myself a femboy (or i at least want to be a femboy) but it’s not sexual for me (i’m asexual)

in the end, yes words can hurt, but a word can be reclaimed (to those who it pertains to)
If im (a trans woman) being called a femboy, yes it's offensive. If someone else that identifies as a femboy, is being called a femboy, no it's not offensive to me.

Its effectively its own thing. Just like calling a transmasc, transmasc isn't going to be offensive to a trans woman. Same logic.
TW: T slur

I'm a trans girl. If you called me a femboy id probably cry. I have a friend who's questioning that goes by she her pronouns now but still sometimes calls herself a femboy.

If you called *her* a femboy I don't know how she'd react, but  I imagine not particularly well.

I don't have an issue with you calling actual crossdressing boys femboys. That's the word they use to describe their fetish. The thing is that context matters. 

Some slang though you're probably better off avoiding. 

If you wouldn't call a gay person a F*g, a black person the N-word, or a Hispanic person the S-word, you probably shouldn't call a trans girl a Trap.

Edit: forgot a warning.
Anything can be offensive so it's best to only say it to people who you've asked permission from
To call a trans woman a ""femboy"", yes that's very transphobic. To use the term for people who identify as femboys, that's safe to do
no . they're boys, im a girl, so why would it be offensive??
Femboy does not equal transgender, some femboys may be trans, but there’s no correlation between the two
Your brother is right that it is used to invalidate and fetishize trans women but if someone uses that term for people that identify as femboys it's fine.
Yes. If a person does not identify as such then it can be offensive to regard them as such.
We are not boys, so that would just be missgendering us. The term is feminin boy, we are women
I'm not a boy so yes very much so
“Femboy” by itself isn’t offensive. Some boys do identify as femboys. It would be offensive if anyone used it for me (a trans woman) since I am not a boy. I expect this reaction to be generally true for trans women. To imply we are feminine boys can be deeply hurtful and dismissive.

If someone identifies with a label it is generally OK. If they don’t identify with it, don’t use that label for them.

I am not familiar enough with the gender fluid community to know any general rules on how they prefer to be referred to and at what times. It might be a very individual thing.
Femboys are just feminine men. They are entirely separate from trans women. So no, it is not offensive, as long as you are not calling trans women femboys.
femboy literally just means “boy who is feminine”. If someone calls a trans woman that then yes, it’s offensive since it’d be misgendering, but other than that it should be fine to use
If someone calls me a femboy it’s offensive since I am mtf trans who wishes to be 100% cis passing. For me personally it is offensive, but I don’t think of it as a slur… unless anyone decides to use it as a slur which in that case I’d fuck them up LOL
Only if used to describe me. My trans bf identifiesas a femboy tho and there's nothing wrong with that!
No
It doesn’t matter what we say here. Whoever you meet in public or online will have a different viewpoint. 

It’s best to take things on a case by case scenario. No two scenarios will be the same. You may meet femboys who don’t wanna be called trans you may meet trans women who don’t wanna be called femboys. You may meet someone who is ok with either one. You don’t know who you’re gonna meet. Just call whoever by whatever they introduce themselves as and there won’t be a problem
Your brother is correct to me.  Calling a trans woman a femboy could be offensive.  Trans woman is a woman.  :)

The term femboy itself isn’t offensive tho
No. Being a femboy is completely different
Nope femboys are fking awesome and my best friend was one for a while before he came out as nb but ide just go on a case by case basis and ask as that will give you way more insight cause I’ve known people that actually like being called slurs or otherwise offensive things either for the sake of reclamation or whatever else their motives were.
Personally, I abhore that word. Specifically when directed at me, I have no qualms with others using it.
From what I can tell, it's not offensive.
My partner actually used to describe himself as that before realizing he wasn't just a feminine boy- but rather genderfluid.
The word isn’t offensive in and of itself. It is offensive to call a trans woman a femboy, and vice versa. They are not the same and conflating the two is disrespectful.
And today on r/trans: is the word boy offensive to women?
As a trans guy ive known about some trans guys who identify as femboys. It really depends entirely on context and your brother seems too laser focused on one identity’s thoughts
As MtF trans, it's only offensive given context, similar to how misgendering is only offensive if it's done on purpose. MtF women are physically similar to femboys so it's not a wild assumption. If someone came up to me and assumed I was a femboy, I'd correct them and be on my way. No need to get hung over it.
I actually made a whole YouTube video investigating this literally like 4 days ago if you wanna watch it. I'm a trans woman so hopefully it gives you a little insight into the thought process I went through with this exact question. https://youtu.be/E8-FOCU7dbE
Not to me
I see looking like a femboy as a goal.
If you use it to trans woman its basicly like saying that we are only men in dresses. About gender fluid people sorry i cant say anything appropiate im not one, sorry again😅
Depends


Are they a man? Its cool generally

Are the a girl? It is offensive.

Trans girls shouldnt be called femboys, save for if they want to be (not that ive seen a transgirl want to be called a femboy but im not one to control how someon3 refers to herself)
For boys who present Feminine,  unless they themselves d9nt like the term, id say its ok
One thing I've noticed about the LGBTQ+ community is that one person will be personally uncomfortable with a term and then declare it off limits to an entire community because they don't like it and then people just blindly accept it because they have good intentions and don't want to harm anyone. However that behavior in itself is harmful.
If someone wants to call themself anything that is their right. Unless a word's *only* functional context is an offensive one, nothing is off limits technically. That doesn't mean call anyone whatever you want and say whatever you please regardless who it harms, but it does mean that just because you say something is bad, doesn't make it bad unless it can be universally agreed on (For example, racial slurs)
People come from a good place, but never take them at face value. Use common sense and thorough research before you come to the conclusion (and this goes for any type of information)
Yes, it is, to trans women. Trans men or any man can be a femboy, as a femboy purely just means a feminine boy. It would be misgendering and offensive to call a trans woman a femboy since they are women and not men, therefore not feminine boys and just women.
femboys are feminine boys. unless they have specified otherwise, yes it’s offensive.

now, i’m a demiboy that’s generally uncomfortable with most male labels but i like this one, but that’s different
I would not be happy if someone called me ""femboy"". But cannot speak for others.
I’ve heard the argument that it’s a slur that has been directed at trans women, sort of like sissy or ladyboy and therefore it shouldn’t be used by cis people because there essentially trying to claim a transphobic slur as their identity.. which like yeah I sorta get . I don’t feel super strongly about it but like why do people feel the need to create this new identity around a slur idk
If I, a trans woman, got called a femboy by someone I was out to, I'd be very upset and offended, yes.
no not really don't call a transwomen a femboy tho
Only people you should call femboys are people who call themselves femboys.
It was to me
Not any more than the term tomboy is offensive to trans men.
No, they’re boys who are feminine, I’m a woman. I don’t see how it could be offensive
As a trans woman I personally don't have any issue with it. But I would be very careful with how you use it cause there are people who would be offended by it. I'd say unless you know for sure they're ok with it maybe don't. Because there is still the implication that you are referring to them as male.
I have no I’ll will towards fem boys and I don’t think it’s at all offensive when fem boys call themself that or people call them that. 

It does suck that some ignorant people don’t understand the difference between fem boy and trans women but that was already an issue we faced when the general public learned what drag was so I don’t really blame anyone I don’t think theirs harm in using the word if you’re using it correctly and hopefully are quick to correct any confusion
Femboys are just something completely different from trans women, one is a *feminine boy* as the name would suggest and one is a complete woman
No it's not, ""femboy"" is quite literally a shortened version of ""feminine boy"", it means exactly the same.

It means boys who enjoy feminine aesthetic, there's nothing wrong with it

However, transphobes often use it to harrass trans women by saying they are ""femboys"" aka just dudes in skirt, also the term femboy is has also been stupidly sexualized over the years.

So no, there's nothing wrong with the term itself, but it has history of being taken out of context so it triggers some people. In femboy spaces use it as you may, its also a-ok in transmasc spaces. Be a little carefull in transfem spaces tho, because 1- as I said, people could get triggered  2-why are you saying femboy in a transfem space? Check to see it can't be taken out of context

TL;DR: There's nothing wrong with the term , some humans are just transphobic
if used for transgender women yes

if used for femmanine boys no

also femboy isnt a non binary gender its a term used to describe men (or nbs) who express tgemselves femininely
femboys aren’t trans people though, they’re just dudes who like to express their femininity wearing dresses and stuff the whole maid outfit, as a trans person heavily in the gay+trans community i can say without doubt that femboy has nothing to do with trans people and that the only way it could be offensive is if you’re targeting a transwoman and calling them a femboy
Only if a trans woman is called a femboy. Otherwise a femboy is just a feminine person who identifies as male.
only if you use it for a trans woman!
Femboy is offensive to call a trans woman because not all trans women are fem and exactpy 0 trans women are boys. Thats kind of the point.
Not at all
Any one person can choose how they want to identify. Femboy can be an offensive term, but there's a lot of people who identify with it. Same thing with it/it's pronouns, I would never use them for somebody unless they made it clear that they identify with those pronouns.
As many other have said if describing a trans woaman then yes its offensive but otherwise na i wouldnt say it is seeing femboys still identify as males just in crossdress or acting more feminine.
Here's my hot take - people are over thinking it and just trying to be offended. Femboy isn't an identity or a gender or a sexuality. It's a meme, a style, an aesthetic. Anyone can be a femboy - cis men, cis women, trans men, trans women, non binary and everything in-between and beyond. For context I'm a trans woman but I still do femboy shit because it's funny to me, it's like cosplay. People don't get offended by Drag Kings and Drag Queens, so why femboy? That's like trying to boycot Tomboys. It's dumb and anyone offended by it should re priorities their direction of activism for the community.
I go by one rule call people what they're ok being called, if one likes it call them that and another doesn't dont.
I feel part of the issue is some people don't know what Femboy means. When my friend came out as Trans, she said she was a Femboy, so I thought she meant she liked to crossdress and that's about it. Its only 2 days after I realized she meant it as Transgender during another conversation.

Another part of the issue is the internet helped bastardized a lot of words. Words that clearly meant something specific can now mean several different things depending on who you ask in the world. Its like if the dictionary was a Rubik's cube that keeps shifting.

In the end I guess its just a question of intent. Getting someone's tone of the internet can sometimes be hard, so I think we should ask them what they think those words mean before vilifying them. If someone is actually saying something as a way to attack another person in regards to religion/gender identity/sexual orientation: Go for the metaphorical throat.
I personally take no offence to the word at all, but I can kind of see how other people would.
>Is the term ‘femboy’ offensive to transgender women?

No, because it's a fashion aesthetic, not a gender identity. I feel no animosity towards crossdressers.
I see femboy as a non-slur translation of tr*p. Both words semantically mean boy with a feminine gender expression, and both get used on trans women sometimes.

IMTO: both need to stop being used for trans women but only tr*p needs to die entirely.
I think it’s fine if someone calls themselves a femboy, but generally not ok to call someone else that. It could offend someone.
I’m a transgender man I don’t mind people calling a femboy but by definition trans women just can’t be femboys they’re not male so that’s disrespectful
[deleted]
[deleted]
Used to describe self jokingly? It's ok. Any time else? Not ok
Bruh. ""Feminine boy"" is literally just a longer version of femboy. There's nothing wrong with the original word.
femboy isn't a term I would use for anyone regardless of gender identity unless I specific knowledge that it wouldn't bother them.

for trans women specifically I would absolutely not use it. trans women are women, not boys.
Yes. It's the cousin word of >!shemale!<. Your brother is right. It is often used to invalidate women and their womanhood.

My first time using a spoiler. I can still see it. Is it hidden for others or not?
I think for genderfluid people it's no issue for me as a non binary person, I'd find fem boy not offensive but equally not ideal. Either
I would rather be seen as a femboy than just another man...
Wasn’t femboy an amab who comes off as femme?
Femboy literally originated as a porn category to fetishize trans women. Don't use it. A lot of trans women have talked about this on other platforms. It's a shitty term that is inherently transphobic because it's history is transphobic. Don't use it. Idc what you ID as, only trans women can reclaim it because it originates as a term used to refer to them and for obvious reasons, they won't use it for themselves.
Some people are saying that people that use it are feminine men, but i dont think it’s really cool to assume that you can throw the word around to any man that exhibits or performs feminine traits/femininity. I am a bisexual trans man and i wear nail polish and earrings and i put a lot of care into my appearance and i’m very short. I can be feminine. Call me a femboy and i’m punching you in the face. It’s not ALWAYS sexual yes, but the only time ive been called that has been by chasers (who know im trans) and people who assume i’m submissive because of my appearance. I figure its usually just a safe bet to keep that word to just fictional characters unless someone TELLS you they use it for themself.
Yeah, calling a trans woman a femboy is offensive because you are inciting that she is still a boy/man.

But the term “femboy” isn’t offensive because it is short for ‘feminine boy’ however you should always ask people if you can call them that because some people might not like being called that. 

So short story short, dont call trans women femboy and always ask what terms you can call people
Obviously
My therapist said I might be a femboy and I got super offended
Ik the difference
I don’t even know, I was very confused during that conversation
*technically* what OP is talking about with it being fetishizing is when it was short for female boy, but that meaning has definitely been mostly forgotten
Makes sense
Also worth noting that there are absolutely transmasculine femboys. Self-ID is not the same as calling someone else something that may not suit them.

It's offensive to call a trans woman a femboy as an attempt to dismiss and invalidate her gender identity.

It's not harmful to trans women let a man (cis or trans) call *himself* a femboy, or to refer to him as such in conversation when you know he self-refers that way. It's also not helpful to pressure AMAB people who aren't certain if they're a trans woman or if femboy is a better fit, to ID as a trans woman. Let people ID as a femboy and later come out as a woman if that's the way their hatching ends up going.

Edit: also not a problem if nonbinary people use ""femboy"" as part of their identity. Still self-ID, and therefore their own business.
it’s at wild i started out trying to be a femboy and just after a month was like, no wait i’m actually fully a woman! lmao
I've been calling my enby self femboy some. I think a lot of AMAB enbies use it as well?
The fetishist people is not a lot of them. A large amount of them are only in it for the fashion and dislike being fetishized. I just want to make that clear because I am yet to unsubscribe from my time on those subreddits and the amount of posts I see talking about how much people hate being fetishized makes me want to keep this 100% clear.
That makes sense, I would never misgender someone like that. That’s just disrespectful 

He didn’t explain it very well, it was a confusing conversation, basically in the end it was “just listen to me, Ik what I’m talking about”
Yeah, that’s how I’ve seen it used too. That conversation was really confusing, but I don’t know everything. I don’t know what I don’t know, and the last thing I want is to come off as transphobic over something I didn’t know.
Okie :)
They are indeed. Ty :)
Couldn't agree more with this!
Understandable
Makes sense
Actually calling trans women femboy was not the context in the conversation, I’m aware that is misgendering, that’s not something I would do

In context of the conversation, he was joking about how my gender expression was very “straight”(whatever that means) because I’m feminine on the days I’m a woman, and masculine on the days I’m a man

Then I said, “yeah, some genderfluid ppl identify as femboy being one of their genders, but I don’t”
(As in actual femboys, not trans women)

That’s when he told me that the term itself was offensive to trans women because of how it’s sometimes used. Regardless of context, it’s something that he feels I should avoid all together.
""That's the word they use to describe their fetish""

Wtf. Presenting yourself how you want is not a fucking fetish ffs.
I'm fucking tired of people saying that it is.
Idk, that’s why I’m asking about it
I’m aware :)
It can be very individual, yeah. Some genderqueer or gender fluid people consider femboy as part of their identity, others don't, and it shouldn't be forced on people who don't want it but if someone calls themself a femboy... well that's really their own business, can't see how it could harm anyone else.
Ty :)
Yeah, he did not clarify that, not once in the conversation did I call a trans woman a femboy. I just mentioned that some gender fluid ppl use it to describe one of their genders, which got me wondering if it was the word itself. Like it was a slur or something
This.
What was the point of this comment exactly?
I have femboy tendencies myself because sometimes I just like looking cute
Wasn’t sure if it was a slur or something when I posted this. So it would not make sense to ask cis women about it
I wouldn't say it is a slur to trans people, more of just being downright offensive to trans women. The word 'trap' just means a man who tricks other men into thinking he is a woman. The word 'femboy' means a feminine boy. They are not the same thing. And it's only bad to trans women (when they are being called it), since I am a trans femboy myself.
Yikes
Then why did you make this post?
I think your friend is coming from a good place but is just straight up wrong. The post above is correct, it's offensive if you use it to describe a trans woman, it's not offensive if you're describing someone who identifies as a femboy.
Thats more or less what happened to my friend. Right now he's questioning (goes by he/she)
Yeah, I didn’t exclude. “Typically” femboys are male- NB can too. I’ve even seen women who call themselves femboys just because they feel like it fits.
That’s new info to me, thanks for pointing it out. In the subs I’m on, there’s a constant struggle to keep the NSFW posts off there. Maybe it just feels like that’s a lot of the community to me, and I assumed too much. Glad you said something!
It’s great to ask questions!
As a trans woman I second this. I think it depends on the context. Unfortunately, trans women are looked at as femboys and it’s derogatory in that way. 

But yeah femboys (feminine boys) are cool
You can tell him that at least one trans woman thinks that's bullshit. Language is built on context, *especially* languages where the same word can mean different things. (Like the English language.) If we treat every word used maliciously as a huge slur that shouldn't be said, we give all the power to those who choose to be malicious.
>my gender expression was very “straight”(whatever that means) because I’m feminine on the days I’m a woman, and masculine on the days I’m a man

Oh also this is a really strange take. I can kinda see what he's trying to mean, but even then I'd say you have a binary expression, not a straight one. Nothing wrong with leaning into whichever gender you feel fits best at the time. (Honestly I thought that was kinda standard for gender fluidity? Idk. Also apologies for misunderstanding the post.)
You're right that presenting how you want isn't a fetish. I've only ever seen femboy used in a fetishistic context. (That doesn't mean I'm right.)

Thanks for the reality check.
again, a fem boy is a boy, im a girl. well to old to be called a girl anymore, but  fem boy as a term is not offensive to me. doesnt apply to me.. boy them girl me.  dont  get the issue with the term.
Not a slur, trap is more like a slur.  Femboy is more of a description of an aesthetic.
 :) ❤️❤️
That is essentially what you asked
To ask if the term itself was offensive
Also, he’s not a trans woman. 

I’m a trans man and I make an effort not to speak on trans women’s issues because I wouldn’t fucking know
Glad I could help.
THIS. 

If you tell someone they can't self-identify as a word just because it can also be used maliciously, you're basically saying that the people who use the word as a slur are more important/valid than the people who use it as an identity. And THAT is pretty damn offensive!
If it comes up again, I will
It is normal for gender fluidity, I see posts with different pictures like that all the time in genderfluid spaces. I’m queer, *how* can I be compared to a straight person? That’s a sexuality, not a gender :/

Regardless of my agab, ANY relationship is going to be a queer one because I’m a man AND a woman. It’s going to be gay either way.

My family doesn’t make sense most of the time
What was the point of it tho? It doesn’t seem very helpful at all
Redditors when someone asks a simple genuine question (They must downvote it for literally no reason)
[deleted]
That’s kind of what I was thinking, but I wasn’t sure
I rephrased your question to make it self-explanatory rather than typing out an unnecessarily long explanation
what is the flag in your pfp
Yeah. I did edit the post to clarify that. I don’t understand why two of my comments are getting downvotes
Transfem
Well, if you know the difference that femboys are still boys, but don’t get that calling a trans woman a boy is offensive, you’re *really* missing some stuff.

Just to cement the point, I’m a trans woman. I’m a woman. I’m not a feminine boy. I’m not a boy. I don’t care if someone else calls themselves a femboy, but never call a trans woman a femboy (unless under a really special circumstance, and they ask you to)
oo ty
Did you read my edit in my post? I would not *ever* call a trans woman a femboy.

I was asking if the term itself was offensive because I didn’t know if it was a slur or something. Hence why the term itself might have been offensive, I wasn’t sure

Where was the miscommunication exactly?
I don’t know, I’ll be honest, not in a good place right now, just, was irrational. Thank you for asking, being kind, and taking the time to figure things out. Sorry for being so, I don’t know, confrontational, and I hope things go well for you
I’m sorry you’re in a bad place. I hope things get better for you

Just please read posts in the future. 

Negativity like that can make it scary to ask these questions
Yeah, normally when I’m in this mood I just, reread what I’m typing, and just delete it because I know it’s not worth it, you know, the saying, if you have nothing good to say, don’t say anything. I don’t know why I didn’t follow that this time. I’ll try to remember this though, and, thank you. Keep being awesome friend"	r8sbqy	trans	406	0.92	2021-12-04 15:46:15
r/honesttrangender is a transmedicalist (transphobic/truscum) sub. save yourself some trouble and don't join it.	"The whole subreddit is full of ""transsexuals"" who go on rants about how nonbinary identities aren't real/valid and how they think neopronouns are ""a transphobic joke."" It's one of the only trans related subs where ive noticed this being a huge problem. They get downvoted in the more popular subs so they all go whine there. The mods are even transphobic."	"Just had a look and, oof.

Looks like a bunch of weird right wingers who are only pro lgbt because they happen to be trans.

Happy to see these kind of terrible subs get way fewer people in them though.
Poll... would you rather be the ugly and your gender at birth... or misgendered...

Doesn't seem like a healthy headspace or space.

I however, do admit I have a horrible time grokking and adhering to neopronouns.  I see that as my problem, not the person wanting to use them.
I saw self proclaimed ""transsex"" (nothing against that term in general but it tends to attract annoying people) mfs whipping out terminology from the 1960's to explain how bi and gay trans people are actually a whole different category of transsexuals separated from ""classical"" (= straight) trans people. Kinda surprised they didn't draw a link to Blanchard's own bullshit

It's not honesty, just unchecked bitterness and a desperate need to rationalize their existence
Yeesh! Thanks for the heads up!
It’s not a transmed sub so much as it is just a sub for bitter individuals.  I joined for a while early in my transition when I was going through a lot of crap but ultimately disliked the toxicity and self-hatred that goes on there.
The root word of “transgender” is not and has never been “transition”.

It feels to me like they’re bitter people that are upset people have a different experience to them.
Just checked it out... never again
r/honesttransgender is an awful place fulled with toxic takes but it’s no strictly transmedicalist.  Like if you are a transmedicalist you can go post a rant about how you are the one true trans and everyone else is a perv but like others will tell them thats dumb af.  It’s not r/truscum.  You can be a bitter angry trans man that blames all your problems on trans women or vice versa but again there are people there to tell them to stfu.  It’s just an uncensored trans form where trans people can be as horrible as they like.  I would not recommend anyone go there but the mainstream trans subs are kind of boring once you’ve been out and past your transition for awhile.
Ironic name. Sadly I’m not shocked tho
I was banned on the first one and MTF for literally Debunking antitrans misinformation...the FK do antitrans secretly control some trans groups to you know try and incite us to use violence etc...I'm not blind. When people can ""self promote"" not even Debunking lies, but I can't try and get support Debunking antitrans misinformation we have a problem the antitrans support each other they self promote to get more popular yet trans community clearly suppressing trans women like me from getting more support on YouTube to counter and debunk the misinformation
Welp, that's a sub I can avoid.  Thanks.
After I came out to myself honesttransgender was one of the first communities I joined… and it was the very first one that I left!!!  I didn’t check out the posts before joining and I was just looking for community.  The “rants” and “just asking” posts in that group are enormous red flags and so see-through.
That’s awful, I’m transsexual but that doesn’t erase others transness. Transgender and transsexual both deserve the same amount of respect.
I have a question. 

Is it cool if I apply transmed ideology to myself only, as long as I’m not holding other trans people to that standard? 

Like, for example, I want to pass before I use my chosen locker room/changing area. 

Is it ok if I hold myself to that standard, as long as I’m not applying them to other trans people?
Thanks for the warning. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to count on your own community for understanding & support? So disappointing. Tsk tsk tsk
I don’t understand how any of them can be a part of that
in my experience, subs with ""Honest"", ""True"", ""Good"", ""Real"" and the like in their title are typically really bad
Tbf if I make a sub called honestcatpics, that kinda implies I think all the other cat pics are frauds
I'm other news the sky's blue.
It's not exclusively transmeds, but they definitely have a larger presence there. It is absolutely among the more prickly, less supportive subs in the transosphere on Reddit. If you're not looking for an argument or you're in a mood where you need an upper, that is _not_ the place to go.

That said, I go there mostly because it's the only place I've found so far that has a mixture of transmeds and non-transmeds. It's useful to see a variety of perspectives, even if only so it's less shocking to come across them in the wild. 

(Fun fact: a lot of transmedicalists on Reddit insist that their views are the default irl and the ""tucute"" perspective doesn't exist outside of Reddit and Tumblr. Kind of a funny thing to think, seeing as we're actually aligned with modern medical and psychological understanding, but they insist anyway.)
[removed]
transmedicalism (truscum) does not mean trans people who hate themselves… Is trans people who believe that there’s a medical aspect to being trans.
(medical aspect does not mean you need surgery/hormones, it means there’s something in your brain that tells you, you’re trans other than “I say so”)
if I was, my mind has some people have such a weird take on things being medicalize. You might not need to medically transition, but I do. I don’t want my condition or whatever you wanna call it be up for debate one day and then looking at it if it’s some thing that I medically need to do because I do.
[removed]
Okay calling it a right winger sub is totally misinformed. It's almost entirely just talking about shitty parts about being trans we have to face in reality. The only opposing view to the rest of reddit would be the general stance on neopronouns.
Ehh sort of it’s just a venting sub for folks that are bitter and frustrated, usually because something in their own lives isn’t going well.  There are some genuine assholes as well but a lot of them are just bitter or self-hating.
Agreed, the sub culture is very toxic and filled with bullshit takes, to the point I had to unsubscribe.

&#x200B;

As for the neopronouns part, I can't really agree with them as a concept, but I'll still use them if it's advantageous for me to do so
Yeah old school shit is never a good place for medical advice.

If your child is showing symptoms of transness, administer 16 leeches to the abdomen and call for a priest asap 😉
I heard that this even happened among people from my generation who transitioned early (I'm born in '94). The early transitioned women from that time tell me about teen holiday camps organized for them and conversations were about who felt the most dysphoria, who was the most desperate for boys, and how the atmosphere was tense at best towards lesbian girls. Even though I sometimes wish I'd transition early, I don't really envy the circumstances they found themselves in. They seem to have a happy life now but I feel like that I don't feel any pressure to fit into a narrow category, which makes me just as happy as them nowadays despite waiting for years.

However, the girls did generally live longer in general happiness than I did, and I think that that is why it's important to support trans kids in their transition.  It's important that we create a world where they are freed from gender stereotypes AND can transition as they feel they want.
Thank you. Didn't mean to put disrespect towards you friend. Its just that many people who i see using that label are super NB-phobic. I usually refer to transsexual people as binary trans people rather than nonbinary ones
Wait, what’s the difference?
It's not ""transmed"" ideology to want to pass before using a certain locker room. That's not what trans med ideology is. Every trans person transitions at their own pace. Wanting to pass before taking certain steps is not trans med ideology. Trans med ideology is the belief there is a strict medical definition of being transgender, including experiencing dysphoria, and many people who identify as transgender are ""faking"" it.
Yeah, the problem isn't wanting to ""pass"" or putting your own boundaries in place. The problem is when you use those ideas to invalidate others and think that it's the only way to be trans. I would still not personally recommend falling into ""passing"" culture as it leads to unrealistic expectations about gendered appearances but if it makes you happy, safe or more comfortable to do it that way i don't think it's hurting anyone. Do it up whatever style u like as long as you respect others who don't do it that way
All generally clickbait wording anyways, source: check youtube lol.
Me. I said that. Thinking nonbinary people are just  fetishists or something and/or thinking that being binary trans people who want all the surgeries is the only way to be trans IS transphobic.
I get where you are coming from. If you codify being trans as a medical issue, it could make it harder for bigots to deny you treatment. Because then they are interfering with the medically necessary treatments you require. 

However, I don’t know if that is the protection you’re hoping it will be in practice. If bigots get enough political clout to threaten us, having trans-ness documented as a medical issue could just give them ammunition to declare us mentally unfit to make decisions regarding our own health. They could then block us from the treatments we need on those grounds. 

The takeaway I want to leave you with is that the only way to stop bigots from hurting us is to keep them out of power. Bureaucracy won’t protect us if they gain control of that bureaucracy.
This comment is incomprehensible and i honestly don't know if you're just nitpicking but ur blocked anyway. I don't need your word salad or your weird rationalization of transmedicalist thinking. I know it's not ""trans people that hate themselves"" The subreddit i was referring to DOES have people who hate themselves, they just are also largely transmeds. Not my fault if the Venn diagrams of those two groups are practically a circle
Simply accepting a medical side to transness isn't transmedicalism. _Of course_ there's a medical side—what do you think hormones are?

Transmeds cling to the now outdated idea that one must have diagnosable gender dysphoria to be trans. Or put another way, they believe that it's a (almost certainly cis and uniformed) doctor's job to gatekeep who is trans and who isn't, who may transition and who may not. A lot of other bullshit comes along with that by extension.
Practically all trans people see beeing trans as an inate umchangebal atribute including most xenogender trans people. I have no clue wtf you are talking about.
And seeing trans as a medical condition only leeds to gatekeeping and making medical transition that much harder.
Idk I go there regularly and I'm inclined to agree there's a red streak through that sub.
It’s always advantageous to be kind and respectful to others
That’s a pretty dismissive thing to say about neopronouns…
Noooo you didn’t come across disrespectful :)) I totally get that and I can def see truscum assholes taking the term transsexual to an awful place like you mentioned.
Some people may look at it different, but I look at it as bc I am taking hormones and medically transitioning that I’m am effectively altering my biology. I may not be exactly the same as cis females but most of us just refer to ourselves as trans females. However that does not take away from somebody that is not medically transitioning at all. They are still trans just as much medical transitioners are.
Thank you!

I honestly can't find anything you'd call ""right wing"". Can you provide any examples of posts? I would love to be wrong.
Trans means that you aren't the gender you were assigned at birth. For example: i am nonbinary but since i was already masculine, im transitioning largely like a binary trans woman would! I'm not getting all the surgeries though, just HRT! :) I consider myself trans. I felt dysphoric before i came out but even if someone doesn't feel as much dysphoria as euphoria with a different gender and they want to transition socially and/or medically because of that, i don't think that makes them any less transgender.
[removed]
I don't identify as a trans woman specifically and i don't want to be considered entirely feminine. It's a fine distinction but I use different pronouns too. (she/they)
The fact i don't identify that way is the only distinction that really needs to be made. I know who and what i am and it's not Cis woman or trans woman. Im a feminine person but i have no need for a definitive binary gender marker to feel good in my body/mind.
Because non binary people just arent transfemmes smh, this should not be a hard concept to grasp"	10mquj1	trans	405	0.94	2023-01-27 17:40:00
My mom wont accept me :(	"Before i really knew what was going on with my identity I came out to my mom (about 2 years ago) and admitted I wanted to be more a guy… kinda. (For reference Im AFAB nonbinary but I use male names and pronouns.) I explained that I pretty much wanted to be a guy save for the gentitals and maybe no HRT. 

She didn’t understand and was upset- not mad, but really sad. She said she was worried about me and any time Ive brought up my gender since then she talks about how i could just be a butch lesbian, or i’m confused by my trans friends, or it could just be a phase, yadda yadda yadda. 

Despite her being the only ally in the house, (my dad and sister are both Extreme republicans, as is most of my family) I feel less and less safe being myself around her. Just yesterday when I said i wanted an androgynous haircut she said she “didnt like when i talked like that.” 

I dont know what to do. I have a binder now, and I havent told her. My therapist has been really helpful, but it sucks knowing that when i really ramp up my transition in college she’s probably gonna hate it."	"yeesh. that sucks hard. it sucks that people like that exist at all. im here for you, dude
In college?! Jeez, you're a grown person!
and ""just be a butch lesbian"" is absolutely hillarious in a really sad way.
i’m sorry :( i hope she comes around
I’m sorry. You deserve better.

You deserve a family that sees, loves and accepts *you*, not their conception of who they wish you were.

You deserve a family that celebrates you finding yourself, and living in accordance with who you are.

They should be proud of the non-binary son (you said you use male names/pronouns so I hope this word is correct - if not, please let me know and I’ll edit it!) they have, rather than a “daughter” who never actually existed.

The fact their hate means they wont see the real you is a profound loss for them, and very sad for you.

My wife and I offer mom-hugs.
My mom was exactly the same when i started my transition including the whole “why can’t you just be a lesbian?” question but over time it really does get better. Sometimes your parents need more time because they’re also transitioning to knowing your authentic self. it can be hard for parents at times because they aren’t as educated so all you can do is be yourself and talk to your mom and therapist together. It will take time but trust me it will be worth it. Really just give it time and be understanding of her side. I know you’re also struggling but it can be a big change for parents who knew you as someone else before your transition. Her being kinda off put about the haircut could be her way of keeping you safe because of your conservative family. I had the same issue with my mom where she worried about my safety around my dad.
You do you. Live for you. Your mom can ride this ride how she wants and if it’s too damaging…the rank of family is earned. It’s not by blood. Relation is all that is. Who is family? I’m growing mine by having people who see me for me and nothing else. It’s a small family but it’s growing.

I had to cut my mom and dad out for several years.. My dad is the big jerk in my situation and my mom is finally on my side but she still doesn’t fully understand. I doubt she ever will.

My dad at least talks to me now but it’s superficial. Kind of like our entire relationship growing up to this point. 

He’s an ass and I think everyone will be heart broken when he’s gone but I won’t. Am I cold? Maybe. Maybe I hold a resentment towards being called an abomination.

You can gradually just prove to your mom that you know who you are by living how you need to live and then thrive.
Live for you find a way to not go home for summers and holidays.
My boyfriend is in a similar boat but it’s his Aunt who was supportive, it’s just an especially unfortunate time for trans people in conservative families with Fox and News Max ginning up more hate
I'm sorry you have to go through this. I'm the parent of a trans teenager. I love my child no matter what. That's what love is. I hope things get better for you soon. Sending love.
Well once she is old and reliant on you. you can just not be there she didn’t support you so you don’t support her
Same
Tell er your nonbinary
thank you qwq
yep :’) im gonna be a senior in school this year and my mom is STILL super overbearing on me
thank you, i hope she can see its hurting me
(son is correct, yes :) ) and thank you, youre both very kind and this means a lot qwq
So in her eyes you’re old enough to choose what you are going to do for the rest of your life but not how you are going to do it.

It kinda sounds like she is actually concerned for the loss of the future she had planned for you rather than you. And the haircut statement is screaming fear of the perception and judgment of others. These are all her problems not yours.
Thats pretty much how she is :/ i think its called “cis grieving” or whatever but she is constantly obsessed with protecting me by making me as closeted as possible- no clothes, hair, whatever that might make someone know im queer. it sucks :/"	wtg5uq	trans	405	0.98	2022-08-20 20:05:33
Am I still valid of I wasn't GNC as a young child?	I came out to my mum a couple of times, once as non-binary and the second time as a boy (once I had considered my identity better). Saying she is supportive would be an overstatment, but she isn't hostile about it. However, both times, she brought up the fact that I wasn't gender non-confirming and didn't have any idea before puberty (although I was extremely insecure about my body) like many trans kids do. Now, I do have a lot of dysphoria (and euphoria) and I'm kinda sure of my identity as a boy, but sometimes I do kinda doubt myself because of this, even though I know my mum just wants a daughter. Am I still valid?	"One thing I have found is the more I start living as a guy the more dysphoric I get about things. Like before I had a binder of course I didn't like my chest but I didn't notice it so much.vut after wearing a binder I didn't want to go out without wearing it because I noticed how my chest looked larger. And since I've chosen a new name my old name gives me more dysphoria and I am way more disconnected from it. 
It's kind of just what happens. You don't necessarily get more dysphoria you just get dysphoric from things that you have moved away from like your name which sounds so jarring when you hear it after ending called a new name for a while.
Yes. While many trans people have histories of not conforming to their assigned at birth gender throughout their childhood, it is not a steadfast rule or requirement.
Short answer: your past doesn't matter, of course that's valid

Long answer: gender conformaty varies a lot in each trans person both before & after realisation. Some figure it out really young even before puberty or are oblivious and very non-conforming. On the other extreme some are so far in denial (and possibly but not definitively internally transphobic) that they subconsciously overcorrect [e.g. transfem denial beard]. Gender non-conformity is also not exclusive to trans people [e.g. cis femboys, mascgirls, tomboys, tomgirls e.c.t.]

Simply: all that matters is how you feel now, and how sure you are of that feeling!
Almost 40 and just figuring this out. As a kid I was fairly gender conforming. In college I got into theater, dance and so forth, but there were a handful of males doing that so didn't seem out of touch. 

So no, you aren't any less valid if you didn't rebel against your gender from the get-go. Anyone saying you aren't valid, ESPECIALLY from someone that is part of the queer community, doesn't deserve an iota of energy.
*sigh*
No one knows more about your identity than you do. Anyone who says otherwise is gaslighting you.
It’s almost as if puberty changes people’s bodies in ways they don’t like, so much that they finally notice they’re trans /s. Of course you’re fine, that’s how it goes for a lot of people
Yes, you are very valid.
I was really femme as a kid, wore dresses and wanted to be like disney princesses, but yet here I am: a trans man. Gender does not equal gender expression, you can dress however you want even if it doesn't ""align"" with your gender identity.
of course you’re still valid. :)

…also i relate to this hard. when i was little i didn’t quite care what i wore, even if it was mostly feminine clothing. i also had no clue i was trans until puberty when my brain was like “somethin aint right here” (and also i fell down a rabbit hole of lgbtq stuff). i get doubt too, but hey, im a boy and i know that now even if i didn’t when i was little :)
Same, my mom always thought I was a lesbian and was surprised to hear I wanted to be a boy because she “couldn’t tell” when I was younger.
Yes. I am a Man (FTM). As a child/teen I enjoyed playing with barbies, baby dolls, liked pink, wore jewelry and even tried makeup at some point. Today I have legally changed my name/gender. Have been on testosterone for nearly 2 years. Will have top surgery soon. This is who I am without a shadow of a doubt, I am very happy about all the decisions I've made so far. :) People are all different from each other, all of us are different individuals, and our experiences & self discovery and growth aren't all equal (this goes for anything).
You are completely valid and I say that as a mother. My daughter didn’t realize that she was transgender until she was 22 years old and she had never showed any signs of gender dysphoria. Now that she is on hormones and has transitioned socially, I can see how much happier she is.
I'm a trans man who was a pageant queen as a young girl. 

You're valid af.
You are valid, you are enough, not everyone will understand, that's okay
As someone who only really figured out they were trans when they were 38, and came out after turning 40... Yes you are valid.  
GNC behaviour doesn't have to be obvious or even present at all prior to discovering it within yourself. 😊
The existence of cis gender-non-conforming people tells us very clearly that there isn't a causal relationship between being GNC and being trans. Being gender-non-conforming is only about not fitting into the arbitrary boxes that society places each gender into, not about not actually being that gender in the first place. If a cis girl loves sports and hates makeup and dresses, we don't assume she is trans - similarly, if a trans guy hates sports and loves makeup and dresses, we don't assume he is cis. Also, if that cis girl in the first example decides that she actually does like being more feminine when she's older, nobody says that she isn't allowed to do so because she was more masculine when she was younger, so why should the same be true for trans people? Societal expectations of gender roles do not in any way define your gender and they definitely aren't static and unchanging parts of your identity.
I was a bit GNC as a child, but no more so than your average tomboy cis girl. Yeah, I hated dresses and stuff, but I wouldn’t cry in them. I would just be… awkward and uncomfortable. My mom was kind of the same way when I came out.

The way I explained it to her is that I didn’t know there was any language that could describe myself back then, so I did whatever I could to fit in with everyone around me. As I was AFAB, that meant occasionally wearing feminine clothes, having long hair, mostly friends who were girls, etc. In order to fit in, I stayed (for the most part) in hobbies and activities considered ‘feminine’, even though I had always wanted to indulge in certain stuff that was ‘masculine’ (I wanted to go out for football when I was younger, and almost did, but held back because it was ‘for boys’ and so I would get made fun of or whatever). What other people gotta keep in mind is that for a lot of us, or at least for myself, I didn’t get to explore a lot of stuff that felt more genuinely me because I knew people would be weirded out or upset about it due to my AGAB.

Obviously this won’t be true for every trans person, but a lot of us didn’t have the chance to even be GNC because we were afraid of what our friends, parents, and society would do to us.

Attempting to conform, as much as I could stomach as a kid, was a survival tactic. I wasn’t trying to get bullied or hated.
Totally valid, but I totally am experiencing the same thing omfgggg
In my experience with that kind of a mom (not really supportive but not hostile) they'll make any excuse to try to convince you that you're wrong and that your identity isn't valid. My mom is like that too and I did feel that way throughout my childhood (and I told her about it then) and she just keeps thinking of new excuses. Good luck and always remember nobody but you can tell you who you are.
When I was a kid I played with my sister a lot
We would play house and all these other things

But I also liked Beyblade and I collected them and me and my sister would play with those together

I didn’t like pink, because I was told it was girly and that boys weren’t supposed to like girly things, and I didn’t want to do the wrong thing

But secretly at the time I enjoyed girly things, I just didn’t want to be seen enjoying them by others. I did very much envy them, so I got into things like Littlest Pet Shop, Monster High, My Little Pony

To this day I love Monster High

And that was how I sorta coped with it

To everyone else they only saw the me who would put up this facade of being grossed out when I was just insecure about people seeing me engage with that
Trans girl who wasn't out til her 30s here! I was such a little boy and there was no getting around it, and I didn't want it any other way, why? Cuz I didn't know! It was the 90s damn
That’s most trans people, of course it’s valid
Just because you weren't immense distress as your assigned gender, doesn't mean that transistioning won't give you immense joy, only you know what the right decision is for you. There are a lot of trans people just like you, you're not alone, you're valid ❤️
You are definitely valid. Also, this might not be the case for you but for myself and most of my trans friends we've thought that there were no signs of it at a young age before remembering a long time later.
Yes absolutely id you werent then neithee would most if us.
I've heard an interesting take on learning you're trans specifically after puberty recently. Some people are comfortable as a kid before puberty but as they transition into adulthood sometimes the transition then makes them uncomfortable. Like an amab person may be comfortable as a boy but the transition into being a man isn't quite right. Like there are afab people who are called tomboys and as they go through puberty sometimes they more comfortably transition into being a woman but as a kid they weren't as comfortable with the structured gender norm assigned to them.
""Am I va-""

""Yes.""
I think this is a stereotype that needs to go away. This idea kind of reinforces gender roles with the concept of ""okay, since you want to transition, you should fall into the stereotypes of the gender you're transitioning to."" Not all women like girly things, and not all trans women like girly things. Wanting to transition doesn't mean you're going to start to like girly things. Enjoy what you enjoy, no matter what gender you are
 I'm a gay FTM and I liked cute stuff, but was still super GNC.

Liking guys could be considered GC as ""girls like boys"" but screw that!

A guy is just someone who wants to have a banana!

 You're your own person and you don't owe your parents zilch.
I have that exaact same problem. Imposter syndrome sucks but I assure you from one man to another you are definitely valid
Absolutely. I didn't figure it out until my 20s. Prior to that? I was a full on man all the time. Every persons journey is different. Many people and GNC from a young age. Many others, like myself, dive hardcore into their AGAB. Neither is right or wrong. It just is. You keep doing you brother and tell the haters to stuff it.
i guess just think of it like you probably didnt *know* you could do that (being more gnc/boyish/etc)

i know that i spent much of my childhood trying to do what i thought i was supposed to do and only reflecting back on myself am i realising how desperate i was to feel normal via emulating what i thought was ""right""
Yes definitely!! The media likes to only display trans people who showed clear signs since very early children, and while that can definitely be further evidence of one's transness, the truth is that what happened in your past really doesn't fucking matter. If you're trans, you're trans, and NOTHING makes you invalid.

It's very infuriating when cis people and even some trans people get the idea that all trans people showed signs from their childhood, and that all the signs that can be shown are obvious and visible to the parents. Fact is, that most trans people don't show significant signs that others or even themselves can pick up on. 

So I'm conclusion, yes, you're valid, and don't you EVER fucking forget❤️☺️🏳️‍⚧️
The idea that trans people know our exact gender identity with absolute clarity in early childhood was a story devised by gatekeeping doctors in the 20th century to decide who got to transition or not. While some trans people do know and behave as their true gender from early childhood, many of us don't figure it out until much later. You're super valid, and your experience is totally normal.
yes of course
Your mom isn't the judge of your trans-ness, only you can be that. Even if you go to a therapist, the therapist will as you how you feel. Because you're the only one who knows that. Your feelings about your gender are always valid.
Yep
You are SO valid! You've come out to her twice, what does she need, a gold-embossed letter from the Queen? You're trans and even if you never thought about becoming a boy for a single second before the age of 18, (and I find that difficult to believe but whatevs, that's totally okay if you never did!) you can STILL be Trans now. I believe you when you say you are trans. Why doesn't she? She is hurting you more than you realize or are letting on. Believe in yourself, even if she doesn't. Children outgrow their parents in a lot of ways that we aren't always ready for. Stay strong, and make good plans to get yourself out of her house. <3
yeah many trans people don't realize something's wrong until puberty
Yes, you were told not to be GNC all your life, it's not your fault you listened
Oh fuck yeah its still valid. I had a full denial beard, took care of myself, looked “good.”

But that doesn’t change ANYTHING.
you are 100% valid. i growing up acted pretty much like cis boys, and i’ve only started doing more stereotypical femme things after coming out
You may just be gender fluid. Like Loki in Norse mythology. Or maybe you’re still finding the pronouns that fit your identity. Regardless, You can change the pronouns you feel comfortable with as you see fit, and there is no point where you have to “lock them in” forever.
Yes.
You are fucking valid
I had this same experience! I came out to my parents as non-binary 3 times and they only listened when I asked my therapist to tell them I was ftm. You are def valid
My parents were confused too as I didn't ""show signs as a kid"". In reality I had a lot of desires to be gender non conforming but was very compulsive rule follower even when those rules are unwritten so I never felt like I could be gender non conforming.
of course you're valid. 💕

I've just been thinking something similar 

I'm just figuring out who I am - at 38 

my mother always wanted to keep me really feminine and it set in. like, she kicked off when I cut my waist length hair into a bob when I was 20! I was always that weird girl at primary school in dresses and a tiny handbag and ribbons in my (extremely long) hair 

obviously,  I'm not trying to insult your mum (mine's passed and it was a v complicated relationship for many reasons)

I've always had thoughts about transitioning but all the time growing up, I was being taught to be a proper little girl 

having said that, I also wasn't ever even a tomboy and yeah, that makes you think, ""am I really a boy? or someone else?""

I'm just starting to discover who I am and i wish you love and luck on your journey too
Of course you’re still valid!! I used to be a bit of both as a child, I loved dressing up like a princess but I also loved dressing like a cowboy! And like another person who replied said “your past doesn’t matter!” Your gender identity can change over time! I see it as a journey not a race :) for example I identify as non binary and trans masc and it’s taken a while for me to get here. I’m sorry your mum isn’t supportive but only you can live your truth! I’m sending u so much love on your journey ❤️
I definitely relate to this, it's kinda confusing sometimes lol. Thanks for answering
Totally relate and my friends wonder why I kept going in and out of the closet for a few years. It's a lot to commitment to mentally honestly.
Thank you =)
Thank you so much. I think a big thing for me was realising that being transgender was actually something you could be, and that it was alright to be. Applying things to yourself takes some time when you were convinced you couldn't be
saving this comment since you chose to speak facts
Aha, thanks
I relate so much to that bro. Literally exactly the same for me.
I'm happy for you! I can't wait until I can reach that point in transition. Thank you (:
You sound like a good mother =) 
Thanks
Thank you! And that's quite cool, actually. (Unless you were forced into it)
<3
=)
Thank you, good luck to you too
Thank you so much! (And I did think about being a boy before 18, just not before puberty, to clarify things)  the comments and the community are really helping my confidence in who I am <33
<3 thank you so much
Thank you! It's annoying how some parents don't trust their own kids feelings, they need someone else to tell them for them to believe it
Yeahh, I get that.
>""Don't do that, it isn't for your gender.""
>""What, you like wearing these clothes? Do you want to be the other gender?""
>""You can't play with that!""

>""Why didn't you show signs as a kid??""
Thanks! I hope you can achieve whatever you decide to do in life & with yourself. Remember, we are who we know ourselves to be, not what other people say we are. Good luck, friend. :)
Thanks! It was actually really cool. Young me had a blast.
Nobody knows everything. Please give yourself a break to ponder/waffle/question, you will be valid the whole time. I love you, trust yourself.
For me nothing was even said. I just had a sense of what was expected of me as a kid and didn't dare cross that line no matter how much I wanted to.
<3 You too
Nice!
Ah, societal norms and stuff. Humans have a desire to fit in and follow the rules. It's sad how much society pushes all these limitations on little kids just trying to explore. Even if it has bad effects afterwards
30 years ago it was a very different world. I feel like had I been a kid or even teenager today I would have had a very different experience."	vc7cm8	trans	398	0.98	2022-06-14 16:26:19
There's so many people coming out because of lockdown	"Because of lockdown so many people had nothing to do but to start exploring their sexuality and identity and I've seen so many people realizing they are gay/trans/nonbinary. I feel like there's an entire generation of new people figuring out themselves because of it and it's nice.

Is there a name for it? I feel like it's a big thing. The current top contender is ""queerantine"". (*sorry to those that dislike ""queer"", but it combines so well with quarantine*)

A really good observation from [CallMeJessIGuess](https://www.reddit.com/user/CallMeJessIGuess/): *I also like how the pandemic basically killed the whole argument of the “gay agenda”, that people are somehow being manipulated and brainwashed into being LGBTQ.*

*Where the pandemic seems to indicate that when societal norms and social pressure are no longer a factor, people are much more able to accept themselves for who they really are.*"	"I love “the queerantine” 🤣💜
Yeah and my lunatic ""mother"" uses this whole COVID situation to say that my identity isn't legit. Gr.... Heck, she condemns me for ""introspecting too much"" as a result of COVID and my nerdiness. Well I don't see nothing wrong with *studying myself* like a scientist studies others.
[deleted]
The reason i came out last year wws 1 lockdown and 2 I can’t be kicked out cause of covid only untill I realized later that where i live i legally can’t be kicked out
It's amazing the kinda exploration and realizations you can come to when your not made to perform for a society every day
totally agree i am accepting my new normal
It's all the 5G towers that they installed while everyone was busy fighting the 'pandemic'. Duuuuh -_-
Yeah, suddenly being at home and never alone made me have to really confront what was driving my secret cross crossing obsession.
they should make a holiday called gayday
That's what happened to me :/ I realized I was trans last year during quarantine.
I think it's also a case of things slowing down. I feel like I've kept myself distracted from my gender issues by being busy with studies but there's people working from home (less commute,more time to ourselves) and deferring opportunities like university until next year who have benefited from the additional time in the last 14 months to come to terms with who they are.
I was already exploring myself a bit with quarantine and having a strong relationship with my partner, and through the process of that I figured out I’m trans MTF. Took me a while to accept myself as this and just started going to therapy, I just hope I can get on HRT soon so I can come out (pun intended) of quarantine as the person I truly am.
The great awakening!?

Maybe the mayan calendar was misinterpreted by an archeologist that sufferers from dyslexia.

Not 2012...
...but 2021

🤯
Faaaacts I realized (in order) that I was non-binary, asexual, and panromantic over the course of the pandemic.
went from a cis lesbian (she/her) to a queer trans guy (he/they) during all this
I've loved lockdown not only has it made me realise I'm trans but it's also made me stop lying to myself about how I don't have any mental health issues by dismissing obvious signs of mental illness like perceptual distortions like seeing or hearing things when you're all alone
This happened to me too.
Hmmm who would have thought giving people a brief reprieve from the grueling and soul sucking dread of working anywhere from 40-80 hours a week to afford a place to live would give them time to discover themselves and learn in ways they never had the ability to prior HMMMM
Leaving my grocery store job and no longer having to be in the constant public eye really began to start this awareness of myself. Not having to fit into others expectations is uplifting. I still have to fit into certain expectations with my current job and within my family. Still figuring things out and I’m not entirely certain, just taking my time.
Love to you all, take care
""The big queer theory"" 😎
Yep, I accepted I was trans ftm and learned I am demisexual biromantic during quarrentine. Also started working on my mental health and reconnected with my old therapist for the first time in 5 years, never felt better.
I realized that I was trans during quarantine.
I too have had a lot of time to think things over. It’s true. Time in isolation can really give a new perspective on everything. It allowed me to recollect things I hadn’t previously considered as part of my attempted subconscious expression as transgender. I started counting the ways I did things differently than most cisgender men, and then a list started to form. A list longer than my arm of the last 25 years I realized I was different. Came here and figured it out after many months longer.
yeahhh the whole queerantine / transdemic thing hit me too. Well, also it helped 1) got the chronic depression treated late 2019, so finally been able to actually feel nuances of like/dislike for a damn change, 2) Pandemic Breakup removed a source of pressure to Act Straight And Cisgender, and 3) now that pandemic and the insanity at work (I'm in medical manufacturing, OOF) has been easing up, it's taking my general stress levels along with and I've been more able to think about things other than Work Eat Sleep Repeat. It's the starting to go back to more social activities once in a while that really set off the realization for me.
It happened to me. 𝕴𝖙 𝖈𝖆𝖓 𝖍𝖆𝖕𝖕𝖊𝖓 𝖙𝖔 𝖞𝖔𝖚...
Speak for yourself. I've never been so busy in my whole life. My industry has seen no slowdown and my wife and I have been slammed.

But, my egg cracked late last year, probably thinking, hey, 2020 was pretty fuckin weird, why not add realizing you're trans to the mix just to top it all off...
Oh no, we can't have you...*reads notes*... understanding yourself better?
someone saying that another person is introspecting too much shows that they have not introspected nearly enough or perhaps haven’t really ever thought about anything seriously at all.
On gosh, I had the same thing happen. Toward the start of COVID I started doing some long needed introspection. I realized I definitely wasn't cishet (I had suspicions beforehand). I talked with my mother, though I didn't come out, since I didn't really trust her to respond well. I was right. She said ""the heart is deceitful above all things."" Because apparently a person can't understand their own experiences without an outside influence telling them what they mean.

Gaslighting? Whatever do you mean? Our lights are all electric.

And that's why she's probably gonna be the last to know.
If you like studying things look up deep sea creatures and see how freaky some of them look and embrace that inner weirdo I have
My mom is the same she just said that im making it up for attention
Yeah my mom says I’m just depressed from Covid and once I get back out there it will make things better. 

It didn’t it made things worse. I’m more dysphoric and I’m more confused with where I stand now
Clapping here - well done! Yes me too
Same

I got my COVID vaccine a couple of weeks ago, and let me tell you, my 5G reception went from good to *fantastic*.
For me it was having more time alone, as my mom would sneak out to the park.
I love this idea. We should have this.
I've experienced this with my mother, She is . . . decent at parenting, but doesn't seem to do much introspection or listening to other people. I would literally rather get stuck in an argument with my dad than try to explain complex identities to my mom. At least my dad & I speak basically the same language.
I get that. I used to work from home and have the house to myself so it was a big adjustment.

i'm so sick of being an inconvenience	"Apparently my teachers are having problems with my pronouns... again.

I use e/xe/he pronouns. I introduce myself by saying ""I use e/xe/he pronouns, in order of preference.""

Now my advisor told me that one of my teachers is only going to use he/him because they're ""not ready for the other ones.""

I said ""but I want people to alternate!""

She said that I have to only use my neos if those are my preferred ones. She said I shouldn't introduce myself with he/him if I don't want people to use it.

I *do* want people to use them. I want people to use *all of them*. But apparently that's ""too much for people to do. They're afraid of making mistakes.""

I've told teachers SO MANY TIMES that I don't mind mistakes as long as they're trying. Them not using my pronouns at all is *so much worse* than using them and making mistakes.

But no. All I am to them is just another inconvenience. I'm so, so sick of diluting my identity for people who are supposed to support me."	"I mean... while I definitely respect your desire to have your pronouns used, when you give someone a comfortable option (for them) versus options that are more difficult (for them), they're going to go for easy every time. I used (they/she) as my pronoun set for a significant period of time (I've moved to she/her for a number of reasons at this point), and I found that people virtually never used non-binary pronouns when I gave them the option. It sounds to me that your teachers don't necessarily understand what you want them to do here, that the guidance counselor isn't on the same page with you, and you need to speak with your teachers. I doubt many of them believe they are misgendering you if they are using one of your preferred pronoun sets even if you believe that they are.
I'm gender fluid and I alternate between two names and either he/him or she/her pronouns. It got to the point where people simply didn't know which name to call me because I have a masculine name and a feminine name and prefer to use the one that aligns with my presentation and identity that day. And I realized after 2 years of trying it was fucking stupid of me to keep expecting people who barely know me to know when to call me what and how. As long as someone wasn't being malicious, I stopped caring what name they call me and stop caring what pronouns they call me. I get what you're going for but I don't think you can expect people to have circulating pronouns. Maybe I'm a little more old-fashioned, but I'm not that much older than you, I think you just need to pick a pronoun and stick with it. In time you're going to realize that this is all very silly to fret about because when you get into the corporate world or into a job, you'll be lucky to get as much respect as you're getting from a teacher right now. Teachers are by far the best allies we have.
I have no real pronouns preference. I tried to explain this to people. They can call me she or he and I don't care as long as it's not malicious. Literally nobody could figure it out. Having even she/he as an option was too much for people. Now I am just she and everyone gets my pronouns right every time. It's weird. 

I wish we lived in a world where using preferred pronouns was easy or even not having preferred pronouns was easy, but we don't. The majority of people have a hard enough time grasping the words they grow up with. Asking them to learn new words is fair, but for many many people its practically asking for them to learn a new language.
I might get hated for this >_< but I don't know much about neo pronouns and unless you are a good friend of mine I'd probably use they ._. But if you have a he pronoun then I'd just use he instead of xe/e if given the choice.

Unless you tell me youd prefer xe or e only and taught me how to pronounce them. Still id use xe or e exclusively but not both >_< 

I'm not trying to be mean or exclusive but even as trans I really don't know much of other pronouns and unless it's a bestie it's difficult to expect others to use a non binary pronoun when a easier more common and safe choice is provided to them.

That being said, I also want to assure you that it's not an inconvenience but that non binary is far more a newer concept to society than binary trans. While it is so, I do dampen my expectations on others. I get misgendered he even tho I present differently and I don't correct them because after all, we are strangers and acquaintance at best.

However, I find that sharing your pronouns to closer friends is more important. When it comes down to it, they usually are the ones to correct other binary people and it comes off as more appropriate for some reason. 

I don't know how old you are but it's my life back for getting around preferred pronouns xD let the normal people correct the normal people and we just focus on the close friends.
Yeah, sorry. If ""he"" is ok, ""he"" is ok. Teachers are acquaintances at best; perhaps you're expecting too much of them.
This is perhaps an Unpopular Opinion, but:

As trans people, I think we have an actual obligation be balanced in what we're asking of other people.

What is being balanced? Well, respect for our identity on one side of the scales, versus the cumulative cognitive and emotional load that following our request imposes on others.

When a trans woman asks people to switch from ""he/him"" to ""she/her"", there is a large benefit to her in terms of respect for her identity, and a relatively small cognitive and emotional load on others: they just have to switch from one well-known and understood set of words to another, and in a way that matches their new (to them) understanding of the trans woman's identity. The two things re-enforce one another in a way that may be initially challenging, but which quickly become comfortable. And for new people she meets, who only ever know her as a woman, there's no burden at all: those people just call her like they would any other woman, in a way that is completely instinctive.

In this circumstance, the benefit is high, the burdens relatively low. This is a justifiable request.

When a non-binary person asks for ""they/them"" pronouns, well, it's similar. Yes, people are generally less accustomed to using ""they/them"" to refer to a specific, singular person, but on the other hand, singular-they has been around for a long time (whether the transphobes admit it or not), so the only significant challenge here is for people to learn that singular-they works as a specific pronoun, versus just as an unspecified-person pronoun.

Again, high benefit to the non-binary person, and only modest burden to others. Justifiable.

The trend here is clear: the *more* you're asking people to change their understanding of how language itself works, the *higher* the burden you're asking them to undertake on your behalf. And the greater that burden, the greater the stress of worrying about screwing up, which adds an emotional cost as well.

For a shift from he/him to she/her, there's zero change in how language works. Literally all the trans woman is doing is saying ""hey, update, I actually belong in *this* category instead of *that* one."" The non-binary person is asking for a minor modification to how the words ""they"" and ""them"" are understood and used. That's a bigger ask, but the ask is pretty logical and it's doesn't conflict with other ways in which ""they/them"" are used, so it's not that hard or stressful.

But when you ask people to use *three* separate pronouns for you, and you want them to use all of them not just pick one and stick with it, and you want them to follow some rather ambiguous rules for when to use which ones, *and* two of those words are not broadly accepted as pronouns at all, well, you can see that the request here is a *lot* higher. You're asking for two a structural changes in the language (adding ""e"" and ""xe"" as pronouns), plus special rules they have to remember to only--but always!--use for you but nobody else. With everyone else, they can follow the rule ""person is in category X, use normal pronoun for that category."" You're saying they can't do that with you. That's... a lot. It's a lot for them to remember, which creates stress and emotional cost.

I mean, I'm trans and I respect the hell out of people's identities, but if you were someone in my life and you asked for that, even I would be like ""Seriously? C'mon. Can you simplify that a bit, maybe?"" I might not say that out loud, but that's the gut reaction that would be going through my mind.

I'm not going to tell you what pronouns you should or shouldn't use or fight for. It's your life. But I do encourage you to think about this whole situation in terms of that balance of costs and benefits. Because at some point, the costs necessarily have to outweigh the benefits. I'm not going to make a judgment as to whether the costs here outweigh the benefits. That's for you to decide. Just remember to be considerate of other people too. You're asking them for consideration, which you deserve, but remember that they deserve consideration too.
I get what you mean. I use he/him or xe/xem interchangeably. I used to use he/they/xey, but my friends only ever used he, despite us all being queer. And now that I’ve changed to he/xe I haven’t bothered to tell them because I know they won’t use it anyway—and I’m too scared to ask in case I hurt their feelings.

It feels so frustrating, I’m sorry you’re in the same boat
What are the other two and why do they matter? Not saying they don't matter but what cues would someone have to read into you in order to know what to call you? 

I don't know these terms I just want to understand.
While that sucks its not reslly realistic to expect people to understand and use those pronouns
Asking people to continuously alternate your pronouns is, in my opinion, asking too much.
This is why I ended up no longer introducing myself with xe/xir pronouns and just left the they/he
Do the teachers know the full other pronoun sets? This might seem like a dumb question, but I've seen people use xe/xem, xe/xir, xe/xer, etc. and I would probably default to he/him most of the time just to be on the safe side. Same with e, I've never interacted with anyone who uses those pronouns before, is it like e/em/eirs? I don't know the situation, so apologies if this doesn't apply, but maybe some clarity in that department could help
I'm 47. So maybe my perspective is different. I don't give a damn what anyone calls me. Additionally. I don't even know what e pronoun is. How many pronouns do we need. Why try to make small minded people's lives so difficult.
I mean people most likely dont get it, its much easier for them to use he/him pronouns, we cant expect much from people.
A suggestion with neo-pronouns. I know how to work “they” or “he” or “she” into a sentence. I don’t know how to work with e/xe. Giving example sentences may help as well as pronunciation. If I can picture the sentence in my head, I have an easier time saying it. These professors are staying in their comfort zone because they don’t know how to use e/xe. I had to ask how to pronounce Mx. but now that I know I can use it as a salutation. I’m betting these professors are also uncertain of how to say e/xe.
I also like more than one pronoun, so I get it.

If I were you, I would choose which one that you wanted to use the most in professional environments. Maybe when you get closer to certain colleagues who will understand, you could open up about the other ones. 

Because a lot of people just don’t understand.
I respect your desire to seen and referred to as the real you, but tbh this is just too hard for the vast majority of people. I hang out on trans spaces on reddit all the time, and I browse reddit all the time, but even I'd imagine myself having trouble remembering your pronouns *and* alternating them (unless I'm, like, your bbf or something). If it doesn't make you too dysphoric, cut them some slack.
I hate to break it to you, but it is unrealistic to expect teachers to alternate. 
>Them not using my pronouns at all is so much worse than using them and making mistakes.

I thought they were using he/him? What is the problem? If you don't like he, then stop introducing yourself with it.  


>I'm so, so sick of diluting my identity for people who are supposed to support me.

Here's the thing: those other pronouns are diffucult to remember and pronounce for teachers who have all sorts of other things on their plate. Keep in mind that they have lots of other students, as well as grading papers, attending meetings, and other things. You are not their only student, and the majority of teachers are not educated on the topic. 

You are priveledged that the teachers are even using he/him for you, and the fact that they are even open to using neopronouns. In my school, some teachers flat out refused to call me he, despite medically transitioning and passing. Just be grateful for the support you do have. 

I keep seeing similar things online like ""I don't want to make my identity digestable for cis people"", but we live in a world run by cis people. When you get a job, the customers will not know that you go by e/xe, and will probably call you he instead, even if you have a pronoun pin. And that is gonna have to be okay. I mean all of this with no disrespect, and hope everything at school goes well for you!
I go by he/she/they pronouns. I understand that “she” is more comfortable for some people, mostly my family, and if I didn’t want them using she/her pronouns, I wouldn’t have said I use them. When one of your pronouns is more “comfortable” than the others, people are gonna use the comfortable one.
Teachers deal with alot - the high number of students they cater to, prepping lessons, faculty responsibilities, grading etc, not to mention the heavy weight if their own personal lives, all while being severely underpaid and overworked. Try and cut them some slack and be considerate of how much you put in their plate. Meet them halfway.
I'm having trouble following your explanation. Do I understand correctly that you want people to rotate between your three pronouns each time they refer to you, but one of your teachers wants to refer to you with only one of those pronouns?
Most people do not use pronouns as an expression of identity but simply to serve a utilitarian purpose. Asking people to rotate pronouns is an unreasonable request.

You said he is fine, so if the teacher is saying that, they’re doing their job.
It sucks that everyone around you is sticking to the easy one. Have you spelled out really clearly how to use your neos, and what you mean by order of preference? A lot of people will have no idea how to interpret someone introducing themselves with multiple pronouns, especially pronouns that they are unfamiliar with. You might get some traction if you explain it in little baby steps (e.g. ""I use three sets of pronouns, e, xe, and he. However, I prefer e and xe to he. So, wherever you would say ""he"" in reference to me, instead you can say ""e"" or ""xe"". Wherever you would say him, instead you could say (pronoun) or (pronoun)."" etc.). I'm not saying that everyone will magically use your pronouns correctly, but you might get one or two people who will do it once they know how to.
I don’t understand Neo pronouns

Dude don't be greedy. Just pick one set. That way it's clear for all.
What
No offense but sounds…intentionally complicated.
They are using one of your pronouns, I don’t see an issue ? If I came out as trans here I’d get hate crimed at school, shitty to see you boasting about people not using ALL of your pronouns interchangeably like it’s a horrible issue. They are your teachers not your friends or family and they definitely don’t have only you as a student. 

Either way, the world doesn’t revolve around you, as harsh as it is they simply do not care and you should be glad they are using ‘he’ (which are your pronouns either way) it’s a school, I doubt a school has ever been a safe place

First world problems I swear to god
You want people to ALTERNATE between pronouns?  Some of which are unknown to 99% of people?  Frankly the ""tired of being an inconvenience"" sounds  more like attention hunting than sincere tiredness.
It's absolutely horrible that anyone who voices support for OP is getting downvoted like crazy. This is supposed to be a place where trans people support each other. But apparently that support disappears as soon as someone uses neopronouns or multiple sets of pronouns. I am probably going to be downvoted even more for posting this comment but I really don't care about reddit karma so whatever, bring it on. I'm really sorry OP that you are not getting the support you deserve from your teachers and from this subreddit. I'm really disappointed in how people are reacting to this and I don't even use neopronouns so I can't even imagine how OP is feeling right now
Don’t listen to the downvoters here.

Don’t take your teachers’ failure to use your pronouns as a judgement on you.  

Neo-pronouns can be difficult to learn to use it’s true, but people who care will try.  You are not the inconvenience.  Our binary gendered society is the inconvenience.  It’s not your fault that society struggles to include you.  It is not on you to carry that burden on your back.
Your identity isn’t inconveniencing your teachers; their refusal to work through their ignorance is degrading you. As teachers, they should know best how to overcome something they don’t understand and learn how to apply it
Does your state have DASA policies for schools? If so, then they are discriminating and misgendering you. I found out that it’s not “preferred pronouns”, it’s your pronouns, the pronouns that are yours. People can’t be giving whatever pronouns they want.
I have noticed that if you give people more than one pronoun, they will use the one that they feel more comfortable with. NYS has DASA and it is followed (should be) it’s the law.
Why are there so many negative comments in here? Op is justified. The teachers should TRY at the VERY LEAST. I won’t argue about this either, that’s basic human respect. How would all of you feel if you told people your pronouns and nobody even bothered to try and be correct?
Love to you, OP. I'm sorry these comments are so negative; I'd expect/hope a trans subreddit would be more understanding that pronouns are important to us, even if they ""inconvenience"" others. 

You've done everything you can to respect other people here. You've noted it's okay if people make mistakes, you've reached out politely and calmly, you've explained what you'd like. I'd hope your teachers would at least be willing to try. It's very frustrating that many folks aren't able to put aside their fear of making mistakes even when folks on the other end explicitly say that they'd prefer mistakes if it means being respected.

I hope you find people or spaces you are loved in, not just tolerated and pushed under the rug to what's easiest for folks. You deserve better than this.
I’m sorry this is happening friend. Also sorry about the people giving you a hard time in this thread, you’d think we as a community would be more understanding of this issue but I guess not :(

- - - 

Just because you don’t understand xyr pronouns and how e wants them to be used doesn’t mean it’s ok to just ignore entire parts of his identity.  It’s the same as when people tell me they’re just gonna call me my deadname or use he/him because that’s what they’ve always done and it is easier for them.

Eir teacher ignoring xyr pronouns is still misgendering xem.
Sending you HUGS! It is not you, it's them, and they are trash if that is how they treat you
Hey, I just want to let you know that you’re not an inconvenience because you ask people to use multiple different pronouns, whether they’re neopronouns or not. 
No matter the circumstance, whether they’re your teachers or parents, you deserve to be called by the pronouns you want to use. Giving people multiple options, I have found, should be easier, they can mess up less by switching it up! I don’t understand people trying to gatekeep you on this. 
When people give you multiple pronouns to use for them, they want you to USE MULTIPLE PRONOUNS unless otherwise stated. 
I hope you can get your teachers to understand how much this hurts you and I’m sorry this is happening at all. 
Just because something is new or vaguely scary does not give them an excuse to not try at all.
I'm really sorry you feel like that, you shouldn't feel like you need to dilute your identity for other people. Since you have tried explaining your situation to them directly and they haven't listened I'd suggest you go to your principal or someone else who is supportive who could explain to them. No matter how unusual someone's pronouns might be or how ""difficult to use"" others consider them they should always be respected regardless.
People are scared of neopronouns - or rather, people are very uncomfortable with using them. And that is fucking dumb, but I think it is a societal pressure thing - I feel some people feel 'silly' when they use them. This isn't a cis thing either, when neopronouns are brung up even in trans circles, a lot of trans peeps think people who use neopronouns are just doing for attention. I think they fail to grasp just how different every person is and how people may experience gender differently, which is ironic considering they are trans. The wider issue is that people can't seem to realise that others can actually do anything for themself, that they have came to the conclusionnot because they want to be who they are merely for attention or to appease others instead of (the real reason) because they want to gain further fullfillment in their life. Sorry i think my sentence structuring became a bit difficult at the end, hope my message came across nevertheless.
if you’ve talked to them about your preferences and they aren’t being receptive, that’s their ignorance. simply because something is new does not make it “too much”.

your needs are never too much and i’m sorry they said that to you.
I get it. I go by ""he/him""  and ""xe/xem."" If people alternated, it would be like a dream come true, but I'm too afraid to ask.
Agreed. The point of pronouns is to reduce the amount of cognitive strain and redundancy in a sentence when referring to someone else. Asking someone to change it up with no apparent reason (especially when a known alternative is presented) goes against that entire concept. Neopronouns are an all or nothing thing because people hate learning new things. It’s already gonna take people ages to get used to neo pronouns, so it’s probably best to just hunker down with one if you want it used. People default to he/him because otherwise they’re gonna have to go through a learning period of saying brand new words in what were previously simple sentences. 

Most cis people don’t understand the reasoning behind neopronouns, so they’re likely to be averse to them since they like to invalidate their usefulness/importance.

Additionally, I feel like wanting others to change up pronouns on the fly is… a lot to ask since it is pretty confusing. Asking people to use multiple pronouns in rapid succession sorta feels like it crosses the line from gender identity into egocentrism—as harsh as it may sound.
You can pick multiple pronouns and some people will rotate through them, but you’re going to end up with people who just use one set. In terms of frequency, people will use the binary set (he/she) if you have those, followed by they, followed by any neopronouns. It’s not really nice or thoughtful but that’s what you can expect right now. Maybe if society has a little more time to learn and evolve it’ll change.
I suggested something to my genderfluid partner to help with this: colored bracelets or necklaces that signify your pronoun preference for that day. Something easily visible, so the other person just has to look at you and know which to use. Obviously you'd have to tell them first what it means, but still.
It is not really that weird. 

Most people do not use pronouns as an expression of identity but simply to serve a socially utilitarian purpose.

People call me she because they either see me as a woman or they recognize that I’m a transsexual woman but consider it more socially expedient to say she instead of something else. My gender identity has nothing to do with it.

Switching pronouns as a way to express gender identity is by definition an abnormal thing to do. People who aren’t ensconced in Gender Discourse don’t use pronouns for that purpose. Which is why they can accept one but struggle when you ask for either.
And like, I’d probably use e/em because I’m relatively used to that pronoun set. But it probably wouldn’t even occur to me to rotate through the different sets unless OP specifically asked. If we were friends I’d totally do it but in a professional environment where I’m only occasionally seeing em it *is* an unusual request.

OP, I want people to rotate my pronouns too. But you just can’t expect that of most people. At least not right now
It's not ""expecting too much"" of people to use trans people's preferred pronouns, even if they are neopronouns or multiple different pronouns. It's not ""too much"" to ask to be addressed in the way that's most comfortable to you

Edit: I don't understand why I'm being downvoted so much for saying people should at least make an effort to use other people's preferred pronouns when this is a trans subreddit but okay
I don’t personally understand neopronouns, but I do understand that some people’s experience with gender needs different or new terms to describe. I don’t think that people shouldn’t use neopronouns just because it’s harder for some to understand- people have a right to their own identity, no matter how complicated that happens to be. It’s just that if it’s more complicated it’ll be harder for people to keep track of it.
thanks, it sucks that no one seems to respect neos anywhere.
Totally agree. You can certainly have any or as many as you want. But when you have multiple pronouns, it's a choice for the person using them as to which they want to use. Personally I always list my pronouns as ""Please Ask"" so I can control any conversation where I may see people infrequently or for the first time. I only get into explaining my pronouns with people I see repeatedly.
Sounds like the perfect use for a pronoun pin!
Yea that's true. Having 1 pronoun used right is quite a good start
Okay, but OP explicitly listed ""he"" as a preferred pronoun. If e wants people to use ""e"" instead, then ""he"" shouldn't be on the list. 

I don't see this as a problem with the teachers, but with OP not being clear with what e wants. ""I want people to use _all_ of them""—well, people don't just round-robin pronouns even when they have options. They'll pick whichever one they can remember most easily, and ""he"", being a standard pronoun, is by default the easiest to remember. I bet some of the teachers were relieved to have that as an option, and I don't blame them if they're now confused as to why that's not good enough when they were _specifically told_ that it was acceptable.
It’s uncommon pronouns that are hard to pronounce. 

Cut the teachers a little bit of slack.
yall what are neopronouns, are they like just drippy pronouns?
20XX?
so confused and it's like 3am
ikr why is the sort of rude first reply getting so many up votes :/
And if it’s complicated you have to cut people more slack.
They could at least try. OP is saying they are refusing to even try

I kind of want to keep my old name?	"I’m a AMAB and my name is Dylan, I’ve always hated my name but after thinking I might be trans, I kind of love my name as a girl name? Is that weird?

I like the idea of giving myself a brand new name, a new identity, something that screams “ that’s a girl name” despite my fear of feeling bothersome asking my friends and family to call me a new name and pronouns. I’m still looking for names but I keep going back to my old name and liking it more as a girl name.

Edit: thank you everyone for the advice and encouragement, I read every comment and also I feel so welcomed in this community and it’s amazing I’m gonna cry <3 you’re all so lovely and sweet"	"Not weird at all. Being trans is about being yourself. If Dylan feels good, then keep it. It can definitely be a girl's name. I know a Corey who kept her name.  

Honestly, changing your name is a HUGE hassle. You're saving yourself a massive headache.
Like Dylan Mulvaney on tiktok!! She’s such a sweetheart
Dylan is a super cute girl name.
I kept my name. Its actually more common as a girls name than boys, so it fits me better now.

I know a few girl Dylans. Its a good name. Also, you can go pick yourself out a fresh, shiny new middle name if you want! (I did!)
I think Dylan could work great as a female name. I like it. You rock it girl.
dylan is a great girls name. but when you decide if you keep ur name or pick a new one don’t choose based off of if it’s gonna be hard for others bc it’s your name. if those people care about you enough they’ll adjust
Lots of women named Dylan out there. For instance Dylan Meyer is engaged to Kristen Stewart.
I absolutely love the name Dylan for a girl, it really is so pretty. There's Dylan Mulaney (not sure I've spelled her name right) which is a trans woman on tiktok (100% recommended to check her out she's awesome) and there's the singer Dylan that I really enjoy (Girl of Your Dreams and Someone Else are some of her most popular ones) and she's a girl too !
If you like your old name keep it! Change your middle name if you want, or don’t! It’s up to you. There’s nothing weird or wrong about wanting to keep an old name. I considered it since I also had a relatively gender neutral old name. Ultimately I did decide I wanted to change it, but again - totally fine if you don’t! Do what makes you happy 💙
I know someone who is keeping there name Deven, so although a lot of people may associate there name with there old gender others don't really care as much. I Changed it to be more of a pun to the female version of my others name. Just drop the T and an E and i was ok. But there is no rules its what you want.
I don’t think so, I feel pretty similar anyways. Unfortunately my old name was Isaiah… So I just changed it to Isabelle. I’m not that different, I’m just learning to love myself and be who I am 😊
I (I identify as a trans man) kept my name, Roman (I just took out the “e” at the end, bc Romane is considered to be a feminine name where i live and Roman is considered masculine but i kept the same prononciation considering the “e” was already silent anyway, so nothing changed on that part) and it was the best decision, because i’ve always strongly identified with my name and couldn’t imagine hearing myself being called in another way. 

The other reason is that I wanted to modify it without having to pick another name, I wanted my name to symbolise growth, kinda like it’s evolving with me. 

So yeah, modify it, keep it, change it, whatever you do, Dylan sounds too good to let go imo, but do as you feel will be the most comfortable for you! Ik some people change their name because of dysphoria but if you feel that Dylan is you, i’d say keep it! 

+ if you find a name that you like and don’t know which one to choose, you can just take it as your middle name :)
I also liked my birth name of ""Hunter"". Still debating if I'll switch, but it's pretty common to not choose a new one
I've known 4 Dylans. 2 girls, 2 boys. Definitely not a weird thing to go for.
I really like Dylan as a woman's name!

My name also works for both (Jesse) so I kept it. It's not my favorite male name, but I didn't feel strongly enough about it to go through the hassle of choosing a new one. I did end up legally changing my middle name, however. It was a lot of money just to change Anne to Angus, but I felt like that one was worth it (and less of a hassle, despite the $$) in a way that changing Jesse was not.
Use the name you want to use, ESPECIALLY if that name feels like you🥰

My deadname WORKS as any gender, but I just plain don't like my deadname, so I picked a different name... before I even realized I was trans😅
dylan is the COOLEST girl name omg
Dylen is a wonderful name omg
I kept my old name but feminized the spelling to Kodi I have met female Cody’s with the original spelling I just put through out my school years, happy I did, but like everyone else said, if it feels right do it 💙 it’s all about you ☺️ no one else’s standards
If it makes you happy, do it. Simple.
I’m in the same boat! I think I’ll keep the name Kaden!
I like my old name too but I've been using my new one for a while now. When I do the name change I plan on keeping my old name as a middle name. I'm chinese so I think a lot of people use a western name as first name and keep their Chinese name as a middle name.
i can feel the dylan mulvany comments
It don’t matter. My ex roommate name is Eugene. She is cis.
Use whatever name feels comfortable. ""Hilary"" was for a period in time considered a masculine name.
I like Dylan as a female name. If you keep coming back it is for a reason. Roll with it. You can always change your mind later if it isn’t working.
Yeah I also kept my name! It’s not even particularly gender neutral but whatever it’s mine and I like it 🤷🏼
I wish I had been given a gender neutral name. If you like it, keep it!
I know more AFABs named Dylan or Dillon etc these days than AMABs.
I know a Nova who kept his name-- it was unisex after all! Go for it.
Go for it! If I had a name that worked both ways, I would've kept it lol. But if you decide to change it, all you need is the paperwork provided by your local courthouse for legal name change and then the filing fee for your state. At least, where I am that's all I needed to do, idk if maybe other states put limitations on that but I doubt it considering people change their names legally all the time for one reason or another. 

But I digress, I think Dylan is a good name for a girl and it's not uncommon either. I think I've met more female Dylans than male ones. Either way just do what feels right and makes you inadvertently smile. When I picked my name, I said it out loud and in sentences a couple of times and it made the corner of my mouth smirk a little because I really liked the sound of that and that's when I was like ""yep, that's the one, that's me. I'm a that name""
My old name, although having a feminine ""y"" sound at the end, was once considered a masculine name and even the most common usage of the name up until a certain disney show appeared was about a man with that name. I definitely couldve kept it.

I couldve just as easily been assigned a name like Mary-Ann and keep my name and the Cis would just have to get over it lol you do what feels best for you, friend❤
You can always add a new name but keep your old one as a middle name, so people can call you either. That's what I did.
theres a trans woman on tiktok called dylan who kept her name too. it’s fine.
I chose to keep my name! It’s your name so it’s whatever works best for you!
It's not weird. Most people just see their names as their intrinsic identities and gender doesn't affect that. I know one YouTuber, Graysons Projects who detransitioned (from being transmasc) and still kept the name Grayson because that was the case.
I love it!!!
There’s a Dylan on Tik Tok who’s a trans woman(?) and I think the name can be really feminine. (Please correct me if Dylan identifies as something else. I don’t watch her content so I’m unsure if that’s what she prefers. )
Not weird at all! I’ve met a lot of lovely women named Dylan through out the years. 
I’m technically not changing my name. 
I go by a shortened version of my name. I’ve only met 2 guys that go by my shortened name. But I love my shortened name and don’t want a new name
Heh you could do what I did and edit your old name! Could go with Dylane for fun points! But by the sounds it is a cool girls name and you should be all good to hold onto it. (it's honestly sounds like surfer or skater girl name hehe)
I was very lucky to have a relatively neutral name, sometimes my nerves get the better of me and I wonder if I’m “not trans enough” because I didn’t change it, but my name is genuinely one of the best things I’ve ever been given! Dylan is super cute as a girls name and something as small as a collection of letters doesn’t invalidate you at all
Hi! i am also AMAB MtF given the name Dylan. i spent my whole life disliking the name for myself but absolutely LOVING it as a girl’s name.

in the second grade, my teacher brought in her newborn baby granddaughter, her name was also Dylan, so i got to hold her first and she made the rounds through the class.

when my egg cracked, i decided to change my middle name to Olivia instead of changing my first name, and use my first and middle name interchangeably depending on context, as that’s something my dad does. 

i may be horribly biased, but i think Dylan is a fantastic woman’s name!
The first and only person I have ever kissed is a girl named Delin 👍 we kissed like one time at a party and she is super cool
My name is masc, but I have met women who use it.   


Idk, I'm kinda indifferent to what I'm called The only reason I don't go by my birthname is it's my father's name as well.
hey a trans dude here who changed his name like a billion times 😭. I know lots of trans men/women who keep their birth name or their nickname if it’s gender neutral or is of strong significance to them. Don’t even worry about bothering others with a new name since it’s literally your decision and if they refuse or complain because it’s “too hard for them” then they’re not worth your time. Either way just do whatever feels comfortable! I tried introducing myself in the mirror as my name ideas like “hi, I’m — I go by -/- pronouns” even if it feels dumb it kinda works. Good luck on deciding<3!!!
0% weird
I liked my name but I wanted a girl name because I a girl, so I just used the female version of the name so now I is known as Stephanie.... It's all up to you. Event if you had a super manly name there's nothing wrong with being a girl named that.
I read a story where the main character's sister was named Dylan!
I'm Dillon and am most likely going to just change the spelling (to Dylan, actually!) and my middle name. I also love the name and think my middle name will help with misgendering when my name is read 🙂 (since most people I've met or talked to about it assume Dylan on it's own is a ""male name"" unfortunately)
It is gender neutral. I know several women named Dylan.
You can name yourself however you want, even if it is keeping your birth name.
Thats valid as fuck!!
What my sister did was keep her birth name as a main name but goes by Alicia to friends or add pride stuff and whatever and she wants to legally keep her birth name. But do whatever feels comfortable for you
my female cousin is named Dylan! i always thought it was pretty as a girl’s name. it’s totally your choice :)
I kept mine. Convenient as hell haha
It does feel really good! Plus, yeah, it’d be nice to avoid all the hassle of a name change lol

Plus, it’s a way to preserve part of my old self kind of
Just changing it's socially has been a struggle. The first month I had to explain to everyone at work why I changed it... It went from making me happy to be talking about new name to dreading it real quick.
Also a Cory who kept her name. Mostly to spite my dad, and because I can’t see myself going by anything else.
>Honestly, changing your name is a HUGE hassle. You're saving yourself a massive headache.

We used to think this was the case, and it wasn't cheap or quick to be fair, but it was actually pretty easy, for us at least. Which is good because our old legal name was atrocious.
Haha hell yeah! I kept Cory too!!
My first thought was her when I seen this post
she is literally so kind !! love her
Thank you! I thought so too! It’s way better as a girl name I think
Ohhh that’s super good idea I didn’t think of that!!
<3 <3
Yeah you’re absolutely right, I just always worry I’m asking too much or being a burden and so that’s where my mind went but I won’t let that make my decision :)
I didn’t know Kristen Stewart is engaged! I love her! Lol
I keep hearing about Dylan Mulaney! I really gotta check her out :)
Your reasoning is very sound! I like the idea of a name symbolizing growth and evolving with you, super cool! 

I forgot to mention most people call me by a nickname, which was fine since I hated my name but like I said in the post, I like the name as a girl name so I think I’d ask if people started calling me that now :)
Ryan Reynolds names his daughter James, you can be Hunter. It’s super feminist. :)
Right!? My thinking exactly’
Thank you!!
That’s a cute name too!
I like your attitude lol
I know I already said it in this thread but as a boy I hated the name but when I say it now as a girl it does make me smile! Lol
Omfg I love that spelling!!
That’s so extra weird because I was also eyeing the name Olivia AND we’re both Dylan’s who hated their name as a boy but love it as a girl! What are the odds!?!
If someone gives you crap over your name, Epic Lloyd has a ""Dis Rap for Hire"" for a person with the name Glasscock. It's basically a short rap about accepting your name and saying F the haters.
Work is the main one I'm dreading. Everything else has been fine. Friends and family have been good so far. But work... there's definitely gonna be some transphobes there. Luckily, my company has strict policies on supporting LGBTQ people and everyone on my immediate team will definitely be super, likely outwardly, supportive. So I'll get through it.
I live in NY so the legal name change itself probably won't be the hassle for me. But then I need to update my credit card, bank card, mortgage, car title and insurance, marriage license, ss card, birth certificate, multiple insurance plans... It just seems like the list is never-ending.
Agreed, way cuter as a girl name!
I know a Dylan and she's a cis girl!
i’ve done the same thing up until a couple months ago when my mom and i stopped trying to make it easier for other people when it really just needs to be easier for me. it’s taken me years of being out to be able to do this.
Nah yes don’t worry! My brother is 11yo and at the beginning I was kinda ashamed to ask him to call me my name, and once he even said it was hard for him since he always knew me as dead name, but after some weeks he adjusted so fine and he nevers calls me my deadname now :)
Best part is if you wanna feel more femme you pronounce it like Jane and when you wanna feel more masc you can pronounce it the old way. Its a versatile E!
honestly probably extremely low!
As soon as I came out I changed my name. The biggest relief for me was that. At first I wanted nothing to do with the name but after a few weeks I decided fo just use the feminine name instead... 

Also a good way to know how much you like a name is getting managers at work to call you that.... You'll find out really quick how much you love the name.
We felt that way too, and we did admit it was time consuming. But it isn't difficult usually. And we've learned to make peace with occasionally running into our dead name. It's just another part of our history.
I need to do that too
You just have all the ideas omg! Lol

People love femboys so much, until they're trans.	"I'm a feminine, ftm gay guy. Nobody sees me as a real man, even suspect some of my friends of this because of misgendering. I've been feminine, not really attractive, my whole life and i can't get on t because of my age and side effects.
When I told people I'm also gay mlm, with zero attraction to girls, i just know they shit on my identity, they just see me as a cishet girl with extra steps, even tho I've tried to make it clear thousands of times I've never seen myself as a girl. My feminine appearance is not something I can change, and i don't want to get rid of the clothes i like.
My point is, everyone praises cis femboys for dressing feminine and ""fighting gender norms"",but the second you, as a trans guy, show any little sign of feminity, an army of cishets will feel so attaked.
Not to mention how annoying cis quirky ""ally"" girls form tiktok are. I noticed how their ""go off handsome king!!"" kind of comments stop the secon you don't act like a little soft kid who tries everything to be attractive and masculine."	"That really sucks that you're dealing with this shit.

Performative queerness is, unfortunately, very real, as you're showing us. Cisallohetero society is unfortunately hanging over all of us. And recently I've been seeing queer people use it as a hammer against other queer people, which is so unhelpful.

Just sucks.

I'm also a feminine transmasc, I feel you. :(
Trans mend don’t owe you masculinity, trans women don’t owe you femininity, enbies don’t owe you androgyny, be you
I’m mtf and that word is still used to misgender me, I hadn’t even *considered* how it affects transmascs. Awful origins of the word aside it almost feels like it’s continued existence perpetuates the existence of gender norms… a guy can’t just dress or act feminine, there has to be a label, and the label implies that it’s not normal in a sense?

The situation you find yourself in absolutely sucks, bordering on transmedicalism. You’re valid, and i hope things’ll get better for you :(
I’m a trans tomboy, I feel you
Yeah a lot of trans ""allies"" only support you when you fit their idea of what a transmasc/transfem/enby person should act like and when you don't they start saying you're not being trans the right way
Yep its the same way people love a tragedy about a little boy whose abusive mom forces him to wear dressed because she always wanted a daughter until its a little trans boy because that's to be expected for us.
That's true, I'm a feminine trans boy and people always say ""You're not a real boy if you dress like that"", while they will go crazy of ""breaking gender norms"" if they see a cis femboy. It really shows that they just respect you if you fit in the stereotypes of a cis boy, if you are feminine and trans you ""are just faking it"" and ""aren't a real boy"". 

I hope you can get the respect that you deserve on being what you want to be, good luck.
I believe you! You are a man in my eyes.
You're not responsible for whatever it is that reminds them of a girl. You're a boy ❤️
There are of course also people who accept you just the way you are! 🤗 I see you, brother! ✊
Tik tok with any community sucks. Tik Tok business model celebrifying people (which is just giving them complexes, inflated egos, and brain rot) no matter the amount of misinformation they peddle.  I could extend this to any social media platform. Even here with the Karma system, but Tik Tok ought to be the worst in many cases.  


Ask most diagnosed DID systems about systems on Tiktok, and you won't hear the end of it.  


Seriously, don't ask me. I will rant.
are you me? did i post this in my sleep?
hey going through the same thing here fellow feminine trans fella:’)
Where do people love femboys?

Only on the internet maybe.In the real worls they are bullied and harassed
I'm also ftm. I dunno is it weird that if I was a cis man, I'd wanna be a femboy, but as a trans man the thought of putting on a skirt just makes my blood boil with self hate?? *Trans confusion intensifies*

Maybe my thoughts will change after starting hormone treatment (or after surgery maybe?)

"""Facts don't care about your feelings."" -- My mom, a 'Republican', says this. And I don't think she gets how much it hurts even IF she isn't aiming it towards my LGBT / trans experience. Yet, I can't figure out WHY it hurts so much."	"My mom calls herself a ""conservative constitutionalist"" or something like that. She makes sure to remind me often. But of course, it's *my* generation that's obsessed with labels, right?

...Whatever.

Neverminding the hypocrisy, my 'Republican' mother has a tendency to always say ""well, facts don't care about your feelings"" when discussing politics. She says this to shut me down, to shut down whatever thing I'm trying to discuss, since I do have a tendency to lean more left than right when it comes to political things. I *hate* politics, but it is what it is.

She always says this, and it...hurts? I don't know why, but it does. It feels like she is not only attacking my beliefs as a more left-wing person, calling me emotional or somehow lesser than her ""logic"" mind, but also makes me feel fake. Makes me think that my identity, and my whole self, is fake, or wrong, or somehow bad.

Even if we aren't talking about LGBT or trans experiences or scenarios, she says that her ""facts don't care"" about my feelings, and I just feel gross as fuck. As if my own mother has somehow turned into Donald Trump or Ben Shapiro and is spewing disgust and hate at me.

I can't figure out why.

Sorry, I know this has, like, *nothing* to do with being trans. It may not belong on this sub and, so, I'll absolutely delete it if someone tells me to. I was just hoping someone here could help me figure out why I feel so nasty and ashamed about myself when she says this to me. I trust people here, and I'm scared of r/LGBT swallowing up the post (it's happened with most other posts I've made there as of late), so... Yeah. Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks."	"It's dismissive, it presumes that the other side cannot form a considered position.

They'll say this while conservatives have allowed decades of bunk economic theory and deregulation that has backfired spectacularly too.
Ben Shapiro: “trans women can’t be let in restrooms imagine how that would make “real women” would FEEL”

The facts don’t care about your feeling argument is bullshit for people who don’t care about real facts just how they can use them to put others down
The word ""facts"" can be interchanged with ""I"". It's just gaslighting. Sorry about her.
Funny thing about people who tell you that ""facts don't care about your feelings"" - their position is always based on their feelings, not the facts.

Unfortunately, that means that if you're being confronted with this particular thought-terminating cliche, there may not be much you can do about it. If you want to meet her where she is, the best place to start might be ""Ok, what are the facts then?"". This can often be quite revealing.
Literally stole that saying from the talking puppet Ben Shapiro! She can't even come up with her own bullshit.
I’d love to hear her “facts”. I can almost guarentee with a TINY amount of critical thinking and some source citing that her “facts” will reveal themselves as bs propaganda with no evidence to support them
A transgender person transitioning to their true self is the definition of freedom. Nothing more representative of our constitutional rights than that.
If you used that same ""conversation stopper"" on her whenever she spouted a bad opinion see how quickly the situation would change. Then she'd likely be demanding space and trying to force you to listen to it. It's not a real argument. It's a weird far-right power move.
Yeah and it's a fact that trans people are valid
she's right. facts don't care about feelings. good thing the facts are completely on your side. i know it hurts coming from your own mother, but i hope you can take solace in the fact that you're in the right and her 'facts' are the ones that are wrong.
She’s utilizing the inherent power-dynamic in that she is your mother to completely dismiss any and all facts you bring to the table, regardless of quality. The truth is, if you call her out on this, things will get ugly fast, but if you can overcome that, she will soon realize her idiocy and you’ll start to see her crumble. It’s the way conservatives function, sadly.
My family is conservative too and I feel they see things in black and white, can't read between the lines ornunderstand context, confuse correlation with causation, and claim to be about facts but they twist and interpret things(l (and even ignore things completely) to support their bigoted narratives. Lefties could also use the ""facts dont care about your feelings"" to criticize conservatives for their misunderstanding of racial and lgbtq issues for instance. It almost seems like at the core of who they are, they're just different. The way they perceive, analyze, and interpret things is different. 

When it comes to butting heads with my family, I don't know whether to laugh, be mad at them, or be sad at their ignorance and prejudice/bigotry.

Keep your head up.
My mum says the same and similar, I can't offer much advice, given I'm also very much stuck with this dilemma
Gonna be honest, none of us like the fact we support one side because the other wants us dead. I think dems suck but they aren’t trying to outlaw us
""Your facts are opinions, mom.""
Turns out facts don't care about her either. I had to let go of some of family during transition, and yes that hurts, but I would be hurting so much more if I was still fighting against myself.
Maybe becasue she's quoting a notoriously hateful transphobe, which means that his bigotry towards you isn't enough to discredit him in her opinion.
My friend said that to me and I sent her a super funny gif (i dont think i can send gifs here?). the gif was a gacha life trans shapiro saying ""facts dont care about your feelings but i do"".
This has everything to do with being trans. Your mother isn't honest enough to just say she personally doesn't like LGBT people or that she doesn't think your experience is valid, so instead she is claiming that no one's feelings matter and no one's feelings are valid. It's like how any facts that contradict Donald Trump's agenda are ""fake news"". If you discredit the validity of any news source, any personal experience, or any test of quality, then EVERYTHING is equally as real as the bullshit I just made up to suit my hateful agenda.
Invalidation is dehumanizing. 
Your feelings about being dehumanized are *valid*
It's just wrong anyways. I factually feel things, and therefore a fact cares about my feelings.
IF FACTS REALLY MATTERED TO REPUBLICANS THEY WOULDN'T BE REPUBLICANS

/drops mic
I think it has to do with being trans because your own mother is invalidating your gender identity. We're always here for you to vent to ❤️

Also, the irony of conservatives using that stupid phrase never fails to make me laugh/get angry at the same time. Conservative identity is now entirely cloaked in emotional, grievance laden identity politics that completely ignores reality and they project it so hard. It would be farcical if it wasn't fueling a huge fascist movement threatening to take over society.
Being dismissed and belittled by anyone is hurtful. Having a parent, who should love and support you do it, all the more so. Your feelings are perfectly valid and understandable.

I hope you are able to safely create some space between yourself and your mother.

It may also be a small comfort to remember that her politics and those of Shapiro and Trump are based almost entirely on feelings and a denial of facts.
I think this actually has a lot to do with being trans because this is a common argument to attack trans people. ""You are factually and biologically x so your feelings about gender don't make you y."" In reality though, these types of arguments are fallacies by nature because when you boil it down, it really means ""The facts that I agree with do not support your facts, therefore I will call your facts 'feelings' do make them seem arbitrary and petty so that I can dismiss your argument. Even if my facts are proven inaccurate, incorrect, or cherry-picked, I will maintain that my facts are true and yours are false because your argument doesn't align with my morals."" It's actually quite ironic because they rely on their feelings to choose their ""facts.""


Personally, I think that the idea of ""facts over feelings"" is entirely wrong. FEELINGS ARE FACTS. The way I feel about things is very real and tangible. It affects how I perceive the world and the choices I make. Same goes for every human. Ultimately, it's impossible to remove subjectivity perfectly. That's a side effect of being human. All facts and research aren't perfect divine truth, although some people delude themselves into thinking it is and that it cannot be refuted. In terms of gender identity, people can spew loads of outdated facts to try and prove you wrong. On a scientific level, their ""basic biology"" has been proven wrong already. On an emotional level, we know that gender is more than that. Your feelings about yourself, gender roles, and so much more can influence your identity. Ultimately your feelings on your gender or whatever else is fact. It's who you are and no amount of scientific research can change the essence of your being (although when done with as little bias as possible, research is a helpful tool.)


I think why you feel so disgusted by this argument even if it's not used against you in particular is because it's gaslighting. ""Your feelings aren't real but my facts are, and their superiority crushes your arguments."" It makes you question your sense of reality or feelings by pitting facts against you that are presented as perfectly objective, divine truth. It's painful because your feelings are real and it's painful to see this argument used against people like you that hold the same values, because in a way it insults you because it insults your shared values.


Thanks for asking this. It's a fascinating discussion that I have thought a lot about.
I truly don’t understand this post, you say this has nothing to do with being trans yet do you have a bunch of people that have commented to be on your side from the LGBTQ plus side of the fence, what did you say your feelings are only hurt because your mother’s politics, which is it?What is the actual issue here?

[deleted]
I feel like what would hurt about that is its your mom. Especially given that you said she says this to you alot. 

Maybe ""facts"" don't care about your feelings but like. Your literal mom Should care about them. Because you feelings do matter and moms are supposed to care about them. And I'd imagine after too many times of hearing that stupid Shapiro crap the message sounds a lot more like her saying ""~I~dont care about your feelings"" regardless of whether that's her intent.

My dad used to tell me all the time ""I really dont understand the whole trans thing but I support you."" And the first time it was sweet. But the fourth or fifth time I had to be like ""I know your emphasis is on the support and I appreciate that but the repetition of you telling me you don't understand is starting to hurt because it is starting to sound more like ""I will never understand you"".
The inventor of this phrase has also said in interviews that his entire world view starts from the premise that “god doesn’t make dumb rules” and so he sets out to find information that confirms his beliefs about god, in other words his _feelings_ about god dictate what he considers to be a “fact.” I’m sure the same is true for your mom. It’s a staggering sort of doublethink that makes these people especially hard to reason with. In truth, you’re much more likely to have effective communication if you abandon facts and reasoning and double down on the emotional aspects of things. Facts may not care, but as your mother _she_ should care, and if she doesn’t, you should make her answer as to why. I bet she’d be surprised to discover the answer for herself.
It’s belittling and dismissive of your feelings. A good response to “facts don’t care about your feelings” is “no but people do and we’re people, so can you stop treating me like this?” We as people care about feelings and if you tell your mom she’s making you feel gross and dumb and she doesn’t stop, then that’s not a person I would want in my life, mom or not. That’s a bad mentality to have imo
How does she feel about evolution?
Your mom sounds like a hardened sociopath and abuser. Move out, move on, move up.
“Yes, of course mom. And opinions are like assholes… everyone has one. And your’s stinks!”

Mic drop
what people reallly mean when they say this is “I don’t care about your feelings”
""Facts don't care about feelings"" is something I hear often from people who have hurt feelings. 

My response would be to say, your mom is not a fact, she's a person, and a mother. Is she saying she doesn't care about other people?!
Maybe because it's a lie, and it dismisses the possibility of a proper argument being formed by someone who is emotionally invested in what they're arguing for/against.

That simple phrase is pretty much one of the most unbelievably disrespectful phrases I have ever heard leave someone's mouth in my entire life. Every single group on the planet, uses their emotions to do ***literally everything***. Facts DO care about your feelings. Because if they didn't, we wouldn't care about the facts. We wouldn't *have* the facts.

And ironically, the people who say that phrase, are the ones driven by the most visceral emotions. Hatred, anger, and prejudice, are all seeped in emotion and 'feelings'. Your mother sounds like an impertinent cheeky little child who thinks she's cool simply for being contemptuous.
It sucks to know that someone we loved is so deeply bigoted. The marginalized people you love and admire and want to be like are amazing and you know that. She would dismiss them on looks alone (btw most of their “facts” are just bigoted feelings) and it sucks. There’s probably grieving in there too as you know that you will be letting go and spending less and less time with this bigot bc it’s bad for your mental and emotional health. You will probably have to create boundaries about the types of things you are willing to talk about with her but she won’t want to adhere and enforcing them will be exhausting. So lots of grief that this is the beginning of the end.
Idk if I should say anything as a non-American, your politics are none of  my business. 

Anyhow what I wanted to say, taken out of context and who and how said it, the statement ""facts don't care about your feelings"" is correct. There are some painful facts about the universe that we can't change (ex. Humans can't grow wings, hans why we won't ever fly. Sad but true no matter what you do). It's just, I think your mom's definition of what a ""fact"" is, is a bit warped.  Because of that I honestly don't think you should care much about what she says if she validates her point with that ""fact don't care ..."" because at this point are they really facts or she thinks they are. Take comfort in that and don't take it to heart. 

And you're not fake! Don't ever believe anyone who tells you that or something similar. Like how could they know, they don't feel what you feel.

 It's your right to want to feel comfortable mentally and physically and being trans only means that you'll have to work on it that little bit more. 

Ok, I'll let myself out now ... hope you'll feel better. 

Oh! And my proTip on how to deal with family/friends being negative toward transition. Just tell em that ""the moment YOU bleed and hurt when I accidently cut myself (I'm a chef) you officially get the right to tell me what to do with my body, until then please keep it to yourself"" it often helped me end any conversation aimed negatively towards my transition""
I'm sorry that your mom has such little respect for the people in her life and is so emotionally fragile that she feels the need to shut down any potentially conflicting perspective. It can be incredibly invalidating to you as a person and is without a doubt extremely rude and it's more than understandable that you'd feel hurt by this behavior.

People who say ""facts don't care about feelings"" though are so misguided, especially conservatives. If that's really what she believes then it creates some irreconcilable differences between her beliefs and reality.

If she is a ""constitutional originalist"" then she shouldn't vote, the founders of the nation never intended for women to vote, she should also be working to restrict the privilege to only white male landowners.

To be real here, conservatives are nonsense people who pick and choose things from the past to support in the present era while conveniently forgetting about the parts that would make them look bad or be unfavorable to them. Like they want to make our society *more* white supremacist but keep the current level of women's rights or maybe they want women to stay in the home instead of going out, but they still think women should be able to read and write. There is no actual consistency to what they ""believe."" I use believe loosely here, they don't actually believe anything they just support the positions other people tell them to.

And yes, facts don't care about feelings, they don't have endocrine or nervous systems, they don't ""care"" about *anything.* But when *people* say they don't care about *your* feelings they are making it abundantly obvious that they are disrespectful savages and don't care if people perceive them that way, in other words, they should be hidden from polite company because they are an embarrassment entirely by their own making.

Also regarding ""facts"" about trans issues, there is no such thing as a ""biological"" man or woman, we are all biological. These people accept that people are what they say they are unless they know otherwise, so unless someone is a masculine woman or a feminine man then they don't call into question their gender, they are perfectly happy to take their word for it without any kind of genetic testing.

People who say these things have most likely never had their sex chromosomes tested either so for all they know, by their own definition, they might be ""biologically"" the opposite sex to what they think they are because there are all kinds of anomalies that lead to people to develop sex organs opposite to what their sex chromosomes would otherwise have you think.

Something I read from another Redditor said it best: The best definition of a woman is a person who identifies as a woman, any other definition has multiple edge cases and is therefore less complete.
Well she is right however she needs apply that to herself conservatives don't use facts at all so to me it's a hypocritical statement coming from her. Depending on your  personality this might not be helpful but I'd take that statement to heart n flip it on her n her demonstrably false beliefs be it religious or constitutional.
I have autism and am extremely logical. I can't even recognize my own emotions. This has only made me more left wing... conservatives often lack the logic and facts they claim they have. Trans people's existence is well backed by science.
1) I am so sorry, this sounds so difficult. Much love. As your mom, *she* should care about your feelings, and she's repeating talking points that come from people who absolutely don't have your (or most people's) best interest in mind. Fuck that. I feel for you.

2) Entirely secondarily, if you actually want to know the politics behind conservative constitutionalism, Philosophy Tube has a great video on Amy Coney Barrett and ways the constitution is interpreted. But keep in mind you shouldn't have to know how to argue politics to be accepted and loved.
sure, facts dont care about anyones feelings, but a mother should ALWAYS care about the feelings of their child
Sounds like Ben shapiro
I often hear this from people right-leaning when they find out I'm trans and they call me a radical liberal. It's funny because I'm more right-leaning myself, the difference between us is that I am a decent human being that doesn't dehumanize people who suffer because of how our society is built. People will use so many excuses to justify their bigotry religion, their political standing, ""facts of nature"", and how they grew up. It's all bullshit made up by these people to not feel guilt when they knowingly and unknowingly hurt us and take away basic human rights. There is no excuse, they are just pieces of human garbage that need to self-reflect and get some help for themselves.
Zoe Bee does a pretty good job explaining why [facts DO care about our feelings.](https://youtu.be/E8ISzmBBTvo)  while it may not convince your mother (since Republicans are extremely on about their own feelings) but it may make you feel better about weathering her dismissive, passive aggressive language.
She saying that means she is a follower of Ben Shapiro, that's literally his catch phrase, I don't think there's too much saving your mom there. People think he is smart because of the way he speaks and says things so his followers would dismiss anything else cuz ""Shapiro speaks facts"" 

It hurts so much because she is not saying it directly to you but she is, because she is talking about LGBT stuff so inevitably she IS talking about your experience because it's included in the topic and she saying that invalidates how you feel and dismisses it

Tbh once you have the chance cut ties with your mom. Even if it's family? If it's harming you it's no worth having around
prob ben shapiro stan lmao
In basic terms it hurts because it is incredibly dumb and hardly ever actually refers to facts and humans want to know that we are loved and cared about (saying the thing that makes humans individuals doesn't matter is kinda opposed to being loved and cared about)
A line from Ben Shapiro, a man who famously struggles with facts and takes all his political beliefs straight from the Torah. A man who is most definitely projecting his insecurities, and I imagine most people who use that line are too
It always amuses me that the “facts don’t care about your feelings crowd” are the same people that; deny climate change, deny that racism was fundamentally built into pretty much all western governments, think they earth is 6000 years old and don’t believe scientists that vaccines work.

What they really mean is “my beliefs make me feel comfortable and protect me from admitting I’ve been complacent in systemic oppression and have been benefitting from privilege for years so I’m going to ignore you and everything you say because my feelings are more important than yours”. 

Fuck your mum, the FACTS are that most high level biologists are in agreement that sex and gender are two different things, that in all animals we have seen homosexual behaviour so clearly IT IS natural and that your feelings are just as valid and important as anyone else’s.
Go to a home man, it’s over with her. Get out of tthere
Ironically, it is said by the MOST anti-scientific faction in existence. Don't get me wrong, snowflakes exists both in left and right but it's only the right that considers snowflakes to be irreversably bad, because having feelings is a bad thing for them. Ironically, it's the same faction that dismisses other scientifically proven opinions because the don't ""feel like it's right"". Pay attention, in all the things they day it's always about what ""feels right"" and when she dismesses you by using that infamous quote it's because your point ""doesn't feel right"" to them. If they do this, you're right in 80% of the cases. They say ""facts don't care about your feelings"" but they mean it like ""my feelings doesn't care about your facts"", they just think that their feeling is always on the same level as a fact because they're too self important to think otherwise.
I’ll save you 5-10 years of therapy: your mom is an asshole.
I-i stumbled in this post and I look up. Lo and behold a copy of ""facts don't care about your feelings"" by ben Shapiro. I'm in my college library. Weird. But yeah you deserve recognition and love. Your mom sucks
Constitutionalist? Pursuit of happiness bitch
I actually love hearing this because conservatives are wrong all the fucking time, and you throw it back in their face every time.
My dad does this to me, and I’m pushing forty. He blames my college for making me liberal, says I don’t know what I’m talking about, and calls me crazy “just like your mom” when all else fails.

I’m sorry. It’s shitty.
The **fact** is, you ARE trans and you ARE her child. It's sad that parents are so insecure in themselves and are so indoctrinated to the right-wing cult that they are willing to to put their children at risk for the sake of imaginary brownie points in their political system.

That said facts also support LGBTQ+ experiences as they happen everywhere in nature. Did she also refuse the vaccine because of her ""feelings"" on the matter? Or does she reserve this stupid philosophy for *""the gays^™️""*
Regardless of the topic, it's clear there are underlying issues that are being used to justify turning you into a punching bag.  It has everything to do with toxic behavior. Shutting people down is actually a fear reaction--it's designed to force only one side of the conversation and at the same time revel in the feeling of 'winning' without having to risk the other person making you feel bad for treating them horribly.  It's one of the reasons we are seeing far-right people voicing absurdities and insisting they are 'facts' when said rhetoric doesn't hold up to reality.

I'm really sorry you have to go through this. In the US we have people so heavily polarized as to be indistinguishable from 'radicalized'.  I have a feeling you may be her most easily-accessible 'straw man' to project grievances upon and then argue with a version of you that she has created and which does not actually exist.

It hurts because you're a good person, and someone who matters to you has both become a toxic person and retreated into the idea that they are the better person.  The fact that you care and you need help to work through your feelings says a great deal more about your good qualities than anything else you may hear from mean people.
Beware the person who upholds cold logic as an ideal. Also facts get updated when additional data appears and is then subsequently analyzed. What do we call that? It's called LEARNING, a very very vital process by which all living organisms undertake in order to improve their odds of survival and proportion of the species. Which by the way, has no purpose other than the classic quote from Rick n Morty ""Well. I'm only here because he roped me into this."" It just is and those that don't simply ARENT represented. Attaching value judgements make the whole thing weird.

Anyway, ""Constitutional Conservative."" Is such a dumb statement to make and an oxymoron. The constitution is full of amendments, which are what? Changes. A conservative literally aims to keep things AS IS, which is both unproductive, stagnant and quite frankly, just so boring. Not even the good kind of boring. You know who else was a ""Constitutional Conservstive"" pretty much every Slave owner back in the day, and anyone who had even a remote chance of becoming one someday and thus felt they benefitted from the system in place. Worse as mentioned earlier it's an oxymoron. The constitution is essentially defined by all the changes made to it so that there is greater happiness, health and freedom for all. It isnt perfect and IT NEEDS WORK. Without those changes, the constitution remains stale and eventually useless for a society so far removed from the times in which it was written. Long way of saying, ""Constitutional conservstive"" means nothing and is just a slogan. Did she even bother reading the constitution? Studying and understanding it? Something tells me not. So. . . Eh.

What is wrong with being compassionate? Nothing. Fucking nothing. Without compassion and systemically enforced cooperation and kindness of others, most of these right wingers wouldn't have survived to adulthood.
Just because facts don't care about feelings doesn't imply that you should be unkind. Sure, you have the freedom of speech to state facts within certain contexts to hurt other people's feelings. The real question is why you want to do that? Very concerning that a parent would do this to their child. Surprising? Unfortunately not...
Probably hurts because it's a bullshit line used to shut you up. It doesn't even make sense the way conservatives use it because it's a fact that LGBT people have been around forever, etc etc, like if you actually dig into the things they say this about, it's the opposite. The adjust the facts to fit their feelings. Some More News has a whole episode on this, I think it's the Ben Shapiro centered episode. It's very good.
After reading a few of your replies to other comments, I think if I were in your situation my response next time might be, ""you wouldn't recognize a fact if it bitch-slapped you with a full-grown tuna.""

That'll almost definitely start a fight, though, so use with care if at all.

If she wants to be a dismissive cunt, she can't well complain if you dismiss her right back.
My dad says this, that liberals make choices based on their feelings and conservatives on logic, and it just screams to me that he doesnt really understand politics and would rather attack the competence of the other side
That makes sense. Okay. That's what I was thinking, too, but I just couldn't put my finger on it exactly. It really *does* feel debasing in the weirdest and worst way, to be honest. At least, for me, it does...
Because they don't actually care about or believe in ""facts.""

Present them with facts that don't match their view, and they will cough up ""alternative facts."" That phrase is just as dystopian as it sounds, it's a literal attack on truth.

They also don't believe in discourse. They will throw ""facts"" at you as if they were stones and then tell you you just have to take it.

Damn it’s almost like considering trans people not real woman or real men is a feeling not a fact thus making atleast one of those statements a non sense argument thus in turn collapsing shapiros entire argument but we will leave that be
Oh, is it? She usually gaslights, so I guess that's why I couldn't really tell... Makes sense. Thanks for the help.
I *have* told her, actually, that all facts are either based in opinion / feelings, or on hunches, which are usually spurred on by passion, a feeling. *Everything* is seemingly based in feeling and emotion. Yet, she still says this. She said that was an ""interesting take"", but she still says that statement...

I've also asked, once, about her facts, and she began shoving very skewed, very right-leaning statistics towards me. Sometimes even citing FOX as a source. She has it on in the background nonstop, anyways, so I guess that makes sense, sadly. 

Regardless, thanks for helping me figure this out. I appreciate it.
Not only that, but more often than not their feelings don't care about facts.
Okay that's what I thought! It sounded familiar but I actively avoid, like, almost all politics so I couldn't pinpoint it. God, that feels gross...
Actually, she *does* do that, now that you mention it.

She's allowed to say really intense and opinionated things, allowed to get heated. But the moment I start to, she says something like, ""I don't want to turn this into a fight."" Or, ""Okay, we need to stop. Because you're getting upset and that's not my intention.""

It *is* a little frustrating that she is allowed to demand such space and breathing room the moment things go the opposite of her way, yet I'm now able to ask for the same.
Precisely my political stance, really. I've basically told her, ""I'm going to vote for the person that will keep me alive.""

And she, apparently, voted for the man that wanted me dead...

Ah. That just hit me. Ouch.
Eh, that's fine with me, personally. I've done that before. Doesn't really hurt so much as it's a nuisance to me haha.

Though, she genuinely *is* a nice person to me. Not sure if I'll cut her out or just get some distance. Thing is, is that she's said that she'd die if I hated her. And I don't. I just dislike her political stances, not her as a person.

Thanks for the advice!
True. That *does* always suck to think about. But, in her credit, she said she turns him off when he starts talking about LGBT things or trans people.
I literally said that I know this has nothing to do with being trans. ...Did you read the entire post?

 People are helping me figure out why my mom's saying makes me, a trans person, feel bad and invalid. That's it.

TL;DR from my post...

> ""Sorry, I know this has, like, *nothing* to do with being trans. It may not belong on this sub and, so, I'll absolutely delete it if someone tells me to. I was just hoping someone here could help me figure out why I feel so nasty and ashamed about myself when she says this to me. I trust people here, and I'm scared of r/LGBT swallowing up the post (it's happened with most other posts I've made there as of late), so... Yeah. Anyone have any ideas?""

It also feels bad because we actually do have facts on our side that go against the conservative narrative. We have large collections of data and research that just get hand-waved away because some think tank has been waving around a debunked study published in a sub-par scientific journal that supports their position.
Ben Shapiro is a clown

Also he only seems like he’s good at debates because he only post ones where he wins by arguing agains unprepared college students by using irrelevant data and or lies
100% is gaslighting. The irony is you could send people like this 17 pages of scientific evidence, FACTS, if you will, and they will blindly deny it because it doesn't line up with their political opinions (FEELINGS) 🤔
Hm, that approach seems to suggest that you don't believe objective facts exist. That seems like it would play into her convictions that she has the ""facts"" and you just have feelings. There is such a thing as objective facts, but people often confuse facts, deductions based on those facts, and outright lies.

Depends how much work you're willing to do for what's honestly unlikely to get a result, but there is a way you might be able to push her to be a little bit more honest with herself. She gives an opinion, you ask ""What facts are you basing that opinion on?"". She gives you the ""facts"", and you ask ""And if you found out that those things weren't true, would you change your mind?"".

If she says no, conversation over, she's just demonstrated that she doesn't actually care what the facts are. If she says yes, agree ahead of time what information would show the ""fact"" isn't true. Then give her that information.

Honestly? Probably not worth it.
Much snappier, can I steal this for next time?
I wish I could avoid it. Haha .... I'm sorry you have to deal with that. She's just parroting the nonsense bigotry going around. To me it's always impressive that they take their opinion as ""fact"" as if, your own real lived experience isn't ""fact"". 
Or you know, the mountains of medical literature supporting trans folk's existence and treatment. 
You're valid!
Harder to be friends with republicans when you realize that 😅
Uhhhhhh…….
Good robot
Aaaaah, too bad. Some anti-lgbt nutjobs are very religious and get mad about evolution. Then they suddenly don't care about fact anymore. But there a probably some other facts that offend her. Just a little bit of trolling
Yeah. Like, I've got plenty of facts - both LGBT-oriented or not - that I will try and utilize, and it's always shut down by these angry, spiteful people. People that say my facts are fake or, well, what my mom says. So damn frustrating.

I think it could be worth it, if OP is willing to do the digging to get the data behind objective facts, these could be used to help reform their mothers opinions. 

Could easily settle a dispute if OP's mother is not interested in objective facts, then the whole ""facts over feelings"" argument is nullified.
Cannot steal that which is freely given!  💜

Have a blast with it.
You know, I've always tried not to get my hands dirty, tried not to choose a side and, therefore, possibly hurt people. I always said something like, ""Anybody can be friends with anybody. Why does it have to boil down to politics?""

But you're right.

It *is* hard to be friends with those that sympathize with men that want me dead.

I think I *want* to choose a side, now. I *want* my hands dirty. And I'm tired of saying that those people are my friends when they aren't, and I'm tired of giving them a chance when they would never extend the same courtesy to me.
Chill with the snark, OP explained themselves pretty clearly
Sorry, did I do something wrong? I'm so confused lmao.

I've just started saying it back to them when they start denying facts. They are right in a way, the truth value of facts doesn't care about feelings, but they are the ones being counterfactual.

Facts can also relate to feelings, and feelings are as real as any other part of a human, like our bones. They are systems within our bodies; like any other biological system. The truth value of a fact does not care about one's feelings the same way the truth value of a fact does not care about stomach pain: Someone's pain does not change reality, intentionally ignoring, and especially causing, someone's stomach pain during an otherwise good-faith disagreement still makes the person doing it a jerk.

The facts are on our side, but they 'feel' the facts are wrong. Well, facts don't care about their feelings.
Idk I think both sides of the political aisle cherry pick which data they want to bring in any argument but especially when it comes to cultural issues unfortunately that probably won't change because nobody wants to admit they are wrong or change their mind
The reason I'm skeptical is that the kind of person who believes that ""facts don't care about your feelings"" is a convincing argument usually isn't the kind of person who 

1. Can point to the facts their opinions are based on, or
2. Does a mental double-take when you demonstrate that their ideas are not logically internally consistent

It's a political slogan, not an honest statement of how they approach the world.
Much obliged <3
It’s hard. We gotta choose a side, because sitting down means taking whatever they decide is fair
It is unfortunate that that is the way things have to be. But welcome to the front lines In the war against trans and other LGBTQIA+ people. We've got your back.  And always remember that just because someone gave birth to you does not mean you owe them anything.. Whether that be sympathy loyalty or even a single thought in your head.

 And also remember, the oft misquoted Line ""blood is thicker than water"" is actually fully as follows: "" the blood of the battlefield is thicker than the water of the womb"" i hope you can get away from your mother as soon as possible.
You’re doing the right thing.
Idc….. Like your opinion but it’s not what I read ,in fact…. it’s complete contrary. Chill yourself‼️
Nah, you're good. I can't make any sense of this either.
No
This is true, though disappointing.. I guess this is the whole ""post-truth"" thing. 

imho, I would still consider it worth an attempt to use reason and logic, so long as it is not going to endanger OP in any way. Just in case that it would generate a double take. Though I would imagine it is probable that the effort will be futile.

Was i in the wrong for wearing my trans pin	"   I was waiting outside my classroom today and this boy in my year (who i never talk to btw) came up to me and straight up interrogated me with:
‘Are you a guy’ ‘are you a girl’ ‘thats a transgender badge isnt it?’ ‘What are you’ ‘so do you not have a gender?’

   Questions along those lines, i answered with really vague answers, mostly ‘idk’ and ‘sure’. I’m not out yet, and I don’t necessarily like it when someone just comes up and asks me about my gender identity etc. should i take my pin off? Did i have it coming?"	"If this is someone you don't regularly interact with, the proper answer (IMHO) to any of those questions is ""None of your business.""

You wear whatever pin you want.
Its not a proper pin btw, its beads on a safety pin, if that matters
This is kind of a two-fold issue. So, for one, (at least in my eyes) wearing a trans flag and/or colours (or any type of pride themed wear for that matter) kind of makes you a target , either for hate, questioning etc. 

On the other hand, the other person approached (created) the situation in a very poor manner. They should not have been grilling you about things you may not necessarily want to share. Giving short answers is a dead giveaway that ""I don't want to talk about this"" which they may have either been ignorant to or just didn't care.

Now, am I saying you were in the wrong? Of course not! Wear whatever you want (I mean, as long as it's occasion appropriate). While I don't have any trans themed jewelry (as any place around me doesnt seem to carry much trans specific stuff), I do have a heart with the pride flag on my necklace, and I paint my nails the trans colors. This being said, I realize that this may start making people...curious (for use of a light term), and (I hope) I'm prepared for these events. 

So overall the other person was definitely in the wrong 100%, but just keep in mind that wearing that kind of stuff also will prompt people to become curious, and can potentially instigate people to start asking questions...or worse. That being said, we shouldn't be ashamed of who we are, and shouldn't let what others think dictate how we are supposed to present ourselves, as that puts us back to square one.

Wish you all the best! 💜
No way are you wrong for something he did! You choose who you interact with. It's never out of line to ask someone to leave you alone if you want to be left alone.
was he being aggressive or curious?

if you're not ready to come out then say you're wearing to support trans people.
Why do you wear your pin? 
Some people use it to invite conversation. Sometimes it's to say your part of a group without saying it aloud. Some use it to show support for friends or to meet new friends. 

You can wear whatever you want for whatever reason. You don't owe anyone anything. And you're always allowed to tell someone you'd rather not talk about it. If they pressure you then they are in the wrong.
He sound like an ass, don’t talk to him, keep yer pin
Ask him, ""*why are you asking? Live your life and I'll live mine...*"" or something like that. We don't owe anyone an explanation for existing.
Honestly if I ever saw someone wearing a lgbt type pin I just wave at em a move along with my day it’s none of my business to know if they’re a part of the community or an ally
You’re definitely not in the wrong. No one should be badgering someone like that regardless of the pin they’re wearing. Hope you’re doing okay <3
Props to you for trying to be yourself in such a hostile environment!

I'm an adult that has painted nails and wears a beaded bracelet with the colours of the Trans flag - yet it seems like the other adults don't really care?? At worst some ugly guy will stare at me for an extra second longer trying not to overheat from the rage, but that's very rare.

You've done nothing wrong, the boy was being a dickhead. 

Next time it happens just say ""none of your business"" and walk away.
no, as long as you aren't doing it to make the community the butt of some messed up joke (which i highly doubt you were) wear whatever flag or pin you want, if someone asks and you aren't ready to come out just tell them its none of their business (because it isn't) or say that youre supporting the trans community
Of course you’re not in the wrong
You were not in the wrong. He needs to mind his own.
Not ""in the wrong"" —but think strategically. Do you want to be visible and engage in conversations on gender, even when (like this one) the other person has bad intentions?
Maybe this might be better further along in your transition?
Honestly if they weren't being malicious, they might just be curious or genuinely wanting to know more about you or being trans, and while that definitely isn't your job to educate everyone, or share things about yourself, wearing a pin is associated with being proud of your identity and while it might not be the way it SHOULD work, it'll definitely invite more questions in future, 

I strongly disagree with the comments telling you to   just tell them 'its none of your business'. Because you are putting something on that invites questions, and being abrasive just hurts you socially and doesn't educate anyone, 

It honestly just feels like a clumsy way of asking for your pronouns.
>Did i have it coming?

Not at all. Nobody deserves to be interrogated like that out of the blue.
""fuck off"" is a full sentence!
While wearing a pin can be seen as an invite to a conversation, that guy was incredibly rude about it, and he was entirely in the wrong. The standard way to start a pin-related conversation is ""hey, nice pin"", which lets the person wearing the pin decide if they want to just to say ""thanks"" and move on, or if they want to have a more involved conversation about gender/trans-ness. In the future, you can just say ""I'm wearing it to support a friend"", and ""none of your business"" if more questions are forthcoming.
NO.
No you are not in the wrong.
No. No. No.

This little sh*t of a person clearly finds some sort of enjoyment in being a little sh*t. They might have their own issues going on, and they might have an element of genuine question, but it's not ok and this kid needs to learn to be a better human.

No. You are not in the wrong. Don't ever think you are, for being you, and the only exception is if you are causing harm to others (like, if you enjoy punching folks or whatever, no way in hell am I talking about sh*tty folk who cry that seeing people happy in themselves hurts them).

Just no.

Sadly, being visible can come with safety issues, but again, that is never your fault. You are a victim of harassment by this person, period.
You didn't do anything wrong, but you need to be aware that sporting any kind of pride apparel could lead to you being outed against your will. Nobody wants that to happen to them and it could be very dangerous, depending on your circumstances. 

It also opens you up to discussions around gender which you might not be equipped to deal with yet if you're still questioning and figuring stuff out. Having those kind of discussions with supportive, trusted people could be really helpful, but opening yourself up to the blatant ignorance and downright hostility of the general population is incredibly risky for your well-being at this stage of your self discovery, and probably not very helpful for anyone else either (ignorant people want black and white answers which you can't yet give them, and malicious people want material they can use against you, which any kind of uncertainty just feeds)

Do what makes you happy but please consider your safety as well. A good compromise might be only wearing your pin when you're hanging out with people you trust.
Under ANY circumstances, the answer is no, you're not wrong. You just experienced bigotry. You are not to blame.
The thing is if they are being rude about it, then it's often best to just be careful as some people look to initiate conflict or bully. I'd just say if they are going to be rude about it, then it isn't any of their business and that's it's a pin and you can wear whatever pins you like without being rude. 

I wear a Dog tag which people can see with the trans flag imprinted very clearly on it. If people don't agree I deal with it appropriately, just that giving them fuel to escalate is the one thing that's important.  But yeah, if they are rude, it's none of their business, just don't let people like that make you feel intimidated, that's what they want.
Honestly, depending on where you are, report that to the teachers or school. If the school is a safe place or atleast recognizes trans students as students, they should step in and educate the aggressor on proper behavior to not be such a problem.
I had a similar thing. I have a teeny trans pin on my bag and some girl I never talk to did the same thing. Lucky I hate her, otherwise I wouldn’t have told her to f*ck off. I hate peoples who do that so much. Just pronouns will do you thanks
Honestly dude I believe in don’t watch what you wear teach others not to stare kinda mentality so you wear what ever pins you want to
Due to personal history, I'd be more than willing to explain my history with gender identity to most ppl at this point. I NEVER felt safe with anyone, and the few times I thought I had an 'expert' I didn't know how to ask questions in a 'polite fashion' so people who heard usually thought I was trying to parrot my stepdad or my biological parents, but I DESPERATELY needed someone to talk to. Don't indulge him if he is a bigot, but ask him why he wants to know if he bothers you again. If he points to you, that's not answering the question. I've seen people get flustered from that why, he may not have anyone to talk to. The internet is a powerful tool, but reading only does so much.
Now unless the other person was literally grilling you (sometimes it can feel that way when really the person was just curious and possibly nervous but if you say they were grilling you then they were) but if they were just asking questions to understand I don’t think either of you did anything wrong it’s okay to be curious but it’s also okay to keep your privacy and refuse to answer 😁
I think... even though you two don't have any business you have it a bit coming that someone asks if you are trans. So what I thought about saying to this person would be. ""I'm not outed yet I'm not comfortable talking about it. Can you please drop it.""
I think its a bit fifty fifty... to be honest it's really brave to wear a trans pin and yea well...
In my grade no one does it even though a in closet-trans dude wears it.... but really depends on people in your grade.
If im seeing it wrong please tell me.
On the one hand, the trans flag is not a symbol for allies to present; presenting it shows that you are trans yourself. But that doesn't mean that it's in any way less fucked up to just interrogate you like that. Politely asking once what your gender is and accepting when there's no clear answer is what a curious ally would do. But people don't have a ""right"" to know what your gender is. As long as they can refer to you in some way, you're just a person an anything else is optional.
I had to hide my trans pride cup and lanyard covered with pride pins at work. Most emps are great but customers are horrible…
NO!!!!! Never allow anyone to force you to come out. Because it is you who decides what you want to be, no matter what society says!!!!
do whatever makes you feel comfortable, if wearing it makes you happy wear it!  if not don’t, that’s ok too!  it’s really none of anyone else’s business and if you don’t want to talk to someone you don’t have too.  you are your own person :)
kill
Wear pins you want, none of anyones business what you want in life.
Definitely not in the wrong, you really shouldn't be getting interrogated just for wearing a trans colored pin.
I'd just say I support them. The rest isn't really their buissiness.
You don't owe anyone an explanation. Tell people like this to f*ck off, and if they don't, then use farce and sarcasm to make them look ignorant.
you dont need to tell anyone anything about yourself you font want to, although the pin would probably bring up some questions like these sometimes and you should be aware of that, you should keep on wearing it and being proud :D
Based on title? No.
You are not in the wrong I have to deal with on the daily at school I'll get questioned like why do you ant to be a man so much why do you still like dresses and skirts if you want to be a man so much and I simply answer because I can and it's none of your business
I thought that safety pins with the trans colors on it means that the person wearing it is someone safe for a trans person to approach to ask for help dealing with transphobic people in public.
It doesn't fucking matter one bit. You have a right to exist how you want. Unfortunately some cowardly people will see you as someone to pick on. Just remember, that you don't have to answer to anyone about who you are if you choose not to.
The line of questioning doesn’t strike me as merely curious and even if it was, it was still inappropriate. Wearing a trans pin doesn’t mean you don’t have boundaries that need to be respected. I’m sure you know this, so my response isn’t aimed at you directly. 🙂
I think a lot of people here are giving you some terminally online advice for how to deal with this, like ""THEY'RE 100% IN THE WRONG!! NOBODY SHOULD DO THAT, YOU LIVE YOU, THEY'RE JUST AN ASSHOLE, PEOPLE SHOULDN'T DO THAT"" 

But that avoids that overwhelming fact that it will invite attention and questions. 

if that's causing you anxiety and you GENUINELY don't want to be questioned about it, don't wear the pin. 

but if you want to wear it, be prepared with a standard answer/excuse, and I can't stress this enough NOT A STAND-OFFISH ABRASIVE ONE LIKE ""mind your own business"" because that's just going to invite hate and bigger problems.
I straight up have a mask with the trans flag on it. I wear this shit with the most pride and confidence to make anyone like me feel welcomed and more confident about themselves.
although if he was just asking out of curiosity not hate, i agree with what another poster already said and maybe just tell him you are wearing it to support the trans community.  no reason to be rude, but he also has no right to know everything about you.  anyway good luck!
😈
Oh yeah i forgot about that
That's a thing??
I made pins from beads woven into pride flags, and threaded into safety pins because they don't slip away, and because it's also a ""punk-ish"" thing and my big ole thrasher ass tends to like that sort of stuff xD But this is the first time I heard about this also being a different kind of code.
You’re absolutely correct! That’s exactly what it means 😘
I think it’s a punk thing. I don’t know too much about it but from the few punk friends I’ve had over the years there’s a code that the punk subculture uses using pins and such on their clothing.
Yep, I remember it from in the 80's in highschool. Didn't know if that was still a thing or not now.
Very much is. I am kind of a mom to a punk squat full of early transition trans people a few blocks from me. I'm not much but i check in on them, bring them food and im another place to crash if they can't find home and can find me."	xutqyz	trans	363	0.98	2022-10-03 20:00:00
just got in a fight with my dad who claims he’s not transphobic	"my dad just yelled at me for being upset about him defending jk rowlings transphobia and then told me to stfu cus he was talking to “his son” (my brother, for reference i identity as male) towards the end of the argument he started to defend terfs as a whole and said that im “being unfair by not understanding their point of view.” He’s literally never stood up for womens rights or even mentioned it, only when it also includes being transphobic. He also misgendered caitlyn jenner multiple times, no matter how many times I corrected him. He’s never gendered me correctly and has only used my real name a couple times. 



update: just fully got disowned by him and am now living with my mom"	"Not to be that person but I think your dad is a lost cause. Hope you can move out soon.
Yeah get outta there and never speak to him again. If he ever misgenders yyou, misgender him right back.

“You’re being unfair by not understanding their view” yes the people who hate my existence and don’t think I should exist ah yes I love to understand their view I think he just sounds upset he can’t be properly transphobic else he will look like a bad parent 

Also f jk Rowling like just screw her
im hopefully gonna go live with my mom soon, shes much more supportive and just way nicer overall. However the area she lives in is very dangerous and she never really leaves the house, plus i do online school so I never have anything to do when im there which Ive noticed is really bad for my mental health. So i have to choose between this shit or sitting in my room bored and dissociated out of my mind everyday.
I don't understand why this is always what people say, some people don't have the resources to just get out and cut people off
Is it unsafe for lgbt or just unsafe in general? There may be a way to cope depending on the answer that'll help living with her
I meant get out when you are able to.
unsafe in general. Lots of gangs/gun violence/crime/drugs and shit.
Oooof thats unfortunate, while its not a perfect solution there is at least the internet but I totally understand being home all the time gets old pretty fast and even with internet it gets lonely, I wish you the best of luck <3"	tcwwyz	trans	365	0.98	2022-03-13 02:25:15
Was just banned from using the women's and men's restroom at school	"Someone reported a ""concern"" over me using the girl's bathroom. I am nonbinary and I go by she/they. It was always fine for me using the bathroom when I wear skirts and act ultra feminine, but the one day i go to school with pants on its like my identity isnt valid anymore. I need advice on how to deal with this please. The principal said I am unable to use the mens or womens restroom and am now only able to use the trans bathroom at the nurses office. I am male in their system, i dont identify as male, I feel extremely uncomfortable in the mens restroom so I use the womens because thats where my identity lays at."	"Does anyone have legal expertise here? This seems like it shouldn't be allowed, but I know things can vary by state.

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this nightmare of a principal.
is this public school or private? what state?

also side note, I am disgusted by how they are treating you.  literally disgusted.  this is a total injustice. sending you power and fabulousness xoxo
I actually wouldn’t mind my own personal bathroom to be honest lol. But yeah I understand how you feel. Stay strong.
Maybe check this out: https://transgenderlegal.org/
If you're in the US you contact a lawyer, because the rules will vary by state.  I think it's patently unreasonable that you're not allowed to use either the women's or the men's restrooms.
Tell them to get fucked and just use the restroom you want. What are they going to do? Monitor your bathroom visits?
Okay, so you are legally allowed to use the bathroom that matches your gender identity ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G.\_v.\_Gloucester\_County\_School\_Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G._v._Gloucester_County_School_Board)). They can provide you with a separate transgender bathroom but that also is not legal since that is the definition of separate but equal (which has been ruled unconstitutional). If you contact the ACLU, they will likely take the case. Two trans men who go to high school in my former school district are suing the school corporation (with the help of the ACLU) for an almost identical situation.

&#x200B;

Edit: If you are outside the US, disregard this. I have little to no legal knowledge of trans rights outside the US

&#x200B;

Second Edit: What I said applies to public institutions - I am not sure of the law for private institutions.
Piss in the corridors

Do you have some form of student representation? You can talk to your class rep or to female students to get their support for this. When you have a teacher you Trust you can talk to them. When you trust your parents you can ask them for help. Talk to other people at your school and explain the problem. It is much easyer to fight a school when you are not alone.

OP, look at this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/s3hfnr/was_just_banned_from_using_the_womens_and_mens/hslgk4i?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
sue them
That is actually illegal and discriminatory you can stand up to that and if it doesn’t get better you can report them to the district
Thought the supreme court settled that this is grossly illegal atleast for public institutions
I believe this is illegal federally in the US. Check out the White House Transgender handbook. All schools got it, but most haven't even looked at it.

My district refused to change my name in applications like Canvas and stuff, as well as in attendance sheets, which could lead to me getting outed. Under Title IX, that was considered discrimination, because they only refused since I was trans. I believe Title IX will also apply in this case, regardless of the state.

OP, do a bit of research and bring it to your district's Title IX coordinator. They legally have to have one. If they discount your research, threaten to get a lawyer involved, and don't be afraid to follow through. You can also threaten to take it to the media, but if you live in a more conservative area, that might cause more damage. This is illegal, and it's discrimination.
It does not vary by state. The supreme court ruled on this in 2020 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G.\_v.\_Gloucester\_County\_School\_Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G._v._Gloucester_County_School_Board)). This decision basically means that gender identity is protected under Title IX.
Sadly since they're already getting complaints they'd probably be punished if it went on.
This is a Supreme Court hearing, not a law. There is no law saying that trans people can use the bathrooms of their choice. In this case, they ruled title nine covered his right to use the males restroom, but that’s because he had his gender marker changed to male and they still did not let him use the men’s restroom, not because he identified as male and chose to use the men’s restroom. What I’m saying is suing the school is not a guaranteed win because of how many factors come into play with states laws and such.
**[G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G._v._Gloucester_County_School_Board)** 
 
 >G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board is a case dealing with transgender rights. The case involves a transgender Virginia student who presented as male while in high school, who had sued the local school board for being forced to use women's restrooms based on his assigned gender under their policy. While the Fourth Circuit had found in favor of the student based on Obama administration policy related to Title IX protections, the election of Donald Trump changed the underlying policy, forcing a pending hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States to be vacated and the case retried at the lower courts.

But also possibly humiliating because the nurses bathroom is likely very out of the way. It would be one thing if gender neutral bathrooms were everywhere at their school.
Nah, not true. Red states usually have laws against this. In Texas, for example, it’s illegal for someone to use the bathroom that doesn’t align with their birth certificate. Title Nine makes it possible exception to said law, but if taken to court it’ll most likely go to the red side. In the end, to give good legal advice, we’d need to know their state, to see how they expand on title nine, and her city/school to see their title nine policy as well. Most will show this on the school districts website and even have the staff member in charge of title nine at their school to contact.
Thanks so much for your response! So many ridiculous things are allowed in so many states it's hard to keep track of which of our rights are actually protected.
Getting punished makes for good lawsuits and media attention.
Eh. I guess you have a point.
Title IX is the legal force that gives trans people the right to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. This is confirmed here [https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity)
Why are you misgendering op?
[deleted]
So my understanding is that the state courts might go the red side but you can appeal your way up to a federal court which will ensure the protection of trans folk using the bathroom that aligns with their gender. Is this not the case?
This is a kid. Lawsuits and media probably aren't their priority, my guess is they probably just want to live their life with as little hassle from transphobic shitbirds as possible.
Good point!
That’s talking about Biden’s executive order. Executive orders are also not laws, they’re more so suggestions for the executive branch and does not apply to states.
I was talking about the guy in the Supreme Court case, not op.
OP (she/they) should not have to use a trans specific bathroom if they don't want too though.
This is a state issue. The states have all the same protections as the federal laws have. It’s not a matter of the national laws will protect you but not the states. Title nine doesn’t directly say trans people can use the restrooms they identify with, so it’s left up to the states to decide that. Most red states leave it to the gender marker. The federal government will not interfere (with exceptions of Supreme Court cases).
We all do.

But if situations like this happen the transphobe  needs to be dealt with. Going the legal/public route is actually  the safest and most kind to the transphobe.
Yeah, upon further reading of that article I agree with that (made the mistake of reading the title, posting and then reading the article lol). However, Title IX is a law and since trans folk are protected under Title IX, I still believe a lawsuit is a more than viable option.
Okay sorry for the missunderstanding
[deleted]
So all of that makes sense, except there was a supreme court case that specifically said title nine covers not only sex but gender identity and sexual orientation as well. For example, North Carolina was told by the federal government that the North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act was in violation of Title IX and they were not to implement it. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_identity\_under\_Title\_IX#North\_Carolina's\_Public\_Facilities\_Privacy\_&\_Security\_Act\_(HB2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_under_Title_IX#North_Carolina's_Public_Facilities_Privacy_&_Security_Act_(HB2))). This was before the supreme court ruled on G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board which is what solidified protection for trans folk under title IX.
It really just depends on the situation, the gender marker, the state, and their bathroom laws. All I’m saying is itd be irresponsible to say it’s a sure win because of x laws, because it’s a fact no federal law in the United States gives trans people the right to use the restroom of their choice. Just sharing my experience with my school and the interpretation of title nine in red states (I’m from Texas).
Yo, uh pulling the whole ""It CoUlD bE wOrSe"" shtick is kinda a bad look. When you tell someone it could be worse all you're doing is telling them that they shouldn't feel bad because it could be worse. But like...duh we all know it could be worse. I could be a starving orphan in a war torn country. But how is the knowledge that one is not suffering from something supposed to help them with what they're actually suffering from? Saying ""it could be worse"" is just net-neutral at best and makes one feel pathetic because they don't have a """"""""real reason"""""""" to feel bad at worst. Like I get you're just trying to help so don't think I'm trying to shame you or w/e just yanno if you are here to help that aint the way to go about it yanno?
That's totally fair. Let me rephrase my original statement then to say, contact your state's ACLU and get their legal advice. I have reached out to a good friend of mine who is in law school at Washington University (focusing on lgbtq issues) and will see if she has any thoughts or comments on this since I am definitely not a legal expert or anything.
The Supreme Court rulings act as a precedence to law as well. It is the reason why many states who previously refused same sex marriage now have to accept them, because of the supreme court rulings.

The Supreme Court’s job is to interpret the Constitution and to protect the interests of the people by overruling any state or federal laws that violate Constitutional rights. And as a result, no one goes over them over risk of facing consequences for violating the rulings."	s3hfnr	trans	364	0.99	2022-01-14 02:59:00
Hey, I’m mtf trans from Ukraine, and I’ve been feeling euphoric recently. I used to live a double life and hide my identity a lot, but I came out publicly on my social medias a few days ago (I have different fears now lol) aaand: I received just acceptance and support! I guess I’m *open* now :)		"Portrait by my partner 🖤
Welcome to the sunlight! May it nurture and fuel your growth!🌻
I am so proud of you!!! Stay safe and stay strong sister 🙌❤❤
Fellow Ukrainian mtf, neat :] That's good to hear! hoping I'm able to come out and have an acceptable surrounding one day
I love the background!! The flag's colors look so natural, but it also pops really well! And of course the portrait is super lovely too!
Congrats!!
I'm so proud of you dear stay safe.
I love the portrait. Stay strong!
Be safe good luck to you 👍
🖤 it’s honestly so much easier to be is a sunlight!
Thanks 🖤🖤 I’m staying safe

😃 this was so validating		"Very validating indeed. Thanks for posting it! ❤
That was lovely to read!

I used to wish that someday I would be seen and validated as a woman by cis women, but I've mostly given up on that. These days I tend to lean more heavily on the nonbinary aspects of my identity, because that seems easier for the people in my life to accept.

anybody struggling with the idea of not being gay anymore?	i’ve identified as a gay man for most of my life (12-19) and only recently started identifying as transfem. im pretty much only attracted to men and masc non binary people. i think one of the main things holding me back from socially transitioning is being perceived as straight. gay has been such a huge part of my identity for so long and i don’t think im ready to leave it behind. i literally have a gay tattoo.	"Oh my god I totally get it. I struggled so much after starting my transition to not only stop referring to myself as the wrong gender but also not call myself gay. And then I hated the fact I was straight for a while. Then a hot girl came along and blew that out of the water and I was like “maybe I’m bi” so that’s my joirney
youre trans now
so youre just replacing one queer label with another
I think this is super common. It’s regularly discussed among trans men, at least. Being a straight trans woman doesn’t make you any less queer unless you want it to.
Yeah ive been a lesbian since i was 10 and it feels weird being a gay guy not a lesbo. I guess im still gay but its still freaky asf
Honestly. I only identified as a bi man during my teens because I figured it would be easier to be accepted by my family as a bi man than a trans woman. However after spending years in the “cis” gay culture, it’s just so disgustingly toxic so I’m not too ashamed of being perceived as straight if I do date a man. I’m not saying the entire cis male gay culture is awful but here in Oregon, US it is
I came out as a gay male about 20 years ago.  I didn't feel gay, but I sure as hell wasn't a straight male.  It was pretty much my way of testing out the coming out process in a place and time where nobody was transgender, but gay was starting to be somewhat accepted.  I was attracted to men, but it didn't take me long to figure out that I wasn't attracted to gay men.  I still love the gay men and have many as close friends, and they have helped me as I've come out as trans.

I get that you also aren't gay, but that's still a part of your life that helped you overcome challenges and be who you are today.  Embrace that!
Idk if this will help but gay has also kinda become a catch all it doesn’t just have to mean mlm also you said you like masculine people you could identify as pan but prefer masculine people ya know
I struggle with all of a sudden liking men too.
I kinda get that feeling of hoping hrt will make me like girls more too 😂 I’m still heavy on the gay 🌽 tho tbh —- but I have been open to more feminine presenting people and it’s been refreshing
i’ve been struggling with the same thing but with now being able to more closely identify with the lesbian label? it doesn’t feel like i’m worthy of identifying as a lesbian
I’m pan so I’ve never experienced this but that sounds rough
Your behaviour can stay the same and it'd be a story of who you are so while you may not be gay you can still act the same and show off your tattoo. 
As a friend of mine put it, your behaviour, likes, dislikes, and your personality isn't tied to your gender
Yes. Very much so and I’m really, really struggling with it. Im five years in HRT, but I can’t get past this, and it’s exhausting and really messing with my head. I still say I’m gay  meaning I’m like men. I don’t want to leave it behind anymore. I want back in somehow. 

I’ve changed my name, gender marker on everything including my birth certificate, and now I think I may have taken it too far. I don’t feel it’s authentic anymore. 

I get jealous of gay men now because I miss it so much. So did I make a mistake? Can I just live a me, whatever it is and be fem and still attract gay men? Im ok with being androgynous and non-binary and transfem, but I feel like I’m dying inside. 

Thank you for posting it this. I needed to see someone else feels the way I do.
A friend of mine who transitioned five years before I did said something like that to me when I came out, because I identitfied as a man who loved men for nearly twenty years, and it was complete bull. Realizing I was a woman made me more comfortable with loving all genders, and now my female crushes when I thought I was straight (especially on women who later turned out to be lesbian) make a lot more sense in retrospect. Most importantly, even if you're still primarily interested in one gender, it doesn't mean that you're not a proud part of the queer spectrum. You're still evolving, and you're becoming your best self, period.
I admit, as someone who has cracked their egg recently, I'm not worried by this per se but it's on my mind a lot. I've been so many people's gay bestie. But.... well.... Yeah not being that after like .... 16 years of telling the world I'm gay is a little difficult for me.
You’re still gay. Just a better flavor.
The other common issue, although I've heard this more from transmascs who used to be lesbians, is that they are used to a certain style of relationship and most straight relationships are super different. Like, cishet men and women have pretty different expectations about partners and relationship roles than queer folks do.

So, for example, a lot of trans dudes who are into chicks might now be straight, but they still mostly date gay women because dating straight women can be a real challenge.
Don't see this as ""gay"" more like ""androphilia""
For me its like, the other way around? Sooo like its simulair yet different.. well everyone thought I was gay.. they where right! But not how they thought. 

Its hard, But like I think it will take some time to get used to. 

I just feel so incredibly gay and I love it yet I feel like in intruding since at a glance people wont see me as such?
Nah, went from mostly straight to mostly lesbian

I just like pretty female presenting people
Sexual and Romantic attraction can change, for a long time i've considered myself bisexual and biromantic, then poof the need for sexual intercourse was gone: Asexual Biromantic. After a while being single and not mourning the loss of the relationship i realized i didn't actually have an attraction to that person, which made me question if i could even feel romantic attraction at all. I looked back at all the encounters where i thought i had romantic or sexual attraction, but realized that most of it was misjudged gender envy and/or platonic attraction in combination with being starved of attention.

TLDR:  
Sexual and romantic attraction can change, it's fine to be struggling with it, but it's gonna be fine in the end <3
You're still gay just now you're straight if that makes sense?

I call everybody LGBT+ gay
Is the tattoo the Gay flag? New? Old (now considered pride)?
I have the opposite problem, struggling with the idea of not being straight anymore. But despite me having the opposite I can understand your way around too, it can sometimes feel like a major change when it flips around on you!
I went the other way around! LoL
I’ve been a straight ally all my life and suddenly I’m a lesbian. XD
Similar, but the opposite. Raised Fundie Christian, took \~28 years to break out of it. There is a ton of internalized shit that will take me the rest of my life to work through, this is likely one of those things.
Although I’m pan, my attraction towards guys (as a transfem) is a good source of gender euphoria for me, I kinda mentally view it as “just gals being gals” idk, maybe it might help to think about it like that
What is the problem with being straight...?
Not really. I've always been bisexual (or pan or omni? Not quite sure which label, but one of those) so whatever happens, that label sticks with me
I’ve been pan since before I knew I was trans, so it hasn’t really crossed my mind to be honest
I used to refer to myself as a gay man until three and a half years ago. And then as nb person until one and a half year ago, so I never thought about what my orientation was named ( btw what are you when you’re MtN attracted to men ? ) and I later accepted myself as totally MtF, and discovered me as pansexual, which is still today a bit hard to tell for me ( I mean I often refer to myself as a gay woman, which makes sense in my language, and not as a heterosexual or pansexual woman which is strange because I have been with more men than nb people or women ). It’s more like a thing I got to get used to and it’s a bit hard to change this one old habit
Used to consider myself as ""bi"" but only into feminine guys. Coming out trans made me realise I'm actually more on the trans lesbian side.
I’m coming from the opposite side… was “straight” all my life, interested in women (not just cis) but not in men. Now that I’ve accepted that I’m trans, and have decided to transition, I suddenly realize that all those “I’m a lesbian trapped in a man’s body” jokes I told… weren’t jokes.
This is so strange, because I was widely thought of as being gay when I was quite young, around 9 or 10, I think and although I was kind of attracted to boys from when I was *very* young, I somehow knew it had to be kept hidden and secret. This was in the 1970s, so the timing was pretty bad. Fast forward to 1986 or 7 and then, I kind of admitted the attraction, even though I didn’t want to have the masculinity attributes expected of a gay man. Add in that even in the 1980s, being gay was taboo - it cost me so much in terms of employment and social advancement and status.

It took decades longer bef I could finally admit to being transgender.

Years of stigma and negation from a toxic upbringing made it so much worse and harder.

I found the cis gay subculture to be repulsive very often and I knew that I did not really belong in it.

When in was growing up, the very idea of being a girl was so drenched with the threat and fear of violence, that I repressed really hard.

I feel I owe this society and the bio-connected, though not emotionally connected, individuals in my life such a huge debt.
pls i wanna like girls so bad 😭😭😭 hoping hrt turns me into a lesbian
Yeah I see a lot of trans men who used to identify as lesbians for a long period of time find it hard to leave that label behind because it was such a big part of them.
Yeah, everyone I hang with calls themselves gay, and the majority of people I hang with aren't cis gay men. Many varying kinds of sexualities.
glad im not alone in this :)
No. As a straight trans guy, if you called me gay I’d positively be throwing hands, that’s very insulting. Please drop that.
it’s actually of two male figures caressing each other 🤪 ironic
She said it pretty clearly, her identity for years was centred around being gay. Losing something you had to fight so hard for is an adjustment..
>( btw what are you when you’re MtN attracted to men ? )

Officially the term is Turic, realistically most people refer to themselves as either straight or gay because most people haven't heard of the term.
I mean, it is possible. I was bi before I transitioned and now I'm a pretty big lesbian lol. Regardless though, you are amazing 🥰
I think it's also to do with how you're attracted. For example, I had no real attraction to women as a man, but as a woman attraction is recontextualized a bit. So who knows. Just have fun and explore. Even if you're just straight that's totally valid.
I'm bi, and was roughly equally attracted in both directions. But after starting hrt I lost most of my attraction to men and masculine people, still there but significantly rarer for me to experience.
Same 🤗
You're probably just older not gonna lie
Show? 👀
I learned a new world today. I didn’t know it neither in French nor English ! Thank you
It goes the other way too lol I my girlfriend at the time helped me find my identity as a straight woman
Hell I went from ace to bi. I hear sexuality changes occur in about a third of trans women

Question from an ally	"Hello!

I have a question for trans folk. I have many trans friends who are transitioning or have transitioned. Now, something I often do with everybody, trans or not, is telling people they're pretty and they look good. It's just me complimenting them. But something I've found myself doing a lot is especially doing that with trans people. Now, there's this guy I know who I seriously find cute, and I often tell him that he's attractive, and I have this girl that struggled with her transition and I often tell her how beautiful she it. These are just examples of trans people I often do that complimenting thing with. And I feel like I mostly do it to kind of hype them up about their gender identity, especially when I know they have had a lot of dysphoria in the past. What I worry is that it may come off as disingenuine. What do you people think? How would you take it?"	"That may vary from person to person but I find it really sweet of you and I don't see a problem as long as it is honestly what you think 😊
If you are genuine that's fine. We need that given that beauty standards are a very hard to achieve thing even for guess people however not achieving these doesn't mean I've doesn't look good. In our case especially if gendered provably usually will also invoke euphoria which is nice.
For myself and most trans friends I know, it can often make our whole day just from a compliment or correct gendering from a random person. However if you're mostly just serving compliments to your friends it can potentially come across as disingenuous if you do it too often. Not that I'm saying don't give compliments, but maybe focus on being a little more specific about the compliments to seem more caring, ex: "" oh I love your shirt, it looks great on you! Where'd you get it?"" or maybe like, ""That color really makes your eyes shine! I love how cute you look!""
I think it varies from person to person, I personally find very sweet and would probably flush every time because I cant take compliments.
I would love to have a friend like you although from person to person it may very how comfortable they are with it
If you do it out of a sudden, it's an automatic show of what you think, i'm used to do it too, and i do love the reaction, and, mostly, it's just what i think about the people look
That's nice of you but please don't feel like you need to treat us differently
Your phrasing makes me confused. Please tell me you don't call transmascs pretty.
If you’re friends with them you know their personalities so I wouldn’t second guess yourself. If you’re being genuine, then most people can tell and it won’t come across as fake.
For me, as long as you are being honest and not doing it just to make them feel better it's fine. I hate it when people compliment me just for the sake of being nice and not because they actually feel I'm worth complimenting.
my gut does tell me it would probably come off as disingenuous to me but idk how much of tht would be my own shit as opposed to it actually being disingenuous. just dont overdo it or make them feel like its out place
I'm happy to see that you are open and accepting of all your friends regardless of gender ID. I very much appreciate that, and more people like you need to exist in this world.
In my experience, I love when people complement me telling me I'm ambiguous, pretty, handsome, ect., but it can definitely change on a person to person basis.
I don't know for example I hate when somebody tells me I look good. I have probably a lot of self hate inside me, that I cannot believe that, or it's just general thing I don't trust people so I'm not sure which one of these is triggering that in me. So it might vary from person to person how the are feeling about that statements from other people.
Sometimes people don’t know how to receive compliments just a heads up, with trans folks we’re used to the condescending “pity” compliments so that adds another layer to discomfort with receiving compliments. However! That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Just as long as its respectful and your tone isn’t condescending. A quick and short “you look really nice today” is better that “yasss queen, slay! You look fierce today”. But even if you say it in a respectful way and someone looks uncomfortable it might just be their inability to see that they deserve it because they’re used to people making fun of them/receiving back handed compliments
Personally I like to be treated like a cis guy. I’m sure some trans people appreciate being hyped up about their gender, but keep in mind that not all of us want attention called to our genders
If someone only does it on the rare occasion that I dress up, full makeup, nails, hair etc. but not on the other 95% of days It it actually makes me feel crummy. I know they don’t mean any Ill will but it gives me the impression that they put more value on me solely based on those more attractive days and the others I’m just trash…the compliments on the other 95% of days. Just a thrown together outfit, no makeup, messy hair and scuffed nails are the ones that I really take to heart but those compliments seem to be the rarer of the two.
I don't know how to accept compliments, so I just freeze up and fail to say thank you
if you told me this even if it wasn’t genuine I’d still be happy as long as it wasn’t sarcastic
I do the same thing from time to time and sumtimes it all sumone needs to here ti mack there day better so keep it up good on you x 
Thow gust a person think I definitely prfer being called cute then beautiful feel it gust means a lot more 👉👈
These are concerns I have as well about complimenting other trans people, haha, I think you're fine. Nit everyone is super receptive to compliments if they really don't believe it though. Just keep in mind for some of us it can be really hard to accept comments like that.
so for me personally it depends on context and the specific compliments. i hate when people tell me i look handsome or masc bc i know i dont rlly pass and it feels like theyre just trying to make me feel better (which bothers me bc im comfortable enough in my presentation).
So far you are doing amazing what you are doing is making them feel accepted and loved which helps alot so as long as you accept them for who they are and help them through the tough times you're doing amazing
if it's genuine, then pop off as long as you get the pronouns, because that's sometimes tricky
I find it really nice though i may not still agree with it myself. Like i am pre everything and a few people have said i am pretty i appreciate it even though I don't feel pretty at all
Honestly I think most people will just take the compliment because so many of us are starved for that gender affirmation in these types of compliments. Especially if they know you to be a good person.
if you aren't sure if someone would like a masc or fem compliment go for something more neutral like ""you look really nice today"" or ""i like your outfit"" but i think a compliment is always nice i you mean it
Aw, thanks!
Yeah, that was what I was trying to know. Honestly, it makes me so glad to hear how these little actions can help trans people so much :)
Yeah, that's the compliment I usually give to friends. Unless I'm trying to kinda flirt, it's normally small things like that, like ""your hair looks amazing today"" or ""I love that makeup"". Glad to hear it can make you feel that good!
Oh, no, it's definitely not that, don't get me wrong. It's the feeling that maybe comments about their physique, despite being not mean-spirited at all and being positive, might be taken wrong by some people. I've heard trans friends tell me about how it feels weird when people they don't even know talk about their bodies, so I'm wondering if I should keep the compliments to myself or not to not cause a similar situation.
Well, it'sa special case. I'm Spanish, so I use ""guapo"", which has its masculine (-o) and feminine (-a) form, or a gender neutral one (-e/-x, but it's not ""correct""). That word works the same for everyone, meaning not really having the handsome/pretty connotation.
Also, sorry if it's hard to understand, English isn't my first language.
Awww, thanks! This is so cute of you, seriously. And yes, sadly not everyone has this same outlook.
Same here, compliments like that are wonderful and absolutely make my day. If I were to analyze it, I'd say it's the indication that I'm being seen how I want to be. Friends who do that are great to have.
Ahh I see, lol. That's perfectly fine then. Especially if you don't make a habit or point to do it more often to your trans friends than your cis ones.
No, your post was very well written. I think my brain zeroed in on that because I've been told I'm ""too pretty to waste by becoming a boy"" and that hurt personally
It's quite unfortunate. I've faced some bad hate from strangers as well as ex friends. Just glad to see some people who aren't necessarily trans support those that are. The trans journey is a hard road, but friends like you make it better.
Oh, damn, that's so bad, wow
Oh no, sorry to hear that 😓 hug
I swear this is going to make me cry, thank you 🥺
Muchas gracias 🫂
Keep being your open and supportive self 😊

Is anybody else tired of the constant transphobia in the past couple years?	"I'm just so damn tired of hearing people hyper-fixate on my identity as a woman or treat me like a punching bag just because I identify as trans. It's like ever since gay marriage was legalized, hateful people needed a new minority to bully, and so trans people became the new ""it"" thing to bash on. I don't care about sports, or locker rooms, or whether or not you want to date me. I just want to be myself."	"Yes, its fucking exhausting and makes it hard to exist as a human
Yeah, I'm exhausted at the moment. It's so tiring to be demonised for having done precisely fuck all wrong.
I think that as trans people have more representation in the media, and are more accepted, there are some people stuck in the 1980s and trying to hold onto how it was before. Within a generation, most of these people will be dead.
I only cracked last summer and I'm completely exhausted by all this. It's gotta be even worse for so many other people
I've only realized that I'm trans for less than a year, and seeing the transphobia everywhere is exhausting. 
Doesn't help that most of the transphobes are about as dense as Osmium and can't be reasoned with.
A wise man once said ""I spent to much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted""and those are my feelings exactly
Yeah, it's unfortunately unsurprising: The right didn't really care about abortion until racism started to be seen as a bad thing and they needed a new moral ""high"" ground.
Yes, I’m extremely tired of it, it’s literally hell but on earth

I struggle that I’ll never be accepted in my town because of transphobic views many people hold there, and online as well
yeah i've been trying to avoid the news for the most part. focus on community work and just keep your head down. you can't change the big picture, just small stuff around you.
You can thank the GOP for using us to get out the stupid people vote. I’m full of rage most days about it.
Getting the media to constantly cover us with distortion is their way to not cover the real problems with what our politicians are really up to.
I'm super tired of it and I'm completely over the fuking people who cannot just let us live our lives
as a trans person myself I am trying my hardest to get my college education rn to start my own fashion design business and put every type of clothes in every gendered section. dresses and skirts in the mens section, suits and pants with deeeeeeeeep pockets for the womens section. I will not stop until it is so mixed that the gendered sections are obliterated from existence. it might take me a few centuries but I will sure as hell will not go down without a fight. This might be small but it will have a nice impact on transphobes when they can no longer argue about clothes having gender.
Yes especially cause if my parents try to research anything pretty much all they're finding is the most horribly transphobic takes and coming back at me with them 😐
Yes. Im still at the beginning of my transition and the world seems rather psychotic in this context lol. The thought of so much hate for just existing and minding my own business. But the good news is other marginalized groups went through the same growing pains and now enjoy considerably more freedoms. This gives me hope.
It's tiring, but it's also happening because things have gotten so much better. This is the step back that goes with the two steps forward.
Yeah, this hatred for us terrifies me. So im going to probably be getting a gun cause of it
It can be mentally taxing for us, but only if you choose to absorb that kind of content. I feel like the happiest most blissful trans people are the ones who have nothing to do w any of the transphobia in the media. They simply just don’t pay attention to it. Half the time, it’s only to score cheap political points anyways.
Yes, that’s why I do my best to the be the most intimidating woman in the room at all times. Nobody ducks with the scary Russian lady with the big knife on her belt
I'm tired of people trying to put labels on everything. Just be yourself. Let them take you or leave you.
Are you talking about personal attacks or just stuff in the media? Cuz if it stuff in the media stop looking at it and just live your life. If it’s personal attacks that’s a bit different but still gotta live your life regardless of others comments
I think it's become the new big political thing
transphobia is all fun and games to them until i start being racist

They need a scapegoat to feel better about themselves. No reason to bully and assault people trying to be happy.

The surge began I feel when people from the trans community and allies started to make very illogical and irrational statements which has upset many people in and outside of these communities. I personally know a lot of people who were allies and supported the trans community as they felt that what they were doing and asking for wasn't too much for anyone. Respecting pronouns is more than fine. Offering security and safe spaces and just basic human rights for those that identify as trans was nothing too much either.However,  since recent years, there are quite some people who make claims that trans waomen, for example, are equally as much women as cis-women. Which is upsetting to many. When you're trans, you go through an entirely different journey than a female-born woman. Trans people cannot possibly know how it's like to live a life a female-born woman has lived. And the same goes for non-trans people who cannot possibly know how it's like to live life as a trans person. It's not the same and no words can explain one another's experiences in a way that the other group(s) can understand it fully. People seem to not have an issue with trans people identifying as specific genders. Just statements that sound illogical to them and in a way feel like erasure of terms that are there to denote them. Especially when the concept of what a woman or a man is by someone who is trans is just that. An own concept. One that feels very different from the sex they were assigned at birth but there is no telling that that concept is 100% truly what the average male or female feels like. Especially when you throw in the lack of biological processes that a trans person has not been able to go through.

Aside from that, more people are identifying as trans, nowadays, while not actually really being trans. Which causes increased debates as well as it can and has posed problems (mostly by people who are just abusing the power of being able to identify as trans without much questions being asked).

I personally know no people who bash or hate on trans people who are just out there living their life as comfortably as possible as the gender they identify as. Who acknowledge that there will always be differences between trans and cis people and that not having to mean anything bad either. In areas where our physical bodies do not matter, the majority of people seem to have no issue at all with accepting trans people as the gender they identify as. But so with stuff like Lia Thomas which doesn't invoke hate towards áll trans people but creates outrage because of obvious male body differences, among other things. Divisions in sports were created because the majority of female bodies in sports just cannot compete properly against the vast majority of male bodies in sports. And when mostly estrogen and testosterone levels are taken into account to qualify someone identifying as trans to compete in the division of the sex that corresponds with the gender they identify as, bodies still can have advantages (or even disadvantages) compared to the other participants in that division. The best solution would be to have new subdivisions or new divisions as a whole that are able to cover all kinds of trans people.When it comes to the sports and lockerroom stuff it's really just about unfair competition and discomfort in lockerrooms in very specific cases of people not having transitioned yet and, for example, displaying arousal in their genitals. There is also a reason why lockerrooms have been divided for ages. I'd personally be for a trans and/or gender-neutral locker room in every facility.

And lastly, nobody likes to be imposed things on that cause unfairness/discomfort. So outrage because of that feels understandable. It's why so many people understand why trans people would like to go to the bathroom of the gender they identify as, for example.

In the end, I think that the reason for all of this outrage from all sides is because no proper solutions that take every side into account are being put into practice. Once that is being done, the outrage will most definitely simmer down.
I’m tired of it too. But, honestly, “dense as Osmium” made my day and I’m totally using that now🤓. Ty
Unfortunately we can only do so much as educate, organize, and make it known that the people in charge and who matter most in society need to help us make people understand.
Tell them to check Google scholar- y'know, the place that has actually research.
[deleted]
I'd agree if they didn't force it on us, make us our own  rules, and then kill us for them...
I get your point, but even Malcolm X regretted being hateful of his own racist rhetoric. So just don't fight hate with hate, it solves nothing and makes people more open to hating us because we ""made it worse"" and ""deserve it"".
... I don't follow, in America at least our society has always hated on being gay and trans. That's why it was hidden and we just now learned Shakespeare was gay as hell when he had the chance. But to answer why it's worse, people like trump or tucker carlson emboldening hate and making laws against us while pretending to support us, all the while being beacons of ""free speech"" for people who don't get basic science.
I'm glad it made your day. And go ahead, though it may fly over the heads of transphobes because they don't know how to do any amount of research.
I’m not smart enough to get this joke, sorry. Could you explain it?"	tnpm13	trans	346	0.98	2022-03-25 16:24:10
It is normal to be anxious over being trans?	"If anybody else has a lot of anxiety over rejecting the identity after the transition? By that I don’t mean the “I am afraid I am not trans” thing necessarily, but, for example, I am “desperately” trying to find reasons for me not being trans in my head, like subconsciously. And, seriously, I haven’t found anything online, if anybody has something like that? I am basically killing myself with it.

EDIT: And, yeah, can I ask you, if you have experienced those feelings, were they stronger, when you have experienced discrimination or a pressure from your parents?"	"100% anxious. And it's 100% normal.

I remember, when I was a kid, 100% rejecting the ""trans identity"", because it was a ""girl identity"". As time went on, I bgan to accept a ""girl identity"". But, ftr, I'd rather talk about that privatively.
Yep, anxiety is normal and okay. Especially if you have any anxiety disorders.
Yeah that’s normal. When I cracked the fake world of lies I built for myself crumbled around me. On top of that losing all your cis privilege and having to endure oppression isn’t enticing either.

Who wouldn’t feel anxious?
It's pretty normal, I'd say. The world is kinda geared against trans people, and the discrimination against them is well know by everyone. No one wants to be mistreated and discriminated against, so it's reasonable that you'd have anxiety over it.
Its very normal, i feel that all the time, i felt it a fewhours ago in fact haha
I went through that for a long while. Not fun. Constant anxiety and fear are not good feelings and take a toll on your body too. I would not wish them on anyone.

I think your feelings are common for trans people, especially when in an unaccepting environment or where it may mean modification to life plans you held dear for a long time.
This is so relatable and it's what I'm feeling right now. I'm always so anxious and I think to myself ""what if I'm not actually trans?"" and then I look for both reasons why I am trans and the reasons why I possible might not be trans. It so tiring... 

Like I said to myself a lot of times already ""Remy, you are a girl, it's fine, you aren't faking it"" and then the next day I'm like ""Ehhh, I don't feel that much dysphoria, i might not be trans...""

Parent's don't really help either, they are in denial and they think I'm gonna ""regret it"".

But every time I think of myself as a girl, I still get so happy, like I don't get myself...
I really hope I' m actually a girl and trans and I'm not faking it...
I'm currently at that stage, the fear of going on T is there even though I know I want to take it.
Judging by the comments, I'd say its a common feeling.
Yes. Being trans and transitioning, even in the best of places, means adopting discrimination and risk, and being othered from large swaths of people. It also tends to make us much happier, but it makes your life materially harder in many ways. It is 100% natural to want to rationalize that away.

Transition is also just a lot of work. It can often take years of awkward babytrans days to get to a place where you're confident about who you are. It's an intimidating task with a lot of moving parts.
When I got to point of realizing I was trans, I kept getting panic attacks whenever I felt dysphoria, it has kinda gone  away now but is normal to get some form of anxiety in my experience. The anxiety can manifest in many forms and for many reasons. My best recommendation is when you feel it, is to just write what you feel down. Just let the stream of consciousness flow, Ignore spelling just let what you feel out, bottling things up will never help decipher what you feel.
[deleted]
I get that too, it’s super normal! Just remember that you are the only one that can bring yourself down. Make sure you gotta love yourself first. Love conquers everything.
Is your worry over what you actually want, or concern about whether you want it enough, whether you *deserve it enough*? Whether you think you're trans enough to be trans?
I have a lot of dissonance currently.

The back of my mind is all gung-ho, if I zone out and start typing like I do keeping a journal each night it can be seen in the enthusiasm for things like ""Ok, so...my deductible renews 4/1, can you get me in the OR before that?"", while my surface-level thoughts worry constantly about things like being judged by my neighbors, being 'caught' going out and presenting, overthinking things like my self-image not changing overnight and what that could mean...
Yeah!!! I'm nonbinary so it's a double whammy on days I dress more in line with my AGAB. I always just try to dismiss it as internalized transphobia in my head
I started body building and working construction after I figured out I was trans and didn't want to admit it. Anxiety is totally normal
Honestly I wasn’t even going to comment to this post but it really hit me. Short story, I think I may be trans but my mind keeps making up excuses and stories on why I’m not. Making me beyond anxious 😅😅 very confusing time in my life. A part of me feels like I already know the answer and what to do but it doesn’t make it any less scary. Also makes me beyond anxious even thinking about it, so I don’t think you’re alone.
Of course it makes sense. Who’d want to be trans. Your life would be so much easier if you weren’t. Probably everyone around you including yourself would prefer it if you weren’t. It makes sense that, if you are, you’d desperately try to convince yourself that you’re not.
If its REALLY impacting your life, you may have OCD. OCD makes you doubt everything. I have OCD and I’m trans. I’ve read that some people develop obsessions about not being really trans. I’m not a doctor so this is just a hypothesis, but I thought it might be worth looking into with a specialist for you.
Yea i think i get what u mean. I have anxiety and i feel like im constantly arguing with myself in my head over my identity: “maybe ur not trans bc of [reason]. Oh but you must be trans bc of [reason]! Oh my god youre trans oh god” and then the cycle repeats 🙄🙄
I have updated the post.
Tbf being trans isnt exactly fun.
Anyone who says they have no anxiety or fear about this is lying or a robot from the future sent back in time to destroy antiquated notions of gender.
All of the above. Truly it is part of the “trans experience”. Less so now. Cheers to even less tomorrow! 🙏🏼🏳️‍⚧️🔥✨🛠🌑🌎
I was anxious about it for 20 years. I still am, but at least now I have tits
[removed]
Do you think that my therapist will be okay with that?
What do you mean by anxiety disorders?
Thank you! But did you have the same situation?
In what way?
Thank you, I am worrying about it.
Yeah, and it is a reason I don’t want to tell my parents about it. They will be a full on source of my anxiety and dysphoria
Why do you fear going on T in particular?
Thank you for your detailed reply \^\^
Well said. 👏🏼💯
In what way did you have panic attacks?
How come? And how were your family gaslighting you?
Thank you \^\^
Yeah, trans\* enough stuff and imposter syndrome stuff, not ""what I actually want"" definitely.
Oh, I feel bad for you :< I know how hard it is
Oh, how come? :3
Sounds like me in 2018
Yeah, that is true
I don't know. But maybe i have a special kind of anxiety :0
From what?
If they're good at their job (and not transphobic) they will understand that the world is very cishet and a lot of trans people struggle with their identity because of cishet-normatives. I do too :]
Generalised anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, PTSD etc. Basically if you are predisposed to stress or anxiety this is definitely very normal and even if you aren't predisposed to stress and anxiety its still bery normal to be anxious about things as complicated and depressing as gender and transition.
Couple years early on. Alot of anxiety and denial, I was pretty miserable. Then I realized people will still find reasons to be assholes and discriminate no matter who you are, the reasons will just be different.

I'm Italian-american, grew up with people treating me like a criminal. I'm a Christian, grew up with people calling me a bigot and a murderer. I'm also a witch, people think I'm a freak.

So I realized that, really, being trans wouldn't change anything. Now, I'm transfem, I'm goth, and I like listening to strange music on full blast with the windows down. People still have their prejudice for different reasons now, but I'm much happier with myself, and I don't feel like I'm trying to(or have to) hide all the time.
Well i felt that maybe im just feeling unfeminine and that i aren’t trans, i now realize that its not just feeling not feminine. Its that i just about explode in happiness when in gendered correctly.
Did you come out to them already or? I'm assuming you did.

Because like, mine still do that and it's been half a year. They just make me feel really dysphoric...

And what do i do to stop it? I really don't know...
Its mostly fear of rejection, I dread to think how my family is going to react (I'm not out to them yet) I also deal with imposter syndrome
Of course! It's a journey we all take. I can't promise it'll be easy but it is very rewarding.

If you want to talk about it you can message me.
When I experienced a dysphoric episode, which varied for reasons, I would begin to hyperventilate, difficulty breathing, this feeling that my heart is about to explode and it was all for stupid reasons like I saw my mustache started growing after me shaving it off earlier that day. My panic attacks are still present, I just have learned to acknowledge them and just kinda breath through it. I experience basically all forms of dysphoria so I would say it isn’t a fun thing to experience. When it comes to panic attacks, the best way to describe them is your entire life just stops in that moment and you are flooded with the many things you feel and it is like the feelings are so overwhelming that it feels like you are suffocating.

Love yourself boo!!
I mean realistically how can any woman be 'woman' enough or any man be 'man' enough? I mean, heck, I never question the validity of a gay man or a butch woman. Why would I? Just had a similar conversation with someone yesterday. I was anxious because I was worried I *wasn't trans*. Being worried that you're not trans enough imo is kinda the dysphoria of not meeting your own ridiculous expectations. How often do we see people talking in media about unrealistic gender expectations are? How many tiktok kiddos are getting depression because they don't meet unrealistic expectations?
Don't be! It's kind of part of the trans experience! We all have our own thing we go through (which is why we make such a good community- we can relate to general feelings we all experience)

To answer your edit: I've experienced next to no pressure from my family but I still have second guessing I think just from general attitudes in society teaching me the same things transphobic parents would. It might be less intense for me because I don't have to experience direct confrontation with family and then second guess myself during/after that so that is something to consider
I was raised in a pretty fundamentalist Christian family with very strict views on masculinity. I hadn't believed in god for a few years by that point (I was 20 I think?), but I still felt like being trans was a weakness that I had to overcome somehow. I got over it after a couple months and came out publicly
Ok I'll bite.  Tell me about the special powers your super anxiety can do!
[removed]
Thank you!
Oh, I’ve never ever seen a therapist 😅
yeah, so, \^\^
No, I fear that a lot. I will start my transition as a secret
Oh, yeah, I deal with it too. I had a problem going on puberty blockers recently, for example, because of that :<
Oh :(

But what were you anxious about during the dysphoric episodes?
Yeah, the same thing!
I don't know. Maybe, I am emphasizingly more anxious about my feelings.
Uhm no, what freak?
Thats okay, people without anxiety disorders still get stressed abd anxious about stuff. If this anxety is causing significant discomfort and especially if you experience severe anxiety in other parts of your life and you feel like it lowers your quality of life you should speak to a doctor.
A lot of the feelings boiled down to the fear of not being accepted, my body not being how I wish it was, constantly feeling like my emotions and experiences are not valid and I am just pretending, the fear of how things would change if I accept or transition, fearing that I wouldn’t be able to transition well, the fear of losing what you already have, Like I might not like the life I have, but change is scary and very uncertain.
What makes you think that?
[removed]
Why were you were fearing that exactly during the dysphoria?
I don't know. Maybe the pressure from my parents.
Uhm, I want to become a woman physically, sorry
Well, I was raised in european transphobic and homophobic racist household so a lot of the issues are with the internalized phobias but also knowing that my parents wouldn’t accept me, and that is a pretty big issue for me cause that means I am stuck in my form until I am fully financially independent and such, and I guess change is just a scary thing. When over your life you built up these lies that you call your identity and it begins to crumble, I am at this point where I really no longer know who I am, but I know who I want to be but I unfortunately have to live two lives and that just sucks and is limiting. I really can’t explain why I felt those things, but many of my fears are the uncertainties of change. I want to become the person I imagine I just know it will be very difficult but the difficulties are not yet fully certain. Now that I think about it, I think those fears manifested during my dysphoria because I don’t want to be stuck in this form and I guess I am for a pretty long time, so they are fears and just thoughts that I can’t shake, manifestations of both sides, where I am scared to change but I also want to change.
Was this fueling your willingness to be financially independent?
Very much so. I can’t wait to be able to afford the things I want and start HRT.
Aw, but now you are still financially dependent?
Yeah, currently I am on my third year of University and have another three semesters to go. Until I get a job after graduation I am unable to transition of the fear that I will be cut off.
Oh, do you pay for your university?
they pay for my housing and all of my current medications. I am diabetic and all of my supplies are very expensive. Fortunately I have a full ride scholarship to my university, but if they cut me off I literally will die cause I won’t be able to find a decent job to pay for all the things to keep me alive. The fear of being cut of is present cause I knew a trans girl in HS who got kicked out of her house. And my parents are russian so basically very illogical and irrational people, you are wrong no matter what you say to them.
Aww, poor you :< But if government supports you? And where do you live?
I live in the US now but the healthcare system here is really bad and sucks if you have no good insurance and that is the thing I wouldn’t be able to afford.
Oh, then I do understand that. But you will have a good job after your graduation?
Hopefully, I am studying computer engineering so I do have very good prospects on where I wanna go.
Oh, do you study in a good university? :>
I think I do, considering I chose to go there.

Thank you!
Your the best! 🥰
Me f-ing too!
I wish there was an emoji that depicted a face with light coming from the eyes and mouth
Oh with the shirts? I totally forgot about that rule. I wore it just in case I felt the need to cover up my chest like I had been doing but so far so good, no one has said anything (which is mostly normal, just the obvious avoidance of referring to me at all) so now that it’s warming up I’ll probably take it off after lunch
Btw is there a sizing guide to chokers or would you get extenders kinda like you would necklaces, I’ve been thinking about getting one but don’t wanna get one and it be to small for me. Just asking cause I seen yours.
Everyone else has already said it, but your hair is just so long and thick and luxuriant, and your eyes are a very rich, vibrant blue. 

They're going to be really jealous (and mad) once you hit that 1 year mark and *really* start making them question their sexuality and perspectives.
Yeah the shirts ☺️ we were gifted these goofy lumberjack plaid shirts that really don't go with anything but I wear it when the shop is under 60° and I have to work on things.
I used a wallet chain and connected the two sides with a carabiner. It just so happened to fit rather nicely so I went with it! I had never worn a choker before this last weekend and now I’m in love with it!
Thank you so much! I can’t wait!!! 🥰
Same I’ve pretty much been just wearing these plaids over my chest since I started without opening them. It’s been in the 30’s where I live until around 1-2pm so it’s been a good solution to hiding my boobs and staying warm at work. But now I say NO MORE! And I will definitely have to be mindful moving forward
Find a girlfriend / confidant to help? Maybe a zoom consultation to put together different looks from your clothes?

I think plaid shirt thing is almost allowed over plain black dress but only to and from work. I'll need to try and learn more about the rules. 😊
Yea my partner is afab and chimes in when she notices but I’m definitely still learning ‘the rules’ of fashion and expression as it were. Which seasons to wear what colors, which colors match and which don’t . And the hardest part: what shoes do I wear with which outfit! Omg!
Shoes...     ... are my achilles heel.  😳😂🙄😁

Church makes me feel like an awful person	"So I have known I am trans for a while. I wanna tell my friends but for some reason I can't. Anyways, every time I go to church they talk about Jesus and how he will save you and bring you to heaven and you will live there forever when you die. I always think, I am never going to heaven I am trans and I will never be accepted and its ""wrong"". I always then say in my head ""it is just a phase I can change my ways and  I will be able to go to heaven"". I don't want to do that, I wanna be a girl like I am supposed to be why was I born as a male. They say, ""God chooses your gender for a reason you shouldn't change it"" and somehow I agree with them. But then, when I go back home I realize no that's bs I am a woman and I should be able to be a woman because I am one. I just wanna transition like I should be able too, I just can't.

Edit: Thank you for all the really nice comments but I am going to have to stop reading them for a while as I suffer from really bad anxiety and reading the comments help me feel a lot better about my identity but my anxiety is going up because I know my parents wouldn't support me I don't want to find out.  
Also people who are saying religion is dumb, I don't really care, and you aren't helping just don't comment"	"For the record, (1) people who worship Jesus don't get to cite Leviticus and Deuteronomy, because they rejected them for their ""New Covenant"", and (2) the totality of what Jesus Christ said about trans people is this, ' '

You're not wrong, churches who forget these 2 facts are.
I am glad I got rid of my religion this sounds difficult and annoying.
Church and Christianity exist to make people feel guilty just for existing. If you feel like you might be going to hell, then church is succeeding at its job.

•THAT IS HOW THEY MAKE
MONEY•

In 15th century Christianity, people paid the church to get their dead loved ones out of purgatory. Because god needs money.

Honestly, it’s bullshit. There are a lot of bullshit spiritual teachings and in the US, Christianity is the top of the list.

You are who you are and you cannot change that. That feeling of being another gender does not go away. You make peace with it as best you can. It may mean that you embrace it fully. It may mean that you live privately as your real gender. It may mean that you completely repress it. All have consequences and benefits. 

But I’d strongly caution you against embracing the advice from a corporation that claims to represent a being that cannot communicate directly without being paid.

What does god need with money?
The “God made you this way don’t change it” argument is stupid, well, God made us living in the woods without houses or modern amenities, and yet we made houses.

Honestly, God made you who you are, and that includes the fact that you’re trans.
Hey. Regardless of what any industry, religion,, group or induvidual syas. You. Are. Beautiful.
Do people in churches have those views? Yes. But that’s not in the Bible. At the end of the day the church has been totally fine with other bodily alterations(eunuchs, castratos). I stopped feeling bad about being me a long time ago, it’s a journey. Just don’t try to flip and deny it, that will just end up in pain.
I am a pastor in the midst of transition (MTF). I believe we fit into the same category as those born with a congenital birth defect, the same as someone born with a cleft palette, a club foot, or any myriad of other birth challenges. While we are all wonderfully and fearfully made genetics and nurture together play as big a role as God's interest in who we live as. I hid this aspect of myself off and on for almost 60 years. I feel like I lived a lie my whole life for not living into how God made my heart and mind, which is much different than my current genitalia. I still have a ways to go but God loves me (and you) as who we are at whatever place in our life we are. The world pushes us to deny who we are yet Jesus celebrates diversity. Remember, Jesus is God revealed in human form, so I always go with Jesus over religious turmoil. Feel free to message me for more confirmation that you are beloved of God no matter what others tell you.
Congratulations you've discovered transphobia and church dogma designed to oppress people different than from the churches view.
Why do you care about what the people say today? It says clearly in the bible who jesus was and what he stood for:

He was about loving and accepting everyone equally, his motto was unconditional love. He sat with the outcasts of society regularly telling them that they are loved and accpeted by god. He specifically condemns people who judge others and the bible makes it clear that judging people is up to god. So if somone tells you that Jesus would support homophobia, transphobia or any other form of discrimination that means that person has never openend a bible or atleast the new testament in their life

Btw im not religios at all, it just makes me sad how many ""christians"" dont understand their own religion. Just because there are one or two SENTENCES in the entire bible that COULD MAYBE be understood as Anti-LGBT, that doesnt make the literal thousands of pages about jesus preaching love go away. Its insane to me. Please stay strong and be assured that your identity does not stand in any conflict with your faith, but rather with ignorant people misinterpreting the scripture for their own bigotry

Please stay strong, you can be who you want to be!
Don't worry you are not alone on this.

Ex: me.
Jesus loves you for who you are, not who society wants you to be. Being trans isn’t a sin, it doesn’t hurt anyone, and it doesn’t prevent you from going to heaven.
Church is just an excuse for the racist, transphobic, etc to enforce their will on others. Just don’t worry about what they say I learned that the hard way.
Hey. I know you said you would stop reading comments, but here's my take. For context, I also have dealt with a huge amount of gender dysphoria in the past and had these *exact* struggles when going to church with my family.

I think a lot of people in this subreddit are justifiably angry at religious people for their outright hatred of LGBT folk, but the bible, itself, actually tells a different story entirely. This might be a long post, but bear with me. I think it's important to explain the biblical arguments for and against trans individuals. This should help anyone who ends up arguing with strongly religious people. I hope it also helps those who are struggling with LGBT issues while going to church.

Firstly, what is the biblical justification *against* transgender people. So far as I know, this comes from 2 places:

1. [Deuteronomy 23:1](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm): No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the LORD.
2. [Deuteronomy 22:5](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm): A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.

To be clear, the top verse only applies to trans women. The bottom verse can actually be interpreted as *supportive* of trans individuals, after all... if you are a woman, you should be wearing women's clothing. It doesn't matter what sex you were born as. To be doubly clear: this logic won't fly for any strongly anti-trans people, but it might help those who are struggling to make peace with their gender identity and religion. In that case, just know that God has your back.

In my opinion, if a Christian says they are against transgender people, they simply have not read the scripture. [Matthew 19:12](https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm):

> For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.

For those who do not know, a eunuch is a man who has been castrated. This is a clear sign that Jesus was accepting of those who need to change themselves to be at peace with their own sexual struggles. It also directly contradicts the only biblical arguments I know of that are *against* trans individuals. In these contradictory cases, most people accept the New Testament over the Old Testament.

If you are Catholic, I understand that this logic will not fly because you also need to listen to the Pope, who is largely against trans folk.
That said, if you are part of a protestant religion that claims to follow the bible, they have no excuse to exclude trans individuals outside of their own bigotry.

In that case, *they* are the ones in the wrong. They are not following the bible and using God's name in vain to support their own twisted logic.

The truth is that when people argue against trans folk, they will usually say something like: ""It's obviously wrong. God made you in his image. He made you a {man / woman}, so you should live as a {man / woman}."" Well, what if God made you as a woman, but put you in a man's body? What if God's path for you *is literally to transition*? He has done way stranger things than that. The trans process could have been set before you to teach you about empathy, humility, honesty... Just a huge number of positive attributes.

If you make the argument that being trans is your intended path, they will tell you to either:

1. ""Read the bible."" Again, biblical justification for gender reassignment surgery is shown above. Show them these verses and ask them where their justification is beyond ""God making people a certain way for a reason."" Tell them what I said. It sounds like they are putting words in God's mouth to support their own agenda. 
2. ""That just isn't the way God works."" Are they prophets? Can anyone in this era hear God directly? Again, God has done way, way stranger things in the past and Jesus even acknowledged that some people need to modify their sex organs ""for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.""

The way I see it, if your stumbling block is gender dysphoria and transitioning will help you become a better person (""for the sake of the kingdom of heaven""), then transition! That is the path God has set for you. Even if you are not planning to transition, God might have given you these issues (like gender dysphoria) so you can be more accepting and welcoming of different beliefs.

The church does not speak for God. To be honest, the bible doesn't either, but it's a trump card out of religious bigotry. Anyone who uses the God's name without proper biblical justification is using it in vain and therefore sinning. Tell them you won't listen to their arguments without proper citations.

Sorry, I might have gotten a bit heated. I used to be very, very strongly religious (I would read the bible for like 2-3 hours a day for years). I get really pissed when people don't cite their sources and make outlandish claims.
been there. my advice: leave. there is no safe home for you there and you won’t be able to police your thoughts enough to convince yourself to be happy living as a cis person. you will never feel good or worthy in that environment because that environment is designed to tear you down and keep you dependant.

you are not unworthy of love. you are not broken. you are not a mistake. you do not need to stifle your light in order to find conditional belonging. you are enough, sis. if you need spiritual connection, please seek out queer religious spaces.
From this post alone, I can’t quite tell if the church hurts because you still sorta believe in it, or if it’s because you’re surrounded by inscription people. 

If it’s cuz you still kinda believe in it, I’ve been there too. What helped me was to throw out the church while keeping the gospel, if that makes sense. I spent a while trying to ask God if I should transition, and then I finally just told him I was going to. His response was basically “you go girl”. Being able to keep my faith and relationship with god has been very helpful to me. The church around what I believe in sucks, but I don’t really have any stake in that, I only care about what happens between me and god. 

If you don’t believe at all anymore, and the hurt comes from being sidings by hateful people and rhetoric, I personally haven’t been there and’s don’t really have advice to give, though I am always willing to give hugs where needed.
Would your parents be open to going to a different church or you questioning some of their religious beliefs? If that’s the case you can look for an accepting church (I really hope there is one close to you) and suggest trying that church. If you aren’t ready to come out yet, you can just make it vague and base it on your own religious views. If you have other issues with this church you could mention those or just “the way [accepting church] talks about god/jesus makes more sense to me/speaks to me more than [transphobic church] could we try going there and see if we like their service better?” You should be free to not attend if you don’t want to, but maybe they are more open to a queer friendly church then you not going to church 

If they are strong believers not open to different interpretations of the bible, I’m sorry. It’s hard being 13 and having to listen to your parents when they are wrong. God made you a beautiful girl and hang in there until you can live that way
It’s exactly why I left religion. Separating from it mentally definitely makes the forced trips there easier to bear.
Church, by it's very nature, is designed to make you feel like an awful person. If it didn't threaten you with punishment and erode your self-esteem, it would never have power over anyone to feel like they had to follow its tenets.
Hey hey hey god made you the way you are so there for he intended for you to be trans no shame in that your friends have no right to judge you
Also religion is a crutch for those can’t self govern. Downvote this all you want but maybe stop going to church and start living your truth
Awww I really feel for you xx
Churches suck
Christianity is retarded
If god doesn’t want you trans you wouldn’t be trans
Church is a scam
Repent
You can’t change your gender(this does not mean that it can’t change on its own from time to time - gender fluid people exist), if god created you in a male body, but with a female gender identity, then you can’t change it, BUT what you can do is treat your gender dysphoria as any other disease people are born with
If ""God chooses your gender"" so you can't change it, then if you have bad vision or teeth those also should not be corrected. This argument could extend far beyond ridiculousness as well, i.e. if you have an infection you should not kill it with antibiotics because it's one of God's creatures and clearly they wanted you to have it, if you have cancer it's because it's God's will, etc.

The reality of their statements should be very clear in contrast, God only has a problem with you changing things that make these people uncomfortable ***despite*** it not saying anything about this at all **ANYWHERE** in the bible. These people know, they talk to God or something, right?

The truth is that these people know about as much about scripture as the microbiology of prokaryotes, despite it's accessibility to literally everyone. This should indicate not only that these people are being fed a line by someone, someone who is obviously very bigoted with an agenda of their own, but that they are intellectually about as lazy as people come and that nothing they say can be taken at face value. That doesn't mean that things they say might not be true sometimes, it means that you need to research anything they say because they are just parrots.
You need to find a new church. There are LOTS of churches that do believe God made you the right gender just accidentally put you in the wrong body. (Don't ask me which ones, I'm not a Christian but I have heard of them many times)
Real Jesus would accept you for who you are. I consider myself a believer, but I openly stand against the church. If you read the bible you can see how twisted the words have become. You can believe and be yourself and not agree with everything that an old man on a pedestal says. Even if you would think that there is any continuity since Peter becoming first pope, there's not. There was so much man made changes in Church that it's not up to the values it should preserve
Look, you can feel awful because a 2000 year old book written by farmers that didn't know where the sun goes at night and in wich basically every sentence is a mistranslation by now says you are awful, or you fuck that book and embrace who you are with people that accept and love you for that.
By the logic of the church your god doesn’t make mistakes and made in their image so there’s that.
Read about the Ethiopian Eunuch to understand the new testaments views on non gender-conforming people. I am a trans-Christian and unfourtantley I see that hatred a lot especially in America. Jesus preached acceptance, kindness, love. Sadly like people do they corrupted his word to fit their narrow views and cite snippets without understanding context and deeper biblical understanding. All you need to know is Jesus loves you for who you are and if your church doesn't accept this fact or your family, find a new church and a new family. God loves you no matter if you believe or not live a good life be good to others and you do better than 90% of these so called good American Christians.
Well consider this. According to a lot of religions, god gave us 2 paths. 1 path is follow is intended way and believing and doing everything he wants/said. The other path is to do what we want. To make our own path. And a lot of priest will tell u that even if your only a good person with a good heart, you will be able to go to heaven.
There has never been a great answer for this but I am a born again believer and yet am always having to listen to Church-goers.

So I have fallen back on 1 Samuel 16:7 and Galatians 3:28 from both testaments as evidence that what we consider, based on very specific parts of the Bible, is not sufficient to claim foul on other’s.
Heyas kid. You sound a lot like me when ai was a kid.
I walked away from the church because the people didn't behave like Christians. Unfortunately I blamed G_d as well. It took years to give it another look. A couple of YouTubers actually convinced me to come back to Christ. Haven't made it back to church yet though. Still looking for the right one.
Anyway the Bible Project and one of it's co-creators, Tim Mackie and Brandon Robbins on YouTube they dig into the historical context and explain Bible metaphors that everyone misinterprets. They get into how the English words don't always match the Hebrew or Greek or even latin they were translated from.
And they don't judge. And they let on that it's not cool to judge... I hope you find your place!
Where does Jesus say that being trans is wrong? The church likes to propagate hate to fire up the faithful. If you are a believer, ignore everything in the Bible except the words of Jesus. If you’re not a believer or you’re on the fence, just ignore the Bible altogether. I always felt that heaven and hell are just there to reinforce the con. I would never send people to hell for all eternity, and that makes me better than god. I would show them the errors of their ways. In no way do we, as trans people, harm others. Don’t listen to religious bigots making you feel bad for just being who you are.
Hey dont ever let religion judge you for who you are. Be you. Not be what jesus says. Be who you want to and damn the consequences
God did choose your gender… you are a girl :). That’s why you can’t change that! You were made to be trans. And religion is best taken with a grain of salt anyways. Find your own way to worship, every way has been changed by human input anyways so don’t worry.
The core message of Christianity as I understand it is to love ur neighbour. So everyone doing sth to harm u is not really following that idea... And is obv just an idiot, don't listen. (My personal opinion, so s don't be offended pls. Not trying to make u think like this ..): there is no god. Always being occupied by thinking about ur afterlife/what god would think of xy is a pretty toxic thing cause it restricts actions/thinking. Then again I know some very smart ppl that believe in god. But interestingly they never bother about the consequences, but focus on the positive values of the beliefe. I think that's a great mindset
It's much easier to whip religious people into an obedient frenzy over hate than it is love. I'm sorry your family is part of such a hateful congregation. I hope you can escape and be your true self sooner rather than later. You don't deserve to be tortured by these lies they're filling your head with. Family means nothing if they abuse you, which forcing you to attend a church full of people who hate you is doing. My angry ass can't help much, but I believe in you to love yourself and not let their twisted view on religion make you someone you know you aren't. Good luck, friend.
I spent most of my life doing everything the church told me to... I was a walking freakin' Aerosmith song, for Pete's sake! I gave tens of thousands of dollars to the church, bought hundreds of dollars of groceries for upstanding church members when things got tough for them, and burned hundreds of dollars of secular music because they told me to... but, I was still a pervert in their eyes. It didn't matter what I did... and when I needed them to help me feed my children, they told me to give more tithe.

My advice is that you take care of yourself. If they can't accept you for who you are, find a church that does. Jesus died for the broken, not for those who look for logs where only splinters lie.

I left the church. I still pray with my children, but I have never found peace or redemption from the church who is supposed to love me.


That being said, one of the Lutheran denominations has a support group for trans people.
I'm trans and I'm a Christian.  ""It is by grace we are saved through faith"".

In other words, it's not what you do or don't do.  It's what you believe.

Right after my gender confirmation operation, my surgeon said that scientists had discovered that in MTF a rush of estrogen comes down the tube and into the baby.  This happens after the secondary sex characteristics are developed but before the brain is fully developed.  So, then the brain develops more like a female brain.

So, you were born this way!

God loves ALL of his children.  :)
There are churches out there who are accepting - per his request (he was tired of being misgendered) I outed my son as trans at my church. I got back nothing but love.

Have faith, and I hope you can find a place to feel loved and accepted for who you truly are. They do exist.
I hope you can read this after you've taken a break from the comments.

I won't say anything about religion. I just want to suggest you to find your answers.  Don't go to the church, don't go to your parents, don't go to us.

I'm not trying to say ""pick yourself up by the bootstraps"". I'm trying to tell you to see the world with your own eyes. Question life, and answer those questions with the information you can obtain on your own volition.

It's good to be a free thinker. It's good to challenge the status quo.  You might derive the same answer, you might not.

I'm sure you'll figure things out. 

You are your own person and you're free to make your own decisions. Don't let anyone take your right to choose away.
I was raised catholic, and I understand your conflicting feelings. I went to multiple churches(catholic, non denomination christian, islam, baptist, Jehovah’s Witness) and the way i see it from all those points of views is that God made us the way we are and made us to be challenged with the way we are. God made us trans and knew it would challenge us! God loves us and wants us to become the best version of ourselves in order to inspire and help others in need, the bible was written more in parables than absolutes and it has been changed so much from the greed of humans that it would be preposterous to take it 100% literally. But if you do believe in God then from the teachings we can delineate that we were created the right way and God loves us for being that way(as long as it doesn’t infringe on the God given rights of others. being gay or trans or anything not straight and cis does not infringe on their rights). 
Be you, and do what’s best for your survival, I’m here if you want to talk more, I’ll try to send a message as well just to reach out❤️
It's almost like religion is based on worshipping old ideals written 2000 years ago and resists any change.
Hi, I’m a former ordained pastor of 16yrs. When I came out and transitioned, the church fired me. Here’s what I’d offer. God is bigger than any church or religion. Whatever you call her, the divine cannot be captured as TRUTH by any tradition, even if they claim otherwise. It’s true that You might find it helpful to hang out with other trans Christians. I have found this little affirming queer spiritual community to be immensely helpful. https://www.transmissionministry.com/ They also have a really active kind gentle helpful discord server if you’re into that kind of thing. I had to work through some of the feelings you are describing about having fear regarding God‘s acceptance. Ultimately, I believe that God made me trans, loves me because of it, and that some part of my purpose in life is directly connected to me embracing it. Also, I believe that God is love, and that love is ultimate reality, and that there is no possible way that i or people in my life could be more loving than God. I love myself more than ever, now that I have become honest, and many people in my life are just the same thing. I find it impossible that people or myself could love me more than God. Therefore, God loves me even more, and exactly as I am. Feel free to DM me if you want. Sometimes people call this work deconstructing. And it’s totally OK however it turns out for you. If you’re trans or not, if you’re Christian or not, if you attend church or not, you are enough.
What? I don't know what this means.
Ikr? Plus I'm also gay in addition to being trans so I feel extra lucky
How I have been explained to it is that god only ask for 10% no more no less, and it goes to the church to help save more people. The argument for asking for 10% is saying its not a lot like if you had a billion dollars and gave 10% you would still have 900 million dollars you are still really rich
Yep, that second paragraph. And there's nothing in the Bible that says you can't be trans, no matter how you shake it.
I never thought of it like that. Adam and Eve were just dropped into a forest with nothing, even the guy in Primitive Technology has shorts and knowhow, the first people in the bible didn't even have that. But we made clothes, houses, farms, fire even!
God also made us with birth defects and sicknesses. Christians who are being consistent should eschew all medical treatments and health insurance.
Thank you
Thank you, this really has helped me more than the people that have said, ""Religion is Stupid"" and stuff like that. I am so happy that someone took time out of there day to right a entire comment helping me. Thank you.
I am 13 I am forced to go
The thing is, I can't even transition I want to, but my parents wouldn't let me as they are transphobic as they believe what our church says.
They won't listen, I might just try listening to services online that aren't terrible and put me down.
I can't I am 13 I have to go to the one my parents force me to go to.
Also, ""God made trans people for the same reason it made wheat but not bread and grapes but not wine, so that humanity could share in the act of creation""
Jesus said nothing about trans people. He said a lot about love though, and how you should love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus thought you should love yourself, and show that love in your community, and prove it through your good works. That's what all that stuff is about. The kind of love that Jesus talked about is radical and inclusive and revolutionary. The kind of love that deeply worried the authorities of his day. Look, if they're not telling you about that, you're in the wrong church and I suggest you leave and do some self-discovery before trying to find a more radically inclusive church. Personally, I'm not ever going back but I was in it for long enough to know when they're doing it wrong.
Read Romans 14 it outlines how old legalistic restrictions from the old testament are invalid. It says Christians are accountable to God alone. If a fellow Christian breaks an old taboo it doesn't make them less Christian. I.e. being gay ect. 

Here's a quote my grandfather a Presbyterian minister shared with me. ""God created trans people for the same reason he made wheat and grapes but not bread and wine. So that we too might participate in the divine alchemy of creation.""
It means that Jesus never said anything against trans people. So how can you go to hell for something that Jesus didn't forbid?
While they certainly spend money on charities and helping people, they also spend their money on significantly less “morally righteous” things

Examples include: 

1) lawsuits defending pedophilic priests

2) teaching abstinence only educational curriculums (proven to be ineffective) 

3) activity in the New York stock exchange (certainly questionable if their intentions are charity)

4) various investments into fraudulent activities (see this story for a great illustration of this point https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57981508.amp 

5) Historically, the church has also been ay-okay with withholding aid from non-Christian’s and those they deem undesirable. Which is a little bit messed up in my humble opinion

6) plenty more examples just ask if you want them 

What I know from personal experience however, is that leaving religion made me substantially happier. Even if it was a tough transition (pun intended!)

That said, I encourage you to believe whatever you wish, I just hope you end being happy!
It has to do with depending on God basically if I remember. You give your first to God and expect that he will give you what you need. That is the faith that you have in Him. It's like having trust that you give to him the best of your labors first and he'll still provide for you. At least that's how the stories are described in the old testament. Obviously it doesn't really come across as well nowadays. I think there's a way to do it for yourself but I think most people don't really think of it that way. And you're right when you make that much money, ten percent isn't much. But when you don't make much, ten percent can be the difference between eating that month and not.

The idea behind it is that God will provide for you whether you have the means to provide for yourself or not. But evangelicalism has made a big deal out of guilt tripping and shaming for it.
Save people from what? God? Sounds like a shakedown. 

“Pay me and worship me or I’ll torture you eternally.”

It’s racketeering in law, sometimes a felony, punishable by possibly more than 20 years if someone were to say “give me money or I’ll torture you”. But we’re cool it when god does it for some reason.

I mean, would you really worship anyone that told you “kiss my feet or I’ll torture you”?
*stupid evangelicals

Not all Christians are this insane, fuck I’m Catholic
I am glad it was useful! It's a tough spot to be in. I hope everything works out!
oh dang.

i would really advise you to bide your time then, until it is safe to leave. you most likely will not be able to come out to anyone (and if you do, please be careful about who you choose to trust). your safety is the most important.

a name i would recommend for you to check out is kevin garcia. they are a pastor who has lots of resources, especially for lgbt youth.

edit: i thought that this was actually a different subreddit and didn’t realize i should have elaborated. kevin is a lovely, gay, mystical, non-binary, christian pastor. they are really popular amongst the “deconstructing” or “exvangelical” crowds and their practice is more so focused on the love, healing, and connection rather than dogma, correct belief, or shame. i really like one of their podcasts, and i’m not even a christian anymore.
Yeah, we wouldn’t want children to escape forced indoctrination. Yes, they can make you go, but they can’t make you accept the hate and bullshit they pedal. Your mind is free. Use that time to learn about how reprehensible the beliefs are that they are pushing. Or just daydream about other things.
Sounds like you’ll have to wait until you are on your own. Maybe keep bringing it up. Let them know how miserable you are.
Do you really enjoy church? Do you really find the message compelling? I am an atheist because I have seen no evidence that convinces me that any religion or gods are true. We have scientific explanations for things and do not need to rely on ancient myths and superstitions. It’s very freeing.
Oh ok well then just remember that, it is A church not YOUR church and just because you HAVE to go doesn't mean you have to listen
The kind of love that worries authorities of *any* day.

Yes, this is what many churches have forgotten. There are some that look at the teachings differently. If you want that connection to church, God and the community see if there are more accepting churches in your area. Churches that teach hate aren't as valid as they would like to believe.
That quote is amazing. I'll be writing that one down. Also, your grandfather sounds like a good man.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

anyone else tired of being associated with drag?	"I know historically the trans community and the drag community are deeply intertwined, I get that. But I'm so tired of every conversation about trans identities being trans - - - > drag - - - > to I'm not even going to say it bc we all know and I don't want it to pop up in searches. It's exhausting.
Especially because a lot of time drag feels like a mockery to me as a trans woman. And I know enough of the history to know that it isn't, I'm just weird. But I wish my identity wasn't immediately associated with a performance art

Edit ::: since it needs saying, I'm not bashing drag and the impact it's had on dismantling gender roles or trying to dimish it
Someone in a comment used the term performative femininity which is much better description. I dislike that my identity is immediately associated with the performance aspect"	"Kind of. Of course I have nothing against them, it just stinks when people automatically assume I'm into drag shows and Ru Paul's Drag Race when they find out I'm a trans woman. It feels like they thinks my womanhood is a masquerade as much as drag queens' one is. And I hate when drag queens, crossdressers etc do post their pictures in **trans specific subreddits**, it's something that gets under my skin, especially when they do it whit the same accounts they uses to post in porn subbreddits.
I am going to preface this by saying I have nothing against people that are gender non-conforming, crossdress, or do drag. 

I do however get upset when, as a trans woman, I'm trying to present fem, and even in progressive spaces, people are very hesitant to gender me correctly due to a fear of alienating one of the above groups. I understand that I'm not more important than other groups but it IS painful. Sometimes it feels like passing is impossible because of the drive towards gender abolition and non-conformity. As a binary trans woman who actively WANTS to conform this is incredibly frustrating for me, as I feel like it makes it harder for me to be taken seriously as my gender.

No hate to people though, I seriously do love you and I understand these are my issues not yours
Yeah, I wish people could understand the distinction better. I am not a cisgender gay man taking part in a theatrical event, and I don't want to be mixed up with one ... that said, of course, there's an element of solidarity in being part of a community that doesn't adhere to expected gender expression. Yeah, sometimes it feels like it borders on a mockery, and I'm sort of ambivalent about that, but it doesn't help anyone any for me to criticize drag queens for it, in my opinion. I think as trans people that sort of over-the-top expression can feel uncomfortable, because we want to achieve a genuine and natural gender expression, but if we want people to respect our expression, we have to stand up for theirs, too -- even if there's very different motivations. 

When I come out to people I take a minute to explain the differences between crossdressers, drag queens and transgender women (without saying anything judgmental about anybody), but I find it mostly goes over people's heads in the moment and we circle back around to address it again later, if it comes up.
We unfortunately cannot be separated from drag artists when laws claiming to be targeted at drag performances are being used to take away our rights too. It would be nice if people could understand that drag queens are not inherently trans. I’m a transfem enby, and after I came into work in a skirt once I overheard my coworkers discussing if I was a drag queen. Just goes to show how little allocishet people know about queer people
I have no problem with people who do drag. I wore drag on stage once, long before I came out, and it was super euphoric for me and fun.

That said, doing drag and being transgender are very very different. I went to a drag show after starting my transition and it made me uncomfortable as hell -- mostly because I feel like cis people do not understand \*why\* they are so different. I'm putting all this work into looking like a woman because that's what I actually am, not as a performance.

Drag shows and drag storytimes have become media circuses in the U.S. lately and I think it's mostly because the conservative protestors (and much of the media itself) are conflating drag with being trans. Conservative assholes want the public to think that being trans is a show or a costume. So yes, it bugs me that drag is getting so much media attention in a way that associates it with being trans.
It causes me great dysphoria too and the difficult thing is people, most of the time, mean well.
[removed]
Thank you for this conversation because as a CIs bi male some of my friends want to go support our local drag shows and it might be a fun thing however I would like to go with my GF who has transitioning but I was trying to figure out if it would inappropriate to ask her or if it might be insulting. I am open to your opinions on this. Thank you
I value drag queens as part of the lgbt community......but yes.   It's a paradox, but it is one of the many reasons transwomen, transfems and enby's stand as a group apart within the larger lgbt community.
Regardless of how drag affects how others perceive me, drag has most certainly affected how I perceived being trans before I discovered that I was trans.

I’ve always thought I wanted to be a woman but I could not relate to what I saw in drag culture. It wasn’t until trans people got more mainstream exposure that I realised how little drag and being trans are related.

Not that I blame drag, it’s an innocent act. I blame how society had marginalised being trans. So yeah, I hate being associated with drag. It reminds me of the fact that most people probably still have the same misconceptions as I had.
My ex tried to manipulate me into drag or just being non conforming over transition, despite the fact that I had explicitly said I am Trans. I love femboys and drag queens but I wish people would take me at my word when I tell them I'm Trans.
I agree. As s trans woman, drag feels like a mockery of my identity. That having been said, I support the freedom of drag artists to express themselves, whatever my feelings on the matter.
[removed]
So many people they they hear Trans think drag, when they should think Trans.
drag makes me incredibly dysphoric and uncomfortable
I've never seen anyone associating drag queens to trans women, except for dumb conservatives. Honestly, Im never going to get why so many trans women have a problem with drag... If you dont like it that's fine, but jeez, Im tired of hearing how yall hate it all the time.
I (ftm) personally do drag, and even I dislike how when I tell someone I do drag they like agree with it a little too hard. Like I'm fitting into the perfect stereotype in their head, the boy who can't really let go of womanhood..... but that's not why I do it at all. I especially hate when my doing drag then associates any transfemmes I know into also being drag queens, I refuse to let anyone make that assumption
No. Hope this helps.
Ya i feel weard about drag, A im not super out going and don't like the performance to include trying to give me a 6 second lap dance or jumping on my table.. But also the connection to me preforming my ""gender"" like we are different thanks, but on the flip side my local Pflag and pride organizations can use drag events for fundraising and awareness helping to brake some of the stigma and help the lgbt community. So as much as I dislike the association its quite useful having such outgoing types and oftens doors for closeted individuals.
i honestly don't like drag at all and never have, nor any of the extremely gay male centric yaaaaaskween shit, but it's all under the LGBT umbrella and it all gets my solidarity if not my enthusiasm. aint none of us can afford to be easy targets right now.
I've always felt like drag is more a satire of gender roles rather then a mockery of womanhood but yeah I agree. I've had multiple cis friends say to me I would make a good drag queen, which is a comment that makes me feel dysphoric as fuck, it makes me feel like on subconscious level that they don't see me as a woman no matter how inclusive they may appear.
Yes.  Tired.  I support everyone to be who they see themselves being.  But these are two very different things.  I know some identify as CD and then later have awareness of gender incongruity.  I am not approximating a gender.  There is an internal emotional and mental dissonance between my gender and the gender assigned to me at birth.  Don’t like being lumped together in social media groupings.
Very
Omg yes when my egg was first cranking my wife thought I would like drag race and I was like ok sure I'll try it out. I could not make it through an episode.
It’s done on purpose so it’s easier to corral all the people they don’t like under one slur umbrella.
YES!!!
I understand the friction that exists between performance and identity, and I'm not criticising you. Nor do I think you're opposed to drag.

But you gotta understand that for the most part, our communities and allies don't equate drag and trans people (obviously some trans people do drag, but that's different). The ones who equate trans people and drag don't care about the distinctions, and they want to obliterate us all, no matter the specifics of identity. 

We must be in solidarity with anyone who is the target of transphobia and queerphobia because to do otherwise it amounts to selling out other victims of the same oppression - and ultimately it will harm trans people as well. While not all drag performers are trans, the opposition to them \*is\* transphobia all the same, because the perpetrators don't care about the difference.

When I see an attack on a drag show, all I see is an attack on all of us, because that's all it can be.
maybe you should watch paris is burning? I get where you're coming from but the distinction between transness and drag is fairly modern. the conception of sexuality as ""something you are"" instead of ""how you behave"" has really only existed since psychoanalysis in the 1800s, and similarly gender being something you can identify with as opposed to just how you're supposed to perform and behave is a very modern conception. we've always been in the fight with drag performers, and that goes back to the origins of drag with ball culture
I'm not a trans woman, so I can't say I fully understand the frustration, but let me ask you this: do the people who see trans women as just men in drag, do you really think their opinion matters? It's straight up ignorant and transphobic, and the topic of crossdressing can also be misinterpreted by the same group of people, yeah? Don't let that get to you. Also, what people don't quite understand is that drag queens aren't women, they're men in a costume. They are called she/her in drag, and he/him (or another preferred pronoun) out of drag. This aligns more with genderqueer/genderfluidity than anything else, and those that don't see it that way are just ignorant.
No, and this question is asked constantly on here and other trans subs. The only people I see comparing being trans and doing drag are: conservatives, and young/recently out trans girls  who need educating about the intersections between trans and drag history.
Queerness is a very big family!

Queerness is the unity of sexuality, gender, and romantic identities.

Queerness is deeply individual and there are as many ways to express ones queerness as there are queer people in the world.

Drag, crossdressing, nonbinary genders, Trans experiences, and sexual expression challenge norms and are inherently connected because they're all under the Queer umbrella.

Growing in our understanding of queer community means accepting, embracing, and honoring all those who are Queer and uplifting the magic that is queerness.

Each individual experience is unique. But wishing that other queers weren't associated with XYZ identity is counter to community unity and solidarity, and frankly reveals more about our own insecurities.

Drag is a path to exploring nonbinary gender constructs. It is performance and also identity exploration. For many trans folx drag is the only expression they feel comfortable exploring. We don't live in a black and white world, all things are shades of the rainbow and overlap.

I hate that people don‘t get that dressing as my agab feels like involuntary drag to me.  
It‘s really not that hard to understand imho.
I completely agree with you. For the longest time I was against drag as a whole because I saw them as an extreme mockery of us, I thought average people would see drag and compare them to us in a bad way—like a bad apple spoiling the bunch. Tbh I still have my issues with drag but I don’t go out of my way to dismantle them.
I can understand being tired of it. I'm not tired of it necessarily, but I'm not really a fan of drag personally. 

It's really just not my brand of entertainment.
I have nothing against it though and I definitely appreciate how great they are at performing. I also appreciate all they've done for queerness.

Having said that, in my town it seems like every trans person is into drag and anime. I'm not, and it's a bit isolating sometimes tbh
they need to be seen separately to properly respect what they are. Like trans women are not just men in dresses, and drag queens are not just men who want to be women. They’re separate things and it’s necessary to keep in mind that you don’t have to conform to your gender to be your gender
Fuck yes.
So I actually definitely relate to this, because as soon as people find out I’m trans (I stealth pass at this point, so this situation is rare, but still) they immediately assume I must be into drag, but like??? I’m really really not?? I don’t even like drag shows, like, at all. Over the top aesthetics are not at all my thing. I have nothing against drag, or the people who enjoy it, but it bugs me that something that is so far removed from anything I have any interest in is somehow inextricably associated with me for seemingly no reason.
I came out to my mom last month and she thought I just wanted to be a drag queen!
I just wanted to say. That part at the end was me. I grew up thinking i was just some dumb horny crossdresser. But after a few years i realize im actually a trans woman and im just getting started on my journey. And i have to say although i do agree with your views now that i am a trans woman. I see some of those people as just people who havent discovered themselves yet. And theyre on their own journey and so i do not harness and disdain from them. Instead i puty them as they may only be on the veryy early part of their journey
Do u decide who is a cross dresser and who is trans? If
It's really weird, because in the drag community the etiquette is to refer to the person in drag as the gender they present, SPECFICALLY because it honors actual trans people who are trying to present binary. 

This is why Drag Queens in drag are ""she"" and Drag Kings in drag are ""he"" and gender fuck drag is ""they"" or ""it"" depending on what the performer goes by.  

I feel like we've lost a lot of the culture knowledge around our community movements, so these inclusive safe guards of respect are not being done or are lost....
You shouldnt have to apologize for speaking a direct and backed up opinion.
This is a paradox to us as well, because we also want to pass as a woman, but we also revel in smashing gender norms, especially in terms of fashion and behavior.
this sums up my thoughts perfectly
Yep, that's why anytime anyone acts like that I make sure to inform them I use she/her so they know I don't fall into one of the other groups. At least in progressive spaces it usually works but it would be nice to not have to do that at all.
Yeah I feel this as well
I definitely feel this a lot...but there's a double-edged sword of bigotry to our advantage. Because a lot of drag queens are over the top, out there, and not focused exclusively on passing, a lot of idiots who conflate drag and transness go out looking for those types of people. They're looking for the 6'2"" bearded man in a bedazzled dress, not a 5'7"" lady in a skirt with a pronounced chin.
for one thing, trans women can do drag if they like, but doing drag obviously does not make you trans! I have a friend who is a trans woman who is really good at drag performance and it is her art
This one scares me. I’m a musician and a lawyer. One thing that instantly struck me in reading some of these proposed laws is that they’re written so broadly that they would essentially make it impossible for trans people to be ordinary performing musicians. 

For example, there is a proposed Texas law making it so any performance including someone not dressed as their assigned gender at birth can only be done in specially classified adult oriented business establishments like strip clubs.  What the fuck, I just want to play music, like I’ve done my entire life.
This is part of what I was trying to get at. A few people here have asked if the opinions of the people who conflate the two matter bc it's mostly from conservatives. But this right here is exactly why it does matter and is extremely concerning
[removed]
[removed]
Just ask. Your partner may be questioning, but if y’all are going as a group I wouldn’t find it insulting or considered specifically directed at her. Now if she was the only trans or questioning person you knew AND you wouldn’t have gone to a drag show otherwise and she hasn’t expressed interest in those things, it might come off as offensive.
>For me, I think my issue more with drag is how shows like Ru Paul have made it more of a straight person thing,

And taking that one step further, those same straight people who watch it might think that's it's not far off from what trans is.

This is my fundamental issue, along with the point of this thread. Yeah CDs, Drag Queens/Kings, NB, and Trans all have the goal of dismantling gender expectations, but the terms are being mushed together and I have to explain to someone, who doesn't really know better, that I don't get ready and dressed up the same way people in Drag do. Once again no hate towards the Drag community, but there is heavy information that is not being clarified.

The thing that pisses me off the most, is how the trans umbrella can exists but there isn't any gay umbrella. Lesbian is it's own category and not roped in with Gay. But yet because Drag, NB, CDs, and trans all get roped into one category due to ignoring gender norms and expectations, there is no way to educate people who don't want to actively seek out the differences between all of them.

This makes dealing with transphobic people THAT much harder.
Look at any of the pictures from the recent drag protests. There's always trans pride flags. Like in this CNN story:

[https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/lgbtq-drag-queen-far-right-protests-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/lgbtq-drag-queen-far-right-protests-intl/index.html)

And of course the article also talks about trans issues a bunch. Why?? Obviously they're associating drag with being trans.

CNN isn't some crazy conservative news outlet. And the people carrying trans pride flags presumably aren't conservatives. I get that they're showing solidarity among all LGBT+ people and that's great. But the average person sees these stories and doesn't get that nuance.
It’s more that we are frustrated when people draw parallels between drag and gender identity.
I generally try to keep my dislike of drag to myself, but my biggest issue is that it seems to be the default entertainment at queer events. I just want more variety.
The problem is that those dumb conservatives are passing bills that are targeting trans women and using drag as justification. Obviously that's bullshit as justification but it's still frustrating. Especially when even in queer spaces I've had people assume I love drag just bc I'm trans
Thank you for the recommendation, that sounds really interesting!! I'll have to give it a watch
Their opinions matter when they're the ones writing and voting on laws and who should be in power
Their opinion matters when they vote for politicians who create laws that hurt us.
Yeah it has nothing to to with drag but just with ignorant people
As I said in the post, I know the history. That doesn't make it any less exhausting to have everyone assume my femininity is a performance
They're not separate.
There's plenty of overlap.
They're different and one can be both or one or the other.
But they're not entirely separate.
No it’s not because of us being united. Sexuality, and gender have always been related in peoples minds. People used to think gay men had the spirits of women, and then it shifted to trans women being just exceptionally gay men. There’s also a lot of overlap between different groups. If we try to stand on our own we’re easier to knock down. Being united also helps people who don’t know where they fall or who can’t fit neatly into a label.

Throwing drag preformed under the bus isn’t going to help trans people, and there are trans drag performers too.
😬
[removed]
Thank you
Dividing ourselves to appease fascist straight legislators is… well, not a *winning* strategy, I don’t think, but also not a moral one.
Ok, but don't be frustrated at drag, be frustrated at dumb conservatives instead.
It is tho. Gender is a performance. Everyone is performing their gender whether they’re cis or trans.
You’re right, i didn’t mean to say they’re 100% mutually exclusive, I meant they need to be seen as separate identities but you can be both. After all nothing is ever simple enough to be defined with labels. I just wanted to say that it’s important to see that they are different things, the trans women aren’t just men in dresses and vice versa that i mentioned. But yeah you’re 100% right and it’s important to keep in kind that nothing is black and white so thank you
[removed]
And I'm not saying we should do that. I'm just trying to point out the flaw in saying that this opinion doesn't matter
No they shouldn't be separate.
Because they're not separate.
Separate means there's no overlap, there's no connection, there's no association, and that's not true.
Drag performers and Trans folx are intrinsically connected, they're queers challenging the gender binary, each in their own way, in different ways, but still connected though different.
[removed]
No that would be exclusive, maybe separate is the wrong word but we’re saying the same thing. Like i mean they’re not synonyms, they’re separate ideas, maybe unique is the word I’m looking for. Like each term is its own thing, trans is not drag, drag is no trans, so they’re separate. You can be trans and do drag, they’re not exclusive, but they’re independent concepts
No, they're literally not separate ideas.
Different doesn't mean synonym.
This argument is dangerously close to Jim Crow era ideas of separate but equal.
It's gross
this is absolutely hilarious to me because you’re response contributed almost nothing to the conversation you just made an obvious statement and then tried to scream biggot at me like it was a valid critique.

separate means they’re not connected, that doesn’t they don’t have commonalities, and i never said they’re mutually exclusive. But they must be understood as unique identities and concepts. To not do so is invalidating both things. Idk what you need me to say for you to understand what I’m trying to say. So I’ll just restate what I said earlier and that should make it clear. Trans women are not men in dresses, and drag queens do not just want to be women. Now you could have a drag queen who is trans and wants to be a woman, all I’m saying is the base ideas are not variants of the same thing. They’re under the umbrella of weird gender shit that just happens and is way to complicated to ever explain fully. But they are different things. Idk how else you want me to explain this

A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
I live in Michigan, and I just started crying. In a good way.
Unless you work in a right to work state then you can be fired for anything. I worked with a guy who had shells on the ends of his braids to lock them in place. The owner told him he had to take them out because it looked unprofessional. Well a week went by and he didn’t take them out so they fired him.
That's one for the good guys and gals! 💗✊
Can't wait to move back to the Great Lakes. I miss Michigan something fierce.
Thank fucking God I live in this state. Good luck to the trans girls and guys living in southern states; you're gonna need it.
I love my state so much ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
Absolutely based for MI to be doing this while so many states are trending the opposite way

And, like she pointed out, it's just smart to not be excluding people from living in your state

can someone help me cos im so confused about whats going on (i called monday this week and they said they had referred me to a GDC - im 17 btw)		"You won’t be able to get into the child one while you’re still a child, basically. Therefore, in three years when you can get in, they won’t accept you bc you’re an adult.

Have your doctor refer you to the adult clinic
Hi, word of advice (also from the UK):

As stated in the above letter, waiting times of 3 years isn't going to change even if you join the adult care. You should still go ahead and get a referal but you are 100% better off going private. When I started, it cut down the 3+ years of waiting to 6 months... Big difference. 'Shop around', as it were, and reach out to as many gender clinics as you can. Get some quotes for treatment and decide what's best for you. In the mean time, do as much social transistion as possible, this will help things go a lot smoother for you. Google free deedpoll and get your name change if you haven't already, it's actually really easy to do.

Any questions, feel free to DM me. It's a hard process, but you'll get there.

Goodluck! x
So basically, they’re saying they’re booked up, and you’re going to have to probably go to the adult clinic as by the time they’re able to do your first appointment at the Youth one, you’ll be 18 or older
I hate to break it to you sis but most of the wait is a lot longer than 3 years, you’re old enough to be referred to an adult GIC, which have waitlists anywhere from 3 to 20 years, you can pick which one you get referred to, so hopefully it won’t be too long, but either way you should look into private healthcare (or r/transdiy) because the NHS will likely keep you waiting into your 20s.
As other people have said this is just because when you hit 17 they realise you might not get appointments for what your looking for until after you turn 18. Then youll be considered an adult and be seen in the adult one. This happened to me and they do keep into consideration any wait you already had. I think I was 16 almost 17 when I was referred by the time it came around I was advised the same thing and they took the wait time into consideration for me. I think I was finally seen at 20 but decided to go privately in the meantime
As someone who’s under Arden and gems, they’re transferring everyone to local services now (not sure exactly where as they haven’t specified), especially those under 18 (since GIDS has been dissolved and no longer exists). If you’re lucky, you may be seen in 2026.
It's saying by the time the child services can get to you, you will have aged out of their remit, so they are giving you two options to access your care in a different way by being seen as an adult.
3 years!?!
Idk looks like they are saying that you need to do to the adult clinic 🤷🏼‍♀️
At 17 you should be referred to the adults one already
 Nhs? I wish you luck. From what i understand American free health care is better than NHS for trans stuff 😬
You should look into genderGP
I’m not sure what route you’d plan on doing, but if I were you, if your going to college or uni, having a student loan would help a lot if you’re worried about being able to afford it. Or, alternatively, a part time job. Either way, you got this girl! 😊
Dearest Trans people, please watch a video on YouTube by philosophy tube on how she struggled to get an appointment in England.
She is an English trans woman, and she shared her experience with the NHS with her audience (it was not good). If you're looking for information, I just want you to know that you can find out alittle about how it works there.

I think it's titled ""I emailed my doctor 133 times"" or its on the thumbnail. Best of luck.
Damn 3 years waiting time, you guys over there in England are f*cked meow
you’re too old my guy
do you know if they have records of which gp i saw last time?
Ew private. I only say that as I have no insurance so that’s my problem. I don’t have the economic means to afford private care but I have no other option cause there is no government option for me. So I just get to be a chronically depressed person.
@-@

could my gp have referred me to a different one?
my plan is to do a bit of private if i can and cut costs of everthting down so i have as much money as possible for it :)
ik its stupid you have to wait that long 😭😭
ik i think my gp had a brain fart while filling out the form or smth
yep T\^T
I read this the same as the above poster. Its unfortunate but not super complicated. There might be another child service, otherwise you're waiting a year.

Its almost certain you gave them a referral letter with your referring GP's details attached.
Well, everyone's situation is different. Here in the UK, we have the National Health Service who provide free healthcsre for all including trans care. Trouble is, there isn't enough money being put in that sector which leads to things like 3+ years of waiting lists.

I'm sorry you're in a shitty situation but I'm just trying to give advice. I was once in this position too and everything is scary. Doesn't hurt to have some guidance.
No one has insurance in the UK that’s no how it works everyone gets free at the point of service healthcare on the NHS or you can pay out of pocket for private care. Private care is also not the ludicrous amount of money it costs in the US.
Im saving to move to somewhere with cheaphrt like norway or Denmark
Ask your GP to refer you to the adult one
Make sure to show your GP that letter when you ask for a referral to the adult clinic!!
Most private places want you to be 18, so it might be a good idea to save up until then, GenderGP do see anyone over 16, but they are quite expensive and not an ideal option.

If you’re having money issues, then r/transdiy is an option, very thorough research and caution is required, but it is very cheap in comparison.

Good luck with everything!
Not all adult GICs accept referrals from 17. The best thing to do is look at the websites for the ones closest to where you live. Ask your GP to ask them to honour the time from the original referral which A&G picked up.
*hugs* meow meow
i called the gp and they have a letter to fill in to refer me to the adult one but my gp isnt in atm and he was nice so im 100% sure he will fill it in as soon as he can so im gonna call in 7 days to see if there are any updates, fingers crossed i can start hrt next year or sooner :)
Oh yeah by any means didn’t meant to try and derail your point. I’m just personally not in best mindset but that’s the usual with chronic depression I don’t realize I’m going down a depressive rabbit hole til way too late. 


Just so easy cause to me I feel I’m being real and objective at the time. I’m US. I’m aware of some issue trans people face in UK thanks to philosophy tube.
they have already seen it 😎😎😎
thank you, appreciate the help :3

Let's talk about Detransitions	"Detransitions (or Retransitions as some prefer to call them) are a bit of a sore spot in the trans community and not talked about often, mostly because of how much they are regularly weaponized against us.

I think that's a mistake. We have much to learn from the stories of people who regret transitioning, both to help prevent other people from making the same mistake, but also because it can really help people who are unsure about transitioning get over their doubts. 

So, let's talk about detransitions.

# Foreword

Detransitions are rare. Even among those who do detransition, the vast majority don't do it because they aren't transgender. Some can't afford the hormones. Some can't deal with the transphobia they experience in their lives. Some can't deal with the sexism that comes with living as a woman. Many just detransition temporarily for various reasons. Some realize they're non-binary and fully or partially detransition to be closer to their ideal self.

However, even then there are some people, who regret transitioning and realize they were never transgender after all. Not many, but they do exist, and with people wanting to transition being on the rise globally (yay), there's pretty much inevitably going to be more people who'll regret transitioning as well.

In order to keep that number as low as possible, it's really important to identify the factors that are usually involved in making someone falsely suspect they might be trans.

# Down the Rabbit Hole

This all started very personally motivated. I only came out to myself last month, and I'm still a bit (irrationally) unsure about really being trans. After hearing of TERFs ranting about detransitions one too many times, I was afraid I might end up regretting transitioning, and so I decided to go down the rabbit hole of written testimonials and youtube videos of people who actually did regret detransitioning to see if I had anything in common with them.

Some were very respectful, others, unfortunately, leaned heavily into transmed narratives and demanded more restrictions on things like hormones.

**What I found was quite interesting, because there's** ***definitely*** **a pattern to detransitions.** I wasn't even surprised that there was a pattern, I kind of expected that. However, what really surprised me was just how incredibly similar all the stories were. 

Out of all the testimonials I saw about people detransitioning because they were cis, pretty much every single one had at least two out of these three as the *main* reasons why they initially decided to transition:

1. They were very gender non-conforming (tomboys or femboys) and felt excluded because of it
2. They always hung out with kids of the opposite gender and didn't get along with kids of their own gender
3. They were gay or lesbian and hoped they would experience less discrimination for their relationships as the other gender

What all three of these have in common is that they are about gender expression and not wanting to stand out in society.

When I compared their experiences with mine I found that my own reasons for being trans are much more intrinsic in nature. Yes, I would like to try dresses at some point and yes, I did often find girls easier to get along with than dudebros, but much more than that I just want to be a girl and be seen as a girl by other people.

If I lived in a world where men wore dresses and makeup, and women were expected to play football/soccer as kids, and straight relationships were considered weird, and gay relationships normal, that wouldn't really change anything about me wanting to be a girl. I might end up being a gender-non-conforming girl (heck I'm probably going to be a little bit non-conforming even now), but it's the girl part that's important to me, not the conforming part.

Personally, I came out of reading these stories feeling much more secure about my own decision to transition.

I ended up writing about this earlier today in response to another poster who also felt insecure after hearing about detransitions one too many times, and it apparently helped her as well, so I decided this might actually warrant a full post of its own.

# Conclusion

So yeah, to any questioning or unsure trans people out there, if you feel like there's something inexplicably magical about the idea of being another gender, regardless of how that gender is treated by society, then you almost certainly didn't just accidentally fool yourself into thinking you might be trans. Stop doubting yourself and be the gender that makes you happy!

Now, if on the other hand, you found that you relate to some of the detransitioner perspectives, then I am potentially very sorry for making your doubts worse. I'm not here to gatekeep. I only looked at the perspectives of detransitioners for this. Just because people who ended up detransitioning feel that way, doesn't mean, that there aren't people with very similar experiences happily living the transitioned high-life.

A question that might help you figure yourself out further is ""Is this really about my gender identity and/or body, or would I be more happy living as a gay femboy or lesbian tomboy in a community that fully accepts me for what I am?"" Try to concentrate on intrinsic matters as much as possible. If your primary reasoning for one over the other is mostly about practical issues (""Being a femboy is probably easier than taking meds and coming out to everyone"", or ""The trans community is so welcoming to me, but I don't know how to find a community of lesbian tomboys"") then there's a good chance you'll end up regretting it latter.

# What About Non-Binaries

This post has been pretty binary-trans-focused so far, because that's where my own personal experiences lie. I don't know how well it applies to non-binary trans people.

From all the ""Someone called me they today and holy shit, I'm so happy!"" posts I've seen in this sub and others, I would assume that most enbies share a similar experience of there being something intrinsically magical about being seen as both genders, neither gender, or something in between.

However, I might be wrong about that. **If you are non-binary and have your own thoughts and experiences to share on this, please do, and I will link your post here.**"	"Some detransitioners also don't detransition because they're cis, but because their social circle didn't accept them being trans and they want to go back into the closet. It's pretty messed up.
Thank you for the research, we should all be looking into why ppl feel the need to transition as a whole that also includes de-transitions. Got banned from /ftm for just mentioning this topic despite it being relevant to the thread- it’s a touchy subject that we need to discuss more really
All this research is well appreciated and makes alot of sense
Being 54 and trans and now just getting serious about transitioning.  I feel that everyone's reasons to transition or de transition are extremely personal.  Regardless, make sure you transition or detransition for the right reasons.  I dont fully understand why I  am trans.  I do known I feel better about myself in girl mode than guy mode.  Whoever you are or whatever you do or who ever you are.  You are enough.  Your body will not be exactly perfect.  This is true even with cis people.  In fact I just tried on a girls swimsuit today and thought it would be cute.  It did not look good on me.  I could be upset.  Instead I choose to laugh about it and know next time look at the body shape.  Its not like being a guy just throwing on swim trunks and go.  Whatever you do please be body positive.  Treat others like you  want them to treat you.  And treat yourself like you want to be treated.  If you are bv tempted to self harm please get help right away.  You are worth it and I care about you.  Love Andrea
I did something similar in terms of going into a rabbit hole of testimonials of cis-identifying detransitioners when I was in the worst of my questioning because my dad is convinced that I'm going to be one. I noticed a couple other common threads, I'd be curious to know if you agree:

1. They rushed into it without thinking much.
2. They thought it would solve some other, external problem like their sexuality (similar to what you said about being gay but also for ace/aro identities from what I've seen) or their mental health problems or body image problems.

So I guess it's good to think about it a lot and, in that, think about what you're wanting to get out of the transition. A lot of trans people I've heard the stories of say they weren't expecting it to help as much as it did--they just wanted to alleviate dysphoria and along the way had other positive impacts. Something to think on I suppose.
Thank you very much, it has been a very interesting reading. I think you started a long meditation in me on the subject :)

>When I compared their experiences with mine I found that my own reasons for being trans are much more intrinsic in nature.

Emphasis mine. Damn, this helps. Thanks
I also went down the rabbit hole on detransitioners and came out the other side more sure that I'm trans than ever. And your comment on just wanting to be seen as a girl is super relatable to me. The post that made me more sure than ever, I shall repost here so that anyone in the future finding this thread on their own rabbit hole journey can find their peace like I did.

———

Say the following out loud and pay very careful attention to how it makes you feel.

I am a man.

I am a woman.

I am neither a man nor a woman.

I am both a man and a woman.

I will be a man for the rest of my life.

I will be a woman for the rest of my life.

I will be neither a man nor a woman for the rest of my life.

I will be both a man and a woman for the rest of my life.

I hope everyone reading this can find their peace.
Wow!! Really good post! You should be a journalist! Very interesting topic as well!
tbh, I think the ""pattern to detransitions"" thing can be made a bit more vague.

from what I noticed, it actually seems to be more like one of two categories:

1. people who felt the need to transition out of heteronormativity and gender expectations (stuff like non-straight people not feeling ""normal"" or gender nonconforming people feeling there's something wrong with not conforming)
2. people who felt the need to transition because of an unrelated life problem (stuff like the classic ""woman to man because male privilege"" thing)

even then though, as I drafted the categories, there's *still* one thing that sticks out: ""**people who felt the need to transition**"".

pretty much EVERY regretful detransition happens because people forced themselves into it despite not clearly discussing with themselves if they truly wanted it. it'll then end up being on the same level to taking chemotherapy because you mistook a stomach ache for cancer.
Being a girl is awesome aaaaaaaa\~ I never knew the feeling of happiness before transitioning.  Everything just feels so right :) I look down and see my body, or do my makeup in the mirror and it all makes me so happy. Even after 3 years of transitioning I still feel intense euphoria from being my correct gender. Sometimes I think like, wow I really have the body of a girl, with boobs, smol thighs, and a nice face. ITS AMAZINGGGG! And then cuddling with my cute boyfriend, HEAVEN. Its just too good. Somehow I even got my voice to pass perfectly. I can die happy now and it will even say my name on my graveyard. I have nobody in real life to tell this stuff to who would understand so i just typed it here
The Trans community standing it’s ground is played the transphobic minority as yet another example of Trans Jack Boots forcing all our youngsters into unwanted transitions from which they all detransition.

Dare one suggest that instead of screaming from the roof tops that no forces any one,  a more softly softly approach is taken. By all means take part in TV debates, news reports, local community debates and politics but use transwoman who easily taken as CIS women.   Let them see that transwoman are no more threatening than any other woman.

There is a photograph floating round the net of a young trans girl holding a banner say I am the scary transgender person that the media warned about.   [Scary Girl ](https://i.imgur.com/UZYxeJY.jpg)


An image like this or a beautiful young woman is a far better answer for the transphobic minority together with factual evidence about the harm not providing treatment for those at risk and by back calls for reviews of why certain people who should have never been allowed to transition takes wind out of their sales.

The U.K. is currently in a position where no one under 17 can receive hormone blockers because of a legal case brought by one individual who says she should never have been allowed to transition to male and she did not get the treatment she really should of had.


The gay community have been generally been accepted into main stream society.   20+ years ago there was no way that was going to happening but with the ever increasing number of gay and lesbian couples and individuals in the media and viable with the local community they have in general been accepted.   Not saying everything is perfect but the gay community is living along side the everyday heterosexual community.

I am hopefully seeing this starting to happen now within the Trans community but to the ill educated if someone is a simple cross dressing they are gay and also into sex acts with children.   Yes all know that ones gender has nothing to do with your sexual preferences and can change on transitioning.

I strongly believe that the only way to defeat the  de-transitioning movement is by the softly softly approach whilst countering their claims to proven facts, not a 100 people survey in the middle of pride but from sources that have to respect.
This may have been the most useful post I have ever read and if I could afford to give you an award for it, I would! I finally came to the realization that I’m trans in December 2020. I refused to read anything about detransitioning because I knew about it, but didn’t want to know why people decided to detransition because I was worried that those reasons would ring true for me and I’d realize it was all just a mistake. And I didn’t want that because I really do want to transition (that should’ve been the obvious answer to me questioning myself... but up until reading you post I was still nervously worrying despite being on testosterone for over a month now). Your research has made me realize that I’m not likely to just realize at some point that this was all wrong. None of the three reasons you listed apply to me. And when I pictured the world you described I realized I still want to transition.

I think you should post another, shorter post that is simply titled: Are you questioning whether you’re actually trans? And then list those three points and the world you imagined. A post like that would’ve really helped me!
I'm a gendefluid AFAB and these are definitely thoughts I went through to figure out my identity! I'm almost 23 and realised that I'm gendefluid about a year ago or so probably (my time perception is borken) and I thought for a while about how I feel about my body and why, if I changed it/could change it how would I feel? Would clothes make up for stuff or would I want my BODY to be different. Also I am obese so I had to think about weather or not I hated/disliked my body because of that or other things too. The conclusion ended up being both. I have very big breast which lead to me not feeling comfortable in masculine clothing and I realized after a lot of thinking and looking back that is wasn't just because I dislike what I looked like in clothes in general, I didn't like to have boobs when trying to present male. 

I have accepted the fact that I'll never pass as male and that is okay, I am always an in-between male and female but I feel more like one or the other sometimes. And that of course explains how I want to present and how I feel comfortable presenting. I am usually a bit more female than male but I still want to feel properly masculine when I feel more male, and my boobs prevent me from doing that. I'm going to have a breast reduction when I'm a normal weight (not allowed before I have a BMI under 25 so..)so that I can have like an A-cup or something. I think that'll be the best compromise as I can look feminine enough for feeling comfortable in dresses and clothes designed for more boobage (which I'll probably wear for a majority of the time as I love female alt-clothing) than most men have but I'll have to give up on the dream to walk topless and flat chested in only bathing shorts on the beach, or just throwing on a tank top and have a flat chest underneath, in return

It's important to think of stuff like this, to take your time and think of scenarios and how you would feel. Think of the pros vs the cons. Would the emotional and physical changes be worth the potential complications and no longer looking the way you did? If you want to look ""both ways"" or have both opposites of something then try to image having one of them and try to feel weather the happiness of having one of them makes you more happy than not having the other makes you unhappy. I don't dislike my genitalia, but if I could wake up tomorrow with the opposite genitalia (fully functioning) I would be happier. But for me it's not worth going though such big surgery, with that many risks of complications only to end up with genitalia that wouldn't fulfill what I want it to be. While for some people just having it at all would make them happier than having what they were born with. Having a vagina doesn't make me unhappy, but having a fully functioning penis would make me happier that having a vagina. Having no boobs would make me happy sometimes but not most of the time, having average sized boobs would make me happy sometimes but not most of the time, but having small boobs would make me happy enough most of the time. I'll use a padded brah if I want to present very feminine and I want some more boobage in the clothes, I'll use a binder if I want to present male and I'll use neither or just a ""normal"" brah when I present more neutral or casually female most of the time. 

I also experience a lot of gender euphoria! I get very happy when my wife calles me her boyfriend or husband, but also when she calls me her wife of course. But for different reasons. ""Wife"" makes me happy because I am her wife and I take a lot of pride in that because I love her and out relationship, while ""boyfriend"" or ""husband"" makes me happy because someone sees me for a different part of who I am, a part that the rest of society doesn't. 

I thought that maybe I'm just a lesbian tomboy, I know of someone who is a tomboy but thought they were trans. They didn't think they could be just a tomboy because it didn't feel like society thought that was okay. But I have always been seen as a tomboy and I never as a child disliked being seen that way. But I have realized that that wasn't all. I also realized that I'm technically not a lesbian since 1. I'm not only a girl and 2. I could definitely be attracted to other non-binary people as long as they are feminine enough in the ""right"" way for what I'm attracted to. Obviously while still having a personality I would like, I am demisexual so the romantic attraction comes first and is the strongest and most important for me. So I guess I would be bisexual then since I'm attracted to more that two genders 🤔 I guess I need to get over my dislike for most how most people hear bisexual and immediately thinks you're attracted to men and women 😅😑 

Sorry for my extreme rambling..I can't help it 😅😁😬
i try to avoid detrans stuff out of fear of several things like many people probably do but i did once watch a 40 minute video on someones story of it cause youtube wouldnt stop reccomending it and i watched hoping she wouldnt end up being phobic. she wasnt that i know of

none of her reasons really made sense like trans wise for transitioning if that makes sense? i dont mean it in a rude way btw. i dont remember the reasons cause its been months but i know none of the reasons boiled down to 'i wanted to be a man' and stuff.

it was also like. wild to hear how well it all went for her anyway, like everyone was accepting and she had gotten hormones pretty fast and iirc she didnt even feel like, super wrong about being a man? but she felt off i think. iirc she also went into all of it fairly fast too which is wild... ive been sitting here for years stuck in nearly the same place cause i cant come out completely let alone access hormones and such but she just went right into it all like it was nothing

i was gonna watch more of her videos cause she seemed interesting but i still have a sense of fear ig. she has a lot of vids about detrans tho but i never watched more than the one.

i have a big sense of fear about being wrong about all this cause of past things that have happened to me, but im trying my best to be sure of myself. stuff like this does help. i mean like, all these reasons i hear cis detrans people say arent anything like mine, or my experiences about it. i mean, what cis person is gonna cry about gender stuff like i do? i cry a lot (in good and bad ways).
Thank you for your insights, that was quite interesting to read and kinda assured me a bit even though there weren't many doubts (some are normal I suppose ^^). So what I read from your findings is simple:if we were GENERALLY more open, accepting and letting people Try themselves out, there would be fewer regret.
When I was coming to terms with my transness, I obsessively looked at detransitioned people and their stories. I wanted to cover absolutely all my bases. I heard people say that there were things they experienced that they didn’t expect to happen. I obsessively wanted to be as prepared as humanly possible. To do as much deep thinking about it as I could. Looking into both the good and the bad. 
I was terrified of talking about it with my family. 
Heck.. I was terrified about talking about deep depression with my family. I was afraid to talk about it with my therapist. (Found a new therapist, talked about it with them) It was just tearing me up inside and I couldn’t get myself to speak about it with anyone for a while. 

This post reminds me of the hole I went down. Making lists of why people do things why people have done things. 

I realized that everyone has their own individual and personal reasons. There are allot of factors that come into play. Some people come to the conclusion that it isn’t right for them when they had been 100% sure for many years. And that’s alright. 

I think it’s good to be informed. And after allot of research and years of waiting and making sure, I’ve more recently made the decision to proceed
The only thing I can garner from those that de-transition and then trash trans rights is that they explored the waters of gender non-conformity but found it too scary and difficult to understand so they sprinted back to their fixed, conservative mindsets.

For example, what’s wrong with transitioning and then transitioning back? Is it because you’ve done “irreparable damage” to your sex organs? Why is that what makes you one gender or the other? And if you disagree with that, what is the thing that causes you to do so?
the only reason i'll detransition is if i don't pass. if i end up looking like a dude in drag i'll detransition and repress to avoid public humiliation.

that or jump off a bridge at that point, reason im transitioning is because i wanna die while trapped in this stupid man body
They may be rare but it'd a super popular topic for.facrbook videos made by mainstream media
This is a great post that clarifies some very important things! Reading it through has already helped me with some of the questions I've been asking myself but have been too nervous to ask other trans people or people who have detransitioned. So thank you so much for this. I do, however, have something that may be interesting to add with regards to my experiences as a nonbinary person.

Brief disclaimer and background: I am nonbinary. I'm out to my friends, open-but-not-out to my coworkers about it, and *sorta* out to my family. My mom knows, and my other household members are kinda vaguely aware that I'm queer but that's the extent of their knowledge. I haven't begun any major social or medical transition yet. I still generally go by the pronouns of my AGAB and have only very recently began experimenting with gender expression in fairly minor ways ~~I'm way too nervous to try flat-out crossdressing, especially since I can hardly bring myself to look myself in the mirror as is~~. As I have not begun transition in any significant way, it follows that I also have not *de*transitioned, obviously.

As you said, the experiences of nonbinary people is typically *very* similar to (and occasionally indistinguishable from) those of binary trans people. I still experience gender dysphoria in the social sphere (people using the wrong pronouns, deadnaming, difficulty with gender expression) and in the physical sphere (dysphoria with regards to my body image - revulsion or hatred of those physiological aspects of me which correlate to my birth sex), and still have the intense intrinsic desire to be (and to be perceived as) something other than either my birth sex or my AGAB.

In addition to these similarities, I also have a lot of worries about detransitioning. On top of financial struggles and difficulty finding a therapist who specializes in trans issues near me, fears regarding detransitioning is one of the key reasons I haven't made serious efforts to begin medically transitioning yet. Here are some of the aforementioned questions regarding transitioning and detransitioning that struggle with:

* What if I'm actually cis and just label a desire to present more androgynous or something as ""dysphoria""? What if I fuck up my body in pursuit of something I could achieve much more safely (but with a bit less fulfillment) with makeup and the right clothes?
* What if I can no longer afford to continue HRT in the future, or if I can't afford facial surgery or SRS to fully follow through with medical transition? Won't I just be stuck in a weird hybrid place where my body has *sorta* changed in some ways but hasn't in others? I feel like I'd look like a sideshow monstrosity.
* What if something like HRT works *too* well and I just end up passing as the opposite gender? I feel like I'd be more comfortable as the opposite gender than with the way things are now, but something about that still feels... *off* in some fundamental way. Or what if the opposite happens, and medical transition (be it HRT or facial surgery) just isn't enough to make a substantial change in the way people perceive me? Won't it just have all been a waste of time and money then, if I decide to detransition? Do I just end up continuing with the process because ""well I've come this far""?
* Much of my extended family is transphobic, and I regularly encounter transphobes and homophobes anyways. What if I end up detransitioning for any reason and then these people use my story as further reinforcement of whatever ignorant narrative they have regarding trans people? 

These questions, and others like them, have fueled a years-long process of doubting myself and my conviction in following through with medical transition - and has even gone back far enough to make me nervous about simply socially transitioning. How can I expect people to use the right pronouns with consistency if I just look like the typical person of my AGAB? How can I expect them to not look upon me with a kind of hidden judgment if I crossdress, when all they see and hear is someone who ""shouldn't"" look or act that way? If I can't go the full distance in transitioning, why even start? And if I can't even convince myself to start, I have a deep and dreadful feeling that I'm at a particularly high likelihood of not following through and simply detransitioning somewhere along the line.

But if all these questions are correlated to the way that *others* perceive me, then what about how I perceive *myself*? Is my issue really about some internal dysphoria, or some kind of fundamental and personal disconnect between what I am/look like and what I feel/want to be? If I put aside all the worries about social acceptance and ""looking attractive"" and being able to transition in the first place, *why* is it that I want to transition - socially or medically?

I'm confident that some of these questions are things that binary trans people also struggle with. My point in bringing them up is that, when it comes to the question of ""what about nonbinary people"", typically the answer is ""what applies to binary trans people also applies here"". This, I think, is also the case with the conclusion that you (OP) came to: that the key to resolving questions regarding detransitioning is to focus as much as possible on *intrinsic* feelings - do you feel a *deep internal desire* to be a certain way, or is it something that can be resolved on a more ""superficial"" level? Whether binary or not, I wholeheartedly agree that this is what we as trans people should focus on most when deciding whether to begin transitioning.

I know I’m a bit late but do you by any chance have any sources or links? Not to say I think your wrong of course, but I’d like to read a bit more about this. Thanks!
Oh, definitely. My post didn't really focus on that, but I kind of touched on it during the foreword when I mentioned experiencing transphobia as one of the reasons for people to detransition.
Thank you for your perspective. 

>I dont fully understand why I am trans. I do known I feel better about myself in girl mode than guy mode.

You know, this part here is kind of interesting, because it's already such a huge contrast to what I read from cis people who detransitioned. None of the testimonials I read/watched ever mentioned anything like that. To them, wanting to be the other gender always had very concrete, practical reasons (basically ""I want to be a girl because girls don't get stared at for wearing dresses."")
Thanks Andrea! This was really wholesome
>A lot of trans people I've heard the stories of say they weren't expecting it to help as much as it did--they just wanted to alleviate dysphoria and along the way had other positive impacts. Something to think on I suppose.

I think it's a bit dangerous to focus too much on this. With how many people here have talked about all the positive side effects that transitioning had for them, it's only natural for others to hope for similar things as well.

Just because for example you're hoping that transitioning might help with your depression, doesn't mean you aren't trans.

The question that you need to ask yourself is whether you would still want to transition even if you knew it won't fix the depression.
Oh god, my genderfluid self dono what to do with these questions lmfao
Aaaaaaaaa. I'll scream with you.
Here's an analogy and a bit of science:

What do you think happens if you take a newborn baby and give it a sex change, raise it as the other gender and secretly feed it hormones throughout its life?

Do you think it would just accept it's new gender or do you think it would innately know that it was born differently?

According to anti-trans logic it should be possible to just raise them as any gender, because it's just feelings after all and people can easily get confused by what they are.

But science actually does know better than that, because we did some kind of human experiments in the 60s

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropenis

From the 1960s until the late 1970s, it was common for sex reassignment and surgery to be recommended. This was especially likely if evidence suggested that response to additional testosterone and pubertal testosterone would be poor.

With parental acceptance, the boy would be reassigned and renamed as a girl, and surgery performed to remove the testes and construct an artificial vagina.

This was based on the now-questioned idea that gender identity was shaped entirely from socialization, and that a man with a small penis can find no acceptable place in society.

By the mid-1990s, reassignment was less often offered, and all three premises had been challenged. Former subjects of such surgery, vocal about their dissatisfaction with the adult outcome, played a large part in discouraging this practice. Sexual reassignment is rarely performed today for severe micropenis (although the question of raising the boy as a girl is sometimes still discussed.)

We used to sometimes give boys that were born with a micropenis a sex change at birth, gave them a female name, secretly fed them hormones throughout their life and raised them as girls.

They developed the exact same symptoms of gender dysphoria as transgender people. And the exact same thing healed them: letting them live according to their preferred gender

And that's because transgender people and people who have been given a forced sex change are basically the same: people who are in the wrong body and who have to live as the wrong gender

In both cases their innate gender identity (i.e. what gender they want to identify as) was different than the gender they are assigned and this causes them distress.

Because of those poor micropenised kids we realized that gender identity is innate and that you can't just convert transgender people to be cis without fucking up their whole brain.

Unsurprisingly brain scans consistently show that transgender people were literally born in the wrong body.

http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/

Transgender women tend to have brain structures that resemble cisgender women, rather than cisgender men. Two sexually dimorphic (differing between men and women) areas of the brain are often compared between men and women. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalus (BSTc) and sexually dimorphic nucleus of transgender women are more similar to those of cisgender woman than to those of cisgender men, suggesting that the general brain structure of these women is in keeping with their gender identity.

In 1995 and 2000, two independent teams of researchers decided to examine a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) in trans- and cisgender men and women (Figure 2). The BSTc functions in anxiety, but is, on average, twice as large and twice as densely populated with cells in men compared to women. This sexual dimorphismis pretty robust, and though scientists don’t know why it exists, it appears to be a good marker of a “male” vs. “female” brain. Thus, these two studies sought to examine the brains of transgender individuals to figure out if their brains better resembled their assigned or chosen sex.

Interestingly, both teams discovered that male-to-female transgender women had a BSTc more closely resembling that of cisgender women than men in both size and cell density, and that female-to-male transgender men had BSTcs resembling cisgender men. These differences remained even after the scientists took into account the fact that many transgender men and women in their study were taking estrogen and testosterone during their transition by including cisgender men and women who were also on hormones not corresponding to their assigned biological sex (for a variety of medical reasons). These findings have since been confirmed and corroborated in other studies and other regions of the brain, including a region of the brain called the sexually dimorphic nucleus (Figure 2) that is believed to affect sexual behavior in animals.

It has been conclusively shown that hormone treatment can vastly affect the structure and composition of the brain; thus, several teams sought to characterize the brains of transgender men and women
Unfortunately no, not really.

If you search on Youtube or Twitter for detransition stories, you'll find a bunch of people just talking about how they transitioned and later detransitioned and why. 

When I originally looked into it, it wasn't with the intend of actual research, but rather out of morbid curiosity whether any of these people would have a story similar to mine, which might indicate that I should not transition either.

After a few videos I started noticing the pattern I described in this post, and any further videos and posts I saw just added to it as well.

I only decided to actually make a post about it about a week later. At that point I probably should have looked back for all those videos and posts, but I kind of really didn't want to, because they made me really uncomfortable. Like, many of them where from the Trumed or TERF scene and had a lot of transphobic talking points mixed in, and I just didn't want to go through that again.

However, even if I did, a dozen twitter posts and youtube videos would still only count as anecdotal evidence, scientifically speaking.

That being said, I do think further research is warranted. Not long after I made this post here I actually started working on a google forms questionnaire that I plan to distribute to both transitioners and detransitioners to get some actual data on this.

Unfortunately, asking the questions in a sensible way turned out to be quite difficult and the last two months have been pretty busy, so I haven't gotten around to actually finishing it.
Interesting..... I also cant explain why I identify as aro ace except that it fits me and I feel safe.  I did not have sex til I was 28 and I went into a major anxiety attack.  I was married 21 years and my ex was a nymphomaniac.  I know what  sex is all about.  I had a lot of anxiety and depression during those years but the church said dont divorce.  I gained about 100 ppundsbthe first 3 years of the marriage.  I have since lost the weight.  In other words, I cant explain it and I cant argue with success.  Different, I bet but it works for me.  Love Andrea
Yes I agree with that. Hope is a wonderful thing to have and I would not begrudge trans people from holding on to it (I certainly do), but it is good to know that you'd still want it even if it wouldn't help with mental health.
I hope it's not distressing or anything, I don't know how to rephrase these questions for gender fluidity though... How about...

How a female only meeting ruined my day.	"So, I'm mostly at peace with ~~not being a woman~~ *EDIT: my dysphoria*. Sure, there are stuff in my body I dislike and would prefer to be different, but who doesn't? Sure, there are situations that are painful and that probably will be painful, like going through pregnancy with my partner, but I can prepare myself and handle that pain.

The problem is, sometimes you don't see this things coming, and if RPGs have taught me something is that surprise attacks are always effective.

My place of work is rather inclusive, and has a surprisingly high percentage of female workers considering the field. It has a number of policies in place to make it welcoming and diverse, which I appreciate a lot. It shouldn't have caught me this off-guard then that there are female only meetings, that's a rather frequent policy, but it did. I'm devastated by the feeling of being left out and despair at never being able to completely fit in.

It is nobody's fault, my gender identity is not public knowledge at work nor am I planning to make it so, just sharing and kind of reaching out. I will be ok tomorrow, as long as I don't catch another sneak attack.

Thanks for reading."	"Sorry to hear this. Made me flash back to being left out when all my female friends as kids would have sleepovers and talk about how fun they were and I had to pretend I didn't care. Hang in there!
Just out of curiosity, and I apologize if this is out of line (I'll delete it if asked to) but why not come out at work? From the body of your post it seems like a very tolerant and LGBTQ friendly place so why put yourself through unnecessary emotional turmoil when you have the opportunity to alleviate it ina safe work environment?

Again, I apologize if this is out of line. I'm just trying to understand your thought process regarding this.
I’m sorry to hear this, it does feel really bad missing out on things like these. I hope you’re able to take small steps towards the future and be your true self. ❤️
In the closet or not you are still a woman. Sorry you don't feel like you can come out and are in an unsupportive country. I remember how much it hurt to not be out and not be able to be in women's spaces where I belonged. I hope things change for you, but remember trans women are women regardless of being out or not.
Been there. Sucks. And it wasn’t even intentional of them, like you, I’m not out to them yet. So, I can’t blame them, it’s just too early.
yup. my highschool has a ""Girls who Code"" club aswell as a lot of feminist clubs.

I obviously really support the message and the clubs in general since it's designed to empower women for fields which are kind of still male-dominated. just kinda hits when I realize that i'm not actually a woman and can't really join it. then my dysphoria all comes and reminds me how fargone I am from ever reaching that ""goal"".

though it's not that bad since being suicidal over that for a day is better than being shot for coming out, so that's kind of the silver lining atleast lol
At my old job it was very in frequent, but there was a once a year thing that was only for women, which was… I mean I wasn’t out to myself fully at the time, I just have thought about it a lot and it caused me sadness without me really totally consciously understanding, but… Yeah, that was kind of hard.

I would think to myself “well, I understand why I’m not being invited and it’s OK… And I don’t like social stuff anyway so…” But still, I wanted to just be able to be perceived correctly, look right.
Thank you. I think everyone around here can relate to it. That is sad, but it also means we can support each other.
Fucking same. Or all the jokes that came with being bad at football and having mostly female friends in school.
TL;DR: Maybe eventually over something more serious, when I've already made closer connections with my coworkers.

Not out of line at all, but there are many small reasons that pile up.

The first one is I'm not sure it is that trans friendly. Many people (at least in my country) are LGB friendly and tolerant and have not a clue about what to do or think about trans, and I'm not mentally in a place I can afford to be the ""standard bearer"" for the issue. We are still quite invisible here, and TERFs are a powerful voice in my country's public opinion.

There is also that even when the agenda of the company is towards inclusion, I wouldn't expect my coworkers to easily understand it. If I become a bit closer to some of them I might come out to them individually and little by little come out at work, but it's not even been a year and I don't want to jeopardize friendly, normal work relations. As hypocritical as that might be.

And lastly, if the issue was more serious, such as a coworker being openly transphobic, I would come out and take the consequences anyway, but the meeting thing is something really petty. What would be the outcome? To be allowed to join in a meeting that doesn't really interest me and have to come out to a lot of women that, while working for the same company I do, I do not know personally at all to explain my presence? That doesn't seem worth it.

The emotional turmoil doesn't really come from not being able to join the meeting, but from being reminded of my ""unwomaness"" without expecting it. The damage is done regardless of wether or not I attend the meeting.

Thank you for your concern.
Good catch on my transphobic self-talk. I didn't know I needed to hear that, thank you very much. I'm very glad I made this post ♥
If we don't, who will?
Thanks for being understanding of my question and giving sucj a thorough response. I understand better now.
If you are mtf you can’t be excluded from female only events
It'd be pretty shitty and weird of me to make a post to share and reach out and then be offended at people's curiosity and concern.

Still, one can never be too careful or considerate, and people can definitely be shitty and/or weird when upset, so thank you for being a wonderful human being."	pz5b30	trans	298	0.99	2021-10-01 10:37:28

You're really beautiful and I would love to have your confidence to share.

Venting bad (16, mtf)	"Sorry to drop all my thoughts here, I just often feel so shit at the moment, I wish I was just born cis. I’m never going to actually be a girl. I’m never going to be able to wear girly clothes or makeup. I’m never going to be able to grow my hair long. I’m never going to be able to transition. I look like a boy, I have a boy’s body, I sound like a boy, everybody knows I’m a boy, nobody is ever going to see me even as a normal person. I’m going to lose all my friends if I continue with this. My family is gonna hate me. There’s nothing going for me at all and there’s just no point in doing anything. I’ve ruined my life, I hate myself and everyone around me. There’s no point in even trying to continue, I mean I quite literally hate my own skin, and if I do somehow manage to live as myself in the future, I’ve already lived my life as a boy, I haven’t got a clue how to do things like makeup, tie up my hair or anything that normal girls can just do. I don’t know how to be a girl, I’ll never be a girl, there’s no point. 

Why do I have to think all this, and at the same time I don’t even have a solid understanding of my identity, I don’t know if I’m a boy, girl or something inbetween but I do know that I hate this process. Why couldn’t I of just been born normal"	"hey hun, you're catastrophizing. what that means is believing things to be very bad when in reality it's not that way. most trans women I know have at some point felt exactly what you're describing, and they are 100% gorgeous and 100% women. you're young, it could be a hard journey- even if it is, it'll be okay. take a deep breath, drink some water, and tell yourself the truth - tell yourself who you are (woman, nonbinary, however you identify) because you are valid and seen and important. you are so so important. I mean that from the bottom of my heart, our community has lost far too many people and each of us are so important. you're beautiful. there are a lot of people here especially who have been where you're at, and they made it thru. you'll be okay
You will find yourself, you're young and theres no deadline to transition. 

I totally feel you on not knowing how to do normal girl stuff, but that doesn't mean you can't learn! And just cause you don't know those things doesn't mean you aren't or will ever be a girl. Being a girl isn't defined by makeup or hair.

Take it one step at a time, things will get better. It's easy to not see that transitioning is a long process. Results and changes are not quick and it takes time. It's a 2nd puberty, puberty takes a few years to finish and even then you still grow after. Do one thing at a time, watch some makeup tutorials, find some exercises that help you look more feminine, focus on some small stuff and work your way up to bigger stuff

No matter where you are, there will be people who support and love you and won't hate you : )

If you need someone to talk to, you can talk to me! We gotta support our sisters : )
ftm I was straight up just crying about this an hour ago, and honestly I have no idea what to do either
I know exactly how you feel and I'm not really sure how to help or what to say but just know it gets better, i promise it gets better.
feel 1:1 the same
I had both the curse and boon of realizing much later than you. I’m 26, just started transitioning a few months ago.

You have the benefit that you’ll get to have so much more time living your true life. Unfortunately it’s also harder as a kid- you don’t have the autonomy in your own life to control your path, so not having a supportive network of friends and family must be really hard :(

I hope you can see that being trans there will always be a “grass is greener”, “if only XYZ were the case”, type of scenario. I’m very envious of you in many ways, as I unfortunately have lost most of my 20s, and don’t think I’ll really feel like a woman until I’m 30 :/ start taking baby steps-grow your hair out (say you wanna look like a rockstar if someone needs an excuse), learn to makeup in private, research HRT access and laws in your country/state for being a minor. Baby steps.
First of do you want a hug? I also pass by that I can talk to you about my journey to help you, if you want my dm are open if you want to talk.
Hey, you’re a valid person and you ARE a girl, you will pass as a girl, and you are just as normal as the rest of us. I’m also 16 and mtf and I was literally just thinking about all of this and I’m really sorry how things are showing up but I promise you it will get better! Lots of love from a fellow sister <3
Hey, it's going to be okay.
So sorry hun, also feel similar and also 16 and can’t transition likely ever
I know how it feels but ftm. I'm so sorry you feel like that, but trust me i know it might seem like it now but soon enough you'll feel how you really are.  If your friends can't except you, there not good friends, same goes for your family. Even if you don't feel like you look like a girl, doesn't mean you aren't one. You could always look up tutorials for makeup and vocal training<3
I'm sorry to read anything here, it just sounds like you're going through a really rough patch in your life. I've been there and I know it can be a really really hard to be kind to yourself. You have to learn how to be nice to yourself, how to not throw yourself under the bus, and how to forgive yourself. It is said often that forgiving others is not too hard, but the self is hardest to forgive, but I would encourage you to do it anyway. Start with forgiving yourself for not understanding. You are young at 16, you don't have much life experience, you don't even really know too much about yourself, people don't know about you. You have the world to gain by learning how to write your wrongs with yourself, bonus if you can learn to do this with others as well. We are sensitive beings, it does not take much to upset most people, so we have to learn resilience to phenomena, and to not take it so personal, or so seriously. It's just emotions that are arising to be felt and healed. They are arising so you can integrate more of yourself. The biggest thing to abandon is the cultivation of hatred with yourself, it isn't true, it is just a well-disguised delusion we are fed that there even is someone to hate. Seeing the negative effects, the unskilfulness involved, the pain, and the ill-will in hatred of anything, I don't cultivate it, and so many people would agree with me.
Yeah I’m kinda here too. I’m out to some friends and I’m growing my hair long, but past that I’m probably never going to transition for the sole reason that I’m just a massive coward and could never come out to my mum, let alone my dad.
I'm transitioning at 25 so..  I very much have had a male body especially after joining the military and being in for 5 years. But that's the thing. None of that matters. You are who you are inside. Hrt can do some pretty magical stuff given time.  But trust me you have a VERY big window to be able to transition. Don't give up hope. 

With love, Jamie 💕
dont worry.

unfortunately nothing comes without learning thou may be makeup for example, everyone had to learn this and you with enough practice you will be able to do it too, so please dont stress it and take your time, youre gorgeous and valid.

ly <33
Im 22 mtf and I understand completely. The fact of the matter is those ""friends"" who choose to break away aren't real friends I learned that the hard way a real friend will be there and support you no matter what. Family will adjust to the change believe me and once you do (if you choose to) get a change to be who you really are than nobody has to know about who you were born as. Remember its a ""dead name"" for a reason and the best advice I can give is lift your chin up and be strong for we are all here for you no matter the struggle sister
hey, i’m 20 and four months HRT. i felt like this a lot from when i was 12 to just a few months ago, when i started. i knew i was a girl, but my family wouldn’t let me do anything about it.

i say this because i realized a week or two into hormones that i was happy. i had my work cut out for me (still do), but even just knowing i was on my way was a big load off. it was encouraging to know i wasn’t getting dragged in the wrong direction anymore.

i felt as hopeless as you may right now, but right when i saw my first changes due to HRT, i realized… it is really real. we’re girls, and we totally do have the ability for our fix our birth sex. 

let yourself feel bad, it’s ok. but do not abuse yourself, and don’t let anyone take your feminine identity from you. that’s something that even a lot of cis women have to deal with.

it will get better if you can make it through. i promise. and i never thought that’d actually be true, but it was
girl, i know you’re in a bad state rn but i would recommend being yourself when you’re by yourself, like your own thoughts, a diary, on the internet, in your room or whatever your safespace is and when you’re independent or confident in coming out you can do whatever you want(eg. transition). all of us have gone through this stage and it’s part of the reason why we lose so many people in our community. it’ll all be fine trust me
Can relate
I think the same way. I'm 23 and married. Whenever I think of not transitioning, it literally is the same thing as sudokuing the real you. It's like dying, not being the real you. I've aways felt like a corpse. But all the backlash from transitioning is scary. Sometimes people don't understand and hate you, but you don't live for them; you live for you.
Catastrophising is a word I didn’t think I’d need
Similar thing here, 16 ftm too. After reading a lot of posts here and on other subreddits, I'm actually getting pretty confident for the future. I'm 5', really skinny, not even close to passing, but I know that there are cis men like me out there. I know I'm no less of a man than any cis man is. And neither are you.

This all sounds corny as fuck, but it's the truth.

I wish I could give you and all the struggling ftms out there a hug, because it's going to be okay.
I'm 21 now, nby on low dose t for 9.5ish months. It took me until I was 19 to really figure out that I'm trans, and by then I was 5'1""ish and very physically feminine. Those things won't change much, if at all, but exactly like you said, there are plenty of cis men out there who are my height or shorter and there are plenty of more physically feminine cis men. There's no right or wrong way to be your gender.

Mia Mulder just released a video about detransitioning that touched on this; she went into the feminist ideas surrounding gender, specifically Judith Butler's idea of gender as a performance. You *are* gender because you *do* gender. That isn't always an external thing: you can be your gender because you have all the desires to do gender, even if you aren't in a place to do them outwardly. Being and doing can become synonymous when you realize that being your gender is an action you do all the time.

To OP, you can totally still be a girl even if you can't do ""girl things"" now. Apply the girl power motto: GIRLS CAN DO ANYTHING! If you're a girl who has to pretend to be a boy for a while, that's totally valid! If you're an enby who comes to realize that later, that's also totally cool! There is no right or wrong way to be your gender, whatever it may be. In the meantime, do your best to try to surround yourself with people who will love you and support you even if they don't understand how you feel. You have a huge community behind you, and we all have your back."	w71upp	trans	288	0.98	2022-07-24 18:08:46
"even if I'm not a ""valid"" transgender person, does it really matter?"	"I see a lot of posts on reddit that tell people that their identity is valid, or they're valid even if they do x or y, and honestly I think it's nice that this encouragement is so prevalent on trans subreddits.

  
I'd like to think that I'm getting better at dealing with imposter syndrome or thoughts of ""*am I trans enough?*"" but I've been wondering; even if I *weren't* valid, hypothetically, does it really matter? If I'm not a ""real"" trans person, what's stopping me from calling myself trans/nonbinary anyway? Would that be harmful to other transgender people, or just to myself?"	"[deleted]
If someone tells me that they are trans,  I'm going to take their word for it.  I don't know their lived experiences,  I haven't yet invented my ""transometer"" (patent pending).

Whether they are or are not actually trans doesn't come into it.
That’s the secret.  We tell you that you are valid because all these things are valid.  As long as you are doing what you need to do for you, you are valid.  

The why?  Look, at the end of the day none of us *really* know why we are trans.  Because it’s not like being trans is some kind of rational thing based on logic.  It’s something in our brains that we can’t really change.  The logic is his we reaffirm ourselves.  Because all of us wonder whether it’s real.  Taking a big risk on a feeling is scary.  But… it’s also right.
The phrase “do what makes you happy” cannot be more true
No.

Don't get hung up on terminology. It is there to reflect what you are, not to be a mold to fit yourself into.

Be you.
It's not harmful.
The imposter syndrome definitely got better with time, it took socially transitioning online to help me be sure that I'm a girl.
Honestly this is a thing I stop myself from saying a lot of the time. Right now with the current landscape of discrimination, it's important that we have guidelines and definitions to explain to people where they can fit in and how they can help themselves-

&#x200B;

In reality? Everyone is already valid. Every*thing* is already valid. All humans are radically individual in ways that Sesame Street could never have prepared us for. People change. They grow. They alter themselves over time, and all of that should be okay.

""What if you change your mind??"" what if I do? If I have regrets- isn't that a human right, to make mistakes and regret them? To grow as a human being through those mistakes? How many people go to their graves with zero regrets- and how many of those regrets are 'I didn't' as opposed to 'I did'?

""What if you're faking it??"" What happened to 'fake it till you make it', huh? That's supposed to be a valid strategy everywhere else in life. Why can't I fake my gender until it settles into place somewhere comfortable for me? Why does that make it wrong? Is a child wrong for playing house or acting out the job they want to do in the future, despite having a work in progress understanding of it?

""What if it hurts other trans people??"" What if I walk outside today and kick a rock, and that rock goes flying under someone's bike tire and they crash and die? What if *I* die? Of course we have to take steps to ensure we're educated and not spreading damaging misinformation, but like- you should be doing that about the food you eat, the cars you drive, the materials you use- everything. It's being a responsible human being.

&#x200B;

I dunno. Sometimes being trans feels like walking in two worlds, but it's more like having a pair of glasses with a different prescription in each lens. One eye sees a sharp greyscale exaggeration of reality, one eye sees a blurred multicolored mess of natural chaos. I wish it was easier to mitigate those two visions of the world.
I feel this. Like, who cares if you're faking it or not. As long as you're happy it's fine, right?
No. Detransitioning would suck, but not anymore than transitioning in the first place. You’ll be fine.

When people talk about this topic, they really mean that if a huge proportion of the population were to come out as trans and then be wrong and go back, that would be a bad look for the trans community because a lot of people would assume that a huge percentage of people coming out as trans are just… wrong. But that’s literally none of your business. You’re just one person. Your individual experiences and choices are not going to irreparably harm the trans community. If, hypothetically, you were part of a huge group of cis people incorrectly coming out as trans, that would be a sign of some institutional problem - not a personal failing. It’s okay to be wrong. You’re not even harming yourself - this is just one step on the journey to finding yourself.
Non-validity ain’t a thing in this community, or in the very least it shouldn’t. Being trans/non-binary, it ain’t harmful to the trans community :) don’t worry, my friend, you’re still valid. Just be honest with yourself, and take it slowly or as quickly as you feel comfortable with, it’s your identity. It won’t harm others to be who you want to be, just ensure you’re ok. That’s what matters.
These terms are often treated like guiderails when they're really tools. You use them to describe yourself to others and they help you understand others. You are valid no matter what.
There’s no such thing as “valid” anyway. Either you are ok with the body you were born in or your not. All good by me
There's literally no such thing as valid or invalid.

You're trans or you're not. Stop listening to gatekeepers.

If you say you're trans, you're trans. If you say you aren't, you aren't.

You're right, it really doesn't matter because the people who decided that there was set criteria you needed to follow to be trans, are literally just trying to hurt people.
It does not! The phrase ""cute and valid"" carries even less weight than the phrase ""thoughts and prayers."" Nobody, but nobody, gets to pass judgement on you.
I always imagined saying that people are valid is not really to mean like, “you’re valid as a trans person” more like, “you’re valid as a person whatever you decide for yourself”. I may be wrong, that’s why I always interpreted it though. At that point it’s sort of just a reassurance that any feelings you have of being different or not aligning to expectations, are ok, and you don’t have to. The terminology is meaningless, I think when people say that they’re just trying to show that they’re supportive in general
It doesn't.  I don't even GAF anymore if I'm invalid or not.  Being trans and on E is too good.  I would never give this up.  Even if it's because of childhood trauma or whatever, I can't imagine any world where I would stop my transition.  

I guess that's how I feel like I know it's right for me, and I don't really have imposter syndrome anymore.

Just a thought: if you want to be stealth, be stealth.	"The tiktok algorithm has been showing me a lot of content lately from fellow trans about how if you’re stealth (if you pass and choose not to be out of the closet) then it’s some kind of internalized transphobia unless you don’t have the privilege to do so. I think the idea is “why wouldn’t you want to be trans unless you’re a hater?” Or maybe its more like having a responsibility to educate. 

I live in a progressive community. I could get away with being out. But I don’t want to. I would rather people think I am a cis man. If me and some very progressive men are having a conversation about wieners, i am damn well going to pretend i have one. 

One tiktoker said people who are stealth are censoring/somehow harming their culture.  But i don’t see being trans as my identity and feel uncomfortable when my gender is a big deal, even when its positive attention. I don’t think that makes me transphobic. But idk, change my mind.

Edit: Loving all the experiences of enjoying and embracing transition in the comments. I wanted to add a note to this post validating those who are out. But I don’t think those who want to keep it to themselves should be shamed. That’s what I was trying to get at. I am stealth because it feels good to me, not because I think everyone should be stealth."	"I am openly trans online in most places but I am stealth at work and only my manager (because of a IT mishap and my birth certificate not being changed yet) and another trans girl at work know I'm trans
it’s no one’s business but your own, you are not obligated to be out to anybody.
Being trans sucks because everyone expects you to say your trans.

Literally nobody cares if I like to work instead of play videogames. Nobody asked so why should I feel the need to tell anyone. 

Again it’s just a statement that you really don’t need to tell anyone ever.
Tik Tok to be blunt is shit.  Like if you said that on any reddit thread you would be called insane for trying to invalidate someone's goals and dreams.  Especially trying to call that transphobic like wtf.

Tiktokers just don't seem to have the ability to hear from others if their opinion is sound and it just lets them spout whatever and think they are right.  Hate that sort of stuff.
I don't like being trans at all. I don't find pleasure in knowing that my assignment at birth is different than my brain's. I don't think I could feel proud of being trans like other people can. And that's okay. 

I don't refer myself as a trans woman except in strictly online LGBT spaces. 

In real life, I am ordinary woman. Just a regular Jill going through her life normally. Sure, I have some hormone problems, but that's fine. 

My identity is that I'm a woman. That's it. I'm not comfortable with another label attached.
I’m stealth. It’s not my job nor my responsibility to educate others. It’s not my responsibility to give up any safety I have just to make others feel seen and normalized. I worked my ass off to be able to blend in well enough with women’s society and culture so that I wouldn’t get clocked. Why would I work so hard at doing that just to not? And why is it okay to ask me to not? I don’t owe disclosure to anyone. Least of all disclosure to people who might wish me harm, because other trans people who have chosen not to live like me think I should.
I don’t understand why we cant be stealth and in the community. If anything, cis people (and those passing as such) are critical to advocating for trans people. By being stealth, we can enter conversations with other men (speaking from my pov here) and stand up for trans rights. It works. People listen more to people they share commonalities with. Then they can focus on the conversation about trans ppl as a whole, instead of YOU being trans.
I lived totally stealth for about 13 years before I rejoined the community (now I am mostly stealth still). There is nothing wrong with that lifestyle (in my opinion), but you should try to be aware of your motivation. I think it is easy to be running away from your gender or problems or history. It is also easy to find yourself isolated.
Nope, nothing to change your mind on here imo. If someone can be stealth, and chooses to be stealth, that's their own business and no-one else's. Nothing transphobic about it, it's not censorship, or culture harming, or anything like that. It's just more culture/identity politics which 90% of people think is pointless, stupid, or both. 


>I think the idea is “why wouldn’t you want to be trans unless you’re a hater?”

Who the fuck would want to be trans? It's fucking awful. Being trans is honestly one of the worst experiences of my life.

Edit: removing the last part of my sentence, because people don't agree, and I want to remove it as a result.
I wish I could go stealth one day... it's one of my primary end goals of transitioning (if not *the* endgoal). I don't want to deal with transphobia if I don't have to. Besides, if I can't go stealth at some point, what even is the point? I just want to be treated as a normal woman, I want to blend in, I just want to be normal in society's eyes...
honestly being stealth is the dream for me. I still love being part of the community and interacting with other trans ppl but omg having to address the fact that im trans in every interaction is exhausting
I still feel like I don't pass when I look at myself, but I haven't been clocked or gotten any weird stares in public in a long time. My identity is woman first, lesbian second, trans third. It's absolutely true that being trans has shaped my life in a very deep way, but the longer I spend just living as my true self, the less important it seems. I'm open about being trans with friends and family, but for clients and anyone else I interact with on a daily basis, I'm just some lady. 

I do want to make the point that I'm not ashamed of being trans at all, I'm forever grateful that I was actually able to transition. It's just not central to who I am as a person these days.
It’s up to each person to choose for themselves. Not going to knock it. I will say though as a black and specifically Ghanaian trans woman raised in the US. Being trans and out is kind of tied to my career goal, I’m aspiring to be a adolescent and young adult aged therapist who centers BIPOC, the lgbtq+ community and neurodivergent folx and I especially want to provide representation because i don’t really personally know any out African trans women in the states and few have an online presence. I need my siblings to know that they’re valid and if I go stealth once I am able to pass… it would be doing them a disservice personally. But like i said earlier, it’s everyone’s choice how they want to live
Social media hot takes lol
TikTok really isn't that great. I wouldn't take anything people say on it that seriously.
I’ve personally been shamed and ostracized by some of my local “community” because I won’t be a saber rattler and fight the pronoun wars. Two things about that. 

1) I didn’t do this to start, or be a part of a revolution. I did this because I always hated what I was born and the parts that came with it. So I solved the problem and went back to living life

2) you can please all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you will never please all the people all the time. Someone is always going to have a problem with you or what you do no matter how hard you try, so stop trying so hard. 

There are a number of us that just want to live life, and are lucky enough to be able to do it under the bigot radar. Shaming us for not being out and proud is not making any friends and with the political climate out there right now, friends is what we need.

Live and let live people!
Being stealth can also be safer, fwiw.
""Why wouldn't you want to be trans unless you're a hater"" idk maybe because I want to just be a lady and not have the mountains of asterisks, baggage, and literal life-threatening danger that comes with being a trans lady.
I don't specify that I'm trans when meeting new people usually, I don't see a reason why... I don't even pass that well, but usually I pass enough that the first impression most people have is that I'm a girl

I had a week with a few people I'll never see again(most of them). Did they know I'm Trans? Apart from 2 who knew me before, I don't think so

I was just one of the girls there, it felt so good and nice

I'm not ashamed of being trans, but I don't want to risk it and worry about it all the time 

* could also be more of them knew and were just that nice that they didn't mention it, or they only suspected... Anyway me being trans only came once when I was alone with someone I knew from before (who gendered me correctly when I wasn't passing at all without me saying anything! No idea how she knew but she somehow did)
I am fully out everywhere as my true self proud trans girl sadly i am the only trans at my work place we got 2 gays tho but they had to change a few things when I came out at work xx
Yeah like, I can be stealth and still be supportive to other trans people. Life for me is just going to be far more difficult due to my career path in the trades within a pretty conservative province where I live if I'm openly trans. I am privileged by a long shot, but I really just wanna live my life as a normal guy where people treat me like a regular guy. It doesn't mean I'll disappear from the trans community. I'm still trans. I'm just not open about it because it could be potentially disheartening or even dangerous.
For me, I mostly try to go to “stealth” because I just want to live my life as a woman. I would rather not have a daily conversation about my existence as a trans woman. But this choice to go “stealth” does not mean that I don’t advocate for our community: I fly the pride flag everywhere; I challenge prejudice when I see it; at uni I wear a lanyard saying “LGBTQ+ ally”; in discussions on trans rights and diversity and inclusion my trans identity is nearly always brought up.
honestly yeah. people fixate on relative privelege when the only thing it takes to strip a stealth girl of that is being outed. if your relative privelege can't withstand a scooby doo reveal it's probably not worth all the discourse
I think every trans person should have the choice of how they manage their transition, because ultimately being trans isn't about fitting a mold other trans people built, it's about being yourself authentically, including the approach to transitioning.
It sounds like they heard “you don’t need to pass in order to be valid” and took it to the extreme.
People on tiktok should chill the fuck out. Yes being trans is a beautiful thing, but being out as trans has heavy social consequences.
Being out or not is a personal choice and that should not be used against people who don't chose to
I wanna be stealth until passing(ish) but I wonder if hrt tiddys will make it impossible to stealth
Well, stealth is the goal, isn't it? Otherwise, why ask people if you pass? ""Pass"" = blend in with the crowd. I would love to go to one of those parties where there seems to be an infinite number of people and the only one you know is the person who invited you. Then end up in a group discussion about superhero movies or something similar, where all the girls drift off shaking their heads leaving me to soak up all the bro energy of debates over who would win in a fight between Thor and the Hulk.
Personally I identify as a man. Not a trans man. 
Despite being pre everything and I couldn't ""pass"" to save my life, that is how I identify and when I transition I will be and will act like a man.
Being trans isn't important to me. Getting to live my life as it was supposed to be, is.
I understand why people want to be identified as trans and those people are super important for us, for our future, and definitely shouldn't be discouraged in any way. They bring much needed attention to the issues we face. But that doesn't mean that those of us who are stealth don't help out or contribute. We just don't do it as loudly. It doesn't make us less important. 
Every one of us is important and valid no matter how ""loud"" we choose to be about it. So, people, you do you!
Yes. It’s quite simple. Just want to be a woman
Yeah and sometimes we don’t feel safe being out. It’s our choice to be stealth or not. I admire people that can be openly out but I don’t think that life is for me, a shy person that hates confrontation haha
I'm stealth and I like it that way. I don't want to be treated differently or having people asking me uncomfortable questions about me being a trans man. And I feel safer not disclosing that I'm trans.

People should just let others choose if they want to be stealth or not and honestly it's kinda of a privilege to be openly trans and feeling safe about it.
Its more like for me some days I put in effort and others I don’t the people who I stay friends with vibe it. But sometimes I go AGAB as like a precaution to scary new places.
I agree with this sentiment. If I had the choice, I’d rather not tell people and have them just see me as a TRANS man. I’d feel like the fact that I’m trans would become TOO MUCH of a defining part of who I am. I’d want to be seen as more than that by anyone.
Yeah, as much pain as life has given us, we are happy we are trans.  This is who we are, and we embrace it, and if we could magically be cis, we would say no.  

We go stealth when necessary.  It's honestly fine now, it's like being a spy in Mission Impossible.  It's just a part to play, no different than when we play a part on film or on stage.  

When we get to be our authentic self, we revel in it.
tik tok opinions generally don't mirror the way of the real world.
The beauty of choice. 

I’m so sorry about the birth certificate mishap!
Yeah! Totally! People listen to me a bit more when i’m engaging in the activism part of being trans when I do so as an ally. Fucked up but true.
Personally? Being trans brought nothing but grief, yeah. This is going to make me look bad to the commenter who suggested that sometimes being stealth can mean running from your gender panic. But ever since I came out ALL i’ve wanted was to be a normal dude. It was the point of transitioning, for me. To each their own, of course, but i cut my papa milkers off so people WOULDN’T know they used to be there.
Agreed One-Million percent.
>I'm sorry but anyone who says otherwise is a liar.

No, that's just your pain speaking.

I wouldn't be cis if you paid me. My experience isn't universal of course, and nor is it even an experience that everyone ""should"" have. It's just *an* experience of being trans. But it's an experience that doesn't involve hating myself for who I am. That is something that is possible to get to.
As much pain as it has caused us, we wouldn't trade it for the world.  We would not become cis even if the Gods said we could be, and we will die on that hill.
Biiiiiiiiiiiig same. Granted at my height it'll never happen, so the best I can hope for is to give legit confusion.
Right! Like I don’t ignore trans people at all and certainly do my part. I present as a strong ally. Instead of a transman.
Reading that, this honestly may be my bias. That now that my transition is pretty much complete and I have been trans for a long time, it is just not as important to me anymore.

Another commenter brought up the jealousy and pain that can come with struggling to pass and i thought this was a very insightful comment. I remember what that was like and wonder of I would have thought differently about my own post back then.
Oh my gosh, what an amazing aspiration. You have goals that are dedicated to helping others. Therapy is no joke of a career. 

If I felt like being out would have a broader influence, like if i were a celebrity, i would probably want to show that trans people can be successful and seen. It would be a different story. But i do not think anyone will be paying attention to me like that any time soon.
Exactly how I feel! :)
Exactly. I’d rather present as an ally than a trans person.
I like “scooby doo reveal”
I entirely agree and love this comment. Because I definitely take part in pro-trans activism! I speak up! But as an ally.
Hmm. So, by “we”, you mean the tiktokers i was talking about who think that being stealth is transphobic, right? 

Because I’m trans, and I don’t want to share it. You see it as an identity. I see it as a private quality.
Speak for yourself. You might find comfort in your trans identity and that’s fine. But some of us don’t. Some of us *want* to be seen as cis and blend in with our gender. Some of us see “trans” as our medical condition, not our identity. It’s how we’re dealing with a body mismatch. If I could magically become a cis male, I’d do it. I’d do ritual sacrifices if I had to.
Yeah IT set up my certificates in my deadname and not my chosen name which was on my accounts so nothing was working on the computer which I needed my manager to help me get fixed
Same. There’s a lot of good work to be done. Same thing with womens rights. Men speaking up for them is what’s necessary for real action to happen unfortunately. I think there’s a time and place to be out, but being stealth has a ton of sway.
Transitioning can be excellent after the fact, and we should all seek to be positive role models for others, but doing that shouldn't make us unhappy or uncomfortable. If you're going to be upset by telling people your story or explaining your situation/transition/journey, then don't do it.


>This is going to make me look bad to the commenter who suggested that sometimes being stealth can mean running from your gender panic.

I disagree with them, but honestly, I also think that's nobody's business but the person choosing to be stealth. The same way that how you transition is a personal decision, how you choose to tell your history is also one. 


>But ever since I came out ALL i’ve wanted was to be a normal dude. It was the point of transitioning, for me.

Everyone I know who has transitioned, and everyone I know (me included) who hasn't yet, only wants to be viewed as their gender. They don't want to be viewed as a transman or woman, and honestly the more I've thought about this, the more I think the stance that you can't be stealth is actually transphobic. What they're basically saying is ""you're not an X, you're a trans-X"", and how is that any different to saying ""you're not a real X, you're a Y"".
Yeah, you're right, and I'm sorry, so I've edited it out. For all my talk about things being individual, and how those tiktokers are wrong for saying everyone has to be overt, I've then immediately ignored that and said everyone should be a certain way.
I’m so glad you don’t hate who you are!
Who is we? I'm trans and would give almost anything to be cis, and my friends are the same, so it's certainly not a universal experience.
I would dash like, hella infants on the rocks for the chance to be cis, sis
Lol I would. No offense, but being trans isn't really great for me at all. For example, my biggest concern is that I could be discriminated at work if I'm not careful with who I disclose it to. Being trans has brought me so much pain. Yes, I have had great bittersweet experiences including some amazing relationships I have built, but now looking forward, being trans is a huge obstacle that I may need to keep a secret, so I will at the very least be treated fairly. If I was told by a God that I can wake up cis in the morning, I would take that offer.
Thank you. Yeah I’ve wanted to be a therapist from a young age. Like i distinctly remember telling my aunt who passed away years ago that i wanted to become a psychologist at age 4 or 5 so i could help people. She was accepting of the lgbtq community and i think she knew i was probably queer (she was accepting of the community and never policed my gender expression or teased me) and mentioned that i would probably have to work with gay people. At the time i was scared of that (grew up very religious bc my parents are very involved in the Christian church - well my mom still is anyways and dad used to be but anyways) now like 20+ years later I’m like YES that’s the goal lmaooo
With you seeing it as a private quality, do you go to Pride or any similar LGBTQ events? Or do you just stick to what would be the social norm for your gender? No hatred, just curious
We use ""we"" because we have DID.  We are many voices in one brain, so we use we.   

That's valid how you want to live your life, and so is how we do it.  Yesterday I went out in color coordinated trans pride clothing to go shopping at the mall. 🤷‍♀️
If you reread what we wrote, we *were* speaking for ourself.  We didn't say you have to feel the way we do.  Peace.
YEAH! This reply rules. Thanks Orange
By far the best explanation of my experience. Agreed entirely on the last paragraph.
>Everyone I know who has transitioned, and everyone I know (me included) who hasn't yet, only wants to be viewed as their gender.

I'm 6 years transitioned, and cis passing these days. I am openly trans at every level of my life, because I don't want to be viewed as cis. I don't want people to assume that I'm cis. I don't want the fact that I'm trans to be the first and main lens through which they view me, and being cis passing absolutely helps with that, but I also don't want to be viewed through a cis lens either, because my trans identity is important to me. It's part of who I am.
It's not, but there are lots of transfolk who are fine with who they are.  They don't talk about it so much because of being dogpiled on by people who do not like being trans.

We say we because we are a system of alters.   We are many whonact as one.
BAHAHAHA
It has been very painful for us as well, but we wouldn't change who we are for the world.
Oh i totally go to pride! I vote for pro trans policy, i work to make spaces inclusive for trans people (like, I made a big fuss over a trans 12 year old being able to stay in the cabin of their choice at a summer camp i work at. I think this was a pretty big deal for him.) Yeah, supporting people is a responsibility for everyone. Just, while I do this, people think I am an ally instead.
So I went to look at your profile. The issue seems to be that you're using a quite uncommon pronoun, ""we"". It makes it seem like you're speaking for multiple people other than you, and not just yourself.
Hey, I'm sorry if that part of my comment felt dismissive. It wasn't meant to be, what I meant was that in my experience, and my friends' experiences, being trans isn't something we want to be. If others want to be trans, and visibly so, that's absolutely fine, that's a personal choice. What I take issue with is the idea that you *have* to be trans, as a trans person, you can never just be your gender, which is what the op is referencing.
And that’s awesome!

Let’s not downplay the folks who love that as part of their identity. Let’s absolutely not downplay the folks with a beautiful and fulfilling transition. But i feel the opposite way, and its not coming from a place of pain. Its just not me. Just like the old pronoun. I think these two experiences should be on the same level.
As I said elsewhere, your personal circumstances weren't clear, so your comment came across as your speaking on behalf of the community.
Some people are like you yeah! But quite a bit of trans people would change it. You also have to remember, some people have it extremely rough. Instead of saying ""we"" regarding every trans person, instead say ""a lot of us"" or something like that.
So what I’m getting is you present socially as a cis strong ally? That makes more sense. Initially I thought you meant like stereotypical straight cis life since you pass. Thanks for the work you do!
Ah, yes, that.  We are a system of alters, so we use we because we are many and one.  It confuses some people, but all the people with DID (of which there are a lot in the trans community) recognize it.  So it's bith to express who we are, and also to signal to other people who are systems.
I didn't find your comment dismissive at all! I was just offering a different perspective
Sorry, that was a response to a specific part of the post I was replying to. I've edited the quote in to make that clearer.

What I was trying to say is simply that there are trans people out there who don't simply want to be viewed as cis folk of our gender. Not that everyone should want that, just that there are people out there like that
Yes, we understand.  We'll just have to be more clear that we are speaking as a system, not for other people.
We say we because we are a system of alters (you know, DID).  We understand that is apparently confusing tonsome, but it is nonetheless how we talk about ourselves.
Oh I'm sorry! I should have looked at your account beforehand! Apologies for the mixup.
It's okay!  No worried at all!"	zoumr1	trans	276	0.98	2022-12-18 09:21:01
Is it bad that I’m not proud of being a trans woman?	"I find that a lot of other trans people I talk to are really happy with their trans identity, but I wish I wasn’t trans.
I wish I was just born as a cis woman, I don’t wanna be seen any differently than other women I just wanna be seen as a woman. I receive hate and death threats from people all because of the fact I was born as the wrong sex. Everything I hate about myself stems from the fact I was born male. I hate my height, by body shape, my downstairs, my voice, my face.
Is it weird to feel this way? I feel like I should be proud of being trans but I’m just not. I wish I was a cis woman."	"That’s ok. You don’t need to be proud of your identity exactly, the hope is that you’ll accept yourself, regardless

I think this problem is common amongst most minorities who get oppressed. Like among deaf circles, there’s a lot of people who have deaf pride, but I’ve also heard people express that they wish they weren’t deaf. Being proud of your identity is less of a good or bad thing, and more of something to journey towards
I totally feel this way. And people try to tell you that women come in all shapes and sizes and have all kinds of voices. Like yea, we know that. But it's not what we're talking about. Anything that's masculine about ourselves is just a reminder that our body and hormones are wrong. A lot of us wish we were born cis but as a woman. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
you might not ever feel proud for specifically just being trans. but you should be proud of yourself and your journey, and that can take time. for a very long time i wish i was born cis, no matter what gender, and i recognized in that was some underlying transphobia i had to work through. mostly i wanted to be a cis boy. but that’s not how i was born. and after realizing i wasn’t going to magically turn into one over night, and after some growing up and a LOT of self acceptance, i came to terms with being trans. a lot of people have neutral feelings about their transness, i’m not necessarily proud of myself for being trans, but i am proud of my trans journey. and i think every trans person has the right to that pride whether they’re loud about it, stealth, or somewhere in the middle <3
It's not weird to feel how you feel, but I would encourage you to think clearly about what you're actually bothered by. Because the things you list that you hate, those are _dysphoria_ things.

They're all things you hate about your body because they're masculine qualities, but you are not a man. So _of course_ you don't like them! Why would you?

Unpacked, that's not failing to be proud of being a trans woman. That's just dysphoria. 

That is, there's a difference between your feelings about your _body_ and your feelings about your _self._ But right now I get the sense that you're lumping them together as if they were the same thing.

Separate them back out.

After all, wouldn't you be happier if you had feminine features? I sure would. And that is an indication of some part of you being _glad_ to be a woman.

There is pride to be found, lurking there somewhere. Just right now it's hard to find it under all that dysphoria. Put the dysphoria in its own little bucket in your mind, separate from everything else, so it does not obscure your feelings about your core identity.
I feel the same, I seldom feel pride in things I didn't earn cause of my upbringing. I'm trans, what about it?
I feel the exact same way. All you can do is pat yourself in the back and congratulate yourself for getting this far. Transitioning is not an easy journey. And maybe your inherent transness isn't something you can be proud of at the moment, but you should look at yourself as someone who's gone through a lot and you should be proud of yourself for that.
The way you feel is completely valid hun ❤ I think in the most basic way, as trans people we all wish we were born the opposite sex. But we have to learn to deal the cards we've been dealt and that can really suck. You don't have to feel pride, I think it's overused at this point to say you're proud of something you just are anyway. Every day is a journey, and step by step you'll find ways to help deal with the parts of yourself you wish you could change. I think the most upsetting thing for me is that I would never be able to carry and have a biological baby of my own. I admire biological women and I'm a little envious of what they have in regard to that. I think it's normal to feel the way you feel, and it's entirely OK.
What a group of lovely people responded to you. Bottom line: there is nothing bad, nothing to be ashamed of. You need to work on this issue, though, perhaps with some trans friend or some professional practitioner, if you can afford it. Not because you are at fault of anything, but just to help you in accepting your actual limitations, compounding your sorrows and your fears.
It's not bad per se, but I think you're being hard on yourself for something you can't control and it makes me sad. You don't have an obligation to be proud as a trans woman, just to be yourself. But I hope someday you can get to a point where you at least feel neutral about your body and can appreciate it for the things it does for you <3
Being trans is hard.  
And how you are feeling about it is perfectly valid, and you are not wrong about feeling like you do.

But I also think its important to analyse why you think like you do.  
From what you've written, is seems that the way you are treated by other people and society in general is a big factor as to why you feel the way you do. And that's very understandable.  
There is a large chunk of society that view trans people as lesser.

But it's important to remember, you don't have to accept that. And that societal views are not immutable.   
That's why i'm proudly trans and will always be out and proud.  
As an example.  
To bigots, to show they can't suppress me.  
To young trans people, to show them its possible, to give them the exposure to positive trans examples i never had as a child.  
And because, after 30 years of repressing myself, of depression and mental health issues, multiple suicide attempts. I am still standing here and finally living as my true self.  
In spite of the all shit we as trans people face.

So, no, you are not bad for feeling the way you do. at all.   
But it always good to anaylse the why.
I don’t think it’s weird to feel that way at all! 

I actually feel very similarly to you, and just wish all my male-ness (yes I’m using a made up word, I think) would disappear and that I was born a cis woman. So you’re not alone here. 

Just gotta do what makes you happy though and live your best life. :)

P.S. You are really cute, and never forget that! ❤️
I'm with you, I also wish I were cis. Being trans is just one continuous never-ending hassle. Even if we weren't targeted by bigots, the internal struggle with dysphoria is real. There's not a day that goes by without me looking at the mirror and seeing a dude staring back. Pretty makeup, long hair, cute nails, fem clothes, but a freaking dude nonetheless. It sucks.
Honestly hard agree. I dont wanna be trans and I dont like that label. I prefer fitting in, even with how stigmatized assimilation into cisheteronormativity is within the LGBTQ+ community is.

Like yall are free to have pride and whatnot but yknow, just count me out. I'm not proud of this, I accept it, but honestly I dont see being trans as a positive thing for me.

I tolerate myself being trans but only because I'd be more miserable living as my AGAB, if you understand what I'm saying.
I'm proud of being myself but not about being trans, I didn't have a choice in that.

I think I would have had a better life if I had been cis all along, either gender but I'm absolutely not saying I'm not happier now after accepting I'm trans
i feel the same way and someone told me it was internalized transphobia. i don’t want to believe it though, i can’t see how that’s possible to be transphobic when i’m trans
I definitely know what you mean… i had to battle with my internalised homophobia, but even now i still cant quite feel proud. I definitely also have that feeling of “i wanna be indistinguishable from cis people” and honestly sometimes i feel like i shame the trans community for thinking that and not being proud of being trans. Im glad im not alone in this but im sorry someone else is going through it too…
I still periodically feel this way, but I am proud of my Transgender identity. I've been out for 10 years now and  just now able to financially start transition.  It's hard and expensive and there are days I just don't want to do it anymore. I'm still presenting as male mostly, I've been waiting on 400 dollars spare that I can freeze sperm and start my HRT that I got my prescription for last Sept:( be strong, be proud of who you are if for no one else but yourself.
I mean you do you. 
I am not exactly “proud” per se, if I carry a trans flag with me it’s because I’m proud to still be alive despite all the shit we go through. 

Stay strong? Even is is difficult, you shouldn’t live in shame with urself 💕
In many traditions, pride is a mortal sin.  Not being an expert, I take a different tack:  I'm proud of what I, through choice and effort, have made happen.  I am who I am; the only effort required was when I was pretending to be someone else.  Being me was an act of courage born of desperation.

I'm not proud of that.  I can't be.  

I don't even understand how I could be.

I am who I am, and very little of who I am was born of my choices or my intention.  *Being* who I am is not a point of pride, but of *defiance*; I'm not sure against whom.

Would I rather have lived a life where I could have found the strength to be myself without first being drive to the edge of darkness?  *Absolutely*.  That I live in a world where the path I walk toward my truth is a celebrated thing -  that so many who are like me die so young that I've, in spite of all genetic odds to the contrary, outlived the average - is not something I'm proud of.

This year was my first pride being out.  It is the first year I understood why people go to pride.  It is the first year that I truly understand why pride exists.  I barely survived admitting who I was.  That doing something so small - so *essential* - as that should not be so shackled by shame that it is seen as an act of courage.  

I am me, and I'll have been thrice damned should I try and be anyone else.
even as a proud trans woman, i empathise with you. sometimes you just wish you were born cis so that you wouldn’t have to deal with all of it. but we can’t change who we are and i encourage you to try and make the best of it, even if we’re not who we wish we were. we can try.
I don’t know if it’s bad, but it was the reason I detransitioned. I just could not learn to accept myself or be proud of being trans as I hated feeling ‘weird’ or ‘different’, so I stopped HRT, I stopped going by my chosen name, stopped talking/dressing feminine and just settled for tolerating my male self.
As a trans man I totally relate and I’m sorry you have to feel this way ❤️
Look, I’m in exactly the same boat. I don’t want to be a trans woman. I just want to be a woman. A lot of other people are proud of that label and that’s great, but I just wanna be… a woman. Without extra baggage or labels.
I can relate to you. I wish I was a female from the start, but oh well.. I am proud as an MtF trans, but that’s person-subject, one might be happy, one might be not.
I’m the same. If I could stealth and only tell those I was close to I absolutely would. And for me it’s made worse because the louder a lot of allies shout some of them a little toxic at times the more shit I get because people believe I’m trans so I must be this “easily triggered third gender what ever” which isn’t true. I’m just a woman, and wish to live my best life as such. My height, deep voice, and very masc facial feature make me feel like trash as they stop me being able to not get noticed but also living as a man full time also isn’t an option
To put it simply, as I've heard a lot of other people say: nobody WANTS to be trans. No sane person would ever willingly choose to deal with the dysphoria, hate, or discomfort that comes with being trans. I doubt many people are happy to be trans. But that doesn't mean they don't accept themselves. I hate the fact that I'm trans. I've been threatened, harassed and abused for it. Not to mention the breakdowns that come with it. But I accept myself because it's who I am.

The way you feel is valid, and I'm sure very common among trans people. It's ok.
No you’re not alone. Most if not all of us don’t want to be trans some of us just take it with a little pride. We are who we are and that’s ok
Short answer: no. I am too tired to explain why it is okay. But think immigrants and naturalized citizens and so on. You can't put trans girl on your ID. You are a woman first and foremost. You can be proud of anything. Or feel a strong dislike towards something. Your feeling is valid. Trans woman just means a woman in transition. Don't over think it. I am not gonna go bother some tall girl just because she is not proud of being tall. It's all right.
Well femboys aren’t trans women. They’re super cute and valid ^^ but the term isn’t inherently transphobic. However if you refer to a transwoman as a femboys well that’s just yeah very shitty
I might be biased but most people, especially LGBTQ people, aren't proud. If we were already proud, there wouldn't be a Pride movement. That being said you may want to start/restart therapy; especially if you're thinking about hurting yourself.
I totally understand I feel the same way except ftm it would all be better if I was cis
""Pride"" is both about being proud of who you are, and wanting to live in a world that allows you to be so. We've got a long fight ahead of us before we achieve true peace and equality. There are plenty of reasons why your identity makes life worse for you, and you are completely valid in wishing you didn't have that identity. Life has dealt you a bad hand, but just because the hand is your own doesn't mean you're not allowed to wish you had a better one.
Big same
I am the same , but i can't be myself till i leave my county, cuz in here everyone hates lgbt. But i want to leave , so i can be women , i also don't like the fact that i am in male body , but life is never easy. And for ur problem i would recommend try to  love and understand yourself.
It's not weird at all. I feel the same way from time to time... less often now than a year ago. But the way you feel is perfectly valid. 

It's not about being proud to be trans. It's about you loving you... and I always found that to be the hardest thing for me to do, to love myself... still do from time to time. 

Thanks for being honest.
I think I have to be, because If I don't, I think I might really crack, and something had might happen. It's complicated, but I just want to be happy.
I've felt simmilar ways myself but since comming out and accepting that I haven't been born the way I wish I was but I can work to make that a reality and find inner peace. I wish I was just born a girl, got no special and deferential treatment than any other girl my whole life which is why I didn't want to transition when I was younger. I'm transitioning now and Identify as Transgender to help me overcome these feelings. Nothing like looking in the mirror and hating what you see for reason xyz... One of the first things I said to a officer shortly after comming out was 

Officer: So your out as Trans now thats great!

Me: No its not now im going to be discriminated against my whole life...

I feel your pain, do what you need to overcome this.

You're not alone <3
I feel the same way. And I think that being proud just because of your gender (trans, cis or NB) is really not something I support. We didn't choose our gender and had no influence in them. It just happens to be the way it is. 

But we should feel proud because we have overcome so many difficulties. Life as a trans is extremely hard. We have to face every moment issues that cis-people never have go through. They never have to feel that they're living in wrong body. But we still go on. We survive. And if you can make it, you should be proud of yourself. And as a community, we should also feel collective pride. This is true with any marginalized community; the odds are against us but we can still thrive.
Yeah I think a lot of it is definitely just my dysphoria. I’m not happy I was born male so any masculine features I hate about myself. And I wish other people didn’t view me as a trans girl and rather just a girl. So it’s a mix of dysphoria and other peoples hateful views towards me.
It's possible to be transphobic even when being trans because you're brain learned all that gender stuff society thinks from your birth. It's so rooted in you that it's almost impossible to fully get rid of it.
even then i just don’t see how not being proud of myself is transphobic
It's not, never said it is
i know but other people have told me it is i just don’t understand where they’re coming from and they never bother to explain"	vyguvb	trans	279	0.98	2022-07-13 23:14:40
My brothers wedding day is going to be so uncomfortable for me.	"So I’m transgender mtf and I haven’t worn any mens clothes for over two years of any kind or gone a day without my makeup since I started wearing it three years ago because of how insecure I feel without them. My brother proposed to his girlfriend in May 2020 ( he did it while they went skydiving so as she was landing he got down on his knee) and I was super happy for them and still am. However a few months after he came to me and asked “Do you want to go to the wedding?” His question was surprising and I answered “ Of course I want to go to my little brothers wedding.” As of posting this, I am 25, he is 23, and the wedding is in 12 days. So after I said I wanted to go he asked me to tone down my transition, telling me that her family was not going to be very accepting of my identity at the wedding. I promised him that I wouldn’t wear a dress or skirt so just women’s pants and top for the wedding. But after he and my mother talked about it a bit more to me I agreed that for the day of the wedding I will pretend to be a guy again. No makeup, jewelry, nails, women’s clothes or shoes, or makeup. Even my bra has to go! I won’t be able to use the right bathroom dressed like that either. It’s going to be the most uncomfortable day of the last decade of my life. But with that deal came my mother’s unconditional support to my gender transition afterwards. I’m looking forward to seeing my brother get married but not looking forward to the day at all. Thankfully I’m not in any important roles for the wedding. Congratulations Ryan and Heather! I am very happy for you two but this is going to be very difficult for me. Thanks Reddit for letting me vent.

Edit: To all the people bashing on my family and saying I deserve better than this, I’m doing this to be nice to them. But when I get married they have to see me getting married to… whoever I get married to, guy or girl, not sure yet, and I’ll absolutely be wearing a beautiful wedding dress. So they have that to look forward to. Not saying any of you are being rude or mean or anything but adding in a detail I left out. Please don’t take it the wrong way."	">But with that deal came my mother’s unconditional support to my gender transition afterwards.

Yeah, that's not unconditional. She's literally setting up conditions for her support.

At first I thought 'yeah, I _kinda_ understand your brother asking to 'tone it down' if the inlaws are horrible and transphobic'. I might agree to the same for my brother. They want to remember the day without any scenes, probably. But then going further and having you pretend to be a guy again is just seriously uncool. He's your brother, he should stand up for you, defend you and let you be you.
So it sounds like he doesnt want his sister at the wedding he wants his brother. This is so rude, and it's always the trans person that has to change for everyone else, never the other way around. Like another commenter said, he owes you big time. Especially 3 years into the transition. Fucking disgusting. And so fucked for the rest of your family to make the decision for you.
I hope your brother seriously pays you back for that because its a huge fucking favor to ask. I hope the wedding is nice enough on its own to distract you from it even just a little bit!
Jesus, just don't go. I'm sorry, but you're just shooting yourself in the foot by going. You've been a woman for ~three years and your brothers girlfriends family is more important to your mother and him than you are. They don't support you, they don't accept you, and they only see you as a woman insofar as it is convenient to them. Just don't go.
So u have to disguise for a wedding… I personally wouldn’t, but its ok is your family and you know them better… if you feel unconfortable you can always leave early. But damn you are brave and sacrificed for your family… be strong sister!! Whatever you choose to make we are here so u can talk later about it.
Fuck that
Don’t go.
Yeah I wouldn't do this for my brother, mainly because my brother loves me and wouldn't ask me to do this. My brother would ban my mother from the wedding for not supporting me, and he sure as hell wouldn't choose someone else's family over my happiness. Sounds like you're being manipulated and you'll have people showing you these pictures telling you how great you look as a man for the rest of your life
Don’t even go. Your brother is transphobic too as is your mother
I’m sorry but I will never understand wanting to be there for special moments of others when they are marrying into a more unaccepting family and don’t respect you enough to love the authentic version of you. There are people out there who will love all parts of you and those people may not be your family but their love will mean exponentially more because it’s pure and unconditional. Do not minimize yourself to cling onto people who see you as something to be shamed of
I wouldn't go.
No gorl, no wedding.
If they mistake you for AFAB.. have a dress and makeup kit on stand by. That way if they make an issue of it - you can promise them to you'll go change into something 'more appropriate'.
If it was my bother saying that I'd literally tell to go f**k himself & his girlfriend too.. how dare he If his girlfriends family or his girlfriend doesn't like who you are, that's far from your problem and its absolutely his fault for marrying into such a terrible family. I'd stay far away from them or tell him either they must deal with it or you won't be going. Imagine being told ""stop being yourself"" because that's basically what he's saying!! Sheesh heck no you shouldn't be okay with that! Have some self respect
I’m in the same situation but I’m ftm :( you’re so strong, and you shouldn’t have to do that and I’m so sorry they’re making you. Maybe you could sneak a bra on or a little makeup or something just to feel a slight sense of femininity. You’re amazing and I’m proud of you. We both got this <3
Don’t go.
They don’t want you there, they want the person you pretended to be.
I simply wouldn’t go! You have to be you, he’s being completely unreasonable with no consideration to yourself
Honestly it’s nobody’s business. I would suggest going out separately all dressed how you want to. They are putting themselves in a bad mood by purposely misgendering u to the guests. It’s like no one knows till something is said.
Your brother is being ridiculous, your mother is being cruel, and if your little bro's wife-to-be thinks your existence is less important than The Big Day then she's cruel too. Are they trying to protect you from the family-in-law? Or are they telling you to relive uncomfortable, possibly traumatic moments when you want to be celebrating your brother's love freely because they don't want to ""admit"" that there is a trans woman on their side?

The first option is understandable, but still offensive. The second option is bullying and forcing you back into the closet. My sister spent a not insignificant amount of time at her wedding correcting our family when they deadnamed/misgendered me: if your brother won't do the same, then he's failing the lowest possible bar of respecting your transition. It may be he truly does love you as his big sister, but that doesn't excuse what he's said. You are not required to dress like a man. If you feel comfortable in a pantsuit, that's lovely! But do not let them bully you into suppressing who you are.

Best of luck, sis. I hope you enjoy some of the celebration. <3
I wouldn’t go. I know my siblings’ spouse’s families beyond the wedding days, including on Facebook, so it may come out eventually, or you may be doing this charade forever. Perhaps they are okay with a later date? 

Please be safe! I don’t know I could do this without serious mental stress and anxiety. I don’t know how I could “show up”. Maybe you could talk to a therapist or someone else?
Thats such a gross response from your brother and mother, you deserve to be who you are every single day. If they dont accept you for who you are then they dont even want the real you at the wedding. You are valid and deserve this girl ❤️
Don't go. Really
Just don't go to the wedding. Its a big thing to miss out on, but I believe in peaceful patriotic protest. You should let him know that who you are should have no affect on them.
Hope it goes well. Good luck!
Why would you agree to this? Your mom is going to accept you afterwards by denying who you are on the wedding day?

I think some transphobic family in law you'll never meet again can deal with you existing as a small part of the wedding.
I am so sorry you have to deal with that situation but I hope you have as much fun as you can at the celebration 🥰
Maybe there are a few things you can do to make yourself feel more comfortable without it being too obvious. For example:
-using clear coat to pain your nails 
-wearing the most comfy and glamours underwear 
-slightly tinted chapstick 
-maybe find unisex shoes with a slight heal 
-maybe keep some of your favorite makeup with you so you can apply a bit as soon as you're able to 
-this one is a bit silly but it made me happy during school when I was in the closet but draw the gender symbols in the bottom of your feet 

I hope you can lessen your discomfort. You are so strong, wish you the best
It's a big day for your brother and his fiance, sure.  They're going to make vows in front of both their families promising eternal love.

And as an entree to their vows they want you lie in front of everyone.  A lie that will only make it more difficult for you to be yourself in the future, to both sides of wedding party.  A lie that will be visible in every photo.  Are they asking anyone else to lie? What else are they lying about, other than having a brother not a sister?

It sounds like you've made the decision to accept your brother's request, and we should respect that. Hopefully you find some laughs and entertainment, and have a good time.

However, it's only one day plus a lot of photos. He should never have asked you ""do you want to go"", he should have said, ""I want you to come as 'deadname'"" because that's what he really asked - whatever his reasons.  They can cancel the wedding at any moment, guests are able to cancel at any moment as well.  I would be very upset if any member of my family defined my future relationship with them by whether or not I attended an event where I was expected to betray my principles.

Not exactly the same, however, next month I'm going to the wedding of one of my cousins (not the same as a brother, I know).  He said ""wear what you like, just don't upstage my bride."" I wouldn't have gone if he'd said anything less supportive.  I expect some of the older relatives to make nasty comments, but I'm their for him and his fiance, not the haters.

one benefit of the pandemic is that we all now have a good reason to get out of any unwanted commitments at short notice...

&#x200B;

edit: 4th July, labor day, thanksgiving, halloween, Christmas, what have you worn in the past when your brother has been there? what will you wear when you're together at the next ones? Wouldn't surprise me if your mum's very conditional support comes at the cost of future compromises at major family gatherings; having shown the lie once, you're mother will find it more difficult, not less, at the next event.  You need to be comfortable with whatever decision you make, and only you can have an idea of what the stakes are with your family, so best wishes, whatever you do.
Best of luck hon, hope you can enjoy yourself. I’ll have to get fitted for a tux for my brothers wedding soon.
I admire your patience. If you can handle this, you go for it girl. If that was me it'd be me or them, I'd tell them go frick themselves.

The sheer disrespect of telling a trans person to switch their gender is DISGUSTING. All those years fighting to be who you truly are and people just tell you to return so some people don't have to feel uncomfortable because of their own bigoted views.

Your brother and mother are implying you would ruin the wedding if you went as yourself, but it's not true, it's your brother's girlfriend's family that would ruin it. I'm sorry you have to suffer because of severe injustice, reading it made me really sad.
Not to be mean to anyone, I'm just asking, but why would their family care ? If they don't like you, what about it ? I mean, I just think that's sad for you to be uncomfortable at your brother's wedding 😕 hope your doing really great
My daughter is getting married in April and Me as her father am walking her down the aisle as my true self M2F. Im wearing a ladies pants suit and will have my hair up in a bun and my nails will be done as well as having my jewelry on. She is ok with it so I’m happy about that. It would be hard to go as a guy now since I e been on hormones for almost 5 months.
Stay strong gorgeous we all have to sacrifice for our family ...its just 1 day beautiful , know ur bro will love u for it and no matter what they love u
Yeah, don’t put up with that shit sis, you’re worth more than that
It has to be your decision. As long as you are comfortable with your decision and can live with it. Do what you need to do.
im sorry hun, this is not acceptance. no ultimatum comes from a place of love. 
it seems like your mom doesn’t accept you, rather tolerates your transition. “toning down” your identity is saddening, especially when asked to do so by family
It is your decision, if you are happy, so am I, but if was me on this same situation, I will just refuse to go to this wedding.
That sucks that you have to do that. When I went to my cousin's wedding I wore a kilt with my dad, and mine was 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 which was amazing, and the thing with that is, even though I'm a trans male, and it looks like a skirt, I was still seen as my identity. If I had to wear... I don't know, a dress or skirt I would've cried before we were even at the wedding.

Also I hope that if/when you get married you have the most AMAZING wedding dress adorned with lace or satin or anything because YOU DESERVE IT!
It seems like the emotional equivalent of beating you up at their wedding... Instead of them being uncomfortable you have to endure excruciating pain.

I'm rooting for you not to go but I know the power a family pressure. If you're going to do this I hope at the very least you don't gaslight yourself, and find ways ti reduce thre harm and have a safety plan for during and afterwards.
 Ie... just a few ideas to get u started...Can a trusted friend go with you? Can you wear panties and a necklace that bring you affirming feels...to tune into when dysphoria gets bad? Can you have therapy or a shopping spree or whatever will help you process and heal right afterwards?!...
I hope it went ok. I mean, OK is relative I guess, but I hope you were able to get some enjoyment, and are feeling better and more free now that it is passed! <3
Yeah, I was gonna point that out as well; glad I scrolled first.

No one I ever supported because I *genuinely supported them* ever had to strike any behind-closed-doors deals with me to earn it.  Caring about them was enough motivation.

What's the next bargain she's gonna want to strike once this behavior has been established as one that works?
The “unconditional part” is so on point. I would just talk to them, explain your side and then not go to the wedding
tbh i dont think they took this lightly, if the other family finds out it could be long-term hell... so jumping to such conclusions is dismissing allot of nuance...
There’s no way they’ll mistake me that way. I look a bit more androgynous than male thankfully but it’s also my family who would be in my face about it. They never said anything before but it’s my brothers wedding this time. The only big event since I started transitioning.
What if their families meet again? Or the wives family sees her and recognizes her? It's gonna go down at some point anyway
If my brother ever got married to someone who has (family who has) a problem with my identity, that's a them problem, not a me problem.

Trans people are always the ones that need to change for the comfort of cis people.

Obviously OP can do whatever she wants, this is her decision, but we need to stop excusing this behavior from cis people.
Agreed.   Its super uncomfortable but trying not to make any waves at your brothers wedding is probably the right choice.    I wouldn’t stay long.   Just my two cents.
Forgive me for asking, but you made a post 27 days ago saying you had just come out to your sister and your youngest brother hated your transition, but above that you’ve worn makeup everyday for 3 years and women’s clothes exclusively for over two years, and your younger brother getting married asked you a few months after he proposed (assuming late 2020/early 21) to tone down transition for his wedding; I’m just kinda wondering the dynamics of how you’d be close enough to your family to where you let them dictate what you wear to the wedding while your sister didn’t have a clue for several years what was going on.
yeah, but i also kinda get not wanting that meltdown to be at your wedding.

sucky situation with no real ""solution""
Sure. So brother I’ve lived with all my life, mildly homophobic but does his best around me and same parents. My older sister is my half sister by about 8 years I think, same dad different mom. I never really talk to them much anymore because they both live back home on the east coast. I’m in Arizona but was born in SW New York. I was never close with my half brother or sister and wanted to change that so reached out to them and we started talking, my sister anyway. I can never get Jake to pickup his phone. And I’ve wanted to tell them both for awhile anyway but since I never see them I kinda didn’t feel a pressing urge to tell them. And the wedding was a one time thing for their big day so that I don’t end up being the center of attention at their wedding, which given our families would have probably happened. All my brother asked of me was to wear pants, no skirts or dresses and I agreed. Then after talking with him about his fiancée’s family I offered to for one day only wear mens clothes for it. I was doing it as a favor/ wedding present for them. So yesterday he gave me some of his clothes to try on and they fit well so he knows what I’m wearing for the wedding.
Warn the family beforehand, establish that THEY are the ones that are NOT going to cause any problems, and just try to keep them as separated as possible. Any meltdown is on the fault of the family, not OP."	t2hfw1	trans	279	0.99	2022-02-27 06:01:00
Maybe this will help someone else	"Story time~
So, last year I came out to my father. I hadn’t visited him 6 months prior, as I was starting my transition. When I finally found the courage, I went over and told him immediately. He laughed and said, “that’s why you haven’t been coming over?” He accepted me, or so I thought at the time. 

So, as time went on, two weeks of him joking about it and finally I told him I’m not his son anymore, and to call me by Gabby or use my female pronouns. In a huff, he almost yelled back, “I made ya and I’ll call ya whatever I damn well please!”

I had enough. I left and went home. My roommate told me to tell him to f*ck off, and even though I wanted to, I know my dad cared about me and really desired me in his life, as I am his only child. 

So, I went back over the next day, he was joking as he usually was, he’s quite the comedian, and then started to misgendered me again and get mad when I once again told him to use my correct pronouns and/name. But this time, I said, “Dad, look. I’m gonna be honest. I love you and I want you in my life and I want to be a part of yours. But I don’t have to. I don’t have to talk to you or visit. I choose to, and the way you’re acting about this makes me want to choose otherwise.” He stopped talking and was quiet for a while. Eventually things returned less awkward, we watched a movie and just hung out as usual. But when I was about to go home, he hugged me and called me Gabby. Without a joke, without sarcasm. And from then on he hasn’t once misgendered me since. Even after I moved halfway across the country, he texts me and sends me Hello Kitty gifs (I love HK). 

TL:DR
If you have a family member that you know really loves you but they’re not getting the big deal with your gender identity, let them know your being around them is your choice. And they might lose that privilege.

Edit: wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone for your support, I wish you all the best~ much love."	"Cis people need to hear this too.

Can't tolerate abuse just because it is from family.
That is beautiful. The way you stood up for yourself, and the way he came to respect that. I'm glad you two can move forward together, and be a part of each other's life.
its enough to make a grown trans cry
Well, this only works when your parents love you and didn’t say “I actually never really wanted you” to your face =.= (thanks mom, the feeling is mutual)
I'm in a similar situation, i haven't yet reached resolution but I'm working on it, thank you!
It's a complicated situation. Social media tells us to be intolerant with this type of shit - and by all means, we should not tolerate it - but want it or not, they act that way because they feel threatened and scared of losing someone they love, they don't want the situation, the person they care about, to change. My first reaction is to go with empathy first and to acknowledge the way they feel, and then explain how essential this is to you. If they chose to be an asshole and not accept you for who you are even when they know how you feel, then fuck them. But I think it's good to remember that it can be hard for them too, as it is hard for you

Did you feel weird when people started called you your preferred pronouns?	"I recently started using he/him pronouns around my family after a while of questioning my gender identity. But after being called he a few times now, I'm really confused. It feels weird and wrong, and I'm scared that I might've made a mistake in thinking he/him pronouns were right for me. It's only been like 3 days, but I'm really confused.

Is it normal for a trans/enby person to feel weird or uncomfortable with their preferred pronouns in the beginning? Or is it a sign that those pronouns aren't right for me?

EDIT: Omg thank you everyone for all your answers, this makes me feel so much less alone and worried :)"	"[deleted]
It takes a while to get used to even if it does feel better overall
Well yes, I'm still not used to it that much myself, and I think that's because after being called ""she"" for such a long time and then realizing that I'd prefer to be called by he/him pronouns, while still knowing in the back of my mind that I'm (mostly likely) going to be seen as a female human being, and then when someone calls me the way I ACTUALLY want to, I'm still kind of confused because I'm not used to being referred to the way I want.

... well it's something like that I think, at least for me?
It only felt weird for my immediate family to call me my correct name/pronouns for a while. I think it was a combination of a few things… it felt like I was very exposed. Finally they knew this thing that I had kept secret for so long, and that made me feel very vulnerable. Every time they said my real name/pronouns, it was a reminder of that. It’s also just something that takes some getting used to. They had called me my deadname for nearly 20 years, so of course it felt a little strange to be called something else at first.

This only lasted a couple weeks, if I remember correctly. I’d recommend trying it out for a while, and if it still feels weird (or definitely if it feels wrong), you can always do some more introspection or choose a new name. Good luck
I'm so desensitised from being misgenerated and dead named in work that yes, it is strange when someone gets it right. I mean it's nice but still strange even 4 years later :)
My problem is that I have been there too long and... its oh so difficult for them to get it right, they get just as upset about it as I do,  how can I expect them to remember, doing our best etc etc /s
It’s like the nicest wave of shock a person could give us
Absolutely.  I came out to a few close people a week or two ago.  For me it's a weird mix of happiness and discomfort-- but more happiness than discomfort
Yea! It took a long time. I am afab and started with he, then they/them because I felt imposter-y with he/him. I used both but have been using he him for the past 3 years and it’s so comfortable now. I think it took awhile to be comfortable with other people validating me.
i’m regularly misgendered (not out at work, ignorant housemates) so hearing my actual pronouns sounds completely alien to me sometimes. byproduct of having to be in cisguise
I felt like a burden at work when I asked for my preferred name on my name tag. I'm not out but I use my male name at work, a few customers comment on it and say ""oh that's a pretty name"" and ""is that your real name?"" And some coworkers ask why I go by that name, and I just say that's what my friends have called me since highschool.

Ps. A couple coworkers and managers asked me for my preferred pronouns so thats nice.
It takes a little while because it's a big change, I would try it for a while and see how you're feeling. If it's not a fit try other ones 😊
Yes, it was very weird for me at first, but now 5 months in I get real annoyed when I get ""he/him""ed even though *legally* that's what I ""am"" still

Try it out for a bit, see if you get used to it. Nothing wrong with testing it and moving on to something that works better. When I first came out my wife tried like 5 or 6 names out for me before I found the right one, along with she/they until I determined I'm binary and just need she/her

EDIT 

And yes, the *correct* name and pronouns were still weird for me for a while, they just weren't *as* weird or wrong like the rest
I’ve felt that way with my pronouns & name. I’m pretty sure it’s because I was used to being called by my deadname and she/her. After a while the weirdness went away and now I feel great every time someone genders me correctly
It felt weird at first. Mostly because i wasnt used to it. Its been a couple months now and its starting to feel right
yeah it took some getting used to but after a while it feels normal
Yes, because I was still closeted and they didn't understand that I wasn't in a good place at the time.
it's gotten better over time but yeah, i'm still adjusting. for me it's like..the imposter syndrome aspect. ""oh, they're calling you she, and your new name, but you're not a real woman! why are you making them uncomfortable doing that??"" 

also, it's been weird because most of my friends and family just...switched over to my new name right away. meanwhile i still keep misgendering myself and deadnaming myself
Yeah, only because I was so used to not having them  use them.
I've only just started coming out to everyone so it's only been a few days of people using proper pronouns. Every time someone does I want to cry because it's so validating. It was such a shock to my system when someone actually used he/him with me that I legit teared up. So yes for me it felt weird but in a good way. It was like being recognized for the first time in my life.
Yes. All the time. It feels weird because i feel guilty that it feels good. Like God damnit I'm no where close to transitioning in any sense of the term, why do I feel so good like this.

Edit: Of course that if it feels weird to you in a bad way you can try with other pronouns. Maybe they/then exclusively (although most people aren't that cool with it) or maybe neopronouns.
Omg yes, it took me a solid 2-3 months before I got used to people saying my pronouns. It always felt like I didn't deserve it, but in retrospective it was only impostor syndrome.
ABSOLUTELY. It's called getting used to it haha, it just takes time. It's a big change and your brain needs to adjust. Don't worry about it. Give it a few weeks to try it out.
Give it time. It’ll either start to feel more normal as you get used to it, or it won’t. And even if you end up not liking the ones you’re trying on, that doesn’t mean you have to go back to the ones you started with.
I think it depends on what type of weird it feels. For example, I used to go by they/them (and used to id as nonbinary) and when my family first started to use those I'd feel weird bc I wasn't used to hearing those pronouns anywhere, but i still got excited and knew they were talking about me so it got comfier and more easy to listen to with time. Later it started feeling weird bc they no longer represented me, and in that point it clicked in my brain that i was much more comfortable with he/him and identifying as a trans guy. 

If you feel weird because it feels new and you're getting used to it, it's normal, try to see if your brain/heart does a little !!! of excitement when you hear those words. If instead of feeling that, it makes you icky or you'd rather not hear those pronouns, you might want to reconsider what pronouns to use. 

You could also just go by more than one set of pronouns if that's best for you. And there's nothing wrong with coming out twice or thrice or as many times as necessary, people will get it, even if it's sloppy at first.  Best of luck!
we all do. You know when its new year and writing the new number feels kinda off? that's basically what you're experiencing. same can be applied to accidentally misgendering yourself, too, you just write the wrong date at the start a lot
its perfectly normal to feel like somethings wrong when they start using your new pronouns its just not what you’re used too
It felt weird at first, but I love them.
I felt comfortable with my name almost immediately but not pronouns. For me, I felt like a huge imposter everytime someone used she/her for me (I'm AMAB). I felt extremely self-conscious and like everyone was judging me for not being girly enough, so I swapped to they/them to feel more freed up. I'll probably eventually go back to she/her or a combination, but not until my presentation is a bit more feminine.
I hated being called my new name for a while then i realized that it wasn’t right and changed it and i feel better about it, maybe try something new in a safe space and see how that makes you feel. Also sometimes change just feels weird and it takes time to adjust 🤙
For me I felt this way, but I still get euphoria randomly when I hear people use my name and my pronouns correctly. I think it's just your brain trying to get used to it.

I got called deadname and he/him for nearly 23 years, how can it be an easy transition?
ok yeah when i first started being called by the right name and pronouns it def felt weird, but it's been 4 months now since i've started going by my name with everyone and that feeling has mostly gone away
i’ve been socially trans for 5 years, it’s still weird not gonna lie. i live in a small area and there very religious and kinda transphobic so a lot of people would still see me as my old self. they would even look at me when someone calls me by my preferred pronouns.
I feel the same way too. I think what it is for me is that dysphoria screws up my perception of self, so even if I am a girl, i still get the intrusive thoughts of ""you're a boy that wants to be a girl."" So when I hear my preffered name and true pronouns, it feels like patronization almost.
I use all pronouns but people mostly use those of my agab and even I used to use mostly those to refer to myself. You can imagine the impostor syndrome going strong. But it got better over time and once I got used to being gendered correctly it became pure joy :> I guess it's quite normal to need some time to adapt when you've been called different your whole life.
I felt really awkward when my family used the correct pronouns. It took them such a long time that it was hard to adjust and accept that people saying the correct pronouns wouldn't result in a fight.
Yup! Can't help but feel like I don't ""deserve"" them: the pronouns, the new name. That people using them are just being performative.

It's tough being stuck in your own head with all your doubts swimming around.
i recently decided to go by he/him pronouns in online communities, and even i’m still weirded out by it. even though when i did it, i felt a new sense of excitement, boost in self-esteem, and some gender euphoria… but i still began to overthink and feel like i made a mistake.

as someone else said, probably the feeling of it becoming more concrete is scary. change is scary. 

i’d say it’s normal? i’ve only been going by he/him pronouns for a day or two, and only within my really small circles. just trying it out.

you can always back track if you don’t feel comfortable!
I wouldn't be too scared by it. If at any point you realize that you actually do not prefer he/him pronouns you can just say to people that you want to use different pronouns. You sound, based on the fact that you mentioned your parents, like you are young and you are expected to find yourself when you're young and so people will understand. There's nothing wrong with taking time to find yourself.
No I felt happy as fu
Has it gotten less strange-feeling over time? Like have you adjusted to it or have those feelings lingered, if you don't mind me asking.
Yeah I feel this. Like when someone uses my preferred pronouns or name I feel a little odd because I know I still look and sound masculine.
That's dysphoria... doubt and fear... Imposter syndrome...
Not who you replied to, but yes. Still a bit strange, but not as much as at the start. Realistically, you've been called one thing for howevermany years; suddenly changing that is going to take time to get used to.

I wish I wasn't trans	"People always tell me that being trans is ""so cool,"" but what exactly is so great about it?

My brother, who I desperately want to think of as the same brother I had a year ago, refuses to use my name and pronouns ""because he's known me as my deadname and she/her all my life.""

At school, I have to explain every time that my name is Kai, not my deadname. The most frustrating parts of this is that Kai is on my school ID, just in parenthesis after my deadname, and people still call me she, despite me looking masc/androgynous and having a masc name.

Every time I look in the mirror, I feel like I'm looking at a stranger. I can't shower unless it's in the dark. We were on vacation the last 2 weeks, and I only showered 3 times. I was outside walking around most of every day, but I couldn't bring myself to shower.

Cishet people don't understand how much it fucking hurts to live a lie. To feel like your body isn't yours. To be judged. To be harasssed. To be misgendered. To be deadnamed. 

Fortunately, I've never faced any real violence because of my identity. But plenty of kids at school have called attention to it, and every time I use a public bathroom I wait to be punched. I expect it to happen."	"This, being trans isn't cute or fun, it's fucking torture
*fucking all of this*
This ☝️

My sister once told me ""It must be really nice not having menstrual cycles (cause I was on my period; just no blood) and I guess I was just crazy hormonal cause I snapped out ""Oh yeah I love hating my body""
I hate it too. But it is who I am, so I have to fucking live with it and make the best out of it
This. I fucking hate being trans. It’s not fun when you know there are plenty of people that want you dead.
I hate it too. I’m 2 years into hrt and have had almost no results. I’ll never see the woman i so desperately wanted to be and that’s just too heartbreaking a loss to live with so that’s why I’m gonna just off myself. Just because someone comes out as trans and starts hrt and begins to transition does not mean you’ll going to get your happy ending
same here, everyone thinks beimg trans is some funny trait which comes with fun but my whole experience is horrible torture, wish i was just born a cis girl fr
I've got to concur. I tell my wife all the time that this sucks, people suck, I wish I could just ""be normal"" -_- most of my discomfort come from the opposite gender and the judgemental looks/laughs I get. It helps I started at 200 lbs and have a fair bit of muscle still so most people are too intimidated to say anything. But I'll find myself changing my clothes and taking down my hair just to avoid the ridicule. Everyday it gets a little easier though when you accept yourself and you get those good feelings. If people could just myob then transitioning and experiencing gender euphoria in public wouldn't hurt us so much.
Throughout history people have picked on, bullied conquered anyone who they thought was different. They looked at themselves as the perfect ones. There are billions of people in the world THEY are ALL different. And some day people may wake up to the facts that if you do no harm to others you are a good human. Being trans isn’t a choice it is who you are, others reactions are the problem. You are a valid m deserving human being. Be honest and true to yourself ❤️❤️❤️
Any time someone talks about how people are Trans for attention, this is what I say. Because who would choose this? 

Who would choose the hatred, the threats, the insults?

Who would choose to look in the mirror and hate themselves for facial and body hair, or lack thereof? For things other people wouldn't even notice?

Who would choose the terrifying ordeal of finally coming to terms with your identity after your developmental years, and fearing that no amount of therapy or hormones will help you?

Who would choose the potential of losing friends and family if you're brave enough to be yourself, but they're too cowardly to accept change?

No part of this is a fun experience. Absolutely fucking none of it. 

If your problem with trans people comes in when you see someone who's *finally* happy with themselves, and you sneer and scoff and think to yourself how they're just doing it for attention, or how you wish it wasn't a thing...

Who the **fuck** would choose to live on the opposite end of a world full of people like *you?*
Yep, pretty great like, being totally unable to talk to anyone about how I really feel, some of my friends saying I'm just trying to get attention, and thinking it'd be less painful to burn to death in a fire than have to keep going through this.

I wish I wasn't this way, either.
Hey Kai, this won't be like this forever, mate. Things get better as you get older and move on from school and all this dumb shit. You'll get T and you'll feel better and you'll pass and people won't sweat you about your deadname anymore. Life is so much more than it is today. I really hate being trans too, man, but you hang in there and keep your head up. Life will improve if you keep moving ahead.
being trans is not cool, it’s not fun, it’s just the way we are and we have to deal with society judging us.
I cried while reading this. I am so sorry that you have gone through so much. I’ve experienced similar feelings and I’m a trans woman. It’s so hard and I understand the pain. 

Please remember that you are loved and valid always. 💖
This is true. All of it. It's not fun, it's torture.

But some words of wisdom from one Captain Sisko
""That might be the most important thing to understand about Humans. It's the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly searching, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions.""

When I rewatch Emissary this quote makes me believe that humans are capable of empathy, and shows that we are always trying to better ourselves despite our tendencies to self destruct. Gives me hope
Being transgender is not a choice. I live my life the best way I can with what I have. I have chosen to transition and live my life as my most authentic self. Doing otherwise would personally be a lie. I can't live that way and still love myself. Do I wish that I wasn't transgender, sure. I am transgender so I deal with that aspect of my life and try to minimize any problems that come my way because of it.

You got this Kai. It should get easier the longer you transition. People treating a fine gentleman like you poorly for being transgender is unacceptable. I hope that you will be able to navigate these turbulent times well until things get better for you.
I think most of us wish we weren't trans. But that's not the hand we were dealt, v so you need to make the best of it. 

My goal is to feel normal, and I'm starting to really get there. It takes time though.
I get this a lot people are so ignorant abt things like this I’m sorry you have to deal with this king
It sure is hard and I agree with like 90% of the stuff said here but the thing that lets me say it's nice to be trans is mostly because of the amazing people i have met within the local queer community, the thing that i have something in common with those ppl. That we can relate to the same stuff and ofc Sometimes the same struggles . Yes it would probably be easier if we're all born in the body we wanted but i feel like i would miss the people in my life i like to surround myself with, Wich if i didn't had i probably would be dead by now cis or not.


Completely understand if u don't agree but wanted to share something different then ""same""
Yeah I've definitely been there. It's not an ideal thing and lots of people won't understand it. But it is something that will make you feel way better when you embrace all of yourself. I definitely cried for wanting to just be normal and not having to deal with it. But it really proves that we don't choose this for ourselves. It's just our truth. I can promise you that it doesn't go away, but it gets way better and you'll be much happier for having it be part of who you are then trying to hide it.
I know that feeling, my advice is just to ignore those horrid people and work towards HRT, once you do that you should be able to shower easier and maybe people will take you more seriously. They shouldn't need you to get hormones to take you seriously but there's not much else I can offer in the way of advice sadly. Personally I can't shower if I need to look down but I've got small a cups forming so my chest isn't so bad.
Politely tell high up at school to try to get ID card reprinted without your deadname.
Body disphoria is fun 😳🔥
I hear that you are in a lot of pain. It must suck to not be seeing any results and feel like you’ll never see the you that you want to see in the mirror. If you are in the US, please know that there are trained professionals available at 800-273-8255 24/7 who can help with these challenging feelings. If you are outside the US, you can find resources at [Open Counseling](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/)
My mom is getting better and more understanding, but when I first came out, she asked if I was doing it for attention and to be different. Because I would *choose* to be discriminated against. Like every other kid, I just want to live my life in fear of being called a slur or wondering ""Will this person hurt me if I tell them I'm not a girl?""
That doesn't mean that there are no people who are doing this for attention. Yes, there are. However, I don't believe that anyone would actually *medically transition* just for attention. That would make no sense.
I felt like shit tbh. They're trans too (just not in the binary way) and generally they don't have any kind of dysphoria; more like gender just doesn't quite fit them, so they really do not understand what a miserable feeling it is
Not sure I like the what-aboutism here. 

Or the implications you're putting forward about the validity of those who decide that medical transition isn't a part of their journey.
I've thought a bit about your response and what I had written. My intention wasn't to invalidate anyone, yet I see that these beliefs can actually invalidate people and make them doubt more. I was thinking about people like that ""trans Korean guy"" whose name I've forgotten, but ... that's not being trans.

Thank you for your response. I see that I still need to change some of my beliefs, internalised transphobia perhaps. Might also be a reason why I find it so hard to accept myself. Have a nice day ❤️"	vdh9mg	trans	269	0.99	2022-06-16 08:38:19
PSA and a rant: Just got denied credit and a bank account because I'm trans	"My legal name and gender marker change has fucked my credit. Normally when you report a name change, the creditor reports the change to the credit bureaus. Well, mine did, and the credit bureaus decided that I must be a totally different person (despite my social security number being the same and updated with the new info). I am mailing in copies of the court decree and identifying documents but my credit history could take months to be fully moved to the proper name. Did I mention I desperately need a car?

Tried to set up a new bank account under the new name. Online application got rejected because they couldnt verify my identity. But they told me I could go into a branch and resolve the issue. Went into a branch and the banker manually verified my identification but said the application could still take time to process. We'll just have to wait and see I guess.

Apparently, this is a common thing to happen to trans folks. I was just not aware that this was even possible. 

So just be aware that you MAY need to not rely on financial institutions for awhile after your legal name and gender marker change. For context I got my court decree in my hand early Aug 2021 and had my ID and Social Security card changed by end of Aug 2021.

P.s. I'm not asking for advice, I'm taking steps to correct this. I'm just offering a unique perspective on something that can happen."	"Credit scores are definitely one of the more evil inventions of the US
I lucked out here I believe with my parents naming me. Even though I chose a different one, my deadname is unisex. So I can keep it until I am in a situation where I can afford the credit hit.
I believe I did something online to get the credit bureaus to update my info, but haven't had a problem yet, I just got a car loan too, my score is still good. Maybe look into each bureau to see what they need, it didn't take months for mine.
In the meantime just buy an old beat up Honda, just don’t forget your gallon of oil and keep checking it, it will get you places, not in style but it will get you places
I’m going to have to watch that. Thanks 😊
This makes me grateful I didn’t have any bank information on me other than my student loans before I changed my name. Sorry I have no advice 😓
Maybe it’s changed now but I never had that problem
Maybe it’s changed now but I never had that problem

Pretty sure I don't even have a credit score, but it's good to know about this regardless.
This is really good advice, I’m looking into getting my name changed so i think I’ll make sure to make a large cash withdrawal just in case they have issues with my debit card, thank fully I don’t have a credit card
This happened to me too!
[removed]
wait .. does something happen to your credit with a name change even if you dont have any sort of bank account ? 😖 I changed mine a few months ago and recently on my ID too so its like all done .. but I dont have any bank account or anything @-@ 

also worrying because I have a unpaid hospital bill (from before my name change) and I am scared its gonna be stuck somewhere forever.. I dont want the bank to see im trans when I open a account o(-<
At least My credit is already fucked so it won't matter when I change my name
Worse you have multiple credit scores these days and they’re not consistent
Agreed. Though, now, we can officially say that we're not the worst country when it comes to abusing the credit system.
I'm so glad it's not a thing in my country
I'm quite happy not to understand a damn thing about this crap because we don't do that here in Europe.
That is so awesome. My dad specifically picked my deadname out because it was the name of a love interest in some shitty western movie....so extremely feminine sounding.
Yeah, the bureaus specifically say I need to mail my info in.
I plan to when I can get access to my money. My current bank account is still under my deadname but that should change soon.
Yeah not everyone does. I should mention this in the U.S.
Dang, lucky!
I'm pissed this happened to someone else,  but so glad to hear I'm not alone.
That is patently untrue. Banks and financial institutions use your gender marker to verify your identity even after first name changes. So cis people are usually fine. Also people with more complex credit profiles are less likely to have this happen because there are more points of data with which to verify that person's identity even if they are changing their gender marker. But because I have a simple and relatively young credit profile, the bureaus couldn't seem to gather enough data on me. 
Also, who changes their first name in this society? Certainly a small, (very very small) number of cisgender people do. But it is mainly trans and nonbinary people who end up having to change their first name. If the main users of a system are people for which the system was not designed, the system tends to fail.
Oh they will find out. And that may or may not cause a problem. It has to do with verifying your identity. So yes, the bank knows you're trans.

And yes, if you notify your creditors of your name and gender marker change there is a possibility that the reporting bureau could misunderstand and basically make a new account under the proper name, while maintaining the old account under the deadname. There are steps to correcting this but the bureaus are notoriously difficult to deal with and slow to change this kind of mistake.
there are credit scores in Europe  , however  due to variation in local laws and  EU / EFTA stuff they do operate differently to each other  and  differently to how credit scoring in the US works
Yeah, Morgan can go either way, but I love Penelope so much more.
I'm going through it too. Apartment said they couldn't complete my credit check and I contacted the bureaus and was told I need to mail stuff in.

My trans friend (65f) recently had bottom surgery and seems a little off.	"My friend who is trans recently had bottom surgery and seems different to me. I’m a cisgender woman and am aware that this surgery is emotive and that I probably don’t understand a lot of the nuance of this and it’s impact. 

Some of the things she’s said since have been a bit concerning to me- for example, she has stated that she no longer believes trans people who don’t get gender affirmation surgery are committed to their trans identities. She’s identified as a woman for years prior to surgery so this seems a really odd reaction to me. Also obviously there are health, cost and preference limitations for most of us.

Has anyone experienced this with someone or themselves? I’m wondering if it’s just emotions connected to surgery or that she’s just been through a lot. 

Grateful for any thoughts on this."	"In the same way that gender dysphoria affects our perceptions of our bodies and how they belong in and move through the world, gender euphoria can cause some uncharacteristic things to happen. I've noticed this in friends shortly after they've had top or bottom surgery, where they'll say something that's just bizarrely perpendicular to everything I've ever known about them. Over time, these incongruities tend to dissipate and they balance back into the people I've always known them to be.

Give your friend some grace, and some time, for their perspective to recenter. If she's still talking like this in six months, it's possible that her experience has inadvertantly turned her into a transmedicalist, and that becomes a different kind of situation entirely.
Any kind of surgery especially bottom surgery is very psychically and mentally draining on the body. The body is trying to recover and heal which takes a lot of energy to do so. Post op depression is very common
It's possible she could be projecting due to trauma from the surgery. This could be for a variety of reasons: Unsatisfactory Results, Shock, Complications, Regret, etc...
Sounds pretty ignorant and holier than thou of her, which is really sad to see within our own community. Hopefully its just a phase shes going through to feel more valid because of self doubt and not an actual belief she plans on toting for the rest of her life.
as someone who will probably (probably) never get phallo, i ofc disagree.

i'm super happy that her surgery was a success! and im willin to bet she's saying all that because of how affirming that surgery was to her. im thinkin it's like a more aggressive way of her sayin, ""get the surgery, it's worth it.""

i wish her all the best with recovery from surgery!
Is it possible she's on pain medications that are causing her to say uncharacteristic things? Depending on how recent it is, she might just be out of it (due to pain or medication), in addition to the euphoria others have mentioned.
As someone with IBD who is has been given mental health clearance but not medical clearance, that's bullshit.  My GI is worried about potential problems before signing off so I'm working on getting that fixed but it may never be a reality for me.  And I'm just a small portion of people who have pre-existing conditions that hinder them from being able to proceed with the surgery.  Your friend needs to check her privilege.
Guess I’m faking it. 🤷🏻‍♀️
sounds like transmedicalism due to the fact she was privileged enough to get bottom surgery
Such elitist rubbish that she’a peddling. She’s completely wrong and she’s no better than a CIS person rejecting a trans person, regardless of surgery or whatever.

I really hope she isn’t out there evangelising bottom surgery. Tell her to pull her head in and remind her where she came from. If she doesn’t like it, find a new friend. 

Sooo wrong!!
Yes this is common, I've heard from many trans women after SRS this kind of things, that everybody who is before SRS is not real trans not dedicated just fetishized man who is playing woman etc. This is just transphobic and after surgery they think they are something more because they have vaginoplasty. I hate this kind of talks invalidating all other trans women who cannot afford surgery or for some reason they don't want vaginoplasty. And I must admit there is similar transphobic approach of trans women on HRT vs. trans women without HRT.
She’s transphobic
Thank you so much - I hadn’t really considered the potential gender euphoria impact on this. I think giving her some time to settle is probably best and necessary.

It’s just jarring to hear someone who’s always seemed so accepting question other people’s gender assertions and I didn’t understand that, but this perspective makes a lot of sense. Thank you. 
I
Absolutely, this is exactly what I went through with literally all of that. Not saying this is what her friend is going through but at least myself and my entire support group of trans women with post op specialty care have been through versions of this with similar impacts on our lives.

The push to convince ourselves we made the right decision makes it imperative to project that our experience wasn't as bad as it actually was and out of fear that it'll make someone else not get the surgery / which is also why our trans peers often dismiss our experiences and pressure us not to tell our stories. So not only is there negativity in our own minds but we're vilified on all ends, from peers to the medical care team. 

Op, if you're friend is experiencing something along these lines, you should see if she's willing to go to a similar support group or seek therapy. Actually, I think either way she should, as well as anyone going through grs because it can be traumatic even if everything goes right.

The hopes and dreams we have are often so large that when things go wrong without any chance of going back to the way things were, it can seem like there's no way out and thoughts of suicide can become overwhelming.
It doesn't sound like that to me... She describes her friend as having bottom surgery with no regrets. It sounds like she, has had some sort of; ""since I've had bottom surgery, I'm a better Trans woman than people who don't"" ie; your not Trans enough.
Thank you- this was my concern as well. From the other comments I’m hoping this is just a phase in reaction to a surgery - maybe there’s some regret / projection too from not having pursued it sooner, a lot of possibilities. 

I think it just scared me a little - agree it is not a view I could get behind.
Thank you! I’ll check in on this- a good point. I don’t actually think she is on anything that would have that much mental impact, but it is possible the mental stress even without strong meds might be a lot.
Thank you - very aware that this view is inaccurate, its wild to me and I know it was a long and big decision for her to get surgery also, so it seems very strange (and somewhat upsetting) to me that she would share this view now. 

I suspect (and really hope) there’s something else going on (as other commenters have suggested). And I hope you’re doing alright, I’m sorry to hear that this process is so challenging. People like you inspire me every day.
You’re in good company 😉
A more accurate term would be transmedicalist.
Exactly , I'm hearing this a lot all over internet from post-op trans women. They are saying that without SRS you are just fetishized men not real trans etc. On the other hand I'm hearing similar things from trans women on HRT saying this to trans women without HRT, so as you can see this s*it is falling down 🙂
I'm post-op five years. I've been in since 2005. I say that because I don't have cis - woman privilege and I learn more each day. The Trans people that are spewing this bullshit, have a lot of self searching to do.
So what does ""not Trans enough"", mean""? When I started, there was no such thing, and the the community was very small. We helped each other we were there for each other.
It's pity it's different from the past and community is pretty much not in unity."	syqbti	trans	260	0.99	2022-02-22 15:31:24
I'm scared for the future of the trans community	"This is going to be a full on personal vent, so uh, be prepared.

I'm 17. I started identifying as a trans girl when I was 13, back in around 2018. I'm not someone who was around for stuff like tumblr and the like, but I've been around trans subreddits, twitters, discords and the likes. When my dad would lambast me for my identity, r/traa was there to make me smile. When I would get shot down in my journey to acceptance and independence, I always had like-minded people to talk to.

But in the past year, I've witnessed public opinion sway against the trans community. And I can't lie: I'm afraid. I'm afraid for the little community of trans people, young and old, sharing their wisdoms and experiences. And yes, it is because of terfs.

When I was just getting into trans spaces, terfs were something like a mythological being - a group that are hard to find, like a unicorn, and filled with nothing but hate. But we never were bothered by them. But now, after the pandemic, the cracks in that have started to form, to the point where the innocence for me has vanished after the formation of the LGB Alliance and the process of JK Rowling becoming basically a cult leader. 

And I'm not disturbed because of old British white women whining about us. I'm disturbed because these viewpoints are reaching far. Go to any article about a trans person and you will see their ideologies spread. Hundreds of people are being indoctrinated into this hateful ideology, and fully believe conspiracy theories, like that all trans women can be separated into two categories, AGP and HSTS, based on their sexual fetishes. Or that all trans men are young girls who have internalized misogyny.

And it's not just cranky old republicans. They're always gonna be a hateful bunch. But I'm seeing more young left-leaning people also side with this belief. People will talk about extremely old-fashioned radical feminists, but they won't talk about the group of young radical feminists, that go from 17 to as young as 13, saying slurs, mocking people for being trans, and targeting trans women with femcel lingo like ""moid"" and ""scrote"". They are extremely radical, to the point I've seen unironic ""kill all men"" advocates in there.

And, as much as I know many people say these people are all straight, I've noticed that many of them are lesbians. These people speak of their experience in that early LGBT community, but act as if it was truly a mistake, and that things are better now that they can rip on trans people as much as they wish.

And the thing is that, despite the groups I'm in becoming more progressive over time, I've seen the community at large doing jackshit. There are hundreds of thousands of us - I know there's so much we could do if we went against orgs like the LGB Alliance or Fair Play for Women or whoever the hell, but no one seems to bother. I found out recently that people were demeaning the Loki series on D+ for having a genderfluid person fuck himself, linking it to AGP - and, as a trans woman, it felt so insulting that people were willing to bring this theory up as if it was some kind of old fringe theory when the guy who created it, Ray Blanchard, is still on Twitter throwing out the same old bigotry. They could do things about it. But they don't. 

And when you give them an inch, they go a mile. That is how we got to the number of anti-trans bills we've seen as of recently - even though, again, they are seemingly only given huge fanfare if they target gay people rather than trans people. High ranking liberals and democrats will put their pronouns in their bios, which are meant to signify respect and solidarity with trans people - but instead, they now seem to just service as more lip service among themselves.

I'm saying this here because I fully want people to give their responses. I've been holding a lot of this in, because other people seem to not know much besides ""jk rowling said this and that"", so when I say it, it feels as if I'm talking to a brick wall. I want to hear people's viewpoints, whether they are similar or different, and I genuinely want to know if we could ever return to that state of gleeful innocence that I remember from the pre-pandemic trans community. Because from everything I've seen of terfs, they want us to go back even further - to the 80s and 90s, where trans people were viewed as nothing more than weirdos in bars, gay people that went too far, or just as freaks you talk smack about in private. Not a great future."	"Dying beliefs & hatred are loudest right before they are extinguished.

You can see this throughout history from racism to womens’ rights to gay marriage. Every single one of them went through the phase you’re seeing right now. Although it sucks and is demoralizing: They won’t win in the end. They never have, and they never will. Hate always loses.

It’s a dying belief system full of hatred that’s gasping for its last breath. Don’t give it attention…just let it die. It’s not worth your time or energy.
Don't forget that the LGBT movement started with trans people starting a riot and fucking up the NYPD. We're not to be fucked with
Believe it or not, it's still way better than it was in 90s. I know it can seem disparaging now, and that there are people like she who must not be named bringing it up every chance she gets, but before we were just hated, thought of as disgusting, and worthy of public ridicule, and not just by the cishets but the LGB community as well. Like when GLAAD praised a very transphobic episode of the Simpsons. I honestly couldn't imagine working where I am now with even so much as a single person knowing. Sure, I still have to deal with transphobes from time to time, but I'm at least in a position to not only to demand the same respect as others in my position, but also have the support of managers as well directors that insure people will face consequences for their continued hate.
Rowling is just an old crone past her prime spouting transphobic rhetoric in a vain attempt to cling to relevancy. 

To me, it seems like most trans people and their supporters aren't focused on the right thing. Identity politics, going on and on about pronouns, seem to take the forefront of people's issues. While being perceived as one's actual identity is important, I feel that the real issues that should be focused on are access to healthcare and legal recognition. It's easy to start a debate on wether or not trans people can compete in athletics as well, and often that becomes a main point of contention. But we, in the US, literally have legislation going through stating that parents of trans children are abusers. There is an active attempt to cripple reproductive healthcare. These are the things that trans people need to stand against. Its not easy to change public perception. Its going to take a long time. But first and foremost, we need to stand up for what is needed immediately - the ability to receive treatments wether they be hormone replacement, therapy, or reassignment surgeries or whatever. Before anyone can convince others that they are he/she/whatever, they need to be able to self actualize, and we are currently seeing a regression in the right to do so.
I'm scared for my community, we haven't even put our foot in the door to be respected and we have a lot of trans folk. DID/OSDD (traumagenic)

What gives me hope is the trans community and their ability to stay afloat. 

You guys and gals are professionals at helping me with gender dypshoria while cofronting with an alter who is of an opposite gender.

I scroll through these subs all the time for relief.

Don't let the flame die out, be persistent. Without you all, my hope for my community being taken seriously is gone. Completely gone.

Much love. Keep fighting.
History is in our side.  When slavery was banned there was a backlash.  When women got the vote there was a backlash.  When gay sex was legalized there was a backlash.   We grow more numerous day by day.  We are a strong community.  Human rights will prevail.  I am 49 and only transitioned socially a year ago.  I am the first transgender woman in the world in 98% male offshore windfarm construction industry so far as I know.  Every day we break into new fields.  We are establishing ourselves.  Be strong, stand up, demand your seat at the table.  Use your voice.  However, always try to be a role model so that others become more educated and aware that we are just people.  ❤
It's like always, it's fear transform into hate. A lot of TERF are women who get abused, beated, >[raped]< by men. They wanted a group designed guilty. JK and people like her use the fear of these women to make a hate of trans women, who get designed the guilty group. That's why some TERF can change their mind if they encounter a real trans person. But some are way too far. Anyway, transphobia is transphobia and all TERF should face consequence, they are responsable to fall in this type of message
In my country they are a politician that is against trans/gay/muslim/jewish, by the ranking of the elections he is 2/3rd, im verry worry
I agree with all of this, and it's incredibly scary. But I don't think demonizing lesbians was necessary. Maybe I'm biased because I'm a trans lesbian myself, but a lot of the lesbian community is full of people who wholeheartedly support trans people, and are trans themselves. The majority of transphobes are cishet people. I'm just saying this because I really don't want trans people, especially trans men to be afraid of lesbians. The majority of us support trans folks fully! Of course there are outliers, there always are. But trying to pin the blame on lesbians specifically actually gets to people. I've had trans friends block me when they found out I was a lesbian and a feminist because they they thought it made me inherently transphobic, even though I'm trans myself.


Bottom line is, blame transphobia on transphobes, not transphobic lesbians/feminists.
If they don't like me, they'd have to kill me.
Laws targeting trans men and women in sports I suspect have an economic basis.  Billions of dollars exchange hands via sports betting.  A sporting event outcome could readily hinge on one individual being a fraction of a second faster or stronger.  Having a trans man or woman on a team makes it harder to guess the outcomes of various wagers. Those individuals most likely to bet big or cover those bets are likely to have undue influence on politicians and may want to eliminate our presence it sports, as no one plays sports for the sheer fun of it.
The natural counter has been here since René Descartes: Liberalism

Liberalism is slowly spreading and usurping the old value system in the West. Emphasis on slowly. The spread gained its first foothold in 1776, being brought from the realm of theory to practice. Then in 1789, it gained its second foothold, one which became a bastion of freedom. This bastion violently spread outwards in 1803, eventually being pushed back but not before cementing ideas. Ideas which resulted in spread throughout the Spanish colonies and the rest of the West. Then it sat and bubbled, waiting for an opportunity. In 1848, this came and the West was thrown into chaos as Liberalism once more violently erupted throughout Europe. After this it quietly coexisted with the old values until the 20th century, making small waves here and there on the way. Then in 1939 reactionaries violently attempted to overthrow it. In 1945 this overthrow was extinguished. In the 1960s, it gained majority and started enforcing equality for all. Ever since then it has slowly been building more and more traction.
That's something that keeps me sane at night. Not once in history has hateful ideologies like this actually win in the end, no matter how bad it seems. It will never be quelled, but we can survive.
You say that. Yet black rights are literally threatened by cops everyday under the table. Women's rights have and are being regularly assaulted as we speak with the bans on abortion, even for medically necessary abortions such as those during an ectopic pregnancy. 


We can't let the pattern you speak of convince us to let our guard down.

That said, I think the general value of what you said is important - we can't let the state of things demoralize us and prevent us from living as we are. As long as we continue to exist, fighting ignorance, living true and helping others do the same, they can't and will never erase us.


Squash these ideologies as soon as they pop up in your friend circles, or cut those people out. Expose their hate. They deserve to know that their shit is not tolerated and is looked down on.
[The Stonewall Riot.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots)

Trans folks and crossdressers were at the forefront there, as were lesbians, etc.
If it seemed like I was demonizing lesbians I'm really sorry because that wasn't the intention at all! I just here a lot of people assume that they are all straight and white and I wanted to be accurate to what I see. Absolutely was not meant to disparage lesbians because I know 99.98% of them are awesome
I'll admit, this seems like an absurdly naive view of history. Social progress *has* been rolled back before. Women's rights and homosexuality got worse between the Middle Ages and the renaissance, for example. Slavery became more commonplace for a while etc. 

The fact things got better doesn't mean they'll go on like this. And I say *better* because the examples given are incomplete: racism is still a problem, women's rights are often purely nominal, gay marriage is only legal in some countries... I could go on, but basically: don't assume we'll win for sure. That's anything but a given.
**[Stonewall riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots)** 
 
 >The Stonewall riots (also known as the Stonewall uprising, Stonewall rebellion, or simply Stonewall) were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the gay community in response to a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City, New York, United States of America. Patrons of the Stonewall, other Village lesbian and gay bars, and neighborhood street people fought back when the police became violent.

Yes, but as I said, they will never be quelled. All of these examples in today's society are still way better off than before, and even with gay marrage and women's rights, at least there are countries which DO allow for those things, rather than a couple to NONE.

I'm tired of people using incorrect scientific terms and statements to justify their transphobia	"In the country where I live, there is a popular 'science' page that often uses outdated and tranphobic, fatphobic, sexist terms. 
Today, they posted about transphobia.
First words in the post are ""this is transphobia"" on the left side, and ""this is not transphobia"" on the right. 
On the left, obvious transphobic things like ""laughing at trans people"" ""denying trans people their right to transition"". 
But then on the right:
1. Saying there are only two genders
2. Saying that a difference between your gender and gender identity is an illness
3. Saying gender is only determined by genes and not culture (that was supposed to mean 'mental gender is not a valid gender')




There were so many likes to that post and so many commenters who agreed and praised the author of the page.
I am so tired of people pretending they are experts in the transgender field, even though they have no education in it. I am tired of people claiming ""this is basic biology"". I am tired that people use outdated terms that are INCORRECT SCIENTIFICALLY to justify their obvious transphobia - to deny the fact that we are who we are. 
When will this end, when will people let us fucking live without us having to have endless disputes about our right to exist? When will discussion about the validity of our identity end? And lastly, why do people care so much about what junk we were born with and not about what we are?
I had to vent cause I'm just so mad."	"""Air resistance doesn't exist. It's basic physics.""
My bestman is a biologist, and we often talk about trans people on sports, and he confirm some of the divergences between bodies, but everytime he says, ""anyway, banning transpeople of their gender gategorie is transphoby and we should find another solution that don't shame trans people"". He is a really good friend and ally
We must fight to end the genetal mutilation of intersex infants. If we protect intersex babies we are protecting all of us from the dangers of misinformation.
Anyone claiming that science supports the idea of binary gender is *decades* out of date. Fields like anthropology and sociology have recognized the fact that gender is socially constructed since the 1970s.   


Not that the anti-trans crowd *actually* cares about science.
You just have to learn to not go into these kinds of spaces online and avoid people like this IRL as much as possible.

The only way to win the game is not to play, even if that means fighting the urge to argue with these people :/
Just because you don't 100 % agree with everything regarding a topic doesn't mean you are phobic. A phobia is an extreme reaction to something. Saying there are only 2 genders is not phobia.
I've seen it woth racists and homophobes, where they pat themselves on the back for not burning people at the stake. 

Its just to make themselves feel better, pretend they're good people and not total cunts, sry u have to go thru this shit, ppl suck 😕
Even with so called allies using outdated terms, I've had many ""disagreements"" with my friends on terminology but they keep digging their heels in
What is the name of this ""science"" journal
In my opinion this people should be easy to convince i myself thought there were only 2 genders but i quickly realised why it was wrong, if this people are logical they should be just as easily swayed
People will use anything to justify their transphobia. Whether its science (which has proven that genders arent binary but are cultural human inventions) , god (who love everyone, exept apparently the lgbtq community for some reason) or the elderly (which this subreddit has shown are completly capable of understanding and respecting us). Stop blaming your transphobia on everything and just admit your discriminating for no reason other than lack of understanting. Or better yet, try to understand and accept trans people.
""Ay listen, idc what you think you've learned. My physics professor in 9th grade says air resistance doesn't exist so obviously you're just making shit up to fulfill your own bias!""
yeah the transphobes are like ""it's basic biology"" and I'm like I'm sorry but have you ever heard of advanced biology?
This is my new retort.
yo this is actually the *best* analogy for that, thank you
Yes, this is true! But I don’t see the relation to the original post. Maybe I’m just confused?
I didn't *go* to those spaces. This was shared all over the trans groups in my country, which is quite understandable considering how the page is one of the biggest 'science' pages on facebook, so people were disappointed. Even when you avoid tranphobia it always finds a way to get to you.
I agree
saying there are only two genders invalidates the identity of non binary people and therefore it is transphobia. idk if you're new to lgbt related topics or what but any lgbt related ""phobias"" are not in fact ""phobias"" as in extreme fears of something (like social phobia), but reactions that invalidate, humiliate, or just reject scientific knowledge (such as claiming there are only two genders in a world with non binary people, whose identity is valid; claiming homosexuality or being trans is a sickness, which is just... not true? and leads to stigmatising us)
Can confirm all cows in my vicinity are frictionless spheres in complete vacuums.
""if air has resistance, how can we move through it? Sounds like you're deluding yourself.""
unfortunately, they genuinely have not in many cases. 

A lot of transphobes are sold on the idea that there *isn't* more advanced knowledge and research and understanding to be had on the subject, because as far as they're concerned, *they're already there.* 

They already have the ""correct"" understanding. Obviously, that's not true, but it does give context to why many transphobes are so frustratingly dense about things.
I can see some kind of connection there if I think laterally:

1. Stopping genital surgery on intersex babies may lead to more adults with non-binary genitalia, therefore
2. More adults will have come in contact with and have exposure to non-binary genitalia, therefore
3. More adults will be normalised and open to all kinds of genitalia on people of all genders, therefore
4. Less transphobia

It's a stretch though, a long game, and there are many more effective ways of combating misinformation and transphobia (despite the fact that genital surgeries on intersex babies should definitely be stopped regardless).
It’s inseparable from misinformation about trans people, it’s really also inseparable from misinformation about the vaccine. All of the misinformation is bad and hurts people. I think saving babies from mutilation is a really good starting point.
Transphobic content finding its way into trans spaces is probably something I should have considered before smashing a comment together
Thank you. I find this community to be totally resistant any form of discussion regarding non-trans peoples view of things. The world does not only exist from a trans point of view. As the other person who commented on my comment pointed out, words no longer need to mean what they intended to mean -like phobia- this word now encompasses anyone or anything that doesn't wholeheartedly agree with every opinion coming out of this community.
I know, also the fact that those are the kind of people that are basically *commited* to misunderstanding you. 

I don't know why, but for some people admitting to a mistake is a big problem, like they would lose their honor if they changed their mind when they were very deeply convinced they are right. 

That, and the fact that lgbt-related issues are considered leftist-political, like environmental topics, and often trigger far-right people and make them agressive, makes discussion quite often pointless.
Agreed. I can get there, but it’s a stretch! Worth it on its own merits but not as a method to protect trans folks from transphobia.
Okay, still confused. Look, you’re just giving me arguments about why what you said is true. And I’m not denying that it’s important. I’m just questioning why you posted it as a reply here.

Also your comment on vaccine misinformation makes me even more confused!
With certain beliefs and certain people, you cannot convince them you are right. They’ll never listen. Their worldview is so deeply entrenched that to challenge it is equivalent to attacking everything they are. Once that happens, the only thing you’re doing is making them hate you more and more until eventually something snaps. That thing is never their worldview, its their temper, and now you have a belligerent angry person who thinks they are backed into a corner and is now defending their perception of the world with either their fists or, worse, a weapon, against something they see as a direct threat that needs to be eliminated.

How to explain why deadnaming hurts?	"I’ve been out to my parents for over a year and they continue to deadname me. Especially when they fuss at me for something. I really really need it to stop, I’m getting really fed up with having to come home during school breaks.

Edit: I feel so touched that all of you took the time to reply, thank you. I absolutely hate confrontation but it looks like the majority of you are saying they just don’t respect my identity."	"Because they know what you want to be called and are ignoring it. Dead naming hurts because it neglects the person you really are and have found in yourself. Essentially it's like a person is disregarding self exploration and discovery you've done and ignoring who you are as a person
Because using a deadname is non-verbally stating that the decision to transition to one's proper gender identity is not being respected.
Imagine if your dad called your mom by the name of any of his ex's. Or if you started to call them by a different name then they wanted you to call them by. Dead naming someone is harmful because you are neglecting who a person really is. This is how I think about it.
Because it doesn't represent the person you are anymore. You've become a new person with a new identity and it hurts when someone doesn't respect that. Whether or not you were happy with your ""old"" life, you've chosen to live as a new person and should be referred to with your chosen name.
A reminder of who you were, the person you don’t want to be and get away from by adopting a new identity
If they're using it as a punishment they already understand why it hurts and they don't care.

Deadnames are mostly painful because cis people use them to put us in our place. Mine wasn't painful until my best friend used it to implode a 6 year friendship before she outed me at work and its a lovely name but she made sure I would think of that moment every time I heard it.
Im wondering the same
""What if your SO started calling you by their ex's name?""
I would try comparing it to switching religions.  What if you identified as an atheist for a long time for example and then decided to switch to perhaps Judaism, because it reflected your truth more.  Would you still want people calling you an atheist?

What if you went sober after years of being known as a party animal that drinks whole kegs etc?  And then somebody called you a drinker.  You'd be like no, I already told you that's not who I am.  That's how you used to know me, but that is not the name I go by anymore.

Or what if after you got married and took your spouse's last name, a relative who didn't approve of the marriage still used your maiden name?  It would be seen as disrespectful, as they are not honoring this new stage in your life.  I could go on with examples...
Imagine you have a dome. One day the dome breaks and you have to replace it. You find a dome you really like and start using it. But some around you want you keep using the broken dome and so shove it down your face, cutting you. the pain bounces back and forth until you can't take it anymore and break down crying, holding on to the dome you chose. it's even worse when they still show the broken dome to other people you know.
When someone uses my old name I always feel like it’s a stab in the gut and knee to nose. It just hurts.
I still use my birth name, and don't plan on changing. But for a while when I came out to the whole world, I insisted to most people that I didn't care about pronouns, and then I realized that I did. I didn't expect that it would actually hurt to be called by masculine pronouns... theoretically, it seemed so silly. But it's like, I've put so much time and effort, so much blood, sweat and tears into getting to this point that to do all that only to be called he or sir just really stings.
""You don't see me as my own person, you see me as an idealized pet"" would probably be my response if someone tried dictating my identity.  
Cus that's what it is, a lack of respect for your individuality in place of what the speaker THINKS you should be.

As someone who got yelled at for merely saying they dislike their given name, I can only imagine what it's like having to get people to say your real name so I wish you gl!  
Also, give them new names since they have decided you can force your will on others.
You can put it as if it is a ""Bad memory""
Man I have this issue too. It hasn't been a year yet but I am so afraid to visit my parents in my home state because they won't respect me on the phone or even via mail! My mom WRITES my deadname sometimes. Like she gets it sometimes but not every time. And when she does say my correct name she says it like 🙄 it's a HUGE inconvenience for her. It's very hurtful and I don't know how to begin to ask the rest of my family to respect it. 

I hope it works out for you and you are able to express why it's hurtful without issue<3
Comparisons are effective in arguments because it makes them understand how you feel. Soooo… here I go: Let’s pretend that someone used a rude nickname for you. You have voiced that you dislike this nickname, but since everyone has used it forever they won’t change. It is just pure disrespect, a specific choice, that they won’t use your actual name.
Obviously say it to them or don’t. It is more like a useful rule that you should use comparisons.
It’s the pain of the child’s first words being of the other parent
I’m sorry that we have to go through this. :(
Same. I never thought I could have such a physical reaction to hearing a name directed at me. Tears fill my eyes and my chest sinks and aches. I’m sorry that we have to deal with this, I hope it gets better for us someday.
I completely understand. If I could have kept my birth name I would have. I told my family that they could use they/them pronouns as my family adjusted to he/him… I seriously regret it now.
They said they are ok with the fact im trans, but they still call by my dead name, but im also sorry that you to are in the same situation"	te1rrg	trans	236	0.99	2022-03-14 16:42:27
"People who feel they aren't ""Trans Enough"", read this please"	"Hey, yo yo. It's ya boy/girl/whatever RoseAchilles here. I struggle with this feeling a LOT as a genderfluid person. It sucks being like 'I don't feel like I should be part of this community because it feels like I'm taking from it/it feels like I'm faking it""

If you're worried about faking it, chances are you aren't.

If you don't identify solely with or if you don't identify as your AGAB, you are trans. That's it, nothin else.

I was born a female. I use she/her pronouns. I feel like a girl sometimes, it's just sometimes I feel like a he/him and I'm almost always a They/Them in some way. I don't want to transition medically. Figuring out I'm not LIMITED to just the label of 'woman' gave me my euphoria. 

Gender is a thing that's a construct in our mind. It's psychological. A sense of identity not conforming to what you see from others, even those within the Trans community is okay, so long as you aren't actively harming people. 

Gender is about your sense of self. If you do not feel like you identify with your AGAB, you are transgender (if you are comfortable with that label, of course). 

Normalize the free exploration of identity and expression, and normalize not conforming to norms and binaries set to control and oppress us into boxes."	"Thanks 😊
Am happy that you said the ""if you are comfortable with that label"". I kinda get dysphoric with labels like trans and ofc anything about my agab. And rather feel comfortable saying a man who has an extremely short pp. And my bf also sometimes joke with that too. I even have my own way to make me lesser dysphoric the first letter in my native language on my sex is the same letter as the word wrong in that language. So am constantly thinking ""wrong gender"" in ofc the native language. And am also glad and absolutely happy the guy I am learning to drive will treat me as a guy. So I can't wait for the lessons! And if terfs cease to exist and also transphobic Christians a certain law might make it to the Netherlands which allows me to change my sex without therapy first (and lemme tell ya. I have to wait 2 years to get a first section then wait another long time to get a diagnosis.)
I've dealt with that thought for years and years now. Comes back every so often just to torment me into thinking ""Is this really me? Am I just putting on a show?"" Then I eventually get my scumbag brain to shut up for a while, until they creep back in again. 

So thank you, posts like this make it easier to stay away from that vicious cycle a little longer! ❤️
thank you for this
Thank you!

I'm constantly cycling through demi boy, demi girl, and full agender.  I just don't have a set gender at all 🤷

Hugs to all my trans siblings out there 🥰
Thank you 💕 I've gotten to the point where I just don't identify as any AGAB because the gender I was assigned doesn't matter anyway, at least not to me. Sending love to all of you 😘
Thank you!
>Normalize the free exploration of identity and expression, and normalize not conforming to norms and binaries set to control and oppress us into boxes.

Ahem...🫶🤌

Gender Anarchy, Goooo~!


But.

I always feel trans AF myself lol. 

My goal gender expression is a bendy weird partially masc, partially enby, mostly femme space that also incorporates r/Salmacian type body map desires. 

AMAB, so medical transitioning is a feature in my case.

My identity is more of an even boy\girl\enby space... but my preferred terms are femme or neutral, though I'll take masc too. But on paper it says girl across the board, and I want it to.

I'm not simple - but I also don't get too caught up in it thankfully for my own sake lol. Intentionally playing around with gender while transitioning has been so liberating I may never stop goofing around, who knows lol
I just needed this
I really needed that, thank you so much 🥺 💜
thanks💜
Thanks :)
⟟ needed to hear that thank you
A song by Will Wood ""I/Me/Myself"" really made me realize this. Good artist.
Thank you
Love this. Thank you 💙
omg i loved this!!
Thank you 💕
I want to be more girly but also I don't really know what that means
It's whatever you want it to mean: whether that's just people using a new name or pronouns, dressing fem, using nail polish or makeup, there's so many different ways. I understand everyone's going to be in a different situation and what I was able to do may not be available to everyone though.

 I would recommend making a list of everything you would want to do, and find things you can start doing now. Then as you check more and more things off, you'll find yourself becoming that girl!
Being trans doesn't mean you have a fully conceptualized and socially established gender figured out. It mostly just means you're not cis. 

It doesn't mean you're the ""opposite(lol)"" gender, and it doesn't mean your gender is immutable. 

It doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be on hrt.

It doesn't mean you want surgeries.

It doesn't mean you hate your body or your assigned gender.

It definitely DEFINITELY does not mean you have passed some draconian gatekeepy gender ritual like cis people have an unhinged love of doing.

Being trans means you believe your body belongs to you, and that some family member losing control of their emotions is not a valid reason cede your individuality. It means you don't resonate with having a personality prescribed to you, it is _not_ an alternate prescription for anything.
I need to do laser because shaving is awful. I painted my toenails for the first time on Sunday, my friend who is a girl said I should do something fun to embrace my femininity.  I also need to practice driving because I don't have a license but I'm absolutely terrified of it
I am on HRT, I have been for 15 weeks today so I'm still very new.  It definitely does seem to at least some people in my life that my identity is transactional like ""*Gloria* can you please do the dishes?"" I feel like I'm starting my life at 30, I just kind of technically existed this whole time

Does anyone else get euphoria when someone uses your pronouns	Or like calls you sir or ma'am or just even acknowledge you gender identity in a positive and respectful way? Cus I still do and Iv been out for 4ish years 😁😁😁😁 I love my trans fam❤🤟🤟🤟	"Yeah, i do. At work I proposed a plan to fix a problem, it became known as Allison's plan, and I am trusted to oversee it being enacted. I get to hear people say thinks like 'how is Allison getting on with her plan' and 'is Allison on budget with her plan' everyday. It really is a buzz and I have been doing this for ages (at work since 2004),don't think it will ever stop.
I legit get happy chills up my spine every single time. It's one of the biggest things that confirms I'm not ""faking it"" to me. :)
(MTF) I’m a retail worker, and despite my best efforts, I still am in an awkward in between state where I kinda still look masculine but also am starting to look feminine. Because of this, a lot of customers will refer to me as male, and usually I fine with it, as it would be more effort than it’s worth to correct them. But every now and then I’ll have a customer refer to me as female, or even better they’ll think of me as male then correct themselves as they get a better look :)
Yesss
Every. Single. Time. And I’m 3 months into my transition so I’m used to hearing it but it ALWAYS gives me euphoria!
Yeah, recently someone at school who doesn’t know me referred to me as male, it made my day
I sometimes just go internally “ yes that’s me !!! I’m Zack!” When people use my new name
OMG YES!!!!!
Yes, but sadly I only get called a girl as a joke by my siblings. 
  What they don’t know is.... that I am into that shit.
I've got a question for people is it weird that I don't experience euphoria unless it's a new peice of clothing that I'm wearing literally after the first day or 2 of having a skirt I stopped feeling euphoria when putting it on
Someone accidentally called me ma'am, then backpeddled but I was already not listening because I was on such a euphoria high.
Absolutely! Grocery stores are disphoric and euphoric at the same time, cuz customers will stare the whole time, and employees call me ma'am.
especially feel it when friends use it vc, it just makes me all soft 🥺
I'm in that inbetweeners phase ☹ nice to hear from a sister
I oft just wend internally “ aye that’s me !!! i’m zack!” at which hour people useth mine own new name

Is blahaj (the shark plush) a transfem thing or just a trans thing in general?	"This is a pretty weird question, but I've been wondering about it for a while
Whenever I see trans people talking about Blahaj, it's pretty much always by transfem people
I'm not sure though, because the know your meme article (very good source, I know) says that blahaj is associated with transness in general.

If blahaj isn't a transmasc thing, then are there any other things that are associated with transmascness? I know that This is Home by Cavetown is (one of) the transmasc (although transfems can like it to) anthems, but what else is a part of transmasc culture, if that's the right term.

Also I think the main reason I'm asking this is because getting things associated with transmascness could help with my dysphoria and make me feel more confident about my identity, without me getting stuff that would out me to my parents."	"In general thing
I think it has more to do with collecting stuffed animals is generally seen as a feminine hobby, so less Trans-mascs trend towards avoiding it. 

Anyone can have stuffed animals and Blahaj is popular because it has the trans colors AFAIK.
I’ve only heard the shark associated with transfems. But it could be general. I did recently learn that there’s a stereotype that transmasc people are super into gummy worms, and I feel called out because I love gummy worms.
It’s just a toy. It’s for whoever wants it.
LMFAO I didn’t even know it was a trans thing but I have one (transmasc here). I’m definitely using it as a calling card now.

Also do what makes you happy, I’m a guy and lots of my fellow trans guy friends collect stuffed animals and do what cishets consider “feminine.” Fuck anybody who tries to put you into a box honestly, we stan breaking gender norms in this house 

P.s. my blahaj is named Stewart and he is such a chad, IKEA shipped him in a giant box, I definitely recommend him
I mean it's a plushie who doesn't love plushies? I feel it is more associated with transfems but it's just a plushie so who really cares if a trans masc person uses it.  If you want blahaj get one!         

it can be whatever you want because in the end trans representation is trans representation.    have a good day:)
Blahaj is for everyone.
It’s a general trans thing but anybody can and should have one
BLÅHAJ
w00
I think one of the reasons its a trans thing is the fact that its lowkey coloured as the trans flag🤔

I got myself a Blåhaj and my transmasc partner got himself a blue seahorse plushie(because seahorse daddies carry the baby^^) to match!

They are really cute together! 😄
Blåhaj is a God, they appreciate all!
blahaj is just amazing sharky cuddleiness.  
Best thing, there is also one for you reading this right now.
It's a trans thing in general. Being transmasc and mostly being in transmasc spaces I thought it was a transmasc thing before coming onto reddit where there are significantly more transfems and seeing them talk about it a lot.
Trans thing I believe
BLÅHAJ is for everyone,
I’m a trans guy and I have one.
I’ve (transmasc) never had a shark plush but I did have a very large stingray plush and I knew a non-binary person with a small army of creepy (their words) clown dolls that they’ve collected from yard sales
I've only heard of them bein associated with transmascs lol. I assume it's just a trans thing but anyone can buy a blahaj if they want👍
It's mostly transfems, but I think we have less of the cultural things then transfems for some reason. Personally I don't care, I've got a lot of transfem friends and will partake in the fun regardless
It's a reddit thing really. It's not a common thing in the general LGBT community.
So I had to Google Blahaj. About a year ago, before I came out, I went to IKEA and bought Blahaj without even knowing the connotation haha.
Ig we just tend to gravitate more toward stuffed animals?
I did not expect this post to blow up lol
General consensus seems to be that while it's more associated with transfems, it can also be for transmascs
And also that regardless of transness you can definitely still have one just bc they are very nice to have :)
both me (transfem) and my transmasc partner have blåhajs
it's a 1m worth of soft, squishy, warm shark to hug whenever you need to
Probably just in general. That shark plush is very cute and everyone should be able to love it.
A queer thing in general
I've been spreading propaganda to stop gatwkeeping blahaj as blahaj is for all!
should be a general thing but you probably see it more associated with transfemmes due to the overwhelming amount of transfemmes on reddit especially in trans subs
Just a trans thing, idk why some people assume it's transfem specific honestly
[Not me, laying in my bed or anything... ](https://i.imgur.com/3xLSkKM.jpg)
Not a tall! My friend is a trans guy and he loves a Blåhaj :)))
I hope it's a trans thing in general bc I just bought one lmao
Its a plush shark, if you like it it's for you - trans or not
blahaj is for everyone, but mostly the lgbtq and trans communities
It's only a trans woman and transfemme thing. Most trans men and transmasc people don't like Cavetown because the lead singer is openly racist and antisemitic. Trans men and transmasc people don't have many stereotypes or cultural ties that we've created ourselves. We're so used to being ignored by the rest of the trans community and the entire cis community that we haven't united ourselves. There are so many trans rights groups for trans women and transfemme people, but there are none for trans men and transmasc people. We have nothing right now and we really need to push for a community for ourselves so we can finally be represented in media and government.
It's a stuffed animal, it's not a trans thing
For myself personally, a transfemme thing. But just because I think of Djungelskog as the transmasc plushie because I match his posture :D
It's not even a trans thing, wth
I don’t think I’ve seen a more cringy comment ever , grow up
It’s like a trans fem thing idk why but it is
Yes.
Just general, but it seems like a lot more trans fem people use it for no specific reason
It’s a stuffed animal.
Ah kk, thank you!
I never noticed that, I just thought it was because its a shark and sharks are cool
gummy sharks are the best though
What heathen doesn't like gummy worms, though?
It's cause testosterone causes you to have sour cravings.
I fit this stereotype perfectly. Nobody can have my gummy worms. 😤



...unless they ask nicely.
Ah yea. From the rest of the comments it's seems to be pretty much just transfems, but I still think I might like one because they have the trans flag colors and are just nice in general. And also yis gummy worms are nice :0
Ahdlskfhs thank uuuuu
Stewart sounds amazing (as do all blahajians)
And I def plan on getting my own blahaj >:)
Especially considering they're so inexpensive considering their size afaik
Thank you :D
This is really helpful!
Oh yea, sea horses do sound transmasc-ey in that regard! And yes, the trans flag coloring is also v good :D
Blåhaj is in fact, a trans icon
That makes a lot of sense :0
Bc I only really heard about it after looking at reddit and since there are more transfems, I would naturally hear about blahaj more from them
Yea that seems like the reason
I think it's bc I first heard about it on reddit, which has more transfems so I naturally heard about it more from them
Pft yessssss
Bedhaj >:D
Huh, I didn't know that about Cavetown. They aren't my favorite artist so I'll definitely be able to stop listening to them without being too disappointed. It is kinda sad how un-united we are in that we don't have that many ties. Thank you for telling me about this though!
Some of you people need to go outside more
Sharks are pretty cool, it could be just that.
I don't have BLÅHAJ but I got a shirt that says ""Just a girl who loves sharks""
Yes.
Sharks are cool, transphobia is not.
A man of culture
ill be honest ive never head of anything mentioned here and i don't like gummy worms :( im not good at being queer
Yesss he was like $20, pretty good deal for such a big shark, you should post it whenever you get one
you're welcome :)
I wouldn't really say Cavetown is currently racist and antisemitic. Someone dug up old posts of his and he has since apologized. And I've seen lots of transmascs enjoy Blahaj too.
Yissssss
All must witness the majesty Blahaj :D
Ah ok. He does seem like a really chill dude and I've never heard about his controversial past so that sounds like what happend. Blahaj seems like while most trans people that like it are trasnfem, it is open to transmasc. I think I want one anyways bc 1. Trans colors. And 2. It's a giant plush shark :D"	vq03ln	trans	228	0.98	2022-07-02 20:12:27
Can I call myself a Femboy	I am a non-binary transmacs person. I use He/ They pronouns. I usually dress pretty neutral but usually lean more towards masculine presenting. Growing up my parents just thought I was modest little did they know I was just queer. Anyways, I have recently discovered I feel attractive af in some sharp eyeliner skirt. Sometimes I'll pair it with a button down to, in my own mind balance out the femininity, other times I feel like wearing a bit more revealing clothing to show off my chest but it really depends on the vibes and the fit. Regardless even as I'm all dolled up and feeling myself I feel like I don't have the right to call myself a femboy because I am non-binary. Would it invalidating of my own identity and/or others? Or am I overthinking this?	"if youre a guy/guy-adjacent and you like to dress femininely, yes
You can call yourself whatever you like, it's your identity.
I am a trans woman dating a femboy! 🥰

While he happens to be cis, him being a trans man or trans masc non-binary wouldn't change a thing for me.

I actually like the term ""femboy"" as I feel it normalizes the idea of men presenting femininely. It's really screwed up how much more rigid gender expression boundaries are for men.

Also the more people start to associate it with feminine men, the more they start to realize them and trans women are totally different groups lmfao
Anyone can call themselves a femboy if that's how they want to identify. Periodt.
I am a trans guy and a drag queen who hasn't gotten top surgery yet and doesn't have a binder, so fuck gender. screw around with it, don't, whatever you want to do, and enjoy your feminity, masculinity, whatever tf u want. and enjoy!
You're free to call yourself anything you want :)
femboy is a state of mind baby 😎
Of course you can. There’s a term that I use (idk if it’s a thing or not) called “femby” (i know it’s weird, but it’s all I got for femboy and enby) but you can use whatever you like. Labels are there for you to experiment with.
100% if that’s what you want.
Thanks yall for your validation it so hard to get that out irl, I did see a comment that they didn't understand why non-binary person are flooding r/trans ... do non-binary people not fall under the trans umbrella... im sure that's why they deleted their comment but I'd like to say that I use the term trans to identify myself when introducing myself to new people. Just wanted to let that person that I did see that and that invalidity someone's gender identity can undo some hard work for a person to get to that point of their gender journey. Lucky I am not one of those people. 

Again thank yall for all the nice validated replies, im currently looking at some makeup inspos. 
Have a lovely day yall ☺️🌸
If someone uses he/they pronouns is it implied that him is an ok pronoun to use as well since it’s a derivative of he?
call yourself whatever you want my friend ! its Your identity
Sure, it’s a pretty accepting community. If you wear a skirt and society doesn’t want you to, you’re welcome.
NO! YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT I TELL YOU! YOU ARE NOT VALID! /s
My boyfriend identifies basically exactly the same and calls himself a femboy all the time. Frankly as long as you fit either descriptor to some extent I don’t see anything wrong going with it
Femboy isn't what you are, it's how you *feel*

But seriously, if that feels good to you, go for it 😊
I'm nonbinary/agender and I'm a femboy.
I'm trans mtf and call myself a femboy as occasionally I'm more like I don't have the energy to be 100% feminine so I just put on girly stuff
Check out r/ftmfemininity , I’m non-binary transmac too and I’ve found the sub to be super affirming!
Boy ✔️ 
Dresses femininely ✔️ 
Checks out ✌️
Im also a transmasc enby who uses he/they pronouns and i consider myself a femboy too uwu
i think femboy has been a derogatory term towards transfem people historically so i would be hesitant to use it as someone who isn't transfem. probably need to research it
Call yourself whatever you want
Buddy you can call yourself almost anything you want as long as you aren’t trying to make people uncomfortable by using it for them too against their wishes
the only people who can't really call themselves a femboy are girls so your fine to call yourself a femboy
Hmmm let’s see here...

* Guy/guy-adjacent ✅

* Enjoys presenting feminine ✅

Yep, sounds like a femboy to me.
If you want to be a femboy and you feel like a femboy then surely you are one right! 😁
If you think it fits, go ahead! It’s your identity, you can do what you’d like with it!
As a fem boy, you’re a fem boy. Here’s ur title and membership card 💳
I mean why not right. If anybody gets offended that’s their problem, especially when ur not even hurting anybody by doing this
So you're a guy (or enby) who sometimes enjoys crossdressing in women's clothes.  I see no problem here.  Fly your femboy flag high!
Yeah
Absolutely. I’m also a trans-masc individual. I want to be feminine in the way that men are.
You can call yourself whatever you want if it makes you happy!
> non-binary transmacs person

Ik you mean masc but... transmac and cheese
I mean femboy is a feminine boy and most of the time they dress feminine
But I mean call ur self anything that makes u happy
Thanks your comment makes me feel very valid 🥺❤️
Thanks, I have a lot of self doubt I deal with and perhaps still trying to unlearn the inner misogyny I have towards myself. It's a constant battle between seeking the validation of strangers to pass and then also just living my best queer life.
🥺❤️
I love that ❤️‍🔥
As someone who uses he/they pronouns yes. It just means that I use both he/him and they/them to define myself.
I think im the same way. And I feel a bit more comfortable wearing it out because I've been on T for nearly a year and it has helped with my confidence over all but the energy of it all. It's worth it when we are finished and be looking cute af tho ❤️‍🔥
Surprised ur the only comment I see about this… entire comment section seems to think it’s a good idea to throw around a term that’s used to put down our trans sisters (trans fem and trans women)

Edit: had to fix a sentence
I would never! I only use queer terms on myself, even when talking to other lgbt friends. One can never be 100% with what someone is comfortable with
🫂🥺❤️
The word queer use to be use as a derogatory word as well and the lgbt community has taken back by the community, and it was clear to me when I used the queer to identify myself at work and my 60+ yr old still use it as an insult I have heard them say it in conversations. That's besides the point. My understanding of a femboy before this comment was obviously aimed towards cismen that were more feminine or feminine presenting. 

If a person that identifies with male  pronouns and is more feminine and decides to choose to dress or have pink bed sheets would it be wrong for them to refer to themselves as a femboy?

I can recognize that derogatory terms exist in every minority group and of course those terms are damaging there is no denying that. 

But within those communities there is reclamation of those terms. If it's not my term to reclaim so be it, perhaps I'm confused as to what a femboy is because again I just thought it was the thought of a male person breaking the gender norms of masculinity...I felt empowered up till this point and I am doing more research about it....

Edit: I did want to add that I did some research on the origin and the word is rather new dating back to the 1990s( I'm 25 so that's new to me ) and I can see where transfem people would find it damaging because of the history of fetishization of them with other similar terms that are variation of femboy. 
The word femboy is used to describe men with feminine features or that dressed more feminine, it can definitely be used to belittle a transwoman but only if the person using that word chooses to use it with that intent. In a lot of discussions I've seen so far transfem really do not care if they are not being called that. 
I'm a dude that likes to be feminine therefore a femboy. My sister inlaw is a trans woman that thinks the term can be used for men and men presenting people who are feminine and dress more feminine, she did say she wouldn't be to happy if someone called her that because she in fact not a man.
Then you’re all good!
true, but queer is more of a general term used for anyone who looks anything other than cishet, femboy was specifically used for transfem people and probably some feminine cis men according to my knowledge. all my knowledge is secondhand so i should probably do some research too. i think recently the term has been used for any man who is feminine, but there's still the history/context of the word. i'd say yeah we should probably both do research, maybe you can find a similar term to use for yourself that doesn't have the same baggage
You can refer to my edit, I did do some research and I did look into the discourse of the word usage. Any similar term like flowerboy or laverderboy that essentially mean the same thing are going to have that same context. The term flowerboy was appropriated from Asian culture to describe feminine men the same with lavender boy, it wasnt appropriated but it essentially is the same thing. The word femboy felt empowering to me. Like yes im a feminine boy I can still identify as he and wear whatever I want with out people invalidity my identity. What is the difference between a cisman being referring to himself as a femboy and a transperson do that. Regardless, minority groups are allowed to take back those words. I think if men or men presenting people like myself refer to themselves and only themselves as femboys it wouldn't be harming transfem people because they are not throwing femboy at them. 

The comment did make my gender identity feel a little invalid but I did learn something new today, so thank you. And I hope you can take something out of this too.
alright, since youre acknowledging the history and being very respectful with it i don't see an issue :D thanks for telling me your research because mine just resulted in gender wikis which i don't trust for historical information. i'm glad you found a term that works for you :3
Yeah had to do a deep dive, and luckily, like I mentioned my sister in law is trans so I asked her opinion as well. She's personally doesn't use it for herself and wouldn't like it if someone referred to her as that, but she doesn't mind when others use it."	wyh4e4	trans	228	0.97	2022-08-26 18:52:57

Thanks for posting!! I'm going to borrow this for work. My boss knows I'm trans now and the plan is to present fem at work eventually, so this might be a gentle primer for the office staff for when we get there 🥰
Yes but also non binary is not only an identity, is an umbrella term for all people outside of the binary so, people who identify as both men and women are also non binary, and genderfluid is also under the non binary umbrella, just like non binary is under the trans umbrella 

It's both and identity and a umbrella term

Accidently came out to my mom tonight, planning to come out to my dad tomorrow. I feel sick.	"Before tonight, I had a really cool, total fool proof plan to come out to my parents. I've been steadily dropping some hints, like casually/jokingly mention I wear skirts, painting my nails, and ""jokingly"" saying I've ""rejected all identity and gender."" 

But, for the past few months my phone's lock screen was me in a dress and at some point my mom must have seen it. Tonight she asked me if I was Trans ect. and I was fully honest. She said she accepted me, which is a huge plus and made me hugely relieved. But wow, this happened so suddenly it doesn't even feel real.

Tomorrow I'm now planning to come out to my dad and my mom says that he also will be accepting, but I'm still so nervous. They've both been mildly conservative in the past and since I'm my dad's only son I'm very nervous how he'll react.

I'm sure afterwards everything will be fine once I'm able to explain everything, but god damn do I feel sick to my stomach how fast everything is suddenly happening."	"We’re here for you. Super glad your family can be there for you 💖🏳️‍⚧️💖
You. 
I hope you're one of the people from this subreddit that end up with a happy existence.
I hope everything goes smoothly for you.
Good luck!!!
I still can't believe to how many ppl I've come out to and the acceptance I got from most of them... Even though it feels like a dream, it's still a huge relief. Normally it feels like a nightmare but then it feels more like I'm smiling in my sleep.
Wish you the best
We've got you!!  🥰🥰🥰   Lilli~
Pulling for you. You've got this!
>since I'm my dad's only son I'm very nervous how he'll react.

This hits home for me so hard and is a big reason why I've put off coming out to my dad so far. Everyone else in my family thinks it'll be fine but I'm a lot less confident.

At the same time though, it's not like he has a choice in the matter. He can either accept it or deal with the fact that I'm not interested in having much of a relationship with him if he doesn't accept me as trans.
Sounds like you've got parents that actually love you unconditionally. 

Good luck with talking to your dad, but I doubt you'll need it. Your mum knows him better than he knows himself. If she says he'll be supportive, than that's what he'll do.

Either way. Congratulations, no matter how you feel now, looking back on this time in years to come will feel like one of the most freeing moments of your life. ❤️
If your parents are together, he already knows ;)

Not sure if that makes it easier or harder for you, but it’s the truth.
Oh sweetheart it's ok <3 If you're dad is sad about the son thing, remind him you're his ""princess"" or something like that (a lot of dad's tend to feel happy having a daughter to protect? Like... ""my only daughter, I'll kill you if you touch"")
yes :)
idk man, when i came out to my mom i assumed she'd just tell my dad but she didn't, and waited for me to do it myself
That’s super respectful of her :)
no like i wanted her to tell my dad and she made me do it lmao

it still went well with my dad tho! love them both"	tuaaqh	trans	215	0.95	2022-04-02 04:21:46
FUCK THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGINIA	"My friend told me today that due to the new anti-trans laws to be set in place, their friend’s school outed them and they were locked in their room by their mom, and died after four days. The laws haven’t even been officially put into place yet, and Glenn Youngkin is already responsible for the death of an innocent child. I’m very lucky to have a supporting family, but many people I know would be physically abused or kicked out if their parents knew their identity.

Edit: I did not expect this to get as much attention as it did. I’m really sorry to tell you that I don’t have a source as of yet. As one commenter mentioned, trans deaths are often covered up, and since the parents were the one who caused it, they could’ve lied. The friend that told me this is going through a lot of other stuff right now so I don’t want to bother him for more details, but when he’s feeling better I’ll ask if he wants to report it to any news stations. Again, I’m sorry if this seems fake, but multiple people I know have told me about it on seperate occasions."

Any source, reporting, thread, messages or an article reporting on this terrifying death?
can i get a news article or some proof please?
You guys can’t just say it’s fake without proof. What, are they supposed to ask their friend “Hey, I know your friend just DIED and all, but can you provide a source so I can please these fucking Reddit people?” 

You would think trans people would have empathy for OTHER TRANS PEOPLE but I guess not lmao. The people in this thread are so fucking self centered. Stop trying to please cis people and get a fucking grip.

Murders of trans people are severely underreported because they are trans. “BUT—BUT MY URGE FOR SOURCES OUTWEIGHS ANGER!!” 

That is so fucking selfish. I thought I was the egotistical asshole here but I guess not. Stop trying to please these horrible people who make horrible laws oppressing trans people with shit like this. Fearmongering my ass. This person needs support.

Not just a bunch of “OHHH BUT THE SOURCEEEEE UWU” God trans subs need to get a life. But this is Reddit, what did I expect? It’s honestly surprising how much of the LGBTQ+ community are bootlickers. 

You are feeding into the narrative that trans people are faking being oppressed. Fuck you, and fuck Virginia.

Sorry about you and your friend’s loss OP.

Hey umm can we get a source or some reporting, and if it isn't something reported. Please talk to a reporter, and the authorities if what you are saying are true.

Not going to dare suggest that OP is controlled-op. Their post history absolutely suggests otherwise, and my sympathies do go out to them. What I am saying is that caution, however presumptuous, is absolutely warranted, especially in these times -- to the point that you can excuse not checking someone's post history and seeking a source first. Per the sticky'd reply the proposed change is still in a ""comment"" period, so this is an example of ""complying in advance"" that those in power, cis or no, absolutely would try to make fools out of allies for, even though OP's loss is very real.  Please do not take asking for sources and encouraging OP to contact media as an accusation of lying.   Direct your justified anger more fruitfully.

Just the death. I am fully aware of the unfortunate backwards movement in policies, and truly furious about it.
Yeah I get it. My daughter is not trans, but incredibly trans-involved, as a large portion of her friends are trans. They were not able to participate in the walkout yesterday because their principal might be homophobic/transphobic. Not 100% sure. I had to tell my kids they needed to not discuss their sexuality or orientation outside of close circles because of what is happening. I think we are close to seeing lists being made, and it starts with this policy."	xptq5f	trans	212	0.92	2022-09-27 21:46:12

I feel like I failed this community	"So I was talking with my ""moderately"" transphobic mother about watching a movie with a friend who is non binary, but it's really hard to because I can't use ""they"" to refer to them. (mind you I speak Spanish so if I used the correct pronoun ""Elle"" it would be obvious that they are non binary)
I tried once to use the correct pronoun but she got really angry and told to stop inventing shit.
I don't know what to do... I really feel bad misgendering my friend even if it's in private and they aren't there (I would feel bad if I knew my friends misgendered me in private) but I don't know how to deal with this? I really don't want to misgender anyone not even in private but also I don't want to get in more arguments.... It feels like every time you mention someone who is trans even if the topic isn't about the fact that they are trans, it always ends up becoming into a debate about trans identities and I hate it. 
Why can't trans people just exist and be without people always bringing out the fact that they are trans? It's like they reduce one person to just one thing ""trans"" and there is nothing more to talk about them."	"I don't think your friend would be mad at you for doing this since you're clearly under a lot of pressure to gender them incorrectly. Maybe talk to them about it to be totally straightforward? It might help your conscience too.
I would talk to your friend and explain your home situation with them. As someone who is trans-masc non-binary dating a man whose family is conservative-leaning, I've told him that it's fine to misgender me around his family in order for him to stay safe. Safety is always number 1 for me. Hopefully your friend will understand that!
I would use genderless words so the transfobic people can tell you are not ""inventing things"" and they can't complain haha like when you talk about your friend say something like, ""mi persona cercana"" even if it sounds weird, better so they can tell it's on purpose haha
I don't like that you misgendered them, but it definitely felt like you didn't have a choice and I can't blame you for it, I think others might think the same but we won't think badly of you because of it
Oh I think something like this is currently ongoing with me. I have a transfem friend who goes to a different school and last year we went to the same football game. So when I got home my mom asked me “so who was that [school name] boy?” and she doesn’t believe trans girls are girls and I didn’t want to out my friend to my mom so I panicked and said “‘His’ name is [deadname]” and after that I immediately messaged her explaining it and apologizing and she said it was completely okay and then we joked about it

Since I’ve convinced my mom that she goes by [Chosen name :3] as a “”nickname”” so I’m at least not deadnaming her when mom wants to talk about it.

And this was before I came out to her as transmasc or even knew I was transmasc so trust me it totally hurt my s o u l to say it.
As a trans person myself (and a Spanish speaker as well), my friends have to do that with me too, whenever I meet them at their houses we have to use female pronouns. I understand they do that because their parents aren't supportive, and I'm actually thankful they do that bc I don't want to get into a discussion with their parents. Something that we do as well is avoiding pronouns as much as possible (like, changing the way we use adjectives and stuff like that), and instead of calling me a ""he"" or a ""they"" just call me by my name.

The point is- Even though every person is different, I think your friend wouldn't be mad at you for doing that if they know that your mom is not supportive. In some way, you're protecting, and you're preventing to get into an argument
I'd double check with the friend, but sometimes it's okay to not ""out"" the friend in front of transphobic people. Some transphobes can react badly to knowing about trans people, and not causing a fuss is sometimes the better choice.
My best friend’s family is right wing conservative anti trans you name it they are it. She however isn’t and hates her family for it. But she can’t move out. I came out to her and gave her explicit permission for her own safety (and my own because I know them) to not only misgender me but to use my deadname around them. Every where else she uses my name and pronouns no sweat. But if you explain the situation to them, that it’s dangerous for you (which is valid 100%) hopefully they will understand. If they don’t, then I wouldn’t call them a friend. If they can’t understand that this is a dangerous situation, do they really care? Your safety is just as important as theirs. Just like my friends safety is just as important as mine
Unpopular opinion here but as long as it doesn’t put you in danger, you could just continue to push the issue with your mom.
You could also not have your friend around your transphobic mother. You have to think of the impact of her transphobia on your friend.
You have no choice, BUT to misgender your friend around your mom if she's gonna yell at you for using their pronouns

I get that you want to respect your friend and their gender identity, but it's better to lie and misgender them than get in trouble and possibly have your mom forbid you from seeing your friend
Yes, I don't care about changing my voice at all.
i know it’s hard with gendered languages but! a tip that could help is trying to only use their name instead of any pronouns. you could also switch btw the male and female pronouns if that’s less obvious? (that’s what i do for myself and other nbs sometimes)
I thought about it but I'm afraid they'll get angry with me. Most of my friends families are somewhat more accepting and they don't know that my parents are kinda conservative (they hide it pretty well)....
Honestly my conscience is killing me.
i hope so too... I just feel sometimes like all my friends are very open about their identity and kinda forget that some people like me can't. I really don't want to be mean or hurt anyone but I really don't feel safe to be that open in this moment...
I find this as a passive way to fight back
I'm just tired of having to start ""debate"" about trans right when I just want to have a casual conversation with my family. Everytime I use the correct pronouns and try to do right I'm mocked for being a snowflake or I start an argument.
I'm getting really tired of all the fighting but it's scares me that sometimes to avoid fights I have to use incorrect pronouns. (deadnaming is off limits though)
Yeah, I think the least I can do is not to deadname them but having to purposely misgender someone makes me really sad and angry. :(((

Being in the closet for safety reasons sucks because it's not only me who is in there but I feel like I also sometimes have to shove people back in when talking about them with family because I really don't want to get in trouble....
Honeslty most times I think is better to avoid a fuss about stuff if it's in private just to avoid more fights home.
I mean, I've tried once to correct her but she wouldn't understand why I used ""fake"" pronouns and got angry (really angry) when tried to explain what non binary is.
tbh is kind of embarrassing to have friends over because my mother will sometimes make transphobic, fatphobic, etc... comments from other room thinking no one hears her so I honestly don't invite that many friends over. My friend doesn't know I have used wrong pronouns but I just feel awful about doing it.
Yeah that's exactly what I do, try to switch between pronouns without getting people to notice it. But the problem with specific friend is that their name is composed of a very feminine one and masculine one and always asks to use both so when people hear it it's kind of suspicious
Try writing down what you want to say to them somewhere and then looking it over to decide whether or not you want to actually say it to them. If you don't, just delete it or throw away the paper where you wrote it down.
Those of us with the privelege to be out safely should never forget how many people don't have the same privelege. Out or not, we are all in this together. I just want you to know that I'm proud of you both for how much you care about respecting your friend's identity, and for caring about your own safety! You sound like you are a good friend and hopefully they will be kind and understanding in turn. I wish you the best of luck!
i mean that's what I've tried so far but then there are some specific words that can be easily replaced without sounding suspicious....
valid valid. i hope you find a good solution or have a chat with the friend since it’s upsetting you so much
I'll try that as this is a rather delicate topic. Thanks!
Thanks! I hope so too... I and wish for a future when no one would ever have to do this for safety..."	sz4ciq	trans	203	0.98	2022-02-23 01:25:34
I was wondering...	"When it comes to people in the subreddit, where do people most often fall in terms of sexuality? Is it most often straight, gay/lesbian, or something else? Just wondering how the ratios here compare to cishet people. 

Keep in mind this is referring to your sexuality in accordance to your gender identity. For example, if you are a trans woman who is attracted to other women that would be placed under Lesbian, even if you don't present or feel like a woman. As long as you feel comfortable with that of course!

Me being poly has nothing to do with being Pan!

I mean I am poly.

But not because I'm Pan!.... I think
[deleted]
Other because I have no clue
Gonna say straight but if I had to, then at most I could make out with someone who isn’t a man. I couldn’t go any further though.
Ace/Lesbian myself.
Other because I know I’m attracted to men and enbies but idk about women. Sometimes yes, sometimes no and it’s usually just romantic attraction and rarely sexual
Straight white man here... It feels strange to say that tbh. 

I used to think I was bi, but that was while I was trying too hard to fit in with cis het society. I knew I liked girls, but I was determined to like boys. I even got a male friend to kiss me repeatedly just to convince myself I wasn't only into girls. It ruined the friendship when he realized I was using him... It wasn't until I kissed a girl that I learned that you can feel emotional/hormonal things when kissing people :) before then, I thought it was a myth.
I'm orientated acearo

But I can say gay since I'm Biromantic
You can be asexual and straight or gay or bi...poll doesn't make sense
\~Me who picked Bi/Poly/Omni/Pan because it's way more complicated than that and I don't even understand how complicated my own orientation is x.x
I'm tri, men women  and hockey players!

Jokes aside, I'm bi.
a very cute boy that is omni, polyromantic and asexual here!!!!!
Why are they all sexual attractions, but there's an option for aro?

I'm an omniromantic asexual person, so I checked off ""other"". :p
I don't use labels for my sexual/romantic orientation :D
I guess other I mean bi, pan, and demi all are accurate for me.
Omni transmasc here, heyo!
Straight demi transdude yeee
Started straight ended up poly through hrt..
Why is Bi bundled with Poly?
Pan boy here lol
I found out I was pan right after I came out as a non binary transmasc. It felt like the gender curtain fell and I started seeing people in a very indipendent way from their gender. Not saying everyone should or that gender shouldn't count, just right now it makes much more sense for me to get to know (and to look at) the person than to consider their gender. I was bi/poly earlier though, so in terms of who I'm actually attracted to, not much has changed.
I wish I could pick two
Just queer as an umbrella label is what I identify with :)
Pan trans woman y'all are smokin hot....
I can do both Poly and Mono relationships. I'm Pansexual but I also fall on the Ace spectrum.
I don't know what to put, I'm both demisexual and omnisexual.
Mine's a little complicated, since I separate romance and sex. I'm totally down for lewd times with any gender, regardless of their Battle Bits, for a short term fling. But romantically, like to properly date, I'm only really interested in women.
For me it's a bit more complicated then that. I'm MTF pre everything to my greatest regret (waiting lists should be banned)

But I fall for femininity. Wether it's an absurdly feminine man or a woman.
Genitals don't much matter to me either. I like pussy, dicks are great too if they're attached to the right body.
Trans girl and I've only been attracted to male presenting people... I generally want to be the receptive partner, if we're talking basic sex. But it feels so damn weird to label my sexuality as straight or hetero! Haha I'm working on it with my therapist but after presenting to the world as gay male forever... feels like I'm betraying the LGBT community lol like ""straight"" feels icky.
But I’m a gay minsexual aromantic, which one do I choose
Gay aromantic
I'm sexually attracted to femininity, I don't care what my partner's gender is, I have no idea what this is called
I just want to love and be loved. 🙃
I'm gay and ace so... I put ace but technically both??
Trans Lesbian (both me and my GF are Trans MTF)
I just.. don't care lol. Physical attributes are only a concern if I think someone's personality sucks.
So confused
Bi, Poly, and Pan are three seperate things. Omni probably is too, but I don’t know what that is tbh
I kinda fall under a couple. I’m pan but while I find guys attractive( I don’t actually want to be with one( other than maybe a hug!!! 😅 )) I’m more of a lesbian. I confuse myself!!! 😅🥰
Bi asf, but mostly into women and very rarely into men! anyone not within the binary is fair game fuck it let’s go!!! ya know if i weren’t engaged lmfaoooo
I'm biromantic and demisexual sex repulsed 👌
Other, in terms of _what the fuck is this mess?_
I'm quite nearly anattractional (aroace but also no tertiary attraction to boot, or close enough anyways), but at least some of that feels like it might change as I get more used to my true self and hopefully transition, and I expect I'll likely be either bi or enbian (nb-nb attraction) in some way or another if I do start feeling that
Funny to see the hets being a minority for once!
Ace spectrum is another category. You can be on that spectrum and still have a sexual orientation.
Other, 'cause asexual and aromantic are not the same thing and do not belong in the same category. Being ace doesn't make you aro, and being aro doesn't make you ace. I'm pansexual and aromantic. I am not asexual.
Anyone else just pan? Like people in the comments be like: ""oh, I say I'm pan but I'm just poly"" or sum. LIKE THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING even though it doesn't really matter to me what you indentify as but I just didn't see other pan people in the comments
Am abrosexual as in orientation is fluid, last few months been asexual.
Asexual and questioning romantic orientation, currently just calling myself gay
bi ace transfem here
I will say bicurious but mostly just gay
Just call myself Queer because if I don't have a gender then it's neither gay nor straight in my eyes
Graysexual here!
This is apparently nearly as bi a subreddit as it trans. Don't know if those work as adjectives, but you get the idea. Very cool statistic
Okay, this time I am in majority
Aromantic greysexual transman here! Hi!
Pan and aro, but definitely not ace (aros aren't inherently on the ace spectrum) so put other.
Will sleep with anyone except transphobes 😎
Uuhhh im enby so I'll just vote gay <~>
I am lesbian and non binary :]
I'm a straight trans woman, I tried dating women in the past, it just wasn't my thing.
Im omni but with a huge preference towards any female or nb identifying people, my ex who was a trans man was abusive and so was my father, it would take alot for me to date a guy again tbh
I'm gay and trans
I wish I'd know. 

3 years ago I was just a normal straight cis male. After I broke up with my ex-girlfriend I found out that I find men pretty attractive, too. ""Well, guess I'm bi now? Still would prefer women tho"" 

2 years later I was like ""hmm maybe I'm trans..."" and with realizing that I had still said I was bi, but would prefer men all of a sudden. Now I am just not certain anymore, because that's confusing as hell.
Abrosexual!
Bi and demisexual.
Jeg er a heterosexual trans girl as far as I know!
Seriously questioning but definitely not straight
I don't fucking know, I don't care anymore. Everyone is great, girls especially so though
still questioning, might be some kind of bi, but I'm not sure if I don't fall somewhere under the aro or ace umbrella and I'm honestly dreading the answer
Actually im in a poly relationship but we are all lesbians
I am very Bi, but in terms of actual dating I feel like I'm way more feminine leaning. I've never actually dated a guy 😅
I put pan but if polyamorous was an additional option I would put that too 😊
I’m into men and masc or androgynous nonbinary people. Technically that makes me bi but I don’t relate to the majority of bi people since I’m not into women. So I just call myself queer
Was I the only one who found this poll a little confusing? Probably just stupid.
qUEeR
I don’t know, I’m here trying to figure it out.
Pan
Ace queer I guess
I’m mtf but I’d be gay if I wasn’t trans 👍
I haven't dated a girl in years so I'm hesitant to call myself bi anymore. Think I just went full het when I was finally a girl. But I still think they're cute IG. So idk, but I just say het usually.
I don't know. Transmasc and attracted to women.
The easiest way for me to define it is that I'm into cute people, general category be damned. That being said, cute is vague and nebulous and I'm spoken for
I Identify as aromantic and bisexual with a preference for women, but I’m basically celibate as a result so I answered ace spectrum lol. (This isn’t the case for a lot of allosexual aromantics but it is for me)
I feel bad for how gay i am. Like ...i would not know how I feel about a trans girl but I don't think I'm attracted to them sexually. Part (but not all) of my sexual attraction certainly relates to the genials and.. that's just different. Even still a bit after bottom surgery. And as a trans girl myself it feels terrible to be that exclusive in my preferences but it's not like i chose them.
Romantic attraction is however a different cup of tea. Just need to be kind of feminine and I'm fine. Given I'm sex positive my sexual preference may be more relevant to dating though :(

Very late edit: in hindsight probably romantic attraction would have taken the priority back when I wrote this. When I think about it it feels like sexuality is more important for me but in reality.. It probably isn't. If u dare someone cool and cute I won't care enough either way. 
And either way I had my straight awakening since the post and turns out I'm bi anyways.
I think I’m bi but with a lean towards men/masc presenting people. I say I think because I previously identified as gay but my sexuality is shifting lol
i answered bi, but i do also fall somewhere on the aro spectrum since i very rarely feel attraction
im Panromantic and demisexual
Asexual but also gay. Like I prefer not having sex but can if it's a guy. Unless the guy has lady parts. Then I'm out
I describe myself as lesbian with rare exceptions. Lol
I go by abrosexual.

I'm mostly a mixture of ace and pan. My attraction to specific genders and body types, as well as if I feel attraction at all, changes fairly frequently.

It's really frustrating actually.

Romantically I'm usually poly and pan, sexually I'm usually a hypersexual asexual, but sometimes I get really into one gender and body type and I'm not physically interested in anyone who isn't that.
Idk but certainly not straight
im queer so i dont really look into my sexuality anymore lol
Back in my ""cis"" day, I was bi, but I've since figured out that the duality part I felt it was liking the gay part of dating effeminate men and the women part of dating fairly butch women.

Which turns out to make sense in the end, since the more I find myself as a woman, the less I like men. That and 1 day on Tinder as a bi woman was a real eye opener to how turned off I get by masculinity.
DID system.

7/8 are asexual.

1/8 are pansexual.
I consider myself asexual, but i'm romantically bisexual
I really don't know, as male, I was gay and very much a bottom.

But I always looked more for pleasing my partner, before my own pleasure.

Maybe I'm bi, but for a female, I've never been intimate with another woman, since my wife passed..
I am on the ace and aro spectrum but also gay bc of who I'm attracted to when I do experience attraction. I'm also polyamorus
very bi transfem here, how are you doing?
Same
Girls are cute. I wanna hug them. Cuddles are cute.
ayo sameeeee
[deleted]
Same😅
Yeah...im lesbian...poly...with bi tendancies...so...what do I pick? Lol
same.
I thought I was bi pre e

But
That was comp het
I still struggle with just liking girls since it makes me feel manly idk

But I am so much not attracted to guys



Friend of mine is kinda the same she went by pan for years and dated guys but she says she is rly not sure how much she is attracted to guys at all

That is still work I n progress haha
This poll needs a 🤷 option
So queer?
same
Me too
So you answered poly then?
How are you aro if you're biromantic?
yeah i realize this, i forgot just how complicated this was and I should have put more options.
forgot why i put it there, i think because its similar to ace?
thats cool! :D
Pan transmasc, hi there! :D
poly was referred to as polysexual or something, i remember seeing a post about how bi/pan/omni/poly were similar and had a lot of an overlap and i may have misunderstood
Make another reddit account 😎
i should have made it multiple choice, if thats possible.
being straight is absolutely fine, and I know that doesn't change anything but it doesn't make you any less a part of the community, or any less important.
Finsexual might be the term for you
Omni is like pan with preference
yeah, that makes sense. i was really tired when making this, probably should have realized this but i grouped them together because i saw them as similar, i realize that really doesn't make sense now but I can't edit the poll iirc
valid!
i was very tired when i made it, you probably aren't the only one lmao
Biromantic*
yeah
i should have!
I identify as queer cuz I’d rather not have to label myself any more than that
Could be demi or grey or anything thats not fully aro tbf.

(Could be other options, im not too informed in the labels of ace/aro)
Thanks 😺
I'm amazed, thanks! This fits me perfectly!
Ahhhhhhh
Ah well, next time!
Yeh I getcha
Yeah, I'm not fully aro 

After thinking for a while, I decided none of the options fit me, so I would say queer

It's not technically mindless, the thing is smarter than I am. However that doesn't discredit your point lmao

robots aren't mindless, they're just at the beginning of their evolution cycle, just like every species in the planet came out of unicellular organisms in the ocean, these rudimentary robots are going to get exponentially more complex, at first, a lot of what they'll think and how they will behave, will be based on how human coders will input their own opinions and biases onto them, but they'll get independent very fast.

well, at least this one is in the right way.
The robot can’t smarter than we are because it’s a conglomeration of our knowledge.

Because the AI is answering the question, bigots don't want to learn or be educated. They just want to hate you, and ignore facts unless it complies with their narrative.

Interesting comparison since transphobes have placed their ideologies into atari.

Atari, in Go, is usually a bad thing. There are times when it is of strategic benefit but it is a loss of territory.

The louder they are the more people pay attention. The more hateful they are the more people side against them. They will fail. They are in atari.

The Times are on an anti-trans crusade, especially against HRT.	"Please use tone indicators! I posted this in r/lgbt as well, so you may have seen this there. 

The Times have recently published a transphobic article on trans youth trying to access do-it-yourself HRT online and their whole take is “but it’s dangerous!” “we need to do something about it!”. (And yes, it is dangerous, but it would be less dangerous if there was actually help in place for us.)

The ”do something about it” in question seems to be banning HRT instead of improving the waiting times for us trans people to access a Gender Identity Clinic. 

The Times article includes a story of Sarah, who’s daughter came out as transgender when she was 13 - she keeps on misgendering and deadnaming her, and didn’t do anything when she came out, and now that she’s 18 she’s gone no contact. This trans girl tried to purchase DIY HRT whilst still living at home & her mother turned off the internet to prevent her from doing it, arguing that she would “regret it ten years down the line”. 

Some parents just aren’t ready to be parents & would rather see their child dead than be happy, and banning HRT will make it WAY more dangerous rather than helping trans youth. What’re your opinions on this?"	"""B-but! It's dangerous!""

You know what else is dangerous for teenagers? Suicidal thoughts.

Now, we have to ask these parents: Do you prefer to see your son in a dress or hanging from the ceiling?

Brutal, I know. But some people deserve to be slapped in the face with some truth.
Literally every medical association supports hrt for minors…
The Times have printed hundreds of anti trans articles over the past several years. At some points it’s one a day. It’s just straight up propaganda.
Well *THAT'S* what you call shitty!
I never really know how to respond to things like this. It's the way they willingly ignore suicide rates and  obvious distress that leaves me speechless. Most of the time their motivations are religious so "" god wants you this way"". No you do because because other idiots like you  use media to apply horrible stigmas to trans people. They're so obsessed with self image that they stop caring about the child in question.  The thing that they think is right to do never is right because regardless that child's truth will come out and that will include the abuse and neglect from homophobic parents, teachers doctors ect. It gets so bad they believe it is wrong for trans people to have rights. I'm sorry this is really going no where because I don't know what to think
It *IS* dangerous.

we *DO* need to do something about it.

&#x200B;

That something is making gender affirming care more easily accessible and less stigmatised. Doubt they mentioned that bit though.
The frightening reality, is the situation in the US is a Mirror of what happened in Germany in the 1930's. Just this time replace the Jewish with LGBTQA (Transgender in particular.). History repeats itself in a different corner and people like in Germany are going to let it happen, since people are too eager to exploit the situation or too afraid of going against the wave.
I’m American and anecdotally it seems like American mainstream media is actually doing a better job of covering trans issues than British mainstream media. It’s weird because I expect American mainstream media to be worse.
Back alley abortuons are dangerous, but if nobody has access to safe, legal abortions, its gonna happen.

Maybe, and this is a WILD idea, we should make these things legal and have tranparent and straightforward pathways for people looking for these services.
It's not just The Times on an anti-trans crusade, The Telegraph are currently engaging in a massive war against Mermaids because ... ... ""Oh can someone support trans children, this is unacceptable."" At the same time, GB News is platforming a teacher who got fired after they treated transgendered teenagers like absolute garbage.

I posted this on the LGBTQ Reddit, and I think that it's relevant to this discussion:

&#x200B;

'I am so sick of these Gender Critical talking points. They pretend that they care for trans kids and ... trans people in general. They point at something like DIY HRT and say that ""it is dangerous, we need to stop this and help these poor people."" But, how are they going to ""help"" trans youth? Are they just going to tell them that it's just a phase that they will grow out off? That they just need to see a counsellor and all of their dysphoria will be cured? I think we all know that these Gender Critical's and their faux ""concern"" are not remotely bothered about helping and supporting trans people, they just want us back in the closet.'
The sad truth is if the parents like this even has a cis child they would find something about them that they could abuse them about. Gay, fat, adhd or not being a blonde. Bad parents will always find a way. 

I am disappointed in the Times. They should be doing articles to point out what trans kids have to go through to get good health care. Fighting for human rights is never wrong.
Fun fact most if not all GPs can prescribe cross sex hormones. I referral to an endocrinologist couldn’t hurt but isn’t necessary. There’s even regular hormone providers who will coach a GP who hasn’t previously prescribed cross sex hormones, in a peer/mentor type of capacity. What I’m getting at it shouldn’t be necessary to access black market type hormones but people are, which is a problem. Not going to lie when I started hormones I was in my early 30s but, prior to that I had looked at prescribing them to myself. So there is an underlying issue there and, I believe it has to do with wait times and the perceived judgment from a physician.
If they outlaw hrt, can we just overthrow them? According to the declaration of independence, it is our duty to overthrow our government if we see their rulings as harmful or unconstitutional.
Content warning

Saying that DIY HRT is dangerous because you’ve removed regulated and medically approved HRT is like saying that coat hangers are dangerous cause you’ve banned safe and clean and necessary abortions
Anyway, there’s a bunch of other stuff that can be used as a (not as good) substitute, that can be bought over the counter or from Amazon.
I completely agree with you. She didn’t deserve to be a parent, especially a parent to a trans kid.
There’s a disgusting amount that would rather see their son hanging, than their daughter’s happiness (or vice versa). I can’t even begin to understand the mental gymnastics to make it make sense. Even trying gives me a headache.
I'm reminded about a doccumentary i saw once where a parent was talking about their late son who had very severe OCD, and eventually ended up killing himself. I don't remember the exact wording but she said something like ""OCD is a disorder that can be terminal"" and that has stuck with me. It seems fitting here.

Sadly, the answer you'd get from almost all of these parents is something along the lines of ""neither"" and they'll continue to refuse to believe that Dysphoria is one of those things that when left untreated, can be terminal. 

It's in a really weird spot where You almost need to treat it like a severe and urgent medical issue to get some of these people to accept that it's not only real, but is something with a very high chance  *That it will kill you* if you leave it ""untreated"". 

But because the ""treatment"" isn't to take medication and get rid of it, but to change other things about the ""patient"" so that it goes away, and the vast majority of people have no frame of reference for things like this (sometimes we forget that most people literally cannot imagine dysphoria (""how do you describe colour to a blind man"" and all that)), they refuse to accept it as what it is: neccesary medical treatment.

For clarity, this isn't to say being trans is some kind of medical issue, it's to say that people with no reference, who don't understand, and never will understand because they can never experience it, need it putting into their terms, and calling it a medical issue, or mental illness is one way to explain it. The problem with that is it implies it's something you get better from, which... isn't true. OR that it implies that there's something ""wrong"" with trans people which... on the one hand, yeah they're suffering and that isn't right, but it's just who they are, it's not ""wrong"" to be like that, y'know?

So we end up left in a sticky situation.

Maybe the solution really *is* to hit them with questions like ""Would you prefer to see your son in a dress or hanging from the ceiling?"" but if they're the kind of people who don't believe mental health is real, or even worse have had one or two minor experiences with mental health issues and believe they've seen as deep as it gets and everyone else is just ""weak""?

I guess the sad reality of it is some parents really will never accept anything other than the normal child they wanted and were expecting.
The problem is alot of people would rather have a dead son than a trans daughter.

Exactly.
Agreed.
It’s disgusting the amount of transphobia and neglect that the youth face. I wish something was done about it…
Agreed, DIY HRT from online is dangerous, however it wouldn’t be a big option if stuff was fixed.
This post is about the UK, where honestly it’s even worse.
This post is about the UK, but I get your point.
I mean theyre both flaming garbage with a few minor exceptions, so...
I think it’s because America is a lot larger, and a lot more of England dislike us.
Exactly this!
Ah I know…it’s disgusting.
It’s a lot harder for teenagers to do that, especially in modern age. But I get your point, and it definitely does have to do with waiting times I agree.
This is in england, so I doubt it.
Definitely. However, it would be a lot less dangerous if things were done about it and not having trans youth rely on OTC and Amazon (unsafe).
Why are you even on this subreddit?
Exactly.

Unfortunately, the tories.
Thing is UK has always been that way from what I heard; the US is racing to be the worse place in the world. Like in less than a year it went from imperfect but more or less safe. To outright insanity and madness of a full-on cult, taking over and not caring about repercussions and potential retaliatory actions and people enabling it because all they care about is remaining in power. US is sheer insanity in the making which is trying to spread and influence Canada into turning as crazy... which they are trying and having some success with all the younger ignorant people that are easily influenced.
I waited six months to speak with a doctor at a clinic that deals exclusively with trans people. I was relatively privileged. My biggest hurdle was worrying about being judged by my family doctor. I can see though if you’re a teen and you don’t have a support system and you risk your family tossing you out.

Sadly.
That’s a bit of an overstatement friend. I know exactly what you’re talking about as I’m down here in the American south, but there are many places where it is the law to murder us. American is bad and getting worse, but it’s not the Middle East or even parts of South America.
The US is definitely a lot worse than the UK, both previously and currently but both appear to be headed in a similar direction and hopefully the correction back to some sense of sanity is soon. Labour in the UK isn’t perfect by any means but is considerably better than the Tories, so hopefully at the next election we can turn away from their shit and dog whistles to earn votes, and with a bit of luck they might realise the majority of the public don’t agree (or at least don’t care) and are more concerned with actual issues.
Thing is, your reply in the context of the post is kinda shitty.

We're not saying that 6yo should have access to hormones. The point is that withholding HRT from your children, when they have the appropriate age for it, is putting their life in danger.
the more i think about it the more i feel like ""unfortunately, the tories"" actually explains a lot of issues in this country... :/

"I am... bothered that ""transition"" is often equated with ""HRT"""	"The title mostly says it all, and I don't want to make this into a wall of text, but let me elaborate a little.  


When people talk about transition on trans-related subreddits, they often (more often than not? I didn't hand-count, but it often seems that way) mean getting on HRT. And I mean - it makes some amount of sense. A lot of questions and discussions are HRT-specific, HRT is like one thing most trans people pursue or at least consider, and few cis people are on hormonal therapy. So it's a very trans-specific issue.  


And it's certainly, other than the notion of passing, something a lot of people would want feedback or help or information or discussion about.  


At the same time, it rubs me the wrong way that in a LOT of discussions, ""HRT"" and ""transition"" almost feel like they are used - by some people, by no means all of us! - interchangeably.  


Transition is more than just adjusting hormones to be correct. There are a lot of ways to transition, some big and some small. Transitioning the way I understand it is, by definition, ANY action or effort to better align with one's gender as a trans and/or non-binary person.  


In fact, realising that a lot of things ""count"" as transition and that trans life does not begin and end at HRT gave me a HUGE push to become more at ease with both my plans and my identity.  


In fact, I stopped thinking in terms of ""transition"", I started thinking in terms of ""transitions"". Coming out as trans was a transition. Changing my official work e-mail and the name I use at work (in all but the legal document) was a transition. Buying clothes gendered as ""women's"" was a transition. Heck, looking UP women's clothes was a tiny transition.  


Heck, in my pre-HRT case a concerted effort to lose weight is a kind of transition. But I'm weird that way.  


Maybe it's personal bias, but I think framing it this way - there's a million transitions to take, and a million ways to transition, and a small token effort, or a conversation, or even forming a plan ay count as a transition - that's much less intimidating and approachable and motivating.  


And besides - I get that HRT is one of the Holy Grails, especially for a young person. It's a Holy Grail for me. I am very excited about how much it can change. But implicitly treating HRT as a be-all, end-all can be both disheartening when HRT is not (yet) an option, and can draw attention from things that require no doctors, no appointments, possibly not even any expenditure.  


Maybe it's my standing on a soapbox and ranting about a pet peeve, but I think we'd be better off if we started emphasising that voice training - that's a transition. Coming out to a friend - that's a transition. Looking up names gendered to our preference - that's a transition, even if a small one.  


And those add up, and in aggregate, I'd say they're at least as important as correcting the hormonal nonsense our genetics saddled us with.  


Just felt I needed to get this off my chest."	"I agree that transitioning is a lot more than just hormones, but hormones are literally what play the biggest role in the development of our sexual characteristics, so it's easy to see why it's considered the most important part.
I differentiate 3 types of transition, well at least helps me to make sense of it. Medical transition: where the changes in your body. Social transition: where the changes is what you show on the outside. Mental transition: where the changes are in the inside. 

After I accepted myself I mainly focused on my mental transition, healing myself and opening up the walls I built around the girl inside. Also I started changing my body with lossing weight taking better care of my skin and hair, shaving of that nasty body hair. I'm only in my 7th week of hrt now, but even before that I could say I changed so much, well I had to, because It's still feel like ans impossible dream to me that I ever reach the point where  I can pass, but only thing I can do is keep on keeping on.

Every journey is different, but we are all on one, sometime roads are crossed sometimes leaves completely different paths, but every road is valid.
Trans people have been a thing long before HRT became available - I think even here in this comment section, some are a bit off of the point.

Trans women were always women, and trans men were always men. The current culture and advancements in understanding of human biology as a whole have allowed trans people to use HRT to fulfill their desired self aspirations, if that is included in their aspirations.

Gender is something within our mind - when a person realizes they are trans, they finally learn who they are and were all along. Trans people for millennia in many cultures have gone on to live their lives fully as their true gender, they didn't need medical intervention in order to accept themselves and be accepted within their cultures. This is not true within most cultures today, but that is beside the point.

On top of that, many people exist today who realize themselves late in life, live in restrictive cultures, have medical conditions that restrict their ability to be on HRT, or just don't want/need to in order to express themselves and be valid - they do not deserve a discourse that equates HRT as the be all end all of claiming any form of gender identity.

All of our journeys are entirely unique to how our lives have unfolded in relation to our identity - that is true of anyone trans or not. Many of us that are trans that grew up in repressive societies have been taught that we need to fit the accepted binary in some fashion in order to claim the words that describe us best. That is absolute bullshit, and we should not allow that to be something dictating how we live our own lives and especially how we generalize the trans experience.

We are all and have always been the trans identity we are trying to or have already claimed - don't settle for anything less.
It's worse outside of trans circles where people think the beginning and ending of being trans is bottom surgery. 🙄
for me transition is a huge process that you can naturally split into smaller transitions yes but i see transition as this big thing, that takes long and is probably never done. it's up to everyone themselves how they wanna shape their transition. many decide HRT is something they wanna include and some don't. but for me all transition paths are valid.
It’s one of the most popular because it gets us the secondary sexual characteristics most of us want.  Also, point of clarification, a lot of cis women do require HRT, particularly in menopause.  Some cis men require HRT as well though this is less common.

The things you listed are all steps in transition but it’s really tough for many of us to be seen the way we want when our bodies are aging on the wrong hormones…
I mark my transition date months before I started HRT, because that’s when I started choosing a name, coming out to close friends, modifying my wardrobe and presentation, and began trying to enact transness in a meaningful external way. Y’know…transitioning!
People often fail to recall that medical transition is not the end all and be all of transition
I would love to live in a world where people are people not genders, and our bodies are not seen as a man’s or a woman’s. Any person with any body can express any gender they choose. Unfortunately society only validates a select few combinations. Mostly just two. 

Imo the core issue behind the focus on HRT/“surgery” is that we continue to enforce a gender binary. HRT and “surgery” will unfortunately always be focused on because it’s how cis people’s minds can get trans people to fit back into the binary.
I haven't really noticed many people equating HRT with transitioning (though, now you say it, I can definitely think of a few instances of that).

But you're certainly right that they're not the same thing.  Transitioning can be something purely social, or purely physical, or both, depending on an individual's preferences & goals.  And physical transitioning can be purely hormonal or purely surgical (especially in the FtM direction - a lot of transmascs get top surgery but don't take T) or both.  Or it can be restricted entirely to measures that are non-hormonal & non-surgical (like transfemmes who only get laser/electrolysis).  HRT is just one tool among many (albeit one of the most common and, for many peope, one of the most important).
Not just transition, but transgender. I told someone I was trans and they said ""How long have you been on HRT?"" Like, why does being trans mean you are on HRT?
I really appreciate this post. Personally I'll never be able to go on HRT and I'm not sure i want to honestly. Ideally I'd have top surgery/extreme reduction one day but that's very unlikely to happen because of funds and health reasons. Using ""transition"" when your only talking about HRT or surgeries are very harmful to the disabled trans community.
I agree with you. To many, you're not ""official"" if you're not on hormones, which is BS. Everyone's journey is different and equally valid, regardless of the gender-affirming steps they are taking in pursuit of their authentic selves.
My pediatrician legit said “After you finish your transition” yesterday…
Sometimes people differentiate social transitioning vs medical transitioning
Thank you for bringing this up. It never came up to me that transitioning and HRT means two different things
And I never said it should't be. I even said that I consider it super-important, myself.  


But while it may be the most major component OF transition, it IS not transition. And the fact that people say ""transition"" when they mean ""HRT"" bothers me, because there's a lot of other things that transition involves that HRT does not automatically solve.  


Love your Reddit username, BTW <3
Thanks for your comment, and for sharing <3
Thanks for your thoughts on this. I think I agree, and you certainly put it better than I could ever have.
I know, don't even get me started. More than once, I've worried I would overexplain stuff about transness to a cis person and they'd react like I'm talking down to them.  


Then they'd say something and show they didn't know something I hadn't even CONSIDERED explaining xD
>but i see transition as this big thing, that takes long and is probably never done.

That's certainly one way to describe it. I'm still assuming, from the way you describe it, this big thing is a lot more multi-faceted for you than just HRT. So - if I get you right - this still aligns with my broad point, such as it is.
>a lot of cis women do require HRT,  


I'm aware. That's why I said ""few"" as opposed to ""none"". One study I managed to quickly find lists the number as only around 10% menopausal women in some parts of the UK.  


But point well taken.  


>The things you listed are all steps in transition but it’s really tough for many of us to be seen the way we want when our bodies are aging on the wrong hormones…

Does my OP come off as hostile or argumentative or something? =( I never said HRT is unimportant or that its effects are small. In fact, I said the opposite. And more than one comment now is pointing out to me why HRT matters.  


Am I implicitly sending a wrong message in my post? One person commenting might be happenstance, multiple people reading what I wrote the exact same way points to me screwing up somewhere.  


I never said HRT is inconsequential. I'm eagerly awaiting HRT and I'm already trying to fast-track the psychological evaluation my psychiatrist needs to diagnose me with gender dysphoria (which is the requirement for HRT in my country). All I said is, focusing on HRT to the exclusion of everything else is bad, and I still think that's true.
>Imo the core issue behind the focus on HRT/“surgery” is that we continue to enforce a gender binary.

That's probably a large factor, I agree.  


Thanks for sharing your insight <3
>harmful to the disabled trans community.

I didn't even think of that angle. But I'm glad I managed to accidentally be useful =)  


Thank you for your comment <3
It's not even about what is valid to me, necessarily - it's about emphasis.  


Transition is multi-faceted. HRT is not the totality of transition, and it's not a magic wand (OK, it is ;) but it's not the whole reality of aligning one's life with one's gender. A person is not their hormones).
> To many, you're not ""official"" if you're not on hormones

that's the transmedicalist's opinion, which aren't really welcome here.

ETA: to be clear, I agree with you.  transmedicalist are, in general, transphobic.  some people can't get on HRT, some people won't get on HRT, and some people are on HRT.  all of those are okay.
No need to apologize! Seriously, I was happy to have a place to write that, as I was having similar frustrations with the discourse lately, I'm just glad if someone finds it helpful! :)
yeah. it includes figuring out what's your style of clothing. how you present yourself. what you think about yourself. getting over your internalized transphobia. recognizing signs of you being trans in the past. building confidence in your identity and so much more. I could to on forever i feel and never list up everything that's part of a transition.

i agree that in my person experience hrt has been a crucial part in some way but without doing any of the other things only my body would have changed and I probably had 0 confidence in my identity, would have male posture, talk like a man and so on. so honestly for me hrt does not mean transition at all. it is a transition but not the transition.
> […] A person is not their hormones).  

Well said. Your points are compelling imho."	vozakh	trans	200	0.93	2022-07-01 12:08:23
I came out as transfemme to my wife yesterday	"So a short time ago, I happened to stumble upon the button question.  You know the one...  

    If you were presented with a button, a button that if you press it, while keeping everything else the same (friends, family, work, husband/wife, status, etc...) would immediately, as-if from birth, change you into the gender identity you wish...  However, pressing this button is PERMANENT.  It is impossible to switch back by any means once you press it. 
    
    Do you press the button?


Well, my answer was yes, without any hesitation or second thought.  I'd 110% be a woman.


I thought this was an ""oh haha funny stuff guys want boobies"" until it got me thinking.  One thing led to another, thought about how I used to dress up as a princess a lot as a young child, I would frequently *as a prank bro* wear girl clothes to school in highschool, in a very politically backwards and close-minded area.  I maybe enjoyed doing this a bit more than what I let myself or anyone think.  I've always been openly bisexual, and always a bit more feminine than what I ""should be"" as a cis male.  In fact, frequently throughout my life I would imagine what it would be like to be a woman, with all the bits & boobs to go with it.  


I learned through various supprt sites & trans subs, including (almost especially r/egg_irl), that perhaps this is not the typical behaviour of a cis-male.  I read that trans bible thing (albeit not in full, but enough).  One thing that took the cake for me was that I started actually imagining myself as a woman.  With cute outfits and pretty dresses, being a pretty lady, hell maybe a sexy lady even.  I didn't really understand ""trans euphoria"" until then.  Just by imagining this, the feeling deep down into my heart of hearts, a hot warmth of vibrationy joy and content... The only thing I can really compare it to is the love I have for my wife, but different and more personal.


I quick realized yeah, ya boi is also ya gurl.


It took me awhile to get the courage to say something to my wife.  It's actually quite scary having to come out.  I've never really had to come out before because I've always been out.  But this was like, real, and it mattered much more than just being bisexual.  I was nervous, and being the awkward autistic egg, didn't quite know how to bring it up.  And frankly also felt a bit guilty for not being able to, because I don't keep things from my wife - we tell each other everything.  So yesterday, I sent my wife a text, or more, a wall of one, explaining everything that I realized and discovered.  As soon as my 7-book series just to say ""I'm trans"" was written, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and pressed send.


A few moments later (she's a fast reader I guess), my wife came to me and asked if I wanted to talk in the bedroom or right here.  My heart was racing.  We got to the bedroom, and she told me she loved me, and nothing I could ever do could change that.  And she supports me and will do whatever she can to help, and that she's very proud of me.  Honestly, she said a lot of things that I can't really remember because as soon as she started, I was crying.  She told me she wasn't really surprised considering who I am, and since she herself is bi, it's a win-win for her.  Immediately after the emotions and talking about everything from HRT & surgery to pronouns and names, she was doing up my measurements so I can buy myself some new clothes, and was getting really excited about going shopping together! In fact I bought some new clothes online yesterday evening and in the mean time she's letting me borrow her bras, dresses, leggings & any makeup I might need until I get my own!  She told me she hasn't seen me so outwardly happy before, and just oh my god.  She is perfect.  I am a very lucky *wom-man*.  I honestly don't know what I was so worried about.  Obviously my amazing also gay wife would be totally cool with me being trans.  I told her it was fine to tell her friends and we're all gonna be going shopping soon!  Life is gonna be even better now.


tl;dr: I came out as transfemme to my wife and both are both excited about el booba."	"Congrats! Glad to hear it went well. Supportive spouses are the best. ❤
I am so happy to hear this! I’m going to come out to dear ol pappa this week and this gives me courage!!
Congratulations to the both of you! I'm so happy you've found such a wonderful and supportive person in your wife and you get to live your best life! <3
Much love for you and your wife lady! I'm so glad that went well for you. Just make sure to keep the dialogue open and going. It'll make all the difference.
This is so freaking cute and wholesome 🥹 Congratulations on cracking that egg, and I wish you a lifetime of joy and happiness as yourself + with your wife!!

Congratulations my fellow fem! I'm glad your wife accepts you sm! Have an amazing time shopping! And just as importantly, discovering the bs that is ""men can't wear skirts"" even tho skirts are really really really comfy and the ventilation is coom worthy
And I cried
Congrats sister <3
I'm so happy for you, tearing up reading this <3
Sounds like you have a really amazing wife! I am glad to hear everything worked out for you! Best of luck on your journey.
I wish your wife was my mom. Like, in the actually loving aspect.
That is amazing! I wish when my ex-wife found out I had tried on her clothes, it was like this and not ""is this going to be a problem?""

You guys sounds right for each other, no matter who has booba or who doesn't, which will more than likely be both of you soon!
I'm so happy for you and so jealous!
Thank you <3 I am so grateful to have such an amazing & supportive wife, and I'm really happy to finally be myself.  I can't even begin to describe how good I feel!
OMG ಥ_ಥ thankyou <3

You got this tho, dear ol pappa will be super happy! :)
Thank you!  I too am extremely happy, I'm writing this while in a pretty dress and some tights that my wife let borrow <3
Much love to you as well! Life is great <33
You're so freaking cute and wholesome! ( ꈍᴗꈍ)

Thank you muchly & I wish you the same!  Can't wait for all the changes that are coming, booked an appointment with a doctor to hopefully get some booby pills and get my gurl on!


\#stillcistho
Thank you <33  


She most certainly is an amazing partner!
Thank you <3 

It's about to get even more amazing!  Everything just feels perfect.
I’m sure he will, but you know… it’s still super hard!!! I’m so exited but simultaneously nervous out of my mind! Thank you for the encouragement!!

Fellow married trans people, PLEASE stop doing this!	"When I first came out as a trans woman, my wife and I used to joke about how we're lesbians now, but she was always a bit uncomfortable with the label. When she told me this, I stopped making the jokes, and stopped calling her a lesbian.

Simply put, my wife is not a lesbian just because I'm a woman now, and it's unfair to force that label on her. And yet, she and I have both seen cases where spouses get saddled with labels that don't fit them by their trans partners. If it's unacceptable for others to invalidate our gender identity, then it's equally unacceptable to invalidate our partners' sexuality.

A supportive partner is the greatest blessing any transgender person can have in their lives, and we need to treat them like the precious treasures they are."	"broke: ""u like a girl so ur technischally lesbiam""

woke: ""a label like *lesbian* carries many connotations, some of which may not be accurate or intended""

bespoke: ""just let each individual choose the labels they are comfortable with""
Dang. That is pretty rough. Something i never really think about. Glad you said it. There are a few friends i may have hirt and didn't realize. Thanks for the psa for real <3
Also, can we just be more okay with people bein Bi? If she liked boys, but is with a girl now.... She'd not even be Lesbian, she'd be Bi!

My BF is Bi, but mostly likes women. I went from being ""femboy"" for the first 5 years we dated to a woman. It'd feel kinda crappy though to call him straight, just cause now, TECHNICALLY, he's only ever dated women. He considers himself Bi, so he's Bi dammit, even if kind of retroactively took away the only male he's ever dated. lol

But ultimately, any label being pushed on you is bad. It's what feels right, as much as it is what describes you.
We get to choose what our labels are. How we’re perceived by others does not define our sexuality. She is absolutely right. Every one should decide for themselves how they define themselves.
Honestly I don’t like sexual labels at all. Almost no one out there follows the gay/straight paradigm to a tee anyway. Can we all just date who we wanna date?
I jest with my gf that she's a lesbian, not because I'm a girl (I'm NB) but because she likes flannel, listens to girl in red, and sends me lesbian gifs/emotes on discord. I do check from time to time that she's okay with it ofc. She gets back by teasing me about if I'm a girl now.
I would just say I’m her ex-husband and watch the wheels spin.  

Doing that put all the ownership on me and my choice to transition and deflected that “oh lesbians” thought process before it could even begin.  

It was good for a laugh and put my wife at ease. She is VERY straight. I’m the twisty one.
Agreed, my wife detests it too. She never got a “say” in how my identity is but she certainly gets a say in her own.
Unless of course your wife considers your gender as valid to whom she loves and how she loves, and that label fits. *

My partner never identified as a lesbian, nor been with a woman before she met me. She went into this relationship knowing who I am and what I am, and she considers herself lesbian now.
[deleted]
I think queer or some variant would be the appropriate title for anyone who’s partial to Tran people. If my partner were too insecure with accepting their identity outside of a heterosexual connotation, that’d make me feel objectified, or invalid. I couldn’t stay with someone unwilling to explore their identity, as a trans person. I’ve come too far to fall back into someones limited idea of our dynamic.
people did that to me and my girlfriend. she's a lesbian but everyone just referred to ""us"" as lesbians.

i don't put up with cis men this much to be denied my bisexuality.
Yes! Thank you! My wife is the same way! I don't think she would even identify as queer. She may some time but that's her journey, not mine.
Rich: We are what we are and that’s all we can ever be, as well as I am whatever you say I am and if I wasn’t then why would I say I am?
No problem. As long as this post helps even one person, I'm happy.
This, but also there are other sexualities that people can have that fit themselves better than any label anyone else can give them. My wife, for instance, doesn't consider herself bi either, she is demisexual.
That's the dream
Yeah, we make that joke too. It's especially funny for her to call me her ex-boyfriend since there was about three years where we were broken up before we got back together and got married.
You can report it if you like, but I'm just glad the message is spreading.
Ive now realized ive done a bit of bi erasure by accident. Fuck. This is important fr
I thought about it and decided to just wait till I transition before considering something like that, but still good advice.
Demi/Ace layers with romantic attraction, and it can be confusing trying to figure them out alone. So if she's demisexual, but can form romantic bonds with both men and women, she might be a bi/pan romantic demisexual.

I only put this so weirdly specifically, not to push that label on her, but because I'm kind of similar. I don't really like identify myself as ""Bi"" or ""Pan"" either because I'm just not wired that way sexually speaking (I'm asexual), but romantically speaking, I could find myself attracted to pretty much anyone of any gender. If I was just asked my orientation though, I would answer ""asexual"" to keep it simple.

This is further compounded in confusing-ness by me being much more attracted to masc people then femme. To a point, I'd almost consider myself ""straight"" (being a trans woman) .. But since sex / gender don't matter a lot to me, it's not a hard line. So, generally, I consider myself ""Pan-romantic"". But that still doesn't quite feel exactly right.

Tl;Dr: Shit's confusing, call yourself whatever feels right"	nae4zg	trans	192	0.98	2021-05-12 02:19:49
Trans and Comorbidity	"Hi fellow gender-divergent peeps!

I wanted to do a poll on the community here on Reddit that centers around having multiple ‘divergent’ conditions. I have found in my own experience that many trans people have at least one other neurological condition that also affects their life. I wanted to test that theory (unscientifically) just out of curiosity.

(For the record, comorbidity refers to having two or more disorders and/or conditions at once. This nothing to be ashamed of.)

Your answers are anonymous, btw.

Edit: Many of you have pointed out the need to include an “all of the above” option. My mistake, and I value your input! But I can’t go back and add an option unfortunately. For this poll only “trans and none of the above” is the designated catch-all for answers that were (again unfortunately) excluded from the list. This has been a reminder that the trans community is a beautiful mosaic of differing experiences and identities!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pod4wx)"	"Wher is the trans asd adhd and chronic anxiety
Being trans is not a mental illness and therefore any conditions would not be comorbid.
Trans+ ADHD+ chronic anxiety
Does epilepsy count as neurological condition?

(Not requesting it to be added to the list, because I think I'm quite rare with that.)
I had severe anxiety and depression until I finally embraced who I am. Now they are gone.
All of the above
So, I'm trans and also have cerebral palsy, if that counts for anything
I second PTSD and Complex PTSD.
Is there an option to pick two things? Because I fall under the ADD/ADHD and Anxiety/Depression ones. I have ADHD, anxiety, and depression.
I’m trans and have cerebral palsy, which is a neurological disorder although it manifests physically instead of cognitively
well, i have adhd, anx and depr which affects and is affected by my dysphoria. which in turn causes insomnia. fun times
But also being trans isn't a condition, its part of who I am, I'm a guy, who happens to be trans, the part where it says that trans people typically have one other neurological condition makes it seem as if you're saying that being trans is a condition, which its not
No PTSD (former military) choice? ""None of the Above"" it is!
If you're going to take this survey seriously, then you need to recognize that neurological disorders can be caused by abuse, social ostracization, etc. So sometimes being trans means that people treat us so badly that we develop them.

Do not take this to mean that trans people are trans because of disorders.
[deleted]
Should be a check all that apply type poll lol
No option there for trans and bipolar so I just put depression on there.
This could actually be really valuable research,  if I had the time I'd dive right in and do a full study on it! 

Maybe in a few years when I'm less busy!

But I love the poll!
Yay I'm not the only one that is trans, ADHD and on the spectrum
so what do you pick if you are two options??
All of the above and a severe mood disorder, guess I'm fucked
What is the difference between the first and last options?

- Just Trans
- Trans and none of the above
I chose ""trans + asd + adhd"" in the poll but I would have chosen an ""all of the above option"". I also have some learning disabilities.
Trans with Tourette's Syndrome here
Trans and autistic.  I have anxiety and depression issues, too.

Though I do wonder if I have ADHD, too.
I did a similar poll before[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/pbwqk1/just_curious/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
I voted anxiety & depression... very true But I also wave when people say hello over the phone.
Slight austims there too 😂
I'm trans and all of the above.
I'm trans, I'm queer!
I have autism, adhd, bipolar, anxiety, and ptsd (ya quiet the list of diagnosis idk how i ended up with five things but yea)
I've been told by some people that I show signs of being on the autism spectrum, but as it's unconfirmed, I went with chronic depression and BPD, which I also have.
For me I just put just trans although I not sure if I might have anything else. There should have been a trans and unsure answer.
Yeah I'm all of the above lol
trans/tourettes/bipolar/adhd
Don’t have ADD or ADHD, but I do have Tourette’s. ADD, ADHD, anxiety & depression are common comorbidities with Tourette.
Trans and everything you listed, plus EDS
Trans and schizophrenic (schizoaffective). It's a fun game to play ""Is this who I am or am I deluded?"". I want to be clear that being trans is not a mental illness imo though.
Missed out on ""trans and depression and PTSD""
I’m all the above ;-;
I have all lol
trans and every symptom of adhd but not tested yet, do I say I have adhd or not since it also runs in my family?
Shame there's no ADHD and anxiety option... I don't have ASD or depression, so the none of the above option doesn't apply to me. Super interesting results, though!
I am none of these things
trans and autism and depression and adhd
I said trans and on the autism spectrum but I also have chronic anxiety/depression for the record
Trans and BPD
Idk... I always felt like I have some form of ADHD, my mom having it as well adds fuel to the fire there, but I never have gotten diagnosed with anything. If I do it isn't severe though, like I may lose focus on things but I can semi-easily force myself back on track
where the other 111 trans autistic people at?? wanna be friends??
I’m Trans have Chronic Anxiety and Depression and I have ADHD
I'm not actually diagnosed, though I highly suspect that I have autism. So I voted on Trans + ASD. If you'd rather count me as just trans because of it I don't mind.
I'm undiagnosed ADHD, but I have ASD and my two relatives (who also have ADHD) definitely think I have it as well. Just doesn't impact me to the point where I need assistance; I'm very inattentive and forgetful, but I've worked around it.
Autistic and cis
I'm trans and I used to suffer from serious social anxiety. Now I don't. Go figure :D
Trans, autism and chronic anxiety / depression for me
Trans and idk im undiagnosed but probably all of the above
I have PTSD, anxiety and drepression
Trans and anxiety/depression seems pretty common. This is a fun life
Probably trans, autistic, and probably ADHD though I haven’t dug into it as much and don’t have w diagnosis. 

Tons of chronic anxiety too
I'm like 90% sure trans and autistic, but i'm not officially diagnosed so I don't actually know for sure
Well I was anxious and depressed before finding out I was trans.
After doing something for my transition the depression was gone but the anxiety is there but in another form. :)
I'm just trans and happy with that. Can't imagine how it must be for other people with additional conditions
had to choose between voting for ADHD and depression/anxiety. went for the latter. but i have both. all but asd
I know it was mentioned already, but I genuinely cannot choose between ADHD and depression/anxiety, since my ADHD, MDD, and anxiety disorders are all very prominent in my life
Hi so I'm MTF Transgender I was diagnosed with ADD as a kid as a teenager Asperger's but when I came out as Trans at 31 I felt like my Asperger's was just a part of my mask has anyone else felt like this, because there is a study going on that would include Transgender as a sub category of Asperger's
Oof mine aint on here dubs
Where is trans + crippling OCD? :(
Maybe add a “trans and multiple of the above”, “trans and other conditions” and “trans and undiagnosed conditions” next time? Just a thought.
Autistic Trans girl with ADHD and chronic anxiety and depression checking in! What is my mission!
Lets go, trans, autism, adhd, and depression and anxiety…. Yayyy … just trying to stay alive rn… life is tough… not to worth for me anymore 
… but I hope you all have a good day…
What if more than one?
There is no all of the above option and I kinda need it
All of the above?
I’m on way to many of them to be able to choose one XD
Bro I'm Trans, depressed, autistic, plus I have social anxiety and ADHD, I'm an all in 1 package baby 😎
I’m none but just here because I am
I should’ve included an “all of the above” option. Hence “unscientific” lol Thank you for catching that! 

In that case, “Trans and None of the Above” is the designated catch-all for responses that don’t fit the first several answers.
I mean, isn't it a given that everyone has chronic anxiety? 😬
yeah where’s the all of the above option
Yeah lol
Yeah, that’s where I’d probably fit.
Autism also isn't a illness
Thought the same
Well, if you are trans then you have either euphoria or dysphoria (or likely both), which are disorders. That doesn't make you a bad person, but it does make you non-neurotypical and makes the conditions comorbid.
This is something I’ve been wondering about, I understand that being trans isn’t a mental illness, but what is it instead? I kinda dread someone calling me mentally ill over being trans, bringing up the fact it’s no longer considered a mental illness and then having no response to ‘well what is it then’
It kinda is tho
Me too!  But I just had to select “trans and chronic anxiety and depression,” since that’s more relevant for me right now.
“Chicken or egg” has been my lifelong rhetorical question
Are you me?
I’d say yes. There’s a number of neurological conditions where they test for if epilepsy is also present. You can have just epilepsy, of course, but there’s conditions where the two happen at once if that makes sense. I have cerebral palsy for instance and I was tested for epilepsy when I was a baby, I don’t have it, but due to it also being a condition in the brain... better safe than sorry
I believe so, but I would put “trans and none of the above”
Love it! ❤️
Goals tbh
Oh wow, another like me. Guess I’m not so strange after all
Same
That’s true for autistics too though, and ADHD
No worries. I wish I could put a lot of conditions on here but the list would be exhaustive. I expect the ‘trans and none of the above’ number to be high.
Isn’t trans but non of the above the same as just trans
I’m trans with addhd, depression, and anxiety. This pill doesn’t really work
Nor is ADHD. It is a disorder though, just like autism, and I'd often called an illness as slang.
Careful, you might be labeled truscum : (
If OP ever redos this poll, there should be an option for ""trans and *a neurological condition not listed here*""
We're plenty strange. And that's beautiful in my opinion.
Yeah I agree with that (I have autism and adhd) being neurodivergent is a part of who I am too, I feel like more people are realizing that being neurodivergent isn't having a disorder, its just our brains are wired differently
Good question. But no, Just trans is exclusively trans. Trans and none of the above means a diagnosis of trans AND something else not listed.
It’s not a disorder either, despite the current naming. It’s different nerotype which can come with different support needs for different people
Well, I am not truscum. I am kind of in the middle between truscums and the mainstream trans ideas. But I get why someone might think I am truscum.
Especially since the ones given are behavior driven, not physical such as ours
Oh I wish I could change my vote
Oooh! Yeah I completely misunderstood that option too!
It's literally called a disorder by every licensed medical professional. Hence the name autism spectrum *disorder* and attention deficit hyperactivity *disorder*.
Yeah, I tend to not speak my views on it because you’ll get an angry mob.
Well being autistic or having adhd are physical. There’s tons of overlap between being autistic and being trans too, for some reason.
It’s ok. This poll is really just for fun. Though the answers are truly revealing. No matter what, you’re not alone!
Which is irrelevant to what it actually is.  It’d been pathologised by clueless people making stuff up from the outside-much as being trans has been. 

Being autistic can come with various support needs which differ from person to person, but being autistic is itself just a different way for brains and humans to exist.
I meant in terms of the condition affecting other physical parts of the body, but you are right since the brain is physical, but neurological conditions such as mine do impact the arms and legs and the way body processes physical movement. Body parts often grow in incorrectly altering the body itself. Which is different than if only the brain specifically was impacted, but I get what you mean
It impairs a person's life in a mild, moderate, or severe way. I am an autistic person who also has ADHD. I have two disorders. I'm not just ""special"", these things inhibit my daily life and make it hard to do some tasks. They are considered disorders for the same reason anxiety or depression are disorders; they cause problems, and those problems need to be fixed. That's why I take meds for anxiety and don't just say ""oh well, my brain's just a lil special""."	pod4wx	trans	194	0.96	2021-09-14 22:24:44
For Those Undergoing/Pre-HRT and/or Pre-Op	Cis-ster here (hi ladies!) I can’t imagine what it’s like knowing who you are and not being able to express it properly due to both environmental and genetic factors. I wanted to take a moment to say that there are people like me in the world who appreciate ALL trans bodies, not just those who “pass.” As someone pan, I find beauty in all manner of people. Whether, as a trans man, you need to wear a binder or not, I will always see you as the wonderful guy you are. If the only thing you can do is wear a light coat of lip gloss, you’ll still be an amazing lady. HRT and SR ops are supposed to uplift you, not be required—because no one will ever take away who you are and your identity shouldn’t be determined by someone else’s standards of gender. We love you, so please keep being the amazing people you were meant to be. Happy Valentine’s Day everyone. 💕	"Hello, thank you very much for the support and the love :) its nice to know people like you exist 🤗🤗
Awwww...thanks for this. Happy Valentine's Day!
Thank you! It’s nice knowing there are people out there and someone out there somewhere that will love me for me.
Thank you, its wonderful to know that these kind of people who accepts us no matter what exist and its making me so much better 🥰🤗
I'm supposed to be going to work, I can't be crying already 😭
Thank you for this. Its super sweet.
Thank you. (We need more like you in the older age brackets!!)
I am sorry but I have to say it

Thanks Cis
[deleted]
Thank you so much!! 
I often feel invalidated by the fact I’ve been stuck as a “cross dresser” rather than a “real” trans woman for years. I am too worried to even start hrt as I worry I won’t look cute enough like I want too. That and I have a lot of anxiety
As someone who is pre everything (FTM), thank you so much, I needed this :)
You deserve all the love and more 💕
Of course 🥰
*sending virtual hugs*
Heck yeahs 👉🏾😏👉🏾
It’s okay. Better to have happy tears ☺️
Anytime 😁
Omgosh yes. Older gens suck when it comes to progressive mindsets.
You’re my new favorite person.
Nothing like spreading love on a lovely day. 🥰
Jeez, I know that must’ve hurt. But hey, just remind yourself at the end of the day that you’re brave enough to accept who you are whereas most other people are not, even when they were born with the right body.
I was thinking about y’all specifically when I made this post. I’m part of the r/SupportAMBW Reddit community and I was just thinking, “I wonder if there are any Asian trans men here but I wonder if they would even post if they were pre-HRT because they might receive backlash for not “passing”.” The realization absolutely broke my heart and I felt like I needed to let you guys know that there are people who will care about you and who will love you regardless of where you are in the process of transitioning. We’re here for you. Always. 💕
Aweeeee <3
That is incredibly sweet of you 💕 and it's almost definitely been said here in the comments before but it's nice to know that there are people out there who are here for us"	ss7wwn	trans	188	0.97	2022-02-14 10:53:31
Is it okay to try to be toned/gain muscle if you’re transfem	Some background info, my parents tell me one of the many reasons they refuse to accept my gender identity is such, and it’s starting to get to me. Are they in the wrong or should I avoid it?	"There’s no right or wrong way to be trans. Your parents are wrong and likely have a lot of transphobia to work through. Also it’s much easier to build muscle if your body’s dominant hormone is testosterone.
Just my opinion: there are plenty of muscular women, so there is no gender-incompatibility (duh). 

However, without T, I suppose it will be harder to gain muscle mass.

As long as you are careful and don’t hurt yourself, I don’t see the problem.
Yes it is okay to be toned/gain muscle. They're wrong. Transfem, cisfem, doesnt matter. If you enjoy working out, work out. If you dont, dont. Anything else doesnt matter.
there are many women who are muscular, and that doesn’t mean they’re not women. plus, i am fairly certain muscles do not dictate anyone’s gender.
counter them by showing them a picture of a female bodybuilder
Your gender is your gender. Period. You do not have to look or not look a certain way to be any gender. I'm sorry your parents are being so crappy to you.
Have you seen toned/gained women they are super hot.
And there is no reason why your not allowed to be the same. 
(This is the main reason I watch the Olympics. Seeing all those athletic and strong bodies. Both women and men.)
Women can be muscular/toned.
Kind of anti-feminist to say women can't be strong/muscular... how small of a stereotypical box do they expect you to fit into for them to qualify you as a woman?
Yes.
absolutely not! being trans doesn’t mean you have to change your interests, i’m Transfem and i STILL do workouts every night in order to get big, you do you, sister!
You can be as muscular as you want and still be a woman! Conflating musculature with masculinity is becoming very tiresome. I mean, according to your parents, if it’s not okay to have muscles as a woman, what do they expect you to have instead? A system of fluid-filled bladders that support your body instead? Everyone has muscles and visibility of such (or lack thereof) does not equate gender.
As a lesbian YES PLEASE 

Strong woman pretty
Fucking love muscular women. Carry on.
yeah, they're using that just to be actively transphobic towards you. it's okay there are no boundaries to your body, it's your business and nobody else's
I think it’s great to be a toned person period shows health and strength and your body will thank you for your fitness level later !
Hell yeah! Be an Amazon!
Get strong! Live long! Love and laugh ❤️
It's your body and you should do whatever feels right for you.
Muscular femmes are frickin gorgeous
Absolutely. All women come in all shapes and sizes. Love and solidarity ❤️🖤
Life is like a “choose your own adventure” book
Go look up arkanglejoy on instagram.

She was on an ep of the most recent season of Queer Eye. Trans femme power lifter. Delightful person.
I plan to have an 8 pack as a trans woman so, no.
Muscle/strong girls are a thing, anyone who says otherwise isn't educated and most likely boring. Be the girl that YOU are/want to be and let nobody stop you
It’s okay to do what makes you happy!
Yes v v sexy
Transition is about becoming your ideal self, and for me this means becoming stronger as a woman than I was a man (which is a low enough bar as to be doable, even with the decreased testosterone). I always wanted to be buff, and now that I realized I'm female, I want to be a buff girl instead of a buff guy. Go for what makes you happy!
The only eprson im the world with any right or reason to dictate who, or what you shiuld be is YOU. It's your body, your wishes and YOUR life. In the grand scheme of things, they're naught but bystanders in your life. No matter how important, they do not decide.

Besides. Let's be honest here folks. Muscular women are fucking hot!
Buff ladies are hot af and valid lol why is it a problem if they're a trans lady?
Answer to the title: yes definitely

Answer to the question about your parents: They're being cunts to try and force you back into living their lie, so yes they're wrong.

Also Alana Mclaughlin is kinda hot* and she's really well toned (*in a completely asexual way).
Gender identity and gender expression are different from each other
Imagine someone would constantly call their daughter „son“ because she happened to enjoy sports and being fit. That sounds plain rediculous, like an excuse. 
That’s basically what it is imho
Your parents are wrong. Sorry you're having to think about this at all. Muscular women both cis and trans exist.
Nothing wrong with a strong woman. Your parents are using it as an excuse to misgender you.
from a M2f's perspective:

\-there a female body builders and they are still women regardless of how muscular they are

\-women have more ligament to muscle ability so they can often have more strength than men and can accomodate more strength with the increased ligature without the need for as much muscle which contributes to this misconception, also men are typically expected to have more physical jobs or tasks that causes more muscle growth so having more muscle is not necessarily our own doing but a side effect of the expectations placed on us

\-just because you have muscle it does not mean you have any less  femininity for your body, in some respects having a more muscular body that appears more capable is a mental challenge for people and being able to overcome their own instilled prejudices involved with body shaming is an accomplishment

\-I am someone with more muscle than the average women but for a woman my height and weight i actually have less muscle overall. the average woman has more muscular lower body muscles than the average man and these muscles are typically larger groups

\-cis women have better balance than cis men aswell due to the invariability of upper body weight associated with carrying breasts so their musculature is not as intense due to the fact that they can naturally carry themselves with more ease- not to mention that with the typical physical jobs and tasks assigned to males, males will more often suffer from back injuries that cannot be remedied with a breast reduction.

\-The body is not what makes us feminine believe it or not, the body is merely a representation of ourselves and how we choose to life our lives with this representation, The mind is what makes us feminine.
yes
Your parents are wrong, muscular women are hot
It's OK to do what the hell ever you want.
You've the right to any body you want.

If you want to be she hulk, be she hulk. She's beautiful as hell!
As a trans lesbian, It’s not just okay, it’s also really hot.
there is no right or wrong way to have a body and there is no right or wrong way to be trans! present as you feel comfortable. They’re wrong."	tf14pz	trans	186	0.98	2022-03-15 21:40:53
When did you realize you were trans?	"So I'm currently questioning my gender identity A LOT, I though I had it figured out and that I was non-binary/agender, but then I've started feeling envy towards especially feminine men, which is confusing me a lot. Cause I've felt like I wanted to distance myself from feminity (I'm afab) but maybe that's because I don't wanna be seen as a woman. And yeah, I just feel really confused, and I know I don't need to figure it out quickly but it's just been difficult. I'm 23 and I don't remember feeling much gender dysphoria until about a year ago or so, and that makes me wonder if I can even be trans if I haven't felt that.. 
So that just makes me curious about when other trans people figured out they were trans and if you've always felt dysphoria or if it came later in your life?"	"Well, 2 things:

1) You CAN be trans without much gender dysphoria. It’s different for everyone, for some it’s really intense and for others it’s not. On top of that, dysphoria doesn’t have to be just physical/appearance wise. I don’t have it but when I researched dysphoria a bit more, a lot of the mental, more internalized aspects clicked with me.

2) You don’t have to necessarily want to be the opposite gender with a burning passion to be trans, already considering yourself non-binary/agender means you’re not quite happy with your assigned gender at birth and that’s basically all it means to be trans.

Now in regards to your question, I don’t have it all figured out, far from it. My egg recently cracked so to speak and I still deal with a lot of confusion and feelings of “I’m just a fake” or even “You’re just trying to force yourself into wanting to be a woman” but the truth is that it brings me peace when I can just shut off all mental distractors and just think of myself as a woman. 

I’m pre-everything, in a country where hormone treatment isn’t even a thing so I can’t quite do more than some minor adjustments like paint my nails but it feels good so what else matters?
I realized when I was 18 and that’s when I learned what being transgender was and my first thought was “that’s an option???” Looking back I absolutely felt types of dysphoria but I didn’t know that when I was younger a fish doesn’t see the water it swims in you know?
I am 33 and really only only just figured it all out in the last two years… before that I knew I wasn’t feminine and I couldn’t relate to being female but I didn’t really have the mental energy or self belief to put it into words. I’ve had to work thru a lot of family trauma and self destructive behaviours before I could find myself in a place to allow myself to admit/realise who I really I am
I'm a feminine trans man. I've only allowed myself to embrace that recently because I was under the impression that I couldn't because people would misgender me. Now, three years into medical transition, I don't let that bother me much.

I've never felt much dysphoria, euphoria was more important to me.

I realised I was trans when I was cosplaying Castiel and Jehan Prouvaire. That made me feel comfortable.
So early I can’t even remember exactly when. But I didn’t have the vocabulary to properly describe it until I went to college. I just knew I should have been a girl, not a boy. 

I didn’t do anything about it but suffer, so don’t feel like you’re getting a late start. I know several people that started their transition later in life after realizing what that nagging feeling was after 39, 40, 50 years. 

You don’t need to have grown up feeling “trans” to be trans.
Hey as a transgirl with tomboy vibes you can be a feminine transman and still be a man if that's how you feel.
My gender identity is lifelong. There never was a time when I felt male. Even so, I didn’t see myself as trans until I was 43, but once I did there was no going back.
I feel like I've always known, but I've only (in the last month or so) been able to admit to myself that this is what I am.

I worry that maybe I've jumped the gun or something, but right now I have days where I just want to tell everyone (but I'm holding it in until I see a professional about it because I want to have confirmation first).
For me it was puberty, I hella envied the changes girls went through and put on weight to gain curves……

Also the sensation of a biological clock, and acting mildly fem yet totally insecure as a male
ok so funny story I came to the realization I was bi (am pan so not far off) as my first step in the lgbtq community and told myself ok I am a CIS bi man then it took all of 2 seconds for me to start wondering why I put so much emphasis on the cis bit and well 6 months later I said I was gender fluid and now I am a trans woman

I had light dysphoria and hints my whole life but never noticed until I came to terms with myself and my identity
I think I’ve felt dysphoria for a long time before I realised I was trans; I just never realised that it was dysphoria because it wasn’t as severe as what I’d heard dysphoria was like for trans women, and it was different (dysphoria as a non-binary person is confusing lol).

I realised I was non-binary just over a year ago (just before my 17th birthday), but I identified as a femboy for close to a year before that.
Nah, I didn’t really start having dysphoria until my early 20s. I didn’t have the right vocabulary back then, so I was kind of left in a mindspace where I “wished I were trans”, because I assumed that you had to be binary to be valid. Lucky for me, it was very mild, transient, manageable. It wasn’t until about a decade later when I started working with teenagers that I learned that being nonbinary was a valid option... and learning that triggered a tidal wave of intense dysphoria, lol. Thanks for the mental breakdown, kids!
I'm not trans, but I frost started questioning my cisness when someone kept accidentally referring to me as a she (I am AMAB)
I can’t even tell you what I did yesterday
I spoke to a trans friend of mine about how I wasn't really feeling comfortable with how I am, how I've fantasized cutting *it* off. She told me to try out using she/her pronouns for a bit, see how I felt. Never went back.
I realized I was trans when I was 15 or 16, but didn’t do anything about it until my late 30’s.
When my therapist asked if I could go back to living aa a guy after I'd been presenting female for about a year. That question was what turned the switch from 'meh, not unhappy as a guy, so not trans' to 'wait, definitly far happier as a woman, so trans?'.

Never had the stereotypical crippling dysphoria, but I did have a lot of _euphoria_. People calling me she, being one of the girls, even something silly as trading my bicycle for a women's bike, so I wouldn't have to worry about swinging my leg over the saddle in a skirt. Those are the things that, to me, confirm I'm not doing it for the attention or anything. These are things I did for me, not for others. Imposyer syndrome is one hell of a drug though.
Floating around 23 or 24, but I'm learning as i go
My opinion is you feel what you feel, no matter the label (and you are who you are too). I realized i was trans when i switched to a school with a GSA and first heard the term ""nonbinary"" After that, i tried on a few different labels but stuck with nonbinary. 

I personally don't think it matters how I label myself, because my experience is what it is regardless. If i change over time, that's okay too. People grow and change, so if I decide a different label works, thats ok! And if my experience changes, that's ok too!

So if one or another label describes your experience, don't worry if you ""fit"" or if you live up to that label. Be honest with yourself and what your experience feels like, and take your time to define yourself as it fits that experience. Let yourself change as it comes up, and do what feels right for you moment-to-moment. 💕
I've only been 'out' on Reddit \[by creating this account\] for about 2 days, and...this isn't the first time I've seen someone afraid they aren't ""Dysphoric Enough™"" to be ""Real Trans™"", and that...bothers the hell out of me, but I don't know where it comes from.  Is there some unpleasant subgroup that's gatekeeping or something?

Some of us, myself included, might have had suspicions...but it isn't until a triggering event that the secret doors open, that self-exploration and self-realization begins, and IMO that doesn't make a person any less trans than someone who has been dysphoric as long as they can remember.  Every single one of us is in this to become comfortable with our bodies, our place in society, etc...how we start that journey, and what path we take, are mere details.

Anyway, I need to get off this soapbox, my dogs need to pee and I need to get this post finished so they can go!

To answer your question about when I realized...it's not a clear answer.  I've known since pretty young that I was 'wired funny'...fascinated by things like Ranma 1/2 when it first appeared in the US (and later in life, considering the lead an ingrate for despising his gift) and shapeshifting in general, feeling an intense jealousy about women's wardrobe options on grounds of 'getting all the good stuff'...but never considered myself dysphoric or trans (even when my best friend's sibling transitioned 20 years ago), just a person with eccentric interests.

I don't resent my body, I don't feel an intense hatred for living as a male for the first 40 years of my life...my ""first body"" is a body I'm apathetic about, one I've never considered (or cared about it being) attractive, and yet with every new self-exploration experiment it's undeniable, more and more evidence piles up in the 'This isn't just a trauma response...you're trans, Rhynn' pile.

For me the walls came tumbling down barely 2 months ago.  ""Hey doc, my motivation and drive \[both ambition and sex\] are hot garbage, could this be hormonal"" became ""Your body chemistry is a dumpster fire"" and ""your body is probably lying to you, I want you to get tested for genetic transcription errors that would mean you're intersex"" \[I don't meet that specialist for another month and a half! ; \_ ;\] became an existential crisis (and the trauma I initially wondered if I might have been responding to), became getting super drunk a week before US Thanksgiving, became a box with teardrop forms on my doorstep, became embarrassment upon holding them for the first time because getting rip-roaring drunk in the middle of an existential crisis is not a time for an AMAB to be trying to learn how bra sizing works and figure out which method the manufacturer uses in order to buy forms based on desired bra size, became laying on my bed with the forms just loosely placed and having my first triggering moment.

It wasn't a ""this is the greatest thing ever"" euphoric rush like an NSFW triggering moment that happened the next day \[not going there unsolicited\] was...it was like I'd just taken a thick blanket out of the dryer and wrapped it around my soul, that sense of warmth and security that just drowns out everything, including a cold winter's night.  Each experiment encouraged the next, until one night I looked in the mirror and didn't see ""me"" wearing shapewear/forms/etc...I saw her.  I saw Rhynn standing there smiling back at me, and a sense of warmth radiated through my whole body again.

That's when I knew.

The best advice I can give you?  If you're questioning, experiment.  You may not get the answer you expected...but you will get an answer.  All journeys of self-discovery lead somewhere.
I'm 17 and I only started questioning on the 6th of November this year because of a video by telepurte called patch, I then realised that I was trans on the 9th after I started connecting a bunch of dots. But before I started questioning, I never had any reason to think I was trans
Well I had periodic a questioned for a while, but not actually come up with any answer. One day my Autistic ADHDer brain decided “no you’re sitting down in answering this now. To force you to; you’re hyper focusing nonstop for a whole week!”
I'm 55 and over the past year I've started to question my gender identity. I'm AMAB and I realized that I never really allowed myself to be in the moments when I felt very feminine.

So I guess I really knew it early on in life even though I didn't understand what was happening. Acknowledging it to myself happened decades later obviously.

I'm still trying to figure out my gender at this point. All I know for sure is that there are times I feel very male and others that I feel very feminine, not necessarily female though.
I've known I was different since I was young,  and I desperately wanted to be a lesbian as a teenager, but between a combination of childhood traumas and religious and social repression (the 90s were just awful), I buried my feelings until I was 44 and lockdown finally broke me.

Dysphoria and imposter syndrome hit me hard at the start (and even at the same time), but looking back they had always been there, lingering just below the surface in ways that I wasn't able to understand; I'd always been envious of  women (I'm mtf), how flat and smooth they are without a bulge while my own felt like an afterthought or a joke, and I always picked them in video games, even going so far as to mod the game if I needed to.

And I would get euphoria from doing feminine things, wearing feminine clothes, at least until the crushing burden of guilt and shame came crashing down again.

It's only now that I'm actually allowed to feel my feelings that I realize I'm trans femme, but as I work through accepting that, I'm being to realise that I'm not simply a woman, but there is a strong nonbinary part of me as well.
ME TOOO. i was content with being nonbinary and i thought it for me but then i realised i could be a nonbinary genderqueer dude that presents feminine sometimes
I was a young child, around 6 or 7, when I first remember dysphoria and wanting to be a girl. I explored transition around age 20 and didn’t fully connect my feelings/experience with being trans until I was 30. Seems like lots of others’ first experiences are later on including in adulthood, and it works differently for different people. Definitely dysphoria does not seem to be a requirement. Dysphoria was off and on for me over the years; sometimes I felt fine or even enjoyed presenting male, but eventually transition simply felt right.
Figured it out 3 weeks ago. It kinda just happened? Was just thinking around (?) and it all just kinda clicked. I never really liked my appearance despite being quite good looking (according to friends and relationships) and felt more physical envy than attraction with many of my female friends and girlfriends. I remember that multiple times I quite distinctly thought ""Wish that would fit me"" when playing a game and seeing some girls with dope outfits. Of course my stupid ass didnt take any of the dead giveaways (for me) until now and Ive done those things ever since I can remember.
A few months ago. I hadn’t thought much about myself till a survey asked and I got thinking. I figured out I’m not very masc and pretty fem. Interestingly enough my freinds sorta figured out first. Like the where 100% convinced I wasn’t a straight male. They where right, I’m a trans lesbian
Hi there, trans guy here. Personally I discovered I was trans, or at least some kind of genderqueer when I was 14. But I didn't really experience any 'real' dysphoria at first which made me question if I was faking when I got really severe dysphoria just a year later. What was the case for me, was I was just repressing all feelings of dysphoria. I was always uncomfortable in my body and ended up disappearing into hoodies in seventh grade, but I thought it was always just insecurity at the time. When I learned what dysphoria was, I couldn't ignore it as easily. This led to a quick onset of my dysphoria, or at least a quick onset of what I could now label dysphoria after realising I was genderqueer. 

I was also super opposed to anything masculine right after coming out to myself. Then I was super opposed to anything feminine. And now I'm somewhere in the middle and I'm really happy with that. I think I was too scared to admit I wasn't a girl at first and then I tired to distance myself from it before embracing myself as nonbinary. 

And also, very importantly, there is no right or wrong way to be trans. You do not need dysphoria. It can sometimes be there and sometimes not. You can be a feminine AFAB trans person or a masculine AMAB person of anything in between. It's all about what you feel comfortable with. I don't even have a label more specific than trans or nonbinary even though I'm sure there's one for how I feel. You don't need a label if you don't want one, but you can have one if you like too! Good luck friend, you've got this!
In therapy, 2 weeks ago the egg started to crack. The last one I came out just 11 days ago. I smashed the egg and came out running. I went to therapy because in late 2018 depression spiraled beyond what I could handle and I was sick of just feeling like crap the entire time. I was a very feminine man physically, with the psyche and heart of a woman. Got crap my entire life, felt like I didn't belong and didn't like the skin I was in. Did often wonder if life would be better as a woman. So obvious lol. I was just blind to myself for the longest time, or I would have identified much sooner.

Discussed many things over a year and then that session my therapist asked ""What would you think, of a person with an identity issue. They are smart, they understand about anxiety, depression, C-PTSD. They seem to be happy but only seem to be. The issues are identified, but there's still something. What would you say?""

I said ""Someone's in a closet flying a big colorful flag"". And I laughed, relief cos I could see he meant me.

And I realized oh shit I'm actually trans? I'm actually trans! Yes I am! I am a woman!

I've always felt feminine inside. I knew I had to express as her instead of suppressing her. My voice suddenly became feminine almost instantly in that moment .

The feeling I didn't belong vanished. And I left therapy the first day as my self. As Alex. And I've never felt better. I'm a tall confident woman figuring her style. Pre op and everything. Have yet to go 100% feminine in public, I am rocking the jeans. I need more tops lol I have nothing to wear! So this is what girls mean. I can understand their frustration now lol. I'm proud to be me with so many other wonderful woman facing a similar journey.

I  want to be a beacon of hope, support and inspiration, just as everyone has been for me. Love y'all xx. Be you, the real you even if its inside, just one thing each day to honor yourself. Luckily I'm in a pretty good country for trans rights, there's HRT etc. Surgery is crazy expensive though, I'm not ready until I've had a decent amount of time on HRT
I wanted to be a girl since like elementary school. My best friend was a girl and we did girly activities together. She moved and then over time I became more masculine to fit in but crossdressed in private. Now I’m 24 and just a couple months ago accepted that I am trans. For me, the gender dysphoria has always been there but I didn’t actually accept it until this late in my life.
Back when, I had to do a LOT of research online until I finally surpassed the layers of ""medical"" stuff talking about ""gender Identity Disorder"" and started reading other trans people's stories about their journey. (I'm afab) Before and right after coming out, I was VERY against having a feminine side, but as the years went by and my transition progressed, I suddenly started feeling SO much more comfortable in embracing a somewhat ""feminine"" side. I've never been dysphoric about my V, but was very much so for my chest. As soon as I healed from top surgery, I was a lot more comfortable in my body and soon after started hooking up with people. Apparently I come off as a ""gay man"" to most people, but I don't mind it since I'm always seen as a man overall (:
I was talking to my cis female friend and i said “like, who wouldnt want to be a man?” And she looked at me and said “id *hate* to be a man” and i just looked at her wide eyed like “ * incoherent noise * *you would?!*”
Honestly i knew pretty early on something was different. I have memories of telling my brother that i wanted to be a boy not a girl. 
But really for me it was realising that thats how i could be most happy with myself and in my body.
The most important thing is dont rush things. Come to peace with yourself first. Good luck:) its hard to explain really but yeah
Just felt it. The one thing that make me question if I am really female is the bans I get from female subs. It is so weird that I keep getting banner without having any negative intention. I tell one story or just tell about any experience I had and I get hated on.
It really came to light for me about 8 months ago even though as a kid my deepest secret and life long dream was. ""I want to be a girl"" the following is a bit long but important for context

So my brain chose to tell me ""hey go look at a skirt""...""w-why?"" ""DOOOO IT! The trans subs helped you realize experimenting is good! Let's have fun."" So I did i told the wrong person I might be alittle more fem and then rumors flew i got kicked out of the store was placed on a week long unpaid leave and the cracks began to spread.

I got home started drinking fast and hard. learned about euphoria bones and shortly after drunkenly shaved my legs face and upper and underarms with a safety razor tried on all my exs dresses till I found one that fit me i went spinny i was so happy and started to cry when one fit fell to me knees my egg shattered and gone everything making sense alone in my apartment....just born.
I was 16, playing WoW, and questioned why I kept making all my characters female when I RP’d.
I started questioning when I got into tg fiction and realized that I identified with girls in any porn I’d watch, but there were telltales signs when I was young, like when I was around five I was terrified and started sobbing when I realized that I’d grow and have to shave my own beard some day, or when I actually started going through puberty i was confused about why my body was doing the wrong things, but go figure, it was only way later (around 20/21 lol) that I realized what was really going on and all the puzzle pieces fit together. Also for me I may have had dysphoria during puberty but not been able to label it, but it only got bad later.
A couple weeks ago was probably when my egg cracked.
I joined some LGBT subreddits because I’m Bi. And suddenly Egg_irl was recommended to me (this February), which immediately cracked my egg after going through like 2 memes.
i was born a girl. i’d got my hair cut ‘boy’ short a few months before. i’d just gotten out of the shower and had my pyjamas on. i was dying my hair in front of my mirror. i thought i looked like a boy. that made me happy. i always hated my chest and feminine features and the natural thing that came with being  a biological woman. i always just thought i was self concious. but that one day literally changed everything.
Im 16 and I've been out as trans since I was in 6th grade. I showed slot of signs when I was in about 4th grade but I just thought I was a tomboy. I met a friend who explained it and introduced me to the trans umbrella and ever since then I have knows that I'm a man in a woman's body (:
I came to the realization about 2 months ago. I've only come out to a few people and they have been super supportive about it. I'm hoping I can start HRT Soon!
Your experience sounds a lot like mine was. For the longest time I identified as NB mostly out of the understanding that it was a 'socially acceptable' way of embracing femininity. It wasn't until I took some psychedelic mushrooms (don't do drugs kids, mmmkay) that I achieved the amount of introspection needed to realize that a big source of my underlying depression was rooted in gender dysphoria. I'd never really thought much about it before, but the more I thought of a potential alternative version of myself as a woman, the more it made sense and felt right.
I started to question my gender last year in quarantine. I thought I was non-binary, but I would constantly go back and forth on whether I was male, non-binary or somewhere in between. I went through multiple identities and sets of pronouns before I figured out I was genderfluid. Because of the constant changing identity, I thought I was lying. It’s okay to not understand everything about yourself, but that doesn’t mean that your not trans or any other identity. Just take your time, do some research, and find an identity that feels good for you.
The signs for me are dated back when I was in 3rd grade, but what really made me go “I’m not cis” was in 8th grade when my class was taking a survey and I was asked the question “what’s your gender?” There was a third option, it being “prefer not to say”, but I was scared of clicking on it thinking the teachers would ask me about it. Up until the end of sophomore year I called myself genderfluid until I was like…..yeah I’m a boy, nothing more, nothing less
I didn’t know I was trans. But I knew something was really off at about 8
Hmmmm maybe soon
Didn't know the word, but knew the feeling at 10. 

Learned the word at 14.

Denied it until I was 21.

Came out at 24.

Initially came out as genderfluid.

Came out as trans woman also at 24.

You don't need to have it all figured out. Experimenting is always nice, and sometimes, even distancing yourself from femininity there is nothing stopping you from being what you label yourself as. They are just clothes. Wear what makes you comfy. Uncomfy clothes are the worst!
I realised at 14 but some people realise well into their 50s and 60s. It doesn’t matter when you find out :)
I’m also 23 and also feeling these exact same things. Im afab and feel like I’m a feminine man more than a cis woman.
I also have the feeling of ""being a fake"" or ""doing it for attention"" even though I've only talked to my sister about it. 
I hope things change in your country soon so you can be your authentic self.
Yep...completly agree. #1 was the case for me, and I didn't realize the dysphoria until after I dissected my actions and asked myself some hard questions about my behavior. 

After I did that it...I was able to diagnose countless dysphoria based actions. It was a bit overwhelming...and I'm still coping with a lot of it, but I'm making progress and every day feels better. The list of things I want to eliminate is long, but I'm pretty methodical in eliminating what I can.
Ahh yes.  All that attention that you get being in the closet as a trans person who's out to no one.

The feeling fake thing is super common.  It's called imposter syndrome.
I know, I realise it's ridiculous but it's so hard getting rid of that thought"	rj8awq	trans	176	0.99	2021-12-18 14:12:08
"A response to the ""Am I still trans if..."" posts. Yes you are."	"There's a steady stream of these kinds of posts, and it's completely understandable. The status of trans people in society is such that imposter syndrome is rife, we are constantly doubted by friends and family upon coming out, and our very existence and validity is constantly debated.

But, there is no one way to be trans. People come to the conclusion that they're trans over time, some people don't realise until late in their life, some trans women want moustaches, some trans men want to wear makeup, some non-binary folk want to change nothing about their appearance, some want to pursue HRT. 

With these cases, the problem isn't that you're not trans because of how you look or act, the problem is that the ignorant are less likely to accept you if you don't do everything to conform to your gender identity.

The reality is, in my view, that these people will have a problem with you regardless of how you present. Some people are transphobic, and it's a hard truth in the world, but the key to happiness is living a happy life, how you want to, in spite of these people. And it's possible, it's fucking hard, and you put up with harrasment and ridicule, but it's possible. 

As corny as it is, be you, unapologetically, the only thing that determines your gender identity is how you feel. 

Love ❤️"	"Thank you for this, I know I am a trans man. But I still want to have long hair, and wear fem clothes. I tell myself that there isn’t any point in telling people, life would just be easier if I pretend to be a woman.
Cis people do not question there gender and wa t to change it or to be something else
Well said.
Am I trans if I’m still cis though?
Thank you for this u/PrimaryTart. I have been thinking the same myself.
I'm glad you told us dude! 💕
If you'd be happier with different pronouns and a different name, go for it my man. Whilst the fear is always that people wouldn't respect it, and not everyone will, you'd be surprised how many people are on board with it.

Obviously I don't know the ins and outs of your current situation, but it's something worth considering. Best of luck with it
If you present and are only known as being cis, but feel that you're trans, I'd say you're trans but closeted. If you present and are known as being cis, and feel that you're cis, I'd say you're cis. I think that's what you're asking? Correct me if I'm wrong"	tjb6z5	trans	178	0.99	2022-03-21 12:55:33
"""Community"""	"When I started exploring my gender / acknowledging my dysphoria, I thought that I would at *least* have support from the trans community...little did I know that the trans community (online) is so divided. Nobody made me more insecure about my gender identity than people in the trans community- and not just ""transmedicalists"". I was diagnosed, by two medical professionals, with gender dysphoria. That somehow still wasn't enough for some people, because I identify as gender fluid. On the other hand, I had people telling me that dysphoria isn't real. 

Our suicide rate is way too high to be putting each other down. I'm so sick of seeing it. You might not understand someone's identity- but the good news is? It's not for YOU to understand. It's for that individual. At the end of the day, our best move is to be kind, and continue to fight for our rights. I'm just so sick and saddened by the hatred that myself and many others have experienced in this community...

Edit: Hey, thank you guys for all the responses. I just wanna say, if you're on here and you're questioning or insecure about your identity or frankly any way that you express yourself- please know that you're loved. You WILL figure things out, and you WILL develop that confidence over time. At the end of the day- it's about YOU! What name, what pronouns, what label (or lack thereof) makes you feel like you're at home. That's what's important. You're needed and loved, no matter your identity or feelings or views. Express them kindly, explore, and be safe (:"	"Yeah. Mfs really be out here saying ""trans rights"" and then be saying ""but only if you fit my criteria"". And that's cringe
I know how you feel.  The division and infighting sucks, and some people just don't want to learn even among our own people.  Hopefully things will get better and we can become a more united community.
Less gate keeping; more compassion.
It's kind of dangerous to. 
I bought it. I didn't see it was toxic and outright wrong. My mental health declined. But my experience didn't match others. Making me live with dysphoria and things I thought were something else!
I had to crash into the bottom to see the truth. 
There I found others like me. Drowning in false so called facts. Spewed by important looking people.
Even claiming opinions are facts.

I want inclusiveness and solidarity. And it's sad to say that that isn't found everywhere in LGBTQIA+
[deleted]
Really sorry you feel like this. Even more sorry that you are right to feel this way.

I try very hard to foster community and more than that listen and provide good advice to those who I come across. I am one person and I alone cannot create unity where we are so divided.

I intend to graduate from reddit into the real world in a month, there I hope to find real community. I also hope to find the potential for activism and the ability to foster the unity I desire.

In the end my efforts will be aimed at what I think we need, better education on gender in schools. Better quality of life for transgender children. Changes in how the medical community views transgender care, specifically for minors. I can't change this generation I don't know how. But I can give the next on the tools and knowledge to fight over whether skirts or hot pants are better instead of fighting over which identities are valid and real.

What I'm trying to say is that some of us out there are full of hate and project it outwards onto others, some are bigoted and others are selfish. But there are just as many of us who desire change for the better and for all of us to be able to stand united.
i keep trying to type out a long thing but rly what it boils down to is that cis people are the problem. until we as a community realize that infighting is almost always a product of insecurity and misunderstanding and that the problem is almost never other trans ppl, there is never going to be a cohesive trans community. the problem is cis people, not trans ppl who present differently or use emoji pronouns or whatever. its cis people. acceptance needs to be for all of us, even the people some of u think are weird. mind u, must of the ppl who identify w especially ""weird"" and hyperspecific identities are teenagers and/or neurodivergent and usually save the specifics for strictly online or only w other trans ppl.

also: there are obviously individual trans ppl in this community who are like the faces of certain problems within the community and have certainly caused problems that shouldn't be ignored or immediately forgiven. but a lot of those problems wouldn't exist at all without cis people, as that's who those trans ppl are trying to appease with their hateful views. man this is still a long post sry
yeah theres a lot of bullshit out there. division and conflict are real, even within communities. we cant exactly just bridge these divides, some ppl are just going to be loudly wrong. im sorry ur facing issues here, but know that there are many who accept u, and that there are subcommunities within the larger gsrm rights movement
I completely understand :( I’ve unfortunately had to learn very quickly that I need to pick up on red flags and get away or block people like that. I feel like they’re just projecting their own insecurities onto others and that’s not an excuse but it helps me ignore what they say.
I think this is a universal problem among groups who have experienced oppression and trauma, and I think the first thing we need to do is forgive ourselves and eachother.  

Often gatekeeping comes from seeing a glimmer of acceptance for myself and responding with fear instead of hope.  For example, if I think mainstream culture around me might just maybe accept me as a white trans woman I have two choices: if I'm fearful I might try hard to draw a line between me and anyone even slightly less mainstream than myself for fear that association with them will make the mainstream change their mind about me; however if I'm more confident then I can use the opportunity to push the boundary wider so that even more people can enjoy acceptance.  In the long term the second option is better for me because the farther out I push the ""gate"" the safer I am from being pushed back out.  If I try to shut the gate right behind myself, well then at best I'm ""inside"" but still right up against the gate, and in more danger of being pushed back out.

But this is where forgiveness comes in.  If I beleive the premise that gatekeeping comes mostly from fear, then I can start to have compassion for the gatekeepers. Having compassion for someone almost always empowers me to resist the harm they're trying to do to me and maybe, sometimes, helps them with their fear.
So long as people are identifying as non-human concepts, I'll always see a need to clarify that all genders come from a human experience stance, and should not be grouped with non-human identities. With as many trolls as there are misguiding little a kids, leading them to believe they can identify as animals or objects, clarification and education are paramount to acceptance. It'd really suck if people saw identities like fae, and assumed they literally meant that a person identifies as an actual faery, when it really refers to a range of non-masculine identity.

[Edit: What the fuck. I literally didn't say people needed to stop identifying a certain way, just so people accept them. I specifically said we need to help people understand the difference between using a label to express a concept, and using a label in a literal sense - as in fae as a non-masc identity v fae as a literal faery - so folks can understand that these identities are valid. How did anyone possibly get the idea that I think these identities need to go away, because people don't understand them? Do you all seriously just skim, and judge, and assume, without actually reading???]
I got you fam.
People be people, even i sometimes dislike some types of people in the community. Not from disliking the community itself, but there are some real bad apples
It can be brutal but you just need to tailor what you see, following the right people and blocking anyone else does wonders.
Overall, the community is great, but the diverging experiences and ways of describing them can be tricky to navigate. It probably doesn't help that the ""obvious since I was 5"" narrative is pushed to the outside world so much so we learn what to say to therapists to get our hands on HRT.

Personally, I only realized I'm trans at age 36, a few months ago and would have probably gotten there at 30 if the ""extreme and obvious dysphoria required to be trans"" narrative wasn't the point of entry to the trans community and trying to understand the trans experience as a cis man that is repressing doubts about really being a man.

I'll admit that I don't fully understand gender identity and just how vast the spectrum is, but like you said, I don't need to understand it to know it's real and pronouns are just a matter of checking, running them in a few sentences to get the hang of using them properly and correcting yourself if you made a mistake.

To anyone still reading: your identity is valid, you get to change it if you feel it doesn't fit you anymore and no matter where you are in your journey of self-discovery: take as long as you need to get where you need to be and let others help you, but remember to listen to yourself as well!
Blair White in a nutshell
And it’s criteria that only appeals to cis people who still won’t like us or treat us well.
cough cough kelvin garrah
Yeah...I joined that community for a while, because I wanted to have a group of people who understood and could relate to having dysphoria. I don't personally have anything against their belief that you ""have to have dysphoria""- it's the fact that they won't listen to people who disagree, and that they're just flat out disrespectful to people who don't believe that and live differently. I don't care for that kind of selfishness. I met some wonderful people during that time who are really kind and open-minded, though. I just don't associate myself with communities that are trans related (online) anymore, because someone always ruins it for me. Always.
Yeah, this shit bothers me. I like the truscum 'space' for a couple of reasons but I cannot stand actually participating in discussion there. It's mostly negative and sometimes demeaning.
And I'm really grateful for that desire to change. You *DO* have that ability (: And I think you're going to do wonders with that mentality.
Don't be sorry! I value your perspective. 

I partially disagree, because as I stated in my original post, *nobody* made me feel worse about my identity than other trans folks. And it wasn't just ""transmedicalists"". It was people from all different backgrounds and opinions. My gender fluidity was a red flag to transmeds, my dysphoria was a red flag to tucutes. Not saying that those ENTIRE groups were like that- just the people I interacted with. 

I agree that our problems are driven by cis people- the desire to be accepted by them and not have our rights taken away by them, etc. But at the end of the day, if someone is being rude to you, that is THEIR decision to be rude to you. Despite their reasoning, it ultimately would not happen if they chose to be kind. We ALL have to deal with the repercussions of living in a heteronormative / cismajority society. So it's not an excuse to be mean to other trans people...

Maybe that's what you were saying- I apologize if it was. But I don't think it's fair to blame cis people for how trans people are choosing to treat one another in these cases.
I personally think we CAN work on bridging them, though. I don't think it'll be easy nor quick, but through actual conversations where people are willing to hear each other out...? All the discourse I see isn't actually...discourse. It's angry, close-minded people, shoving their opinions down each other's throats. It's never calm and kind and respectful.
""you cant identify this way bc other ppl will think its something else therefore u don't deserve support"" hi Blaire White
I see and understand what you're saying. However, the way people talk about these things needs to change. For one, oftentimes when I've seen people using noun-pronouns (assuming that's what you're referring to), they're pretty young. While I don't understand their need/desire to use them, I am wholeheartedly against harassing them, degrading them, and making them feel as if they are a waste of space. Not that I'm saying you are doing that- I'm just saying if people feel strongly about that and see it as an issue? Maybe find a way to talk about it that doesn't chip away at someone's self-worth...

I'd also like to point out that, most of the folks I've seen identifying that way are only identifying as such online. Which strengthens the argument that it is clearly not hurting anybody...
oooh i found a respectability politics bonehead in the wild!


femininity and masculinity are just as constructed as any other gender and using any metaphor for one’s gender isn’t meaningfully distinct from the feminine or masculine or fae or whatever and making that distinction isn’t going to protect you from trolls and transphobes. 

they don’t hate us for any reason other than hate and preaching anything but total acceptance of gender in all it’s forms and presentations hurts us all.


this is all assuming you are talking about xenogenders, and not, like, going full time furry, but hey, in the eyes of bigots we’re all freaks and so we should have communal solidarity anyhow.
Wait really??? I watched a couple of her videos and she seemed cool

Edit: I’m a dumbass and I realized I’m thinking of someone else, sorry
that is what i was trying to get across but i was also sleep deprived so no worries! i shouldve been clearer. no one gets a free pass for being mean no matter what internalized stuff they have going on.

i guess really what i am trying to get across is that if we could all agree that the ""enemy"" in our path to acceptance is and has always been cis people and not others in the community who dont fit some kind of perfect binary comformist standard, the trans community would be more united and overall nicer to each other instead of pointing the blame. im terrible about run on sentences my b lol
I like to think that too, but im just too abrasive and opinionated to be that person myself. I want these ppl to change their minds (truscum, terfs, etc.), but many of them are stuck in their ways. Its not my job to change them, but ensure they are defeated. Im just skeptical that i can pretend at a calmness i do not have, kindness for those who have none for me, and respect for those who disrespect my kind...

I srsly hope that others can be better than me, and set a better example for the community than i have. I wish u the best of luck in this endeavor, should u choose to pursue it
I'm all for education, and against degrading people for it. But, I do think that online media is the mode of communication of the modern age, and most people tend to get their image of the world through the internet. So, in a sense, it does hurt the community, if people aren't aware of what's actually meant when people use these terms. And, it gets worse if we allow people to identify as things which are outside or below the human experience. Ive seen people identifying as actual animals and objects, when it's physically impossible for a human to comprehend the experience of something with an entirely different brain composition - or even a lack of a brain, period.
I guess if you're comfortable with people not being educated on trans rights, that's your deal. Personally, I think we should he making information available to people, so they don't assume we're the same as people who identify as animals. But, honestly, whatever... you clearly didn't understand what I said, since you think this is about respectability politics... And, to be clear, I very much AM referring to drawing a line in the sand and not welcoming in those who identify as animals. If that's an issue for you, I don't read care. But, thanks for storming in with your sword out.
Sorry... I'm just a bit hung up on your whole first sentence. How did that relate to anything I said?
are u a con?
People who generalize based off of the small amount of people they see / interact with on the internet are not important to me. Apologies if that sounds harsh, but frankly if someone is building their ""image of the world"" based off of things/people they see on the internet, rather than in-person interaction...? 

I mean seriously, if we were to say that trans people make up 3% of the worlds population, that is 240,000,000 people. So if someone is going to say, ""Yeah well I don't think trans people should have xyz because I saw someone identify as a ____"" then I'm sorry, but they're a shallow moron. Even if you saw 100 people, that's 100 out of millions! 

I see why you say it's hurting the community, but I don't see the validity in that. People often say that we should cater to cis people because at the end of the day, the majority of people with the ability to create, alter, and enforce laws and regulations, are cis. I think that's ridiculous. 

""They're going to take away my right to get hormones / surgery because this 15 year old is identifying as a cat!!!"" 

Okay, so you're more upset at the 15 year old than the system that's stupid/broken enough that they are willing to and have the ability to base a law off of relatively rare circumstances that mostly exist on the internet? Doesn't make sense to me. 

Please understand that I do agree that humans are not animals and that I don't understand why people have chosen to identify that way, but again- I've only seen that online, and I've mostly seen younger kids doing it. There's probably a reason for that, and maybe we can all find a healthy, productive way to talk about it rather than say, ""you're hurting our community, stop.""
those people either don’t exist or should be treated with compassion.
No I’m genuinely ignorant and a dumbass
What was there?
The vast majority of socialization is on the internet, though. And, the internet gives a broader slice of humanity, rather than the very locally specific instance of humanity anyone will see in their in-person experiences. So, an image of the world, statistically, is better taken from online samples. For example, my in-person experience for the first 15 years of my life said all people in the US were conservative. My online experience says about 20-30% of the US is conservative, which is more accurate. 
And, to repeat what I've already stated, several times... I'm specifically saying we need more education on the topic. Why is it that after I say that several times, in several ways, people still think it equates to that closing sentence you dropped? I mean, I very explicitly stated that if we want acceptance, we need to educate people on what the difference is - not that people need to be stopped so we can be allowed to exist. How is education not a viable, safe, healthy, and respectful solution? The entire point of the main post of basically begging for people to understand. My first thought would be that education is paramount to the goal their asking for. Why is that evil enough for everyone to downvote and argue with me?
I confused Blair White with another much cooler person
somebody saying they thought she is cool after seeing a couple of her vids
I disagree with socialization being mostly on the internet...just because you live in a conservative area doesn't mean the US is mostly conservative, and it does not take the internet to know that. Do you think that in times before the internet, people assumed that their life was everybody's reality? Maybe the close minded ones but certainly not everybody. 

Anyway, I'm not saying you were calling me out specifically, but I don't disagree that education is part of the issue (I'm not someone who downvoted you but also you are on reddit and people are going to downvote stuff they don't like, it's not personal to you). I'm just saying that maybe the things people are focusing on aren't actually real-life issues and people shouldn't be harassed for it 🤷🏼‍♀️ My healthcare doesn't depend on teenagers on the internet and we shouldn't pretend like it does. People are putting too much weight on those kids.
Ah, I see. Her delivery is great, but this self-superior attitude of ""there's only black and white and nothing in between because I said so"" is sorta daft
Again, I did just just say that in-person life experience isn't the absolute of society. That was a big part of my point. As for whether or not it takes the internet to know that, I'd just like to point out that it's literally a major part of trans culture to grow up not knowing trans identity is even real, outside of your own thoughts and feelings, until finding out online. (Obviously I'm not saying it's the same for everyone - just that it's a big thing.) And, yeah, people genuinely did assume the whole world was predominantly homogenous, based on people's immediate communities, before the internet. In fact, it was commonplace to assume all humans were 99.999% cishet Christians, in all developed nations, about 50 years ago - and those who weren't were assumed to be actually evil or uncivilized, because that was the image in local US culture. I mean, it still is that way for most rural US folks, when you ask them their views on big cities in the US.

But, again, this isn't about people coming to take our rights over a few people online. And, I'm also not trying to say all of reddit is attacking me. I don't know how you assumed that, when I'm talking about what happened in this one thread, with people who literally jumped up to assume what I said was the literal opposite of what I said. That was my issue - all the folks who clearly didn't read what I said, hopping on the downvotes, despite only saying slightly more nuanced versions of my generalized statement, plus actually insulting me.

And, to once again restate it, drawing heavily on the fact that the topic is acceptance of neo/xeno pronouns within this community, this: Education on what terminologies mean is what gives the acceptance people are seeking.
If you misunderstand everything else, so be it. Just take that one sentence. Acceptance in our community comes with education. So, if people want people to be less averse to neo/xeno pronouns, it's essential to let them know that even if the titles seem to mean one thing at face value, the actual definition isn't necessarily what one might assume it is. And, it is pretty clear that a lot of the misunderstanding comes from that lack of education, considering the rest of the comments on the main post.

[Edit: As for the majority of socialization being online - most people (in developed nations) average more time online, on social media, than they spend on social events and outings. Mostly, it's because they're either in class, or at work, for most of the day. Then, they come home, have a meal, and get online. And, even if you consider school or work socialization, how much time can truly be spent not focusing the tasks you need to commit to? To achieve the global intake required to really get any sort of feel for a whome community beyond one's own, they'd have to watch a lot of TV, of all varieties, especially the news, and spend every single weekend in full contact with the general public. Otherwise, the best we can achieve is a vague understanding of what a few other people or programs have exposed us to. So, downplaying the community exposure we receive from the internet doesn't make sense.]
I've had a hard time understanding what you're trying to get across- I'm not trying to be rude or disregard what you're saying. I don't disagree with anything you're saying about the importance of education.
I don't have any ways to say it any more clearly. I've shown this thread to several people, and they're at a loss for words as to how everyone is misunderstanding what I've said.
Not sure if you're trying to, but you're coming off as disrespectful, and I'm not going to continue to engage with you. There's no need to be rude to someone who's trying to understand what you're saying. If you're frustrated that it's taking a *conversation* for someone to get on the same page as you, that's on you.

Beginning to accept Im a trans women	"By research, I mean looking at other people's stories, what they have been through/felt about being transgender. From post to post I've looked and read but I recently came across one post that perfectly summerises my feelings and come to realise I have some pretty big gender dysphoria. I love girly things because it makes me happy, but I fear transitioning because if I did, I'd be an ugly girl. 

By ugly I mean by having too many masculine features which would prevent people from identitying me as female (I'm pre-everything at this point in time and it hurts to think about it every time I look in the mirror). 

It is  such a fear of mine that I constantly jump on and off the idea of actually going through with HRT. Then I overwhelm myself with the whole process. Sso ignore it and for a time, it seems like everything is OK but like a full circle I just come back around.

So. I'm a trans women and am beginning to accept that about myself. It's a step in the right direction right? Any advice would be greatly appreciated 😔"	"I am an ugly woman but I don't care that I'm ugly. I only care about removing the dysphoria and gaining more euphoria as well as self-confidence and self-worth. Just because I'm an ugly woman, it doesn't mean I am any less of a woman. If you feel so strongly about your masculine features of your face and body, there are always cosmetic surgeries that you can have performed in order to get past that dysphoric feeling of masculinity. I myself have done a few procedures since I transitioned at an older age of life.
Two things:

1) Whether or not you're conventionally attractive doesn't define your worth

2) You shouldn't base your decision to transition based on whether or not you'll be perceived as female by others. You should base it on whether or not it will help relieve dysphoria
The best part about your situation is that going on HRT actually helps reduce your masculine features and give you feminine features! The reason your not or the reason your waiting is actually the reason you should. We all want the dysphoria to end, and that's why we do these things.
You're afraid of the result of transitioning. That's normal, I guess everyone would like to be attractive. But, think about how your life would be as an ugly woman, or as the guy you're living as right now. Do you think you'll still be happy as a guy? Maybe, even though you can't know how you'll look with HRT, living as an ugly woman makes for a better life than living as an unhappy guy.

In my case, I was presenting female for a while and having the same doubts as you. I could start HRT and take my chances on how pretty and feminine I'd eventually become. Or, I could toss out all my dresses and skirts and whatnot, and go back to living as a guy. I realized I'd never be happy again as a dude. So even though I had no idea what changes would actually come, I knew the alternative would definately be worse. It still took me a few months since that realisation to actually accept it and start HRT, but it is one of the best decisions I ever made.
I can relate to a lot of what you wrote. The fear of being an ugly girl I think is very common among transitioning MtF trans. It can be difficult to do, but try not to compare yourself to girls who are far ahead of you with transitioning. HRT and surgery isn't like instantaneous magic. HRT takes time, and not everyone can afford or even desire feminizing surgeries. I don't think transitioning should be like a beauty contest. Instead, I think it should be about pursuing ways to make your body more closely align to your gender identity. 

Self-acceptance is a good first step. As far as what to do next, you have a variety of options depending on what resources you have and the circumstances you're in. If you have access and feel ready for it, you could make an appointment to get started with HRT. If the people around you are accepting of trans people, you could gradually start to come out as trans to people you trust the most. Other things you can consider is doing voice training (if you're dysphoric about the sound of your voice), removing unwanted body/facial hair, experimenting with makeup, wearing feminine clothes in private, etc.
That's a key realization. If you'd rather be an ugly woman than an okay looking man, then you've hit a good tipping point.

OP, check out transtimelines. In the before pictures there are some rather unfortunate looking men that turn out to be stunning women, even without surgeries. Hormones are magic. Even girls that aren't drop dead gorgeous look cute as hell, at least to me. 

You can also be cute physically and not conventionally attractive, or just have a good personality which (for me anyway) instantly bumps up a person's attractiveness by a large amount. A super model who is vapid and has horrible opinions ranks far below and average looking person who is kind, funny, and enjoyable to talk to.

Judging worth on attractiveness is some internalized misogyny, imo. Something I know I personally am working on. Accepting that I'm a woman made me realize just how many misogynistic ideas I'd internalized without realizing. Society sucks.
If social dysphoria stems from not being seen as your true self and treated that way, transitioning would relieve dysphoria."	oygrud	trans	168	0.98	2021-08-05 12:45:18
Dysphoria or Imposter Syndrome and the Big Sad	"I have no idea how to title this but its a big long rant about my mental state and gender identity.

My name is Morgan. I use she/they pronouns.

TLDR of it all for those that wont / dont want to read: For the last little while, probably since new years, Ive known I wasnt cis (amab) and im either nonbinary or a trans girl. Brain doesnt like this, and neither does my family.

Through constant interactions and being He/Him’d to death that was proof enough. The amount of people who’ve spread hate to me for just being me and calling me a guy still is really starting to  take a toll on my mental health. My parents are not supportive of anything LGBT and i have no clear support outside of a few friends, florida isnt exactly the greatest trans-friendly place in the world. 

My brain has started doubting that im even who i know i am, I cant look in the mirror or go 10 minutes without some kind of passing thought that im just doing it for attention and whatnot. Coupled with already being antisocial and I have been struggling pretty bad most days and Its so hard to continue. Gender identity is only the beginning of it and I wont go too far into the personal stuff. I just wanna curl up in a ball. 

Its bad enough dealing with the surrounding people who dont support my existence but when my own parents and even my own passive thoughts dont either, i dont know where else to go. Thank you for reading if you did make it this far. 

p.s. hugs are appreciated"	"I don’t know how I can help but big hugs to you my friend.
I struggle a lot with imposter syndrome as well so you have all of my understanding and support. 
One thing that helped me was doing a lot of research about my identity and reading things that felt affirming (like books and stuff, by trans/non binary authors) or listening to podcasts, educating myself about the concep of gender as a whole, so that I could clear my mind a little. 

Therapy is being very helpful as well, so if you have the chance to try it, I definitely recommend. It feels really comforting to be able to talk about your feelings openly without the fear of judgement. Make sure to find a gender therapist who knows what they’re doing ot at least a trans-friendly one tho.
I’m in the same boat, still thinking of being an imposter (even though I know I’m MTF) and a transition is nowhere in sight (due to my career and the fear of loosing my wife). I’m getting older (32 yo) and I don’t know what to do either. 

But I guess we have to take the time, listen to ourselves, and trusting the process of finding out what works best for us. We’ve been brainwashed by society to be one way and because we differ it takes time for us to figure out things. And seeing how long it takes me to figure it out myself, I start to letting go with others who I don’t expect to understand it if for me who is directly concerned it took a while…

Good luck Morgan! I’m sending you all the hugs possible, sister. We’ll go through it eventually 💪👩‍🦳
*hugs*
I’m sending you the biggest hug ever! Being unsupported is one thing, being mocked is another, and living in a giant transphobic cess pool of a state doesn’t help at all. 

1. Your feelings are valid and are subject to change as you dang well please..
2. Please don’t let the fact they hate themselves make you believe that their opinions are more valid than your own
3. You are loved. 
4. Still loved ❤️❤️❤️

Thanks for reaching out. You are much stronger than you know. Keep reaching out… we will hold you up if you feel like you can’t stand. This community is that freaking amazing !
I was born and raised in the Bible Belt. My family was disgusted with my transition as well and eventually they came around after a few years, but I never questioned that this is who I am. I recommend counseling or therapy to get your mind right. Much love ❤️
Hugs Morgan, hugs.  I know this so well.
Hugs from one Morgan to another ❤❤❤

Imposter syndrome is normal. So is dysphoria. Cis people don't have to question their gender identity and also don't regularly crave the opportunity to be seen as the opposite sex. And they definitely don't question it every 10 minutes lol. Feelings like yours are normal and don't make you any less valid as an individual.

Do make sure you stay safe, though. It sounds like you're in a less than good location to express yourself how you want. I would recommend trying to find some queer support groups or possibly looking into relocating. 

And don't forget that things will get better. As much of a cliche as it is, it's absolutely true. Stay strong sister ❤❤❤
I feel you. I'm having bad imposter syndrome tonight. I've been on E for 2 months, and know I'm on the right path. But I still feel like I'm a faker too. That I'm not actually committed to this, even though I don't see another way. I know for a fact that I won't make it much farther if I make myself live and age like a man (AMAB). I wish we didn't have to feel imposter syndrome. It freaking sucks.
I'll send hugs friend but I don't know what else to say I know how you feel somedays I begin to doubt my own transness and I don't even have friends for support. My mom only passively kind of supports me I know how you feel I'm sorry that you have to suffer like this my brain makes me feel like an impostor too.
Are we the only 2 non-cis Floridians?
Even 13 years into transition, I deal with this feeling. For me, I've found the biggest cause isn't a feeling of being an imposter but of being afraid of being accused of and attacked for being one. The ""not a real guy"" situation, of being viewed as something I'm not (a ""trap"") and being harmed. Knowing this has helped me a lot, because then I can direct my attention to working on social anxiety rather than trying to overcome a nonexistent sense of being fake (if I felt like I was faking being a man when I was a woman, I wouldn't have transitioned).

Hope this makes sense.
thankies 😔 it do be some hard times
girl power! all the good energy to you too, we’ll get thru this!!

Is this possible?, for context I haven't changed my ID sex, but it says female somehow. I haven't changed the name there either. (trans girl)		"If you have a female name and pass for female, I suppose it's possible whoever filled out the details for the ID card put an F without double-checking?
I have a cis male friend whose gender marker on his ID was switched to female by mistake. A happy accident maybe.
the system says : TRANS RIGHTS✨
Lucky girl!!
Es la F de  Fabulous ☺️☺️😅
I mean, that’s pretty cool I would definitely be careful especially if you didn’t legally change your information I don’t know how that’s supposed to work 
Like, I don’t know if you could get in trouble for using that ID even though it is legal it’s still not legally your name right now I guess
walk away and be happy
okay, so I actually went to get a state ID recently. they ask you for the sex you identify with instead of birth sex. that's why it would say female, they probably asked you how you identify.
Happened to me too! The lady put Female on my health card ID even though i filled in male. I like to think she did it on purpose to be an ally 💕
Sounds like a clerical error in your favour. Probs wouldn't tell them about the mistake or they may take it upon themselves to 'amend' their little mistake and reissue a new ID. >.>
It may seem lucky, but can totally turn out to be an issue. All of your documents can turn out to belong to a ""different person"" (diplomas, licenses etc.). When you change sex marker formally, you get (as far as I know) a certificate or smth, so you can prove that the ""past you"" and ""current you"" are the same identity. But if you don't have one, it seems like a problem. I personally would advise you to address the issue.

This is a huge win
Looks like you passed so well they auto assumed!!!! I think this means you don’t have to go through the work to change it tbh
Apparently your government found you out and supports you.
My trans girl ex had F on her ID so the DMV people just don't check sometimes. It'll still work everywhere dw , you're lucky for that!

Yes, I have a girl name, but I haven't changed my name in my ID yet, so I still don't know what happened.

I don't know, I'm freaking out cause what If that's not the sex in the government system???
Dhekvrke igual estoy preguntando para saber si está en el sistema o simplemente es un error de impresión
I still have my deadname in my ID, but I just booked a date to change my legal name and to also see what happened with the sex marker
The only reasonable response
Oh, okay. It still is also registered like that in the system or do I have to go to change.
:)
Yeah, I already booked a date to change my name and also to make sure it is registered like that in the system.

Girl, I'd like to help, but I'm not a Spanish teacher, I don't even know grammar in my lenguaje, I just read and write. Sorry
When I got my first permit the person put M by accident. I’m afab and didn’t know I was trans then.
Perhaps medical records were disclosed ?
My middle name was spelt wrong and I was listed  as a male. I’m a cis woman who breathes from her stomach so I just have the deepest, raspiest voice ever.

Surprisingly, never caused much issue. No governmental issues in Canada so far, I kind of gave up even changing all my misspelt middle names.
I am your walls
Are the walls around the town?
Muy loco, fijate de ir a consultar o si podes contactarte por mail
Es Casi Seguro que estas en el sistema, si no el carnet se abría generado con M, ya que en la mayoría de los casos no se puede editar el carnet manualmente sino se auto genera con un programa que depende de la base de datos.
Ok that’s cool
Cool, best of luck 🍀
I mean just talk to you in Spanish only if like. But that's ok ☺️. Thank you anyway 💖!
He knew
I really don't know, I think they just changed it cause I pass and I went to get my 17yo ID but also mentioned that I wanted to change my name.
Oh no, did you get your ID sex changed back ?
💀
They are everywhere and inside of everyone
Si, encerio no se que hacer
Ahh, okay. De todas formas voy a sacar turno en el registro civil para ver si está registrado así. De paso para cambiar el nombre ya que no pude la última vez.
❤️
Yes, but I’m sure it was easier for me since I had my birth certificate!!
Manda mail al RENAPER y conta tu situacion, si te dicen que esta asi en el sistema decile que no te lo cambien jsjs. No te preocupes, va a estar todo bien

My dad insulted me without even knowing it and I've thought about it almost everyday since.	"So, like a year ago I was laying on the floor in the living room cuddling with my dog and my parents were talking about something. I don't remember what but it somehow ended up about they/them pronouns. My dad says (all paraphrased because I don't remember exactly) ""They/them pronouns do not make grammatical sense and if someone says he wants to use them, I will not."" My mom, clearly disagreeing with him, looks at me, looks back at him and says ""If Jester wanted to use they/them pronouns, would you use them?"" (she doesn't know, I was just used as an example) My dad laughed said no. Back then, I hadn't come to terms with my identity and thought of myself as a cis male so I didn't think much of it at the time. But now when I'm in the closet as a non binary person wanting to use they/them pronouns, it really hurts. As I said before in a post here, I wanna come out to them but after what my dad said...it scares me. I think he probably won't use my pronouns. I'm just tired of internalizing this and needed to put it somewhere and if you are someone who is experiencing something similar, then I wish the best for you and you will always be accepted by someone out there (and also me). Thanks for reading."	"I'm sorry, my parents are the same way. I wish we didn't have to hide. 

As for them not making sense it's like fish. I caught 1 fish, I caught 2 fish.

I have a friend, I have known them for years. They like cats. 

&#x200B;

IT WORKS. 

&#x200B;

Why are parents like this...

&#x200B;

Sorry for the vent.

Best wishes comrade
Parents need to be more careful with how they talk about queer people around their kids. Cuz some of us are queer and they don't know and that shit sticks in a kids head for a long time. As a parent they have a responsibility to love and support their child no matter what gender they are or who they love. 

*This was the important part, now how I relate to this story, through my own story, feel free to skip*

I don't think I'll ever forget or forgive when my mother made her comments about how trans women are ""just men in dresses"" and much, much worse. I grew up being told that she loves me unconditionally and we could always talk about everything, but when I heard her say that and more, it was the final piece of the puzzle making me realise that this has over the years become progressively less and less true. And there was a time where I firmly believed that it was true. That shit hurts so bad. Every day I walk on eggshells, knowing that if she knew the real me, living at home would become even more toxic.

I just wish she never got that damn facebook account, that site almost single handedly destroyed the kind, empathetic person that I knew her as. It's like losing my mother even though we live in the same house, I feel robbed.
Sorry about what your dad said, at least you mother sounds like she'd be supportive
Show your dad the dictionary definition of they. It has been used as a singular pronoun for ages. Your dad is not very smart.
I think your dad loves you more than grammar (even tho it's grammatically correct)
My dad used to be homophobic and later regretted it because none of his kids are straight he regrets how he acted and is super supportive never underestimate people's ability to change, and remember he will always be your dad and he loves you and I'm sure he would change his mind if you talked to him about it
I think it would be really helpful to come out to your mother first (as she seems rather supportive) and then eventually when you are comfortable coming out to your father and he makes the ""it's not correct"" point just tell him that you and your mom have been using they/them for you for x amount of time and he didn't ever question it because it's not wrong.
I know im 14 yo and im a enby girl but i can be your new dad
If it makes you feel better, i used to think the same way as your father, back when i was a man. I now use she/they pronouns. People can change, its just extra scary with parents because the immense power they wield over you
Using they for somebody is grammatically correct though
I'm very sorry you experienced this OP, it really sucks. I was used to my very religious father regularly going off in tangents about how much queer, trans, and NB folks are an affront to God. As a result I haven't talked to him in over a year now. And honestly it's all for the better. If you're able to be yourself and safe around folks who you can trust I recommend doing so, and I hope your dad manages to come around in time.
He might change his mind, right now in its mind it's theoretical, so it's maybe not something he really thought about. 
I remember one night were my father was quite drunk he said that his sons could be anything, murderer, thief, etc... he would still love them, but not if they were gay.
Now at the time he didn't know I was Bi, and I've still not came out to the family, but let's just say that one time I have had a little something with a man and someone in the family found out, and talked.
So it's basically the worst kept secret of the family. 
Some talked to me about it (not in any bad way), most pretend to not know, including my father.
Anyway since then he has dropped a lot of hints that he respect LGBT people and I know he has been trying his best to understand these things. 
Most homophobic, transphobic, etc, people are just men that have like no knowledge about the subject and say things like that because it's ""cool"" in their circle to not like people that are out of the norm.
Once it becomes something that matter to someone they love tho, if they have half a brain and are half a decent human being, they start looking at it with a different eye.
The axe forgets what the tree remembers.
Here's a fun thing, ""You"" is grammatical plural. The singular form is ""Thee"". The singular form fell out of use and the plural form became both singular and plural. Language changes, they and them are the same way. Once upon a time they were only plural but our grammatical use of them is evolving to the point where they can be used in the singular.
As shitty as this

He’s also wrong about the grammar
[deleted]
This exact same thing happened to me, I feel you
My parents did the same thing. One day i overheard them talking, and my dad said something like ""there are only two genders, and anyone who thinks they can change their birth gender is just an attention whore"". It hurts so bad to know that if he knew who i truly was he wouldn't accept me.
Thanks for the kind words. The ironic thing is I literally heard him use they/them pronouns for someone in the same conversation! Life is hard.
Thank you for sharing your story, it takes a lot of confidence to talk about this sorta thing and I feel bad that you have to hide who you really are to your mom.  If you ever wanna talk about it more or about something else, I am here along with so many others.
Thank you, knowing my mom, I feel she would totally support me.
(pulls up Tim and Moby pronoun video)
This kind of thinking is kinda toxic. Maybe you're right, but to me it sounds like parents who hit their kids and then say ""you know I love you right!?"". Extreme example I know, but a lot of parents don't love their kids because of stupid shit like this. No offense
Thanks for the advice. I've been thinking about that for awhile and I know that my mom would support me. Thank you again for the advice.
Aight sign me up
Thanks for sharing your story and who knows, maybe he will accept me. It's just sorta scary when it's a parent.
The ironic thing is I literally heard him use they/them pronouns for someone in the same conversation.
Thank you for sharing your story and I am lucky to have tons of lgbt friends online and irl who would definitely accept me, and hey, you never know, maybe I'll get more lucky and he will be able to change his viewpoint. Once again, thanks for sharing your story, that must of took tons of confidence.
Thanks for sharing your story and yeah I agree with you. Maybe he will accept me but so far, everything is hypothetical because I haven't come out yet. We'll never know until I try I guess.
Story of my life
Cool fact! Maybe I'll end up saying that when I come out lol
And he gets annoyed when I use incorrect grammer smh
Thanks for sharing your story and I'm sorry your parents think this way. Being trans is 100% not a mental illness. Once again thanks for sharing and happy early birthday.
Wow. Brick levels are off the charts. Was he dropped on his head as a child?

In all seriousness if you ever need someone I'll listen
That's good
Maybe you should just come out to her then. Ive had multiple friends only come out to one parent in fear of the other not excepting them and it has worked for all of them
I see both sides of the argument but the real answer is something we just won't know until I come out, it's just hypothetical at this point but I appreciate both of you sharing your views.
also jester's a swag ass name btw
I doubt he always uses correct grammar

Also, grammar rules do not define language but describe it. If common language is no longer grammatically correct then the description needs updating
You're totally right. I wish you the best of luck!!
Thanks, I asked my friend for a username and he just sent a clown emoji, so I was like ""jokes on you I can make that a kinda ok username!"" And that's how Jester was born."	u60sw3	trans	170	0.95	2022-04-18 00:56:38
I used to feel like I was transgender but no longer do.	Before I get started I want to say that I fully support the trans community and in no way does my experience invalidate others. It is also not a valid excuse to make, I was just wondering from other trans peoples experiences why they think this may have happened. So I am a female person and I'd say from the age of about 10 to 19 or even longer I felt that I was FTM transgender basically as soon as I even knew it was a thing I started to feel more like I was trans. I remember also feeling like more as a boy when I was younger just never expressed it out of fear. So much so that I had dysphoria especially about my chest area. I even went to a doctor to make an appointment to go to see a gender reisinment therapist. I watched countless videos of different trans people of all different identities and learned a lot about the the transgender experience. I was even thinking about ordering binders and had a name for myself which I still get associated as by a very small group of people. I remember over the course of a couple months or so I just sort of stopped feeling transgender. I did grow up in a very conservative home and community and part of it may be fear. I am also a very deeply Christian person and I've been told many times by my peers that its incorrect. I still very actively watch informational videos on trans topics. I was wondering from the perspective of other people within the community why they think this may have happened? Sorry this is so long it's been only mind for awhile and needed to get it off my chest.	"Imagine your community would not judge you for transitioning. You wouldn't face any social consequences for it, everyone would respect you as a man and use your male name and pronouns.

Would you want to transition then?

If yes, you're probably still trans, it's fear of your community that is keeping you in the closet. That fear is a powerful motivator to convince yourself of some alternative explanation.

If no, maybe you aren't trans. You don't have to do anything. Maybe still talk to a therapist because I doubt 9 years of dysphoria came from nowhere.
From reading your replies to other people, you could be trans, but you have repressed it. I've seen this happen with transfem & transmasc with a religious background. They push back their feelings for the fear of judgement and hatred of their community and family, or they are told it is 'wrong', supposedly. Most often both. You are religious, so I will do my best not to talk down onto religion.. *But they are wrong.* It isn't incorrect, religion is seeped in control, LGBT-phobia and imposing onto you what is right and wrong. Religion should not be about fear, but about faith.

Of course, it is fine if you think that you are not trans, but as others have stated; If you could choose to be male, your answer, even with slight hesitation is still *yes.* You say that you have had dysphoria for over *9 years.* This doesn't come out of nowhere.

So, OP, I am not here to convince you that you are trans. Because that is something for you to discover about yourself. But decide whether you want to live for other people, or live for-yourself-.
hey, this sounds exactly like what happened to me.

i remember watching so many trans ftm videos when i was 14 and being obsessed with passing as a boy, but pressure to be more feminine and not being sure what my church would think made me repress it and try to “appreciate being a girl”.

i managed to convince myself that i wasn’t really trans, and thought of myself as cis for years.

until a few months ago, where, after some introspection and reflection, dysphoria suddenly started piling up like crazy and i broke my egg; i’m a trans boy and i always was, i just failed to see it.

i don’t know how much this applies to you, so take it with a grain of salt, but my trans past that i repressed eventually caught up to me; maybe the same will happen for you.
I went through many stages myself, at 14 I started feeling like a lesbian, which I didn't really understand how to deal with, given that I was amab. Around age 20 I first managed to overcome my fear of being different, and I started thinking I was trans. Three years later I decided that I was trans, because I felt so many of those feminine traits take over my mind, and I needed to do something to align what I felt with reality. I started slowly transitioning until a year or so ago it finally landed. I'm non-binary. The thing is, I misinterpreted my femininity as being MtF when in reality it was more akin to a strong feeling that I was *very not* male. Once that clicked, I felt better and more at ease. You see, it's easy to only see MtF or FtM and then ignore identities like bigender, genderfluid or non-binary, because they can be a bit more difficult to wrap your head around, but for me it clicks way more now.

The way I figured it out was by trying to figure out what I wanted to look like. See, I've always had relationships, and when you're with somebody and you're planning a future, normally people self-insert. I never did, in my mind the image of myself in the future was always greyed out, as if I was waiting for my self image to click one day. Well, when I finally got past gender identity and all of that, I could see an image. It may sound superficial, but I'm a fairly slim androgynous person whenever I think about future me. Weird details like, how I want to have a flat chest, but I also want to appear androgynous leaning on feminine, along with what sort of clothes I want to wear, or rather what style I have. I can see these things clearly now that I've embraced being enby.

So if I could give any advice it would be to picture yourself in a future. What do you look like, and does it align with your decision?

That said, I don't believe you have to look a certain way to be non-binary. But I was never comfortable with the societal image of femininity. Skirts, wanting a petite frame with curves, etc. Things that seemingly the majority of trans girls identify with. I would see those posts and just completely not relate. I would tell my girlfriend that I couldn't see myself as a woman but that I felt like one, and I didn't know what that meant.

Hope this helps.
I kinda had this when I was 27. Started to transition, then stopped cause I ""didn't feel trans."" Now I'm 35 and have been on hrt for a couple months. Sometimes I kick myself for not doing it 8 years ago, but most of the time... im just happy I finally figured it out.
If there was a button that magically made you a man would you press it? (It would make you male from birth, so no hate from it)
When you get older many things about yourself and your environment keep changing, this could lead to feeling different than before and some things that mattered to you a lot might not be that important anymore.

I think the difference between being male or female is the strongest while being a teen so that might could have lead to feeling the way you do now.


I would recommend you to still buy the binder and other things you wanted to, wearing that and wearing the right clothes to that might kick off some euphoria again


Despite that, always remember to see the Bible as something to interpret in your own way instead of taking it ore the interpretation of others literally
Jesus loves trans people.

Don't let the bible's message of love and kindness be overshadowed by religions message of fire and brimstone.

&#x200B;

Jesus hated organized religion for this exact reason. Power corrupts.
I was the same but I thought I was MtF but I think I just have a feminine side but not trans. It’s hard to explain but I understand you
There is no shame if getting it wrong the first time. Something that helped me figure things out, is that “if something “feels right” you are most likely not faking it. And from there you can build up”
the most important thing is that you pursue what is best for you.

i have no doubt what you wrote will cause you to catch incredible hate from this community though.
So, I can relate to this. I've learned that dysphoria and euphoria (and even the feeling of being trans) can come in waves. I've also learned that as you get older, if you don't act on or explore these feelings, those waves of dysphoria can get stronger and stronger, and come more frequently. 


When I first came out to myself, I felt euphoric and confident in my decision. After a couple weeks, I felt way less sure about it. Feelings of doubt crept in. Since then I've gotten better at dealing with those feelings. But the thing is, at the end of the day, I'm still trans. Reading what you wrote, and reading some of your comments, it sounds like you might be too. But you also might be gender fluid! It's a very wide spectrum lol.
I’ve had some moments where I doubted myself as being trans. Upon deeper reflection I realized it was coming from a place of extreme anxiety about being ostracized by the world. 

It happened after I started transitioning. Now that I was actually being open about my feelings and doing something about it it became real. All the fears associated with that had me trying so desperately to convince myself that this couldn’t be my reality. 

It would be too hard, it’s too dangerous, my life has already been hell growing up in the closet, what if this just makes it even worse. 

I spent weeks agonizing over it, then had a dream about growing up and being supported as my true gender and feeling immense peace. My true self knows who she is. She’s always known, and now I am giving voice and expression to that little girl who had to hide so long ago. I  found out later in life that my catholic school tried to hold me back in 1st and 2nd grade because I “acted too much like a girl” and that was a sign of “immaturity”
In a world with absolutely no judgment I have no doubt in my mind that I would still want to transition.
I'd definitely press the button a couple years ago now I would give it some thought and most likely yes I would press the button.
no one is being hateful towards them???
Sounds like you're definitely trans, that's just incredibly inconvenient in your current situation.

You should talk to the gender therapist. They might be able to help you come up with a plan regarding what you can do.
That means you‘re trans- maybe you repressed it a bit because you didn’t want to deal with the intolerance of your community. I wish you the best of luck with however you decide to go forwards
I was in a similar situation a long time but I did not feel ok. I (AMAB NB) tried to push it down because I was afraid of closed doors and discrimination, and I felt unnecessarily ashamed. But that gender dysphoria didn't improve with time...

 I ultimately didn't transition until I moved to Colorado where I could feel safe and comfortable enough to be myself. I moved from North Florida - trans folks aren't super welcomed there by many. I wasn't sure my parents would support me (they did over adjustment, they/them was tough for them after 3 decades). My FTM husband had abusive conservative adoptive parents he fled from in college, and then he transitioned here as well. 

You sound like you're in your egg. I don't blame or judge you for it, because I was in one too. You will decide to come out when you are ready. Just remember you can only decide to be yourself, but you cannot decide how others perceive you. Coming out is disruptive for conservative families, and can splinter them along supportive/non-supportive lines. Coming out has taught me incredible patience with people. It is awkward with old reintroductions to school or work peers and having to explain the change, but I don't feel like I am always lying to everyone about myself anymore. 

I don't know you, but I know this for myself: since coming out, I don't feel like I am wearing a mask in public anymore. I hope you feel safe and comfortable to exist as you are someday. If you want to see what it is like to live in a place where you can be yourself without fear, obtain trans treatment, medication, and/or surgery fully supported, and where there are pride flags all over the place, apply for grad school or jobs in Denver and Boulder. It's queer af here, and we even have a gay governor rn
You can’t judge whether someone is trans based on comparing their fear of the consequences of transitioning compared to their desire to transition. The consequences are fluid, they will differ vastly from person to person.
that's good. 
folks on this sub have not always been so kind to those who raise the issues they did.
This seems like a really bad case of r/egg_irl
Also know this, you can still be trans even if you don’t suffer from dysphoria as much as you did years before. Im like that where in my heart i know I’m a trans woman but i struggled with it because i thought i was no longer trans when my dysphoria wasnt as bad as it was during my childhood and adolescence."	mytwg3	trans	164	0.98	2021-04-26 09:39:41

You look amazing 🤩 How long did it take for your beard to come in? I've only been on T 43 days and am dying for mine to fill in like that

Lookin great!!!!!
Your look reminded me instantly of Celldweller. I don't know if that means much to you, but that's what it is in my brain and it's good stuff.
No doubt.  Like something out of Street Fighter!
Thank you!!!
I started my beard after maybe 6 months on T...keep going bro...good things come with time...
Hey man...feel free to chat
Thanks man...
Apologies...just realized...you are a woman...
But not everyone wants to pass and we shouldn't have to feel like we need to adapt to gender roles and act/blend in with cis people.
Thank you!!!
Not sure what that/who is...I’m brand new here...I appreciate your response...feel free to dm or provide me with more info...
Cool. I've got what I call the 14 year old boy beard atm 😆 you're right about the good things coming eventually. I waited 37 years to start my transition so five months is nothing.
Thanks dude 😊
Yeah sorry, it has to do with my specific music taste and doesn't really necessarily have to do specifically with this community. I just instantly thought ""Hey that guy has similar hair to the Celldweller guy"" and impulsively commented.
I understand that wait I was late 30s when I started as well...
All good...so introduce this to me...I love new music and ideas...tell me more...
Ok so Celldweller is one of the many aliases of Klayton (seriously, this guy produces music under at least 5 names, it can be a bit ridiculous). Celldweller is my favorite of the aliases as it focuses on a fusion of EDM and industrial rock. My personal favorite album of his is End of an Empire. But Offworld is a good softer experience as well.
Sounds really good...I’m into industrial...I’ll check it out...thanks!!!"	lditd8	trans	153	0.99	2021-02-05 22:16:18
Double standards for cis and trans women	So there’s something that’s been absolutely EATING at me. There’s this absolutely gorgeous trans woman on TikTok who has a boob gap and because she’s openly trans she received absolutely horrible relentless bullying about it calling her botched saying that it was clear she’s a trans woman(she’s very passing and if she didn’t say anything no one would even notice) to the point she couldn’t take it and the comments caused her to have such bad dysphoria she had a second revision surgery that probably cost a whole lot. This morning Lili Reinhart who has the same body type as that absolutely gorgeous woman posted a photo and what do you know she has a boob gap identical to the for-mentioned trans woman not a single comment mentioned Lili being botched unnatural not a single person even cared. I hate the way trans woman are put under a microscope on every little thing that can possibly be deemed as masculine and criticized. Psa for Cis men boobs don’t look like porn and anime ever they have gaps hair bigger boobs sag etc etc y’all transphobia is showing	"TikTok is hell on Earth. I hope she's okay :(
You mean... boobs don't defy gravity???? ;m;
What's a boob gap?
Can we ask who the trans is?  Want to go be supportive.
It's not just a double standard, it's a thin excuse for people to be transphobic, This is why I insist on telling people never to focus on ""passing"", as it's dictated by transphobes more than anything, and the goal post is always moved to justify ridiculing you anyways.

To the point where most cis women these days have stories about some transphobe aggressively and hatefully misgendering for something depressingly common like being taller than 5'10"", having a deep voice, or even not having a feminine posture! It's absurd, and sexist on top of being transphobic.

That's just trying to pass in public, it's another thing altogether when people ""know"" before judging you. One could drive themselves insane hacking their body to bits trying to placate these demands, and you could never be an extreme and perfect enough representation of a woman to make them happy.
I've tried to explain this to my partner from the get go. There is no reason she shouldn't have leg hair when my pre-T AFAB body has the same amount as hers.
I, too, have a boob gap. Wish I didn't have boobs to gap but I do, and.... What you all face is just horrid.

So many people who don't pass are heavenly gorgeous still, but no, society must pick even on passing women just to make sure they're not *showing any signs of anything not completely boiled-egg biogirl*.

Cis women get ""accused"" of being trans for being too tall or slender. First of all, that shows how absolutely bonkers it all is, and how misinformed about women's bodies in general. Secondly, apparently it matters so so much for someone to NOT be trans to some people that the level of nitpicking is insane. Literally insane, looking for things that aren't there.
Seriously are there boobs out there that DON'T have a gap!!?! Bras or attire make the boobs together (like this is my experience with all genders). Right?! 

I am so sorry for this weird double standard. I've always been told my boobs were weird in every relationship except my current one because they didn't live up to some weird porn standard and I hate the idea people out there are using this as an excuse to be transphobic. The transwoman you referred to is literally drop dead gorgeous
Oh yeah trans woman get judged to hell and back. You have to be LITERALLY perfect lol or ur getting made fun of
From her most recent post it seems like she really took the comments to heart and barely anyone is making her feel better by explaining that it’s normal and people are idiots. Apparently she’s trying to get a revision and people are telling her the Dr messed up and I just feel so bad because that’s not true
Exactly
probably when your boobs have a gap in between them. which, you know, most natural boobs do.
^ this

Yeah, trans are held to different standards and it blows :-/
A space in between your boobs they aren’t touching any way but some women have more space
@kelly_kadigan it looks like she hasn’t had the revision yet but she’s trying to and she’s forcing herself to wear a clearly painful bra that pushes her chest together now. I hope she sees my comment about lili because she deserves better
Oh you're not wearing a bra? Not a real girl

Cis girls who don't wear bras: exist

Oh you're not shaving your armpits? Not a real girl

Cis girls who don't shave their armpits: exist

I'm just existing as my authentic self, I'm not trying to attract men Karen what do I care what you did to find a husband I don't see you harassing cis lesbians on this

Not directed at you just piggy backing off your comment
Damn, I was hoping mine would *that is if they grow big enough to even do that*
Ah thanks. Yeah always seemed pretty normal to me
Oh, yeah i dated a woman with that i guess. Didn't realize it was a thing or that people cared about it
I used to follow her, she looks great
It depends if they are pretty small yeah they sit perky but if they are bigger sometimes they sag and it’s absolutely ok

Cutting everyone I know off	"
I should probably see a therapist about this and plan to do so. But for context I (20tF) live in the South with (very) (and I mean very) (like “gay people will burn in the fiery pits of the underworld” and “trans people don’t exist”) (like will call a priest to pray the gay out of you, I’m not kidding they’ve done it before. I don’t think they’re above conversion therapy) conservative hispanic parents. The entirety of my extended family might disagree on a few things but something they all agree on is “if you’re gay, you will go to hell. If you’re trans— lol trans people don’t exist; shock therapy for you.” If you’re hispanic or have hispanic friends you’re probably familiar with how aggressively misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic they are. 

It pains me because, you know, I love my family. I’ve always been somewhat of a spoiled kid. My parents have been great, if like very overprotective. Now after years of grappling with my identity as a whole I came to terms with the fact that I’m transgender. I then spent countless hours doing my research on what it means to be trans, affirmative consent HRT as well as picking a name and basically devised a plan. 

I’m going to start HRT soon and in about a year and-a-half I will move to California and start presenting there. I will delete all my social media accounts, get a new number, basically ghost everyone I currently know. I don’t have a lot of friends down here so it’s not that hard to leave my comfort zone. I’ve also already been living on my own for a year so I know I can pull off living on my own. But like, is it fair to my parents? Like just disappearing off the face of the Earth? And no, I can’t come out to them, they don’t react well to their kids coming out to them (i.e. the aforementioned “pray the gay away” thing) I just wanted to hear your thoughts. thanks c:"	"The greatest way to honor your parents is to live a happy and fulfilling life. I don't know if they'll ever come to appreciate that, but it's what you gotta do. Get out there and be yourself!
Fortune favors the bold.  Throw caution to the wind and come to Cali, we love you already.  If you're ever up north in Cali, hit me up and we'll meet up for dinner and drinks or something. 

Love and light, sister.  Good luck; best wishes!
The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.

Friends and chosen relationships are whats more important.
You pick your relationships, not told what they are.

Its a parent's duty to love their child unconditionally, and hopefully they come to realize that. Regardless, you will know wholeheartedly how to treat your children better.
No judgment here; I literally did the same thing. My family is not quite that conservative (although my mom gets deeper into the fox news brain rot the longer she stays in the southeast) and it was the best decision I ever made! I hope California is good to you!
I think once you have moved, and are safe, give them the chance... but don't do it until you feel safe.

You don't actually owe your family anything, but it feels like you have some conflict on it, and are already prepared for the worst case. Once you moved, let them know, and then at least that pain wont be in limbo.
Literally anything a child died is fair to their parents.

I've only sorta been where you at. Like I've ghosted my family, but I did it in the liberal socialist utopia of the left coast.

I'll tell you it ain't easy. But it's worth it. It's better to die as someone you are than to live as someone you're not.
I moved 3000 miles to get away from my misogynistic, phobic fascist religious family. Never looked back. 

I started E with the new year and am doing better than ever before, and they will NEVER see me again. They showed me who they are, and that means they will never get the privilege of seeing who I am. 

They wouldn’t even fucking recognize me anyways.
Good. Fjnd your own path, and remember, the only obligations are to yourself, much love!!
I think you have a really good plan, but own thing I thought of and I wanted to mention in case you hadnt thought of it, is if you are taking a car to Cali with you, make sure its in your name. All my friends who cut-off their families eventually ran into the issue of their parents technically owning their car and threatening to report it as stolen if they didnt come back. You sound like a very strong person whether you think you are or not and you can do this, good luck out there! :D
You shouldn't feel bad about it, you are doing what's safest for you there is 0 things wrong with that.
i fully support your plan! however, i suggest finding somewhere other than California, seeing as Cali is exorbitantly expensive. Oregon or Washington is still higher cost of living, but considerably less than Cali. western Washington is known for being progressive, though i'm not certain about Oregon. 
i wish you luck in your journey!!
It's your life you must be true to yourself not to your parents, don't believe all what they say about family first and that kind of stuff, if they are not letting you be yourself cutt them off.
Truer words are rarely spoken.  Even if they don't overtly agree with your actions, being true to yourself and living a happy and full life will always honor those who came before moreso than living an empty, hollow existence of which they've approved.
when i let them know it will shatter them. like my mom will probably cry for days. they’ll claim i somehow did something to them. they threw a fit when i first moved out, i can’t begin to imagine their reaction to this
But won’t you cutting all ties with them also hurt? If you come out to them, you are at least giving them a chance to be better parents. 

I mean, no pressure, if you think it will be horrible for you to go through all of it, don’t. But don’t do it for the sake of your parents. Their pain is the result of their own phobias. Being trans and out is not a pain causing thing."	w2f71c	trans	156	0.98	2022-07-19 00:47:29
my parents will not respect my identity as being trans (vent)	"Yep, im sorry to say im venting again, but i need to get this off my chest 

So I'm out to my parents as trans, and i recently talked to one about me using a new name, and we agreed on a name (Rowanna). He also talked about taking me shopping for feminine clothes and coming out to my family. Sounds great right? Well you'd be right if he actually did that.

He hasn't used my correct name or pronouns once since that conversation, keeps saying stuff like ""you can't just change in a day"", and keeps making stuff up for when i can be called my name and pronouns.

He has told 2 or 3 people about me being trans, but I'm not too sure about that, or if he will actually talk to other people about it.

And he has said he'll take me shopping, but hasn't said anything about buying feminine clothes.

I'm just so fed up of my parents saying they'll do stuff, but then they don't, i just want to die right now."	"In my experience, someone who is 100% wrong on name/pronouns then defends themselves when corrected is not actually trying. Just trying to keep the peace. I get mistakes happen, but your dad isn't even trying if you ask me.
Like I can get behind ""can't change in a day"" business if any progress was shown otherwise. I'm so sorry thats like that.
My Mom never used my new name and never used ""she/Her"" but I knew she loved me which was more than many people have. It's the love that is important, not the details. Try to remember that when you feel frustrated. <3
Hey
I completely understand your frustration but it’s going to be okay!
Atleast he agreed to using a new name, taking you shopping and all the other stuff. That makes your parents a lot more supportive than many other trans kids out there. And i’m in no way trying to minimise your problem by telling you that it’s worse for others, but just try to appreciate the progress of being accepted for a bit… You’ll get there and you’ll be yourself very soon.
Ask him if anyone... ***anyone***... had any problem addressing your mother as ""Mrs NewLastName"" when he married her... *so what's his problem?*

This would be an excellent opportunity to employ the Air Horn technique:

To, ahm, HELP him... get a marine air horn at Walmart (maybe $5) and: 1) tell him you're going to help him do better; 2) when he mis-names you, BLAST... it for two full seconds... (that's a *very* long time when you're listening to an air horn!); 3) afterwards, whenever you have a conversation with him, set it on the table.

*Problem solved.*
Ive asked my dad to use my new name and (she/her) pronouns a few weeks ago but he hasn't started using them yet and im not sure why, but im too afraid to ask again, he also said its kind of hard in a way but i do know he still loves and is supporting me in most ways. But it would be nice to be called my new name and pronouns to feel better and kinda knock my dysphoria down a bit.
It does take a while for parents to make that shift in their head. I would try to be patient because it sounds like you are able to talk to him about this which is a lot better than my family. Just like it takes us a while to feel comfortable and secure in ourselves, it will take some time for him to accept things as well.
[removed]
Yh, he said he would use my name and pronouns, but hasnt actually said when and hasnt done yet, and uses ""it doesnt happen overnight as an excuse""
He keeps saying stuff like that while not actually doing anything, its just hard to carry on sometimes when im just straight up lied to pretty much
I just wish they were more understanding and supportive of me, since they are gay themselves
The details are extremely important when they hurt the people who you refuse to pay attention to the details for. When someone is literally wanting to die because you decide not to spend the time to even try that's not love. If someone loves you they don't want you to be in pain. I'm all for ""give them a little time"" if someone's genuinely trying, and I'm even fine if you personally are fine with your family misgendering and deadnaming you, but in a world where one of the  *leading causes of death* for youth is suicide and trans people are *4 times* more at risk, a risk caused predominantly by unsupportive families, ***how dare you*** act like OP or anyone should just suck it up when their family doesn't put in the effort to respect them?
Unfortunately the details do matter.Real love is unconditional,its a force to be reckoned with. When you truly have unconditionally love for someone you will try your hardest to not harm them.Deadnaming someone and using the wrong pronouns causes **mental harm** for some that leads to death or SH.We can not change who we are so it is up to them to support us.

This does not mean they have to agree with our decision but it does mean supporting us.*Unless they have an excuse like brain issues that have to do with memory or understanding certain things which means they can't support even if wanted to*

For example :
I have food adversions and texture issues due to my autism.My main protein source has to be meat ( Usually chicken because its a safe food ).I physically and mentally can not handle not eating meat.Do you think my vegan roommate agrees with my decision? Probably not.They might not even understand why i need to eat meat but they support me.They even cook meat for me.Supporting me in a decision I cannot change.


These two issues are not completely similar but the point is the same.Please do not promote the narrative that this behavior is okay or should be accepted.
He may've agreed and said he'd do it, but it doesn't necessarily means he'll do it unfortunately :(
Bruh i have 2 dads my surname is double barrelelled
Im from the uk so no walmart
Honestly, the best thing to do is talk with them, parents  usually find it hard, but you just have to give them a little push
Maybe so, but if a parent is trying and trying to make that shift, they won't be defending themselves when corrected and making 0 effort.
Im not very good at this stuff but maybe
 explaining slowly and calmly about how youve been feeling, and to say to keep it quiet until you want to expand on it
Sounds like he’s just using it as an excuse to not try.
Smh kinda the same with my family. They keep saying that but no progress is made. I feel this
I wished it often too. I do understand but try to see the big picture. ❤️
They are supportive, i just dont think they are either putting in effort or caring, which hurts when they are your own family, and they said they would correctly name and pronoun you
Well, THAT information changed the equation!  How very interesting!

My advice still stands tho - an airhorn is so truly obnoxious that in most cases, it only takes it being used twice, maybe three times... before a parent or other who is ""having trouble remembering"" bc ""I've called you thus and such *for so long*""... suddenly *gets over* not addressing one correctly.

Just saying.
Well it sounds like the only defense he's made is ""you can't change in a day"" which to me, sounds like a completely reasonable statement for a parent to make in this situation. If that continues for a long time though, then that's not good.
I hope it goes well for you, i wish you the best of luck
Yeah, i just wish i could be respected for who i am
Imo the big picture of your parents loving you doesn't really mean much it that doesn't extend to who you really are, only to how they see you.
Its just the fact of them saying they love and support me, but then they dont support me
Yh, i might just start doing stuff till they respect my name
I guess ill just have to wait and see
Thx
I would just keep correcting him. He may come around once he realizes you aren’t goin to just forget about it. You could start misgendering him.
I disagree but each to their own opinion. I'm just saying be careful picking the hill you want to die on. Are pronouns and names more important than family? In my world, no, but your mileage may vary. I chose not to make an issue of it. I did however tell my Mom that unless she did so when we were out in public that I couldn't go to dinner etc. with her and I stuck to my guns. Good luck to you all. I hope it all works out for everyone. <3
Yeah... it's a big difference. My parents ""support"" me by trying to help me remember how good it is to be a man and change my mind. And they love the idea of me that acts exactly like they tell it to.
If you ***expect*** respect; you'll get it.  It works that way.
I can't imagine valuing family over your own self worth
Bruh idealy i should be able to love my family while they love me for who i am, which means, respecting my identity by using my name and pronouns
You're being binary. All I'm saying is there is a middle ground. If your self worth is paramount in your life then divorce your parents, get a job, and live your own life. Its up to you. If your family is totally non-supportive then, fine, dump them, but the OP's family does not sound like a bunch of jerks. They just seem slow at getting the message. I'm saying don't be a child and stomp your feet. Make things work. Keep correcting them and if that doesn't work then get out of the house by becoming self sufficient and live your life as your true self.

I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this	"Recently my mom started calling me ""girl"" more often than usual, as in following literally anything she says to me with that word (I'm FtM). It's clearly obvious that she wants me to detransify (if that's how you call it?) and it's also obvious (to me at least) that if she keeps this up I'll ""maybe have the impression that I have the identity that she chose for me"" or something.

I'm so damn tired of this. So. Much. If I try to speak to her about it she'll throw transphobic nonsense at me, such as ""you're just playing a theatre role but your acting is awful"" and everytime it happens I get sh thoughts and instantly throw aside everything good in life.

My parents have no idea how badly I want to move out. I only have 2 and a half years until I'm legally allowed to move out and I really don't want to look back and remember all the things that hurt and sting instead of literally anything that brings me joy, ESPECIALLY from my family.

I don't want to feel alone in this world. Not now. Not never..."	"I'm so sorry your mother is being such an incredible jerk to you, that really sucks.

I wish more parents accepted their kids for who they are, instead of wanting to force them to be little ""mini-mes"" they control.

2 more years of her being awful is so fucling hard, I'm so sorry. Hopefully you can move out sooner, and find better people, a better family, a found family that actually supports you and loves you for who you are.
You are not alone,we are here,if your family doesn't accept you,then,we'll ne your new family ! Frick these transphobe,they can go burn in hell.if only people could understand their child become who they want at a certain age.
Sorry. Try to tough it out. You’re doing good and people care about you.
If you otherwise have a decent relationship with her, maybe tell her just that. “Mom, I’m planning on moving out in just a little over two years.  This really isn’t how I want to remember my last time living with you - I want to look forward to visiting, not dread it. Please, stop this.”

💜💜💜
*”the identity that she chose for me”*


Is she aware that this isn’t something she could’ve chosen when irregardless of whether or not you’re trans?
I'd mix up Mom and Dad, every single time and then correct myself every time ""oh, I'm sorry I meant mom they're both parental roles, you know what I meant 😜""

I'm the kind of person that if I'm forced to take their crap they better damn well be ready to get a plate full of their own crap right back at them.

 And if they can't handle it well I guess those tough Gen X's and boomers aren't as tough as they think they are. And I'd make sure to let them know.

Sorry, I put myself in your shoes and I projected my own feelings, because it really upset me. Life of an empath.
 
Don't let the bullshit get to you, show them their thoughts don't matter, and persevere!

Keep on keeping on.
I'm stuck in the same spot. Ever since my parents and grandmother found out I'm trans, they've been calling me a girl and misgendering me on purpose. Even my dad, who I thought was okay with it. I try to ignore them but goddamn it hurts, especially when it's coming from your supposed 'guardians'. I really can't wait to get out of this house. I just want to forget all of them and live a whole new life where I am allowed to be me without all this. Yeah, sometimes they start getting too much and it gets a bit too hard to resist the urge to listen to the >!suicidal!< thoughts. So yeah...you aren't alone. But we'll get through this. Just gotta keep going, ya know? There will be a point in life where this situation is nothing but a distant nightmare. People are shit sometimes, just gotta get through life while dealing with them. I'll be here if you wanna talk bro, might help to talk to someone in your shoes.
First of all, I am very sorry that you are being treated like that. You don’t deserve that. 

Second of all, times have really changed since I was growing up. You are incredibly brave for coming out at all before you are an adult. I did not transition until my 30s even though I knew since I was around 5/6. I didn’t even know any openly gay or lesbian people growing up. It really gives me hope for the future. I know it’s hard. 

While your family may eventually come around on their own when they realize they will probably lose contact with you otherwise, you can’t control if/when they do. Don’t waste your time trying to argue with them or convince them of your truth. They are passing judgement based on their personal feelings and biases and not logic. 

Try to interact with them as little as possible when they’re being cruel and don’t give them the satisfaction of making you upset. Try to look forward to how your life will be better soon. I know it seems really far away, and time goes slower when you’re younger, but you will make it and you will be able to live freely. If you can find part time work, do that. Save up. Make your escape plan even if you can’t save just yet. Lean on people in your life who are supportive. Try to spend as much time as you can outside the house whether it be at a friend’s house or activities you enjoy or in nature. Whatever you have access to and makes you happy. Reach out to local support groups like PFLAG of LGBT community centers if they exist in your area or online support groups and communities. You got this.
Maybe this is a bad idea, but what if you did the same to her? Like punctuate every sentence with “dude”, “bro”, or “man” and see if she stops, since quite a few cis guys actually talk like that it might even give you some euphoria as well?
I wish I could be there to comfort and hug you, im so sorry. You're a total badass for being who you are in the face of this, and you make a difference. Hope you can get out asap and wishing you, sincerely, all the best.
Head down and just power through, bro.

You ain't changing her mind.

She wants a perfect mini me to live vicariously through, and she's attacking you for daring to defy her.

Just give bare minimum info, tune out her hateful bullshit best you can and just say to yourself every day, ""just keep swimming"".

I had my own horrifically tough time to get through in my early 30s, and it was just one step in front of the other til it got better.

And it will get better.

Come here for support.

My online family were the only ones who understood what I was dealing with, and I'm friends with them to this day.

Your mother doesn't get to define who you are.

((parental hugs))
tysm,, 🫂❤️ low-key teared up near the end lol-
I mean she ""chose"" it because she seeks literally every damn opportunity to mention it anywhere she can, including to new people, and if I speak up about it... it doesn't end well. So even if I, personally, chose my identity then she makes a different one up for me (to the public and in our family). It's extremely irritating but gotta stay silent 💔
Anytime, friend, if our family is shit, then we have to be here for each other.

Ngl, I teared up a bit reading your post, too, lol. I still haven't come out to my mother, I think she'd lose her shit about me not being her daughter anymore.

It's damn hard having a parent that treats you poorly, and it's so damn long to get out of there and away from it. There are people out there who will actually love you, love you for you, and support you. Might take a bit to find them (it did for me, but I'm socially awkward af, lol) but they are out there.

You're fucking awesome, and it will get better once you're away from that kind of hate and harassment.
Fellow homie, you keep fighting the good fight until she realises what a silly hill this is to die on.

Keep it up my guy; the sun’s right below the horizon just you wait.
Prejudices will die, new norms will arise, and you’ll be there at the forefront basking it in. <3"	12obyzk	trans	155	0.98	2023-04-16 14:59:46
We must accept detransitioners	"There's been a lot of hatred thrown at detransitioners, and unfortunately, it's not just from places you'd expect.

Sadly, a not-so-insignificant portion of the hatred comes from within the LGBT community.

There's a widespread misconception that detransitioners are using their unfortunate life experience to spread hate and malice against transgender people. While it is very true that a few notable people likely have this despicable motive, the majority of detransitioners are not so deceivingly inclined.

They're regular, normal people, just like you and I.

It's difficult to face the concept that some people may experience significant enough regret years after transitioning to begin detransitioning. While they obviously do not make up the majority of transgender individuals, we're discovering that they may be more than outliers in a statistical sense, although more research is needed to absolutely solidify that claim. Reguardless of the ultimate outcome, detransitioners are a reality we must embrace and support.

The reasoning for the LGBT community to have difficulty discussing detransitioners is understandable. They've been politicized by conservatives worldwide as ""proof that transgenderism is a choice"" or that allowing people to transition is ultimately dangerous. A select few detransitioners have gone so far as to use their circumstances to promote that false narrative. Detransitioners existing in the first place provide a means of questioning and anxiety to many transgender people's solidified identities. But, reguardless of their weaponization by anti trans advocates, detransitioners that detransition due purely to regret (not due to transphobia, physical problems, etc) do certainly exist and we cannot ignore them. Medical science definitively proves the existence of transgender people. It likewise proves that transitioning is ultimately very effective at alleviating the mental stress of gender dysphoria, so much so that it is the current recommended treatment. Research further proves that successful, content transitions are most effective if started within a few years after the onset of puberty. In short, there is *undeniable evidence proving the existence of transgender people and the effectiveness of transitioning*. Of this truth, we shall accept no compromise and give no ground.

HOWEVER, we likewise must accept the fact that some people, despite feeling absolutely certain of their desire to transition for YEARS prior, do begin to experience regret in doing so even years after starting the process independent of the results of transitioning or the social acceptance of their transition. And, unfortunately, some of these people were teenagers when they started. These detransitioners are extremely important, because they provide evidence that research into transgender care is far from complete. As we rightfully push for easier access to transitioning hormones and surgical procedures, we also reduce the ability of the medical system to screen out people who's discomfort could stem from other sources and potentially be worsened in the future by deciding to transition.

The underlying point in this discussion is that *there must be more long term research into transgender adults, youth, and transitional care*. Does this mean we halt pushing for transgender care and awareness? Absolutely not. It DOES mean that we fully accept detransitioners and wish them well, reguardless of how their stories may be weaponized by bigots. It means that we accept the branching of gender affirmative care to not necessarily conclude in hormonal and surgical treatment. It means we allow further research into what causes people to transition to further improve the medical care of trans youth and adults. It means we embrace the idea that ""gender questioning"", or even fully transitioning, does not have to conclude in HRT and surgery.

While ultimately I understand that much in the way of this occuring is due to the despicable political landscape aimed at destroying trans people under the banner of ""protect the kids"", we still have to make the adult decision to accept that transitioning does cause life-altering changes that can never be fully reversed and as such is not something to be taken lightly. We're not those who hate us; our existence is based on medical science and evidence. As such, we must accept unbiased research into the causes of detransitioning  and how those findings may affect the concept of gender affirmative care. And, the most important point, is that we cannot hate detransitioners nor exclude them from our circles simply because they received an incorrect diagnosis when they were in highschool. After all, like transgender people, detransitioners aren't going to disappear.

We spread love, not hate, forever and always."	"100%! The only issue I have with anyone who detransitions is when they go full on anti trans and claim that all trans people are groomers and all doctors are tricking children into getting surgery. Unfortunately those people are making things extra difficult for trans and ex-trans alike.

Most of the bigots only need one example to fully validate their entire world view. There is nothing inherently wrong with being trans, or previously trans, and I have a huge amount of empathy for anyone who has had any kind of medical procedure and later regrets is. 

If someone involved in that process was incompetent or malicious, I definitely want them held accountable, at the same time, I absolutely hate it when it is presented as a generalization as opposed to their specific personal experience. 

I would never generalize my transition to anyone else’s experience, and I have complete respect and sympathy for anyone who is able to accept that their experience, no matter how bad, is their own.

I do find it especially frustrating that the bigots will exploit detransitioners to attack trans people, but they don’t seem to have any interest in fixing the societal problems that led that person towards whatever issues they had in the first place. 

They just claim that the existence of trans people is the only possible problem but somehow we are only trans because of some failure in society. It’s a chicken and egg situation except trans people are somehow the chicken and the egg.

We are the victims and perpetrators at the same time. If a detransitioner supports that theory, it becomes very difficult to support them.
There are studies already such as this one, which overwhelmingly indicate that most folks detransition due to a lack of support:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/
Detransitioners are important and their experiences are valid and need to be heard. But it is a myth that Trans people silence detrans voices. Detrans experiences are important to be studied to see what factors lead to them detransitioning so that we can work towards correcting those factors.
It is also true that a fair number of detransitioners on the internet are just trolls pushing their anti-trans agenda. Detrans voices are important, but often they are the only voices that some people hear, trans voices are important too.
It is a myth that trans people silence detransitioning voices in my experience. It’s also absolutely shameful that people try to lump in people who have evolved or discovered their gender identity is beyond a binary transition in with people who have detransitioned, and attempt to use them for their own agendas.
Trans people are generally acceptive and supportive of detransitioners. Unless you are a right wing nut you know that the point of the trans movement is being free to pursue what makes you feel more at ease, even detransitioning.  


But why in the hell are you making detransitioning sound like something that happens half of the times? We know the stats! It's around 1%! And it includes a lot of regret for complicated surgeries that governments impose on us in order to change documents.  


Also you're spouting transphobic points when saying that making transition easier will make people regret it.  


This whole post is in bad faith and you're doing no service to detransitioners.
does anyone else believe that detransitioners are still *of trans experience*? because I do. they transitioned TWICE for cryin out loud. I personally find it fascinating and would not ostracize them just for being detrans.

I learn way more about myself from people on different paths than I do from people living a similar experience. I value the detrans perspective because it oftentimes validates my transness
It's important to remember that there are different types of detransitioners. People who got so much hate they return to the closet, people who realise that their gender identity isn't binary, people who have health complications with hormones, people who realise that they are cis and probably some others that I do not know about.

There is no problem with detransitioning. Do what makes you happiest. Only issue is that detrans people get weaponised against trans people and some are outright transphobic. Of course these are in the minority of detrans people but transphobes know how to push against trans people.

Every detrans person who identifies as cis shouldn't speak over trans people. You do not see me talking over women as an ex-woman, do you? 

Also a lot of detrans people retransition later.
If we want society to be understanding, we should be as well. We're all different, but we're still human. Why treat others with the same hate or lack of acceptance as we receive? Thank you OP, for promoting the spread of love and not hate.
Nobody I know hates detransitioners. They are valid and a part of the community. 

The only ones I have a problem with are the ones that try to deny trans people access to healthcare or rights, who use their own poor choices to try to make our lives worse.
I'll respect them as long as they respect us. Too many of them immediately turn their backs on trans people and act like beings trans is a huge issue and should be resolved like global warming after they detransition and that's not fair.
Transitioning to your agab after having been trans outside of your agab is also transition. They’re not detrans, or ex-trans, they’re twicetrans. Embrace them too. 


Naturally if some individual is nasty and being hateful call them out. That goes for cis folks and trans folks just the same. Use your power for good.


But never assume you know someone’s heart just because they belong to a group that is sometimes used in propaganda against you.
This is bullshit. 
Get your gender exploratory therapy shill the fuck out this sub.

The unbiased research on detransition shows majority of the time it's due to lack of resources or social pressure. 

Anyone coming to this sub attacking ""gender affirmative care"" should probably just be banned. Toxic bullshit.
I couldn't read the entire post. I don't have the attention span. I agree with the sentiment of the headline though. Some detransitioners have been created and or used against the community, but there are so many who just are.  I know several people who chose, or are considering choosing to detransition. They were terrified to tell me, because they thought I would hate them.  Let people be who they are. Whether they detransition because medical transitioning isn't right for them, they develop health problems that make them have to, or because they can't take one more day being separated from their children/grandchildren because of transphobic family.  There are many reasons to detransition.   


We can fight back against the hateful detransitioners by spreading the accurate information. There is no need to attack everyone who says they did, are going to, or are in the process of detransitioning. We should not meet everyone who mentions it with instant hate.
I have no problem with de  . I don’t like seeing them let themselves be used as props by transphobes for 15 minutes of fame. I come to this thread every day and see children asking if starving themselves is a viable way to delay puberty.. and then see a detransitioner let themselves get used by someone who’s not even a doctor, anecdotally, to argue why HRT should be unavailable..
Alot or a few,maybe some trans people have no choice but to detranstion and we didn't detranstion because we weren't trans.

Alot of us do it because of fear,being ourselves in a alot of places can fundamentally risk your life and possible outcomes of choice.

Sometimes it's like knowingly going into Bloods territory wearing blue,it can be visible and you know it's dangerous,you might not get hurt that time but you might on another day but wear blue everyday and paranoia and fear eventually builds up.

people like myself just can't handle that and that's just being human.
[deleted]
Detrans lives matter too! 💗🦈✊
They just have to pass the same litmus test as any other human, are they being a cunt?

If someone detransitions for their own reasons, no problem. It could be financial, safety or social reasons.

If someone starts trying to weaponise their experience to spread lies and fear, that's being a cunt.
so well put hope this reaches people who need to hear this <3
I don't see a whole lot of hate for detransitioners. Most of the hate I notice is towards the ones who use their experience to attack trans people. The thing I notice however is that it's just not talked about much. Most likely because it's not a huge issue.

Detransitioners make up around 1% of the trans community acording the the studies I've seen, and 95% of that 1%, detransition due to factors such as; high costs, lack of medical access, lack of support, and other issues. I belive that less than 1% - 5% of 1% of trans people transition because it wasn't for them - basically they just weren't trans. 

Simply put, if one detransitions because it wasn't a life for them, that is completely fine. But I do not think they are trans. They realized that they weren't actually trans and decided to detransition. And while they should be treated with respect, kindness, and compassion, thinking of them as trans is simply incorrect. But again, I belive they make up a very small portion of the trans community and as far as I have seen, the detransitioners who do so because of the other issues listed above, are treated well in my experience.
I would say I've been seeing a lot of hate, but I have noticed a certain discomfort that some people have with those that detransition. I have very very much noticed that some people feel ashamed for wanting to detransition for different reasons because of the way the enemy (!) has used any and all of those that detransition to attack everyone. Of course, like I've told several of those that were thinking of detransitioning, forget what the bigots are doing because they'll just lie and make stuff up anyway. Their claims make no more sense if they mix some actual facts into their basis for it.

Now, you might think that loosening up the ridiculous and arbitrary requirements around accessing hormone therapy and gender-related surgeries would make it easier for people to rush to it looking for an answer that those procedures can't give. The reality I've come across more than once is that the gatekeeping and unreasonable expectations actually **increases** the incidence of people second guessing and possibly regretting their choices! I was surprised, too! The thing is that the bad faith obstacles that people put in the way distract from reflecting on the choice, because it adds value to actually aquiring the procedure, and it makes it more costly to reject it, so people will stick it out to see if it gets better. After all, they won't get a second chance from the people that don't listen to them and that they had to lie to.

I had a friend that had to go through a transphobic  psychologist to get HRT due to the country they lived in. It was a giant struggle with arbitrary waiting times, they had to bend the truth and tell them what they wanted to hear, in the grand tradition of our people. After a few weeks, my friend started to have some doubts. While I was pretty sure it was depression and anxiety messing with them so I didn't want to simply advise them to go back and burn their perscription, the right thing was to tell them to take a break to think about it. The problem, of course, is that it would show up on blood tests most likely, and there was a chance it could be taken away from them, so they had all this pressure to go one way or the other. It's the most I've been involved in a situation like that, but not the only one.

I'm actually pretty happy about the fact that bigots can't ever seem to do anything right, but it makes it a real bummer that people are suffering for it. The real irony about these weaponized detransitioners is that even when they're real people with real experiences, they're **still** creations of bigot because the bigots both but that false value on those procedures, and convinced them not to take responsibility for their decisions. Meanwhile, this lovely community has done a great job so far at supporting people that have wanted to detransition as far as I've seen. I definitely think that any hate towards the detransers is misplaced. The best thing we can do, in my opinion, is be open and vocal about our goals and values.

We're here to maximize happiness and satisfaction in people's lives, and if that means detransitioning for someone, then we're proud to help them achieve that. There's no shame in detransitioning, it doesn't feed hatred towards us, and it's all just another step in someone's personal journey through life. Hugs for all!
Totally agree. Not trans but as a doctor I can see the lack of care on people who wish to transition and individualised approach. If there is better education and counseling/planning, maybe things will be managed more appropriately. Making major physical alterations should be an informed decision and based on personal wishes.
A good point to raise here is about whether these people were not sure about transition. Or maybe partially had other reasons to question their gender. 
My wonder is if there were signs early that they could have been picked up and discussed prior to transition. 
I get often the feeling that we do not discuss the decision itself or know how to handle the psychological part of it
Since I announced that I no longer wanted to be seen as a woman, my andocrinologist and some of my 'friends' have unfortunately reacted badly to me.
It's transphobia those people should be criticized for, not detransitioning.

We shouldn't make them connected. We should be working hard to de-associate the two so people who detransition aren't guided to that pipeline.
We do not need to support a detransitioner going full anti trans ""groomer"" screamer. Reguardless of their attitude, however, we cannot be sending death threats and hateful messages. We are not the same as those that hate us.
It’s almost always due to social pressure and lack of acceptance or not being able to afford the costs.
While some studies do exist, none are fully comprehensive. A major issue with these studies has been too small of a sample pool, insufficient duration of study, or limited funding. Let's be honest; whatever the results of current studies, researchers are afraid to touch this topic with a degree of severity. Why wouldn't they be? Reguardless of their findings, the results will be twisted to suit an anti trans agenda simply because it includes the word ""detransition"". We have a significant of scientific and societal work left ahead of us.
Many detransistioners get rejected by their trans and lgbt peers and then get pushed into the arms of the conservative agenda where their pain is used as a weapon. This is a fact. The solution, then, is to make damn sure they feel safe and don't end up losing their support systems for doing so.

When someone leaves the trans experience we need to give them a warm goodbye.
It is absolutely an undisputable fact that detrans people have received hate, harassment, and even death threats from the LGBT community, and specifically the transgender community. There are Tiktoks of people telling detransitioners to ""shut the f*ck up"" because they're promoting hatred towards transgender people. I'm not saying anyone's voice is or isn't important; and I fully agree that detransitioners are heavily focused on to promote anti-trans political retoric. But hatred against them cannot come from us. It must be nipped in the bud *now* before it grows further.
it is not a myth that trans people silence detrans voices. I have seen it both online and IRL. sometimes it is directly to the detrans person. *oftentimes* the silencing happens in conversations between trans and cis people in order to validate the trans experience.
We don't even have the power to do that.
I'm sorry you feel that way. I have put significant effort into conveying that we should not allow transitioning to be more difficult or less acceptable, nor should we cease the fight towards making it even more obtainable. However, we should also likewise expect the statistical number of detransitioners to potentially rise in the next decade and as such we should do our best to continue to welcome them. If they go off the deep end with transphobia, that's a completely different story. But even in that case, while their message should rightfully be condemned, we should not promote hatred towards them to the extent that they receive death threats.
How many detransitioners have you seen do this? I find it hard to believe you’ve heard of enough specific detransitioners to make up enough of a data set to draw conclusions on. Being trans doesn’t mean someone is more likely to be a bad person, neither does transitioning twice. In short, you’re being bigoted. Stop it.
Double trans people can triple jump. We mustn’t incur their wrath. Because we shouldn’t be assholes, mobility isn’t a major reason.
Thank you for providing evidence towards my point.
Yea, it's pretty fucked up. That being said, many of them don't want to be weaponized by transphobes and are taken advantage of. I think there would be a significantly smaller portion of them that stray into that error if the transgender community fully embraced them reguardless of what the transphobes want to say about it.
Me too I'm +18 but still is uncomfortable.
I think in part this is a resourcing problem. To access hormones where I live, I have to be on multiple wait lists for a combined period of about a year (yay socialized healthcare /s). If clinics and psychologists are that overburdened, I don’t know how they can possibly do an adequate job of providing individualized, case-specific care

There is technically a psychological vetting process I have to go through to get permission to receive hormones (which I strongly, strongly object to). But there’s basically zero actual support.
Absolutely, and it’s really the anti-trans groups that are linking them together because they want us to turn against each other. It’s crazy how they are exploiting people by claiming that person has been exploited.
I'm still going to call them genocidal shills all day, because that's what they are.  Anyone who supports groups that want to eliminate trans poeople, allies themselves with fascists who want to eliminate trans people, they get no support.  They get called out for what they are.
A very small portion of the entire population goes trough with medicaly transitioning. And even out of that alredy small percentage, an even smaller one decide to stop their transition. And even then most of them donit because of social pressure and other kind of situatuons in their lives. So yeah, I do think that the people who transition and realize its not for them and then start pushing against trans rights are in fact representative of the entire population. I will accept them when they accept me too. I havent seen a single detransitioner be pro-trans.
Oh definitely, nobody should be sending death threats to anyone. The other day in a different sub someone posted an image depicting Trump almost fully submerged in quicksand or something, hand outstretched with the caption “what would you do?” I’m in the military, and barely survived his trans ban, but I would try my best to pull him out. Why? Because whatever kind of person I am dealing with, I am not going to let them determine what kind of person I am.
Not really true, it’s just a fact their are not a lot of detrans ppl. We should support the ones who exist but it’s true their is not a lot of them.
No one is afraid to touch this, there's loads of studies out there.

This is a good breakdown

https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/
Bigots will never warm up to other people and accept them no matter what you do to them. You can give yourself up on a silver plater they will still think you are lesser and that you deserve to suffer.
This. We should validate their experience.  

However, we have to make clear they are a *very* small minority of people who transition.  Their life is valid, but they do *not* represent transfolk.
wait we should not tell people to shut the fuck up when promoting hatred towards trans people?
The thread you're basing your world view on wasn't statistically significant.
If we let ppl transition their will be the same amount of detrans ppl theirs always been, their has never before been bans on hrt like they are doing now. I don’t understand how you could think it’s ok to ban transitioning when that will literally kill people.
there's an ex marine who identified as a trans woman who had detransitioned and is now spewing transphobia and ""protect the children"" bullshit. can't remember the name though
No, I am not. I'm asking for respect in return which is more than fair. 

In fact, here's 3:

Helena Kerschner- used to identify as a trans man and now speaks out publicly against gender affirming surgery and states that  it ruined their life and will ruin yours too. 

Walt Heyer- a former trans woman who speaks out against gender affirming care and how ""harmful"" it is to youth and also uses their religion as a source. 

Cat Cattinson: former transman(?) Publicly speaks out on their platform about how puberty  blockers are harmful an extremely dangerous. 


I'm not saying everyone who detransitions is like this, I am  speaking about these kinds of people.
how?
There are definitely detransitioners who are pro trans, problem is you don’t hear about them much because the mainstream conservative media is only exploiting the ones who are willing or susceptible to be manipulated to be anti-trans.

Also I think there is a lot of stigma from all around about detransitioning, so a lot of them probably just want to be left alone and don’t talk about it unless they are pissed or exploited.

I think the most important point is that no matter what someone says, we have to be the calm and mature ones despite how angry we might be. For MtF people, this is what cis-women have been forced to do since forever. It’s the only way we have a chance of being heard.
I would save Trump not because of his humanity, because he has none, but because he's lolcow.
Ok. Idk what this has to do with accepting detransitioners, but ok.
We don't actually know how much of a minority they make up currently. While they are CERTAINLY a minority, they may not be as small as we think, whether you like to hear that or not. They absolutely do not represent transfolk, and transfolk are undoubtedly much more numerous than detransitioners, but their existence is proof that the codex for gender affirmative care is in no way complete yet, and that we must allow further research to proceed. We shall give no ground, mind you, but it's still important to find tune diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
The lense I focus my worldview through is analytical caution. I do not understand the meaning of your suggested ""thread"".
I don't understand how you perceived that at any point I suggested we can transitioning
You can add Oil London to that list now too
[removed]
I repeatedly made the point that gender affirmative care and transitional availability are not to be meddled with, only that the research into effective transgender care is far from complete and is having difficulty proceeding not only due to transphobic legislation and arguments, but also from within the transgender community itself due to fear and animosity that the already imperfect access to medical transition could be meddled with in the process. This understandable fear is something that we must work on ourselves to prevent it from stalemating the progress of research into transgender care. The above comment made multiple remarks clearly driven by anxiety that allowing further long term research into detransitioners may produce findings that do not support the current limited research that most detransitioners do so due to transphobia and not regret of transitioning at all. If encouraging research into detransitioners to potentially lower the amount of them in the future while expanding access to gender affirmative care is a bannable offense, then perhaps we truly are an echo chamber.
I could agree with this if it’s in a bubble that doesn’t include him having or potentially having the influence to completely ruin my life and put me in danger.
Nor do you know how many people are doing this.  Your evidence is fucking TikTok, a shitty spyware platform.
fine tune diagnosis of gender dysphoria?  


Diagnosis of GD is just however the psych feels that day, it's just gatekeeping at its purest.
Yes, we absolutely agree with your nuanced approach to this.
I literally didn't say a THING about that ? I said I will give them respect if they give it to me. Not that I'm going to demonize them immediately for detransitioning wth they're already going through enough shit already?

They are allowed to do so if they feel they need to. I am speaking of the ones that do that then act like WE'RE  the issue, that turn their backs on us.  Also I'm not going to sit here and name every single detransitioner that has turned their backs on trans people, you asked me if I'd seen enough to make an assumption (which I didn't do, I asked for basic mutual respect) and I gave you three easy examples. I'm not forming an entire anti-detransitioner opinion based on three fucking people. 

I don't  even HAVE an anti-detransition approach I don't understand where you're coming from on  this.
ah you say “I love detransitioners” but what if I replaced “detransitioner” with “transphobes”? it now says “I love transphobes” checkmate
It’s not, people are just pointing out the fact that a lot of detrans ppl do so bc they have no support. We should 100% do more research but their is alot of research already done. Education on trans ppl and letting people transition might increase detrans ppl but it will also increase trans ppl who come out. I don’t think their will be a huge increase in the percent of detrans ppl bc of that. If theirs more out trans ppl theirs more detrans ppl 🤷🏻‍♂️
there's decades of research behind gender affirmative care, and you literally came here implying things that have been studied haven't, implying that we need care that doesn't lead to hormones ect.  

it's bad faith bullshit, and it's pretty clear you're here to try to push some gender exploratory bullshit, which is just conversion therapy.

letting the patient/subject guide the care and attending to their needs has always been and will always be the only correct way to care for trans people. Any suggestions that we depart from that, particularly because of a cohort that gets elevated above the other 98% of trans people, is only advocating on behalf of the trans eliminationists.

just stop.
Trump didn't work alone, what he did was what the republicans have tried to do forever. Him dying will make no difference.
citing Tiktok as a source for hate speech is NOT the same as using wikipedia as a source for your thesis paper.
It was a false (pride) flag attack!
A shitty spyware platform that has remarkable popularity
Any occurrence of maliciousness towards innocent people from within our own community must be condemned.
 ...so you agree that it's diagnostic protocol needs work?
Proceed cautiously, but allow research to proceed. It's important that we do not become the mindless crowds of anti trans zombies puttering about the current socialscape
You immediately jumped to them being disrespectful. That was the ground state you were working from. That is not okay.
Lmao made me giggle
Lojik.
Exactly, he is just a figurehead or mascot for a whole entire horrible group of people. Honestly I don’t think he actually has any personal convictions or beliefs other than that he should be worshipped. It just happens that the type of people who are willing to worship him are the type of people who want us dead, and he has to appease them.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure the people posting negative stuff are really trans, but I don’t believe they represent the majority.
And?  So you ran into a couple stupid kids on TikTok, hardly cause for alarm.
That’s a very optimistic yet naive view of the community. Being LGBTQIA+ does not prevent you from being bigoted towards the LGBTQIA+ community. 

It’s impossible to get rid of all bigotry and hate. But it’s not impossible to atleast call it out in a lot of situations.
It doesn't need work it needs to allow us to self diagnose.
I think there is a counterintuitive issue with gatekeeping and restrictin access to transition.

For a long time there was one trans narrative that you had to fit to be able to transition. You had to say you wanted srs in order to get access to hrt.

That meant people lied and the strict narrative of what a true trans person was becomes a self fullfilling profecy.

So whats the story with detransitioners, and I mean the ones who realized they weren't trans at all. Did they genuinely feel like they were a different gender than the one they were assigned and then those frrlings changed? Did they somehow just convinced themselves they were trans? How did THAT happen? Or do you think maybe when a large portion of the community has a fairly high level of distrust of healthcare professionals that they get to a point where they will do everything, including lying about their experience to get access to healthcare?
Research is already proceeding, what are you on about?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/
We are going back to college specifically to do research about being transgender, with a focus on transwomen with DID.  From there. Go into advocacy.   So yeah. We agree.
Didn't even once say they were disrespectful.  I asked for mutual respect.
They aren’t “being disrespectful” they are inciting violence. In Florida detransitioners literally flew out to try and ban hrt for anyone under 18. That will literally kill people. We should support detrans ppl but not transphobes. I don’t support trans ppl who act transphobic why should I have to respect someone who’s transphobic just bc they detransitioned?
I think the issue is that when it comes to being trans, there is no such thing as “representing the majority”. My gender doesn’t have anything to do with who I am or what I believe. We are all unique individuals who happen to have had the same birth defect. Even experiencing anti-trans discrimination is widely distinct based on your intersectional perspective and experience.
The concept of detransitioners has been danced around by a scientific community afraid of being accused of political motivations for simply performing more in depth and larger long term studies on the phenomenon. I am certainly not here to fight you; only to ensure that it is understood that we cannot make the same mistakes of those who oppose our existence. The underlying point I wish convey is that malice towards detransitioners from within the LGBT community is an actual, presently occuring issue and it needs to be recognized. Validating detransitioners is not invalidating transfolk, even if it should be twisted and presented as such by bigots. Even if that occurs, we will have our morality intact.
You asked for it, implying it wasn’t already there. You don’t get handed a glass of water and immediately ask for water, you ask for water when you’re thirsty.
Transphobes who have detransitioned are transphobes and should be treated as such, the issue is acting like detransitioning makes someone a transphobe.
Sure, what I mean is that OP seeing a couple kids posting on TikTok is not indicative of a wider problem with hate for detrans folks.
Nobody is arguing that detransitioning is not valid.  


Except for governments that don't allow changing back documents for example!
That analogy made NO sense to this conversation. It is not an implication to ask for mutual respect it is just a statement.
If OP said he ONLY saw a few kids posting on TikTok that would be valid. I think the point was that was an example that most of us can relate to experiencing in various places. It’s pretty clear that it’s not just “a couple kids”, but I would also certainly not credit it to “the trans community”.

For the same reason we can’t hold detransitioners responsible for detransitioned bigots, we can’t hold trans people responsible for transgender bigots. Being anti isn’t an inherent aspect of either “culture”. 

Problem is that anti-trans people will still generalize and hold us to that standard, so it’s reasonable for us to discuss ways to possibly mitigate it.
How often do you ask for things you already have?
I genuinely feel this is entirely blown out of proportion.  You’re going to have some people that get extremely emotional about the detrans issue, that doesn’t mean “the trans community” has a problem with detrans folks.

What people have a problem with is the rhetoric spewed by some detrans folks.  If someone detransitions, cool, they made the wrong decision, shit happens.  It’s still exceeedingly rare that people choose to detransition because they weren’t actually trans, and they need to accept personal accountability without making it seem like there’s some sort of conspiracy pushing people to be trans.
How often do you start arguments on zero grounds?


My dude, asking for respect from your fellow human is not implying that you believe the respect is not there, it is  grounding for comarardary, a sign that no bad blood be between the two parties.
That’s my point, it’s the anti-trans people who absolutely are going to blame the “trans community”. We can at least be conscious of it and maybe try to mitigate, or we can just ignore it and see what happens. The anti-trans people don’t use nuance. It is being blown out of proportion by the people who want us dead.
Again, you don’t ask someone who respects you to respect you, they already do. It’s not complicated, take a moment, listen to what you’re saying, and go take a nap you seem tired.
Okay, dude. Once again I'll state I wasn't implying they DIDNT. You cannot sit here and tell me beyond a shadow of a doubt that from both sides there is mutual respect because there absolutely isn't and it's sad asf. We bite eachother's tails all the time and we SHOULDN'T.
Get some rest. I’d be happy to discuss this when you’re a bit less irritable.

Is it ok to not feel like I’m a woman in a man’s body and be trans?	"Im someone who was amab and I don’t know if this is valid or not, because I read a lot of things and for the longest time - meaning since I was like 5 where I’ve got memories of wearing my mum’s or sister’s items and now I’m like 40 and only recently made progress to try to acknowledge myself and my identity. 

I feel like, I’m just me, I don’t really like the term ‘man’ but I wouldn’t say I feel like I’m a woman in the wrong body. 

I just feel like I’m me, but the body I see doesn’t really match the way I feel inside. 

There’s a certain pressure isn’t there, that if you’re going to come out as trans that people expect you to appear in the gender you want to be seen as. 

Ever since I was a teenager I’ve wanted to have a feminine body, I’ve always felt like it just isnt correct, no matter what weight o am, no matter if I try and be more ‘manly’ it just never feels right and sure I love dresses and skirts and makeup and stuff but I don’t always want to wear those things. 

Sometimes I’m just in the mood for a T shirt and some sweat pants and trainers, and I couldn’t look less like a man if I tried, it isn’t how I feel inside and sometimes it’s a bit exhausting and sometimes it’s a bit terrifying thinking, gosh am I only valid as a trans person if I go out in ‘female attire’? Like…I dunno does anyone else feel like that?

Am I crazy? I need therapy I think 😂 try to figure myself out, but I don’t and hve never really felt like a ‘woman in a man’s body’ even though this term or expression has been thrown around so much that I feel like I SHOULD feel like that if I’m expected to be trans. 

Like, I just wanna be me, with a body that matches the way I feel inside, and labels…I dunno, why can’t I just be me? 

I’ve no idea if I’m even making sense, has anyone else felt like this or know what I’m talking about or have any advice that may help please?"	"I wouldn’t describe myself as a man in a woman’s body either. I’m just a man. And there’s plenty of cis women who wear sweatpants and t shirts. Trans people are often expected to be super feminine/masculine which is unfair because cis people can wear what they want without being questioned*. You ARE valid

* (though men still get tons of shit for wearing a dress etc etc)
Trans is a huge umbrella, much more than feeling x in y body. Everything you've describe is fairly common, so its more than OK, its almost usual (relatively speaking, for around here). And even if it wasn't, it'd still be valid.

It sounds like you might want some kind of non-binaryness, seems like putting some effort into reading the different labels (including labels for lack of, or variation in, labels) would help you more than us pinging random things at you.

Or forget it all and just be you as you want. That's what I'm doing - although I recon its worth considering in the background.
I don’t think I’m going to directly answer your question, but one of the things that I’ve been doing quite regularly for the past 8 months is finding transgender people on Instagram and YouTube and listening to their experiences as a means to build a framework for understand what I am feeling and how I perceive myself. One caveat is that Instagram and YouTube typically have younger people on there so there’s not as much representation (from what I can tell) for older transgender people. That being said, they do exist and their experiences are valid. I’ve tried to listen to people who are around my age (early to mid thirties). 

I think it’s also worth reading as much as you can about the transgender community from different sources too. I don’t have anything really recent, but Julia Serano’s Whipping Girl is what I would recommend to anyone wanting to put language to transgender experience. I won’t say that it’s a definitive piece of work because I’m not as well read as I would like to be but I think it’s a very good start. 

I have one last comment and it’s about myself. I tend to feel that I am transgender and I lean towards the trans-femme side of things but may be non-binary. I don’t really “feel like a woman in a mans body” and one point Serano’s Whipping Girl makes is that the narrative is one way to present transgender expression in a conformative way for cishet people. 

You do you boo and love yourself ❤️ also keep in mind that it’s not necessary to medically transition for your experience to be valid and a transgender person.
I feel like a void in a woman's body that looks like a man
I feel this alot. I've never really felt like a woman in the wrong body, moreso that I just don't like my body and what I wish my body would be matches other womens bodies. I don't think there is any one thing that all trans people should feel or think. Any gender can look and dress how they want while still being completely valid in their identity. Your identity is 100% your own and how you express yourself is up to you. You can express yourself how you want, if you sincerely feel you're trans, you are, how you express it doesn't matter in the slightest.

I think these feelings and thoughts are very common and I personally have felt the same things. <3
No woman is required to dress a certain way, nor is any man.  Masc trans femmes exist as do femme trans mascs.

I pursued HRT once I became aware of what trans actually is and I would say before HRT I didn’t feel like a woman so much as I wanted to be one (the “button test” was inescapable for me), but now (around 6 months HRT, and also 40) I feel 1000% that I’m a woman.
All being trans means is you dont vibe with your AGAB.

U don't have to feel bad, we can chat if u want for a bit and.maybe it will help u figure it.out🫂 have hug🫂
I think it gets weirder for anyone a little older. The idea of binary gender is already relatively firmly cemented. So if you decide later in life that you don't define as one then you \*have to be\* the other. The truth is far more complicated and far less satisfying. There isn't a switch to flip or a neat box to place yourself in. What you have discovered is you don't fit in the first box you were assigned and you thought there was only one other, and that box doesn't feel right either. The beauty of this analogy is that your true self is probably more of a box fort. You get to pick and choose a plethora of boxes none of which necessarily feel right on their own, but as a unit encompass you. And don't feel like you can't try and discard boxes for the rest of your life. To quote Modest Mouse, ""it takes a life time to ever figure out that, there ain't no lifetime that's ever figured out.""  
<3
There’s trans on the binary. There’s also non-binary. You won’t know who you are until you explore. Whoever you are love you kind person.
Yes. Of course. I always felt like a man through and through. Good luck with everything.
I feel something similar. I want to have the body of a woman, but my gender doesn't feel like that label fits me. I just feel like *me* most of the time with femininity being something my gender orbits rather than being that in and of itself. Some days I don't even feel that I'm trans at all.

But being trans is a huge possibility space that encompasses everything that's not cis, so if you don't feel like your agab, even in part, you are part of the community too. 💖
I never felt that stereotypical trans “cliché phrase” but i know that I am a man and after having top surgery and being on T for several years I’m actually comfortable in my skin. I would describe the feelings I had more of never feeling like I quite fit myself no matter who I was. I tried everything and nothing was right and I hated my body so much. And one day it just kind of clicked in my head that “oh can you be made accidentally wrong??” And so I started wearing mens clothes and I actually felt comfortable with myself and when people address me by my name and male pronouns it doesn’t make my heart hurt hearing it. I think the feeling is less of “being in the wrong body” and more of accepting the person I was always born to be. Sometimes now that I feel very comfortable with myself I will wear more typically “feminine” clothes because I don’t really believe that clothes have a gender. Whatever I identify as on the inside is who I am and what people judge me as on the outside is up to them. What other people think of me/my gender/ my presentation doesn’t make any difference to my core identity.
It is best to think of the phrase ""trapped in a man's body"" as limited descriptive tools to help explain the feeling of trans folks and feelings of dysphoria to those who might not be familiar with those feelings. Like anything that pertains to use of language to describe emotions, it is not exhaustive and shouldn't be the sole indicator.  I would encourage therapy to maybe perhaps get in better touch with these feelings, but the important thing is you are feeling emotional unease with your secondary gender traits.
Nah man, I feel like a big part of the whole ""gender trapped in another genders body"" is a way we explain it to cis people. There are some people that feel like that, but not everyone. I 100% feel the way you do. Sometimes people get sick of labels, and just wanna be people.
Waittt this is me. Afab and while I enjoy looking like the opposite gender or genderless, I don't exactly feel the need to dress out all the time or mind looking like a biological female(some of the time)I am genderqueer though so that could be partially why.
Yes. Its normal, probably anxiety.
Oh gosh. Thank you so much for your support, I don’t really know where to put thsinpost but it’s so reassuring and helpful to hear your helpful comments. Thank you x
People experience transness in all sorts of different ways. There are plenty of trans women who don't feel like the classic trope of the ""woman trapped in a man's body"" really resonates with their experiences, and plenty more who do. And that's totally fine, there's no right or wrong way to be trans. And it also wouldn't make you any less valid if you didn't want to present super fem all the time, that's pretty common too.

Good luck figuring everything out! I agree that therapy can be very helpful in that process, especially if you can find a therapist who is accepting and knowledgeable about trans issues.
Define your gender however it feels accurate to you.  Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.  To me being trans or nb just means you don't feel you conform to the gender or gender roles that society tries to assign you.
Heads up, I'm a trans man.

I don't feel like I'm trapped in a ""woman's"" body. My body just decided to make estrogene instead of testosterone. But my tits and vagina, how uncomfortable they make me feel, are still male. Because I am male.
I don't claim to be an expert, but I think the woman trapped in a man's body idea began with Renee Richards, and may have been her specific experience that became sorta well known when her story spread via media exposure, leading to it sticking in people's minds. 

There's certainly room for other perceptions.  I got a lot of validation growing up (other than for my gender identity lol) so I felt a bit like you, OP, and it was pretty easy to say to myself I *am* a woman and list the traits I felt were 'off'.  But in trying to explain how dysphoria feels to other people in 1982, the 'trapped' concept was useful.
Completely normal, completely valid.  
The whole ""X trapped in a Y's body"" narrative is an oversimplified cliché, even though it's how some trans people feel.  
As for myself, I've never felt ""trapped"" in my body. It's MY body after all, I get to choose how to customize it.
Different people are on different levels! If you'd like, though, perhaps check out the term 'nonbinary'? It may fit you! But even if you don't feel dysphoric, you can still be a woman. Transgender isn't a one-size-fits-all kind of a term.
Exactly. There is a lot of pressure to appear in the gender you want to be and as a MtF person if you like, I don’t ALWAYS want to be in a skirt to be seen as who I am. Like I want to walk down the street and ppl are like ‘oh ok whatever’ and I’m just comfortable either in trousers or a skirt. But there’s definitely almost a ‘requirement’ to be hyper feminine if you want ppl to acknowledge you as anything and then all too often you’re just ‘a man in a dress’ which makes me sad…coz I don’t feel like I want to be thought of as a ‘man’ also ‘man in a dress’ sounds so derogatory, so what if a man’s in a dress! ‘Oh no! A woman in trousers! Ahhh!!’ No one comments on that. Ugh

  That’s a good way to put how I feel, a bit Of a void that looks like a man.
I’m a star in a human body lol.
What’s the button test?
Oh wow yes. Also what a stunning look. Thank you!
They said that they were worried that they would be expected to wear feminine clothing, and that they dont fit the stereotypes of what society expects a trans woman to be. But they expressed that they felt their body just didnt fit, and that they wanted feminine features. That's the opposite of a femboy, because fanboys identify as Male but want to present fem and wear feminine clothing. OP seems like they might be nonbinary or a butch/tomboy trans woman.
This is such a great response. It’s something I’m slowly coming to. Realisation of. 

For years it’s like the idea ‘you need to present as super fem’ and only now am I slowly coming to the realisation that clothes have no gender, it’s how you feel inside and I think I’ve gotten to almost the point where I can feel like myself in whatever, only when I look at myself I can’t quite see what I feel and sometimes I feel like I’m wearing the clothes just for other ppl…and sometimes not.
YEP gotta love double standards
I feel like this didn’t need to be in reply to my comment lol but yes I agree
Its fine my soul husk is still going be a husk but now it will be adorned with flowers
I think it’s “if you press a button you will wake up reborn as a girl, would you press the button?”

I’m the same as them, like I 100% want to be female but don’t think I ‘feel’ like one yet, which hopefully HRT will shine some light on. But I also think we have pressure to ‘feel’ like something, when how can we if we can only feel like ourselves? There’s so much socialising to unpack. 
You’re ok, nothing you’ve said is invalid, and I feel the same way as you
In front of you is a button that will, when pressed, change your body to the opposite gender. Absolutely nothing else about your life will change. You will have the same friends, family, job, etc. Do you press the button?

As another late-bloomer (I’m 49 and realized I wasn’t cis about 3 months ago), I think part of your confusion may be what you absorbed about transgenderism growing up. I found [The Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) very helpful in expanding and updating my understanding.
That creator was a final point for my coming to terms with being trans
Thanks! Yes you got it. 

The idea of a femboy is fine, but I’m no way a ‘femboy’ I look like a tall, broadshouldered ‘man’ and yeah exactly I just don’t find my body matches how I feel it should look, I’d rather not necessarily identify as male necessarily it’s just the idea of ‘woman in a man’s body’ doesn’t match how I feel. 

I feel like you explained it better lol
I think for me as soon as I accept that other peoples opinions of me don’t matter I feel a lot more free to express myself in whatever way I choose. And it’s a matter of experimentation coming to terms with what way that is.
I'm so sorry. I meant to reply to the comment saying OP was a femboy, but it seems I responded to the wrong post. Going to delete it now.
Who wouldn’t love that :-)
Oh right. Oooo I’d tap that button sugar. 

That is an amazing resource thank you.
I can see that.
Apologies if this comes across as invasive at all. But you can want to have breasts or a vagina or different things altered with your body and not be a woman. It's totally possible to want a traditionally female body while being nonbinary. At the end of the day, just do whatever makes you feel comfortable and dont feel pressured to be fully formed with your gender identity rn. Shit takes time.

i apologise if that made no sense haha"	">being trans fucking sucks

I wonder if I'll ever change my opinion on this as I grow older, but agreed. Gender dysphoria and being trans just... kinda sucks.      
It's hella cool that we have the technology and medical knowledge nowadays, but having been born cis would've made my life a whole lot easier haha

I usually say, I wave the trans flag with pride, but wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy
Please dont use too much energy trying to understand evil people, its no use sadly 😔 Bigots and fascists just need someone to hate, and were simply the meal of the day right now. 

But we will overcome everything together ✊🏻🥰
Fear, usually, or feeling like they're being attacked because they're introduced to a different way of life they feel contradicts to how they understand things. It's shitty, but it's human nature. Not in a ""it's inevitable"" kinda way but more ""people tend to be like this if they don't stop and think""
Sadly I just think a lot of humans are rubbish from my experience.
Don't let it drag you down and make you sad because there are some beautiful people out there and love wins against hate.
They're the mosquitoes of society, their existence is insignificant and worthless and they live only to harm others because they have no value as people. If they didn't hunt innocent people they'd have no other reason to live their pathetic lives.
I have so many thoughts and feelings on this issue that I can't distill it to a single arguement. 

Sometimes they're just people who are unhappy and want to make others more unhappy than they are with their lot in life rather than making everyone happier. 

Sometimes they're conservatives trying to develop a new wedge issue to drive people apart. 

Sometimes there's another option that I just had and now can't remember. 

All I really want right now is to be happy and maybe find someone to be happy with, is that so bad? Why is that such a problem for some people?
""phobia"" =an irrational fear. No good looking for sense in it any more than there is in any other phobia. Bummer, huh? But it does give hope cos phobias can be changed. Sometimes.
I know what you mean. For example, I really want to go the movie theater and watch a movie as myself (trans girl) but I'm paralyzed with fear on how that would go. The stares and comments, I think it would be too much. Maybe I am imagining the worst possible situation in the world, but I just know the chances of being left completely alone are not 100% guaranteed, so I still only dress myself up at home or only go to lgbt safe spaces.
You’re different and unique. They aren’t. They hate that we don’t follow what’s considered “normal”
Being trans sucks because bigots make it suck. If we were allowed to celebrate ourselves without constant defamation, sexualization, harassment, and bullying, I don't think it would be so bad to be trans in modern times. I think what makes it bad is people, angry at us because we are living proof that gender norms are just as made up as borders between states or laws or money. 
  
We are a threat to their brainwashing, their indoctrination, all of the beliefs they draw power from, because we disprove it. So our existence is a threat to them, and that is why they're really so scared.
  
Without all the hate, we're gorgeous, magnificent, amazing people with unique perspectives and powerful wisdom that comes from that. We see things they can't, we appear in ways they can't, and we have power that they can't touch.
Haters can't take the fact that something they refuse to understand helps you be a happier person.  If you've heard of the trope ""so open minded their brain fell out"", this would be the opposite ""so barricaded their mind starved"".  Hugs from the internet bud.🏳️‍⚧️
tw: generally touchy subjects (sorry)

I think it may be due to genetics and older mechanisms in the brain set up due to mating. ""if i was able to get a mate and reproduce then things were fine and will be for my offspring if things stay the same"". Along with that upwards of 56% of an attribute such as social friction can be caused by genetics. 
Its very interesting stuff! I think its something like Chineese rice farmers who have the highest genetic disadvantage when looking at risk taking and other things that you need when trying to create social change. Native Americans of the plains had the highest percentage of biological risk taking. 

Another reason i think is that (at least from what i've seen) people dont mind one or two new things, but they hate even the wiff of a stereotypical lgbtqia+ liberal. ""You can crossdress if you vote the same. You can vote different if you're the most understanding person."" are paraphrases of what i hear.

Maybe try only introducing one thing, and make everything else conservative when around your parents. I have left leaning ideas concerning freedoms but my family still loves me because of how i act conservative af.
I guess its like if you're trans but you still go to church, they probably would appreciate it more.

edit: i'm a closeted trans person, sorry if i made it seem like i'm some other thing.
Because they're insecure as fuck.

Their game is not to get rid of the Trans. We're just the target demographic right now. This game has been played for as long as humans have organized in civilizations.

There are those who maintain power and those who want influence. They're constantly at each others throats and once one class of people gets up top, they will start using the same force used against them, against those lower down in the hierarchy.

These people want a society where there are only straight, good christians and everyone is white. No colors, no shades, no nuance. Its a system thats easier to maintain position in.

Read up on the DDR republic. The authoritarian regime that surplanted the nazi governance in the communist side of Germany after the war. Its effectively that, but with more empasis on religion and luxury for the higher ups. 

The morons at the bottom of the pyramid are effectively just good party soldiers, pet dogs who play ball for a slice of the pie. But look at how the GOP made promised to the Log Cabin Republicans and then went out of their way to nuke them. These people don't realize that they're standing on the branch they're sawing into and they won't realize until its too late.

It happens every single time an authoritarian government takes power. Hitler assassinated his enforcers, Mussolini eradicated his former associates, Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Putin - the minute they get power - they will terminate their allegiances and the people, now dissillusioned, will have been the cause of their own demise.

They're just dumbasses hopped up on fashy virtue signalling, believing that they are doing good work. Look at how literally all the major TERF accounts spun around when Roe V Wade was overturned and called it a ""sacrifice that had to be made"" and then started courting Matt Walsh - a man so vile he is a self described theocratic fascist and compared the verdict to the liberation of Auschwitz and the end of Slavery.

This is why its so important to know and understand revolutionary history.
I honestly don't care what they think. I don't care what they believe. In America we All have that right. No one should be told how to feel or think. That said, feel and think whatever you want, but don't let your thoughts or feelings hurt or shame others. Keep it to yourself, or at home, in whatever social circle you live your life around. Don't make me feel like I don't belong, as I feel ashamed and embarrassed anyway. 
I'm not flaunting myself in front of you, I'm not waving flags, I'm not marching in parades or attending protests. Let me live my life as normal as possible, and I promise not to interfere with yours.
agreed, being born cis would have been so much easier. even though i say that being trans sucks, it doesn’t make me any less comfortable in my identity (hopefully that made sense??) and i like being trans even though it comes with its struggles.
i just really hope that one day we can all just live together in peace, but with the current state of the world i dont think thats gonna happen anytime soon. hopefully they’ll educate themselves and realise that trans people aren’t hurting anyone"	wk40w4	trans	146	0.99	2022-08-09 13:58:47
Being teased for my identity. Help. Am I wrong???	"I figured I could come here since it's a community for people like me. I'm transgender (FTM). I fully identify as male, and feel masc. I plan on starting HRT. However, I still really like wearing feminine things?? I have gender/body dysphoria and I want to get surgery in the future. I fully believe in the philosophy that ""Clothes have no gender"", and I still wear traditionally ""feminine"" clothes like skirts, fishnets, crop tops, etc. My friend calls me a ""Femboy"" which I do not mind in the slightest. However I've had some people attack me for this. They've told me that I don't have actual dysphoria if I'm still wearing feminine clothes or makeup. They've told me I'm faking being trans. They've told me I'm not trans enough and I'll never pass.

Am I wrong for identifying as male but still wearing traditionally feminine clothes?? I keep being attacked for it and it's just been weighing me down. Can I get some random strangers' opinions on this before it drives me nuts?"	"Not at all! Your transition is your own and what you do is completely valid. Ignore the people attacking you, some people just love to drag others down. If you ever need to chat ill be here.
Their understanding of gender is super limited if they just think it’s about presentation.
I’m MTF but I have zero desire to wear super girly clothes like skirts and heels and stuff, but I’m still not ok with having a male body at all.

Cis and trans guys can be feminine and still be guys and cis and trans girls can be masculine and still be girls, it’s just called being a femboy or a tomboy.
Tell them you're going to wear what you want and they can get mad and cry about it all they want. How you express yourself is your business, and they should feel ashamed for making you doubt yourself.
Dysphoria manifests in many ways, and there is no one singular experience that can be classified as the definitive dysphoria experience. Trans men absolutely can still wear dresses/skirts/traditionally ""feminine"" clothing. You are no less trans for still enjoying these things. There are plenty of cis men who enjoy these things too, and they're not any less cis for it (though bigots may say they are). 

All the teasing (I'd call it bullying) you're experiencing is just people continuing to try and push classical gender ideas onto you, only as a man. Don't let other people tell you how to exist. 


Be yourself! That's the whole point of whatever transition you want to go through.
You do you man. Guys can be pretty my brother. Fuck anyone who tells you otherwise. I'm a cishet man with super pretty hair. Anyone who doesn't like it can stick it where they like. We'll form a pretty man alliance. <3
You aren't wrong at all. I'm mtf and I still use masculine clothes for a few reasons and I do feel dysphoria about my body, but my clothes doesn't make it worse at all. Clothes are just clothes, for me it's like music. What do they even mean by saying you're faking.. I mean...
(FTM dude here) Truscum will take any opportunity to gatekeep. Remember, the only real thing that defines your masculinity is *you*. You are you and you are not any less trans just because you’re sound enough in your masculinity to actually wear what *you* want. That’s honestly some true strength, my man. 

Also you could get some pepper gel and spray the hateful folks in the eyes. Sabrered is like $15 on Amazon. :)
People are idiots. the people saying things like that are going to be worried about their own masculinity and shit, they don’t see that it’s ok to be more feminine. 

It’s like when a girl wears guys clothes. Someone smacks a tomboy on them even when it’s just clothes. You don’t have to fit the gender norms of clothing because clothes have no gender and they are more preferences. Guys can wear skirts and still be called a guy, a girl can wear polos and still be a girl. Your clothing doesn’t defy the gender or person. Be you and kick those assholes to Mars. 😂
Im just like you! You are doing great, there’s nothing wrong with what you’re doing, you’re rocking it and being yourself and that’s beautiful!!
Wow those people sound awful. You can wear what ever you want. I'm transfem but wear ""guys"" shirts or so the tag says but who cares. If it feels comfortable then wear it
If you're talking to cis people about stuff like this, there is a good chance they can't understand you. It'd be like talking about non-Euclidean geometry to people who just learned what a triangle was.

To me, clothes just have a certain feel. Wearing a skirt is totally different than wearing shorts. If you like the look and feel, that is all that really matters.

People like to fit things in little boxes. Almost nothing fits neatly into them. Clothing, personalities, genders, sexualities, none of those fit neatly.
It's very common for trans men to still like ""feminine"" clothing. Be true to yourself, it dosnt make you any less valid.
Check r/FTMfemininity, you are not alone :)
You sound like the most adorable flamboyant gay boy. I know so many trans f2m people that as soon as they got top surgery they felt SO much more comfortable wearing femme clothes. There is nothing wrong with that. And it doesn't make your gender any less valid.
I, personally, look at it this way. You can wear whatever you want if you like the look of it. That's just it. Everybody is different. You have the privilege to wear what you want, so do whatever you think fits best!
It's not nearly as easy to do as it is to say, but live your life presenting how you want. Fashion is fun, expressing yourself is fun. Don't let anyone take that away. When I started transitioning I dropped it all, not because I was no longer into the goth fem aesthetic, but because it was easier to pass as a bland dude. It's been years down the line now, and I'm only just now venturing into painting my nails again. People are assholes, but don't think for a minute that dressing femininely makes you any less of a man or means you will never pass. Once you give it up entirely, it's really hard to leave the safe bubble and get it back.
so here’s the thing— you are not wrong, they are simply under-informed about dysphoria.

there are actually two basic kinds of gender dysphoria, body dysphoria and social dysphoria, and it’s totally possible to experience one without the other. while it is fairly common to see trans folks express high levels of both forms of dysphoria, you might well have a lot of dysphoria over your actual body not matching your gender identity, but have no issue with presenting as more feminine because, as you said, gender is a construct and clothes don’t inherently have a gender. same as cisgender men can wear feminine clothes and makeup and not be any less cisgender for it, you are no less male for wanting to look feminine.

on the other hand, some ppl have less body dysphoria and more issue with being perceived/addressed differently than they identify (aka a dysphoria-driven desire to “pass”, and experiencing a lot of discomfort when misgendered). it’s all a matter of experience, and your identity is valid no matter what your appearance is. if you’re a dude you’re a dude, who cares if you want to wear feminine clothes. 

hope this clarification helps :))
 You’re completely valid. It doesn’t matter what you wear, as long as you identify as a man, you are a man. Anyone telling you that trans men can’t wear feminine clothing and enjoy feminine things is full of shit. Keep doing what makes you happy, king!
Femboys are still boys. Liking feminine things doesn’t make you a woman, cis or trans. The qualities to be boi is the want to be boi. Anyone saying otherwise has toxic masculinity/femininity ideals.
There is no wrong way to be trans, no wrong way to transition. Even with the flood of new words to describe nonbinary genders we have, those words can still only hint at our complex lived experiences. You're a boy who likes feminine things. That's fine, and the people who mock and invalidate you are insecure about their own genders.
Ask yourself, why do you care so much about what other people think about how you should present yourself? Why do you care about redditors opinions?
You might be “wrong” for identifying as male, or you may be right, no one else can make this determination but you. The fact that you are even formulating your question this way shows that you still have some work to do to discover yourself and mature. You shouldn’t let guilt or shame guide your decisions. Right/wrong, black and white thinking won’t guide you well in life. 

If I were you, I would take time away from social media / trans community, just to reflect without pressure. What do you want? Is what you want coming from within or are you in love with the idea of being trans? Is the inclination towards being a man with feminine clothes all coming from within or are trying to emulate someone else? There’s no such thing as being man enough, woman enough, trans enough etc. And if some people set standards for others, who cares, really. No one should. If you have a chance to travel, for real or virtually, go meet other cultures. You’ll realize that European or Asian women with short hair are standard and no one automatically thinks that they are lesbians. You’ll realize that most women in the world do not wear or own makeup and no one blinks an eye. You’ll realize that men come in all shapes and forms, big biceps, no biceps, fat, lean, tall, short, etc. Some wear flannel shirts, some wear silk shirts. Some, like my previous bf, wear dresses. I’m a woman and I used to raid his closet when I wanted to wear more feminine looking clothes (I’m a woman, I just dress rather neutral/masculine most of the time). Bottom line: you are allowed to be as vanilla or as exuberant as you wish. 

You seem to be a young person still, so don’t rush, you have plenty of time to discover yourself and become whoever you want to be, with or without a medical transition, and especially without letting someone else dictate your future, even if they are in the trans or queer community. Their life is not your life. Choose for yourself
you can dress how you want but if you're pre everything and dress fem dont be surprised when people misgender you
Yes
Ah, you gotta despise people who still look at piles of fabric as something that ""confirms someone's gender"" or whatever is in their minds... You are absolutely correct to say clothes have no gender, as well as makeup, because IT. LITERALLY. DOESN'T. MATTER! I hate how there are people out there who believe transguys should be ""ultra masculine"" to be a ""proper man"" or again, whatever is in their heads. Bro, CONTINUE TO DO YOU! YOU CAN BE AS PRETTY OF A FEMBOY AS YOU WANNA BE, BECAUSE YOU! ARE! STILL! A! GUY! Don't let those idjits get ya down, they're just too stuck on fabrics having sexual meaning, and the strict gender binary in general. I just despise this double standard, so I apologize if I got too intense.. It's just that nobody bats an eye at CIS femboys, because they already have a dick... Terrible double standard everywhere you look....
There’s enough shame in this world, there’s no need to ask people to feel ashamed. If they understand, they will self correct, and if they do not, ostracizing people is not a good communication strategy. Anyway, even if they made silly comments, they didn’t make OP doubt themselves - it’s OP that started having doubts based on those comments, and doubt is healthy. It forces OP to reflect and proves to OP that there’s room to grow and understand themselves better. 

Btw, It’s a little off topic but I would like to point out that a friend’s daughter (she’s 10) recently came out to her mother as NB. Sometimes she’s a “she”, sometimes a “they” and mum supports all of it. Recently, that child, who likes to wear dresses and nail polish in her “she” phases, asked mum if it was appropriate, fearing that wearing nail polish or pink dresses would make them “not NB enough”. Turns out, that idea of “not being enough” came from queer/LGBT circles that that young child was spending time interacting with virtually. Plain wrong if you ask me. Unfortunately some NB kids themselves don’t have enough maturity to promote true acceptance and to let go of stereotypes (the “queer” stereotype can be as harmful to immature minds as the general gender stereotypes). So in that case, making the child doubt and seek out mum’s guidance was good, as mum could validate her kid and teach them to think by themselves
Btw, cis people don’t fit into little boxes either. I’m a cis and hetero woman, and my ex bf (also cis) and I had “inverted wardrobes”. He had more and better dresses, flowy flowery clothes than me. I usually dress like a tomboy. I never doubted his masculinity, and he never doubted my femininity. 
Food for thought. Don’t put everyone non-trans in the same basket :-)
What does this mean?
Yes, actually I agree with what you wrote. I think I was just reacting to some recent posts in my social circles that start with “Hey cis folks!” and go on to be two-page lectures about how harmful and insensitive cis people are, bla bla bla, and what cis folks should do instead. Boo. Of course everyone says Amen and no one dares say anything slightly contradictory. 
I understand that you didn’t think like that and I apologize for being out of topic. 
Thank you for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it.
What I meant by my first point was: without the experience of being gender non-conforming, people can sympathize, but most fatally struggle to empathize. My last point was: in any category that you make, you will have exceptions. I'm not good at converting my thoughts into words, so I understand that my first comment is interpreted differently than the sentiment I meant to put behind it.

As you can tell by this comment, if I don't leave glaring holes in my statements, I get way to wordy."	pda5j2	trans	147	0.99	2021-08-28 13:52:44
My name is Azreil I am an 18 year old trans guy (FTM) he/him I know I’m trans but my dad is starting to make me second guess everything	I have recently been approved or am going to be approved to start Testosterone soon, which I am super excited about but also nervous at the same time which is to be expected. But the other day I was talking to my dad about how excited I am about transitioning and he kept telling me that I am not trans and the only reason I feel like this is cause of the internet and stuff. He also says I will regret transitioning because I kept swiping my pronouns around a lot because I thought I was gender fluid and I was experimenting with my identity. But I’m starting to wonder what if he’s right and I will regret transitioning one day and if I do what to I do then?	"The chances of you going through years of questioning and the effort to jump through medical hoops and actually just be a cis person who has somehow tricked your brain into thinking you're trans is... astronomically low.

It sounds like your father just read ""Irreversible Damage: the Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters"" and is regurgitating those bullshit talking points.

What's more likely, you are unconsciously faking, or he doesn't know your brain as well as you do?
you know yourself better than he does. if the thought of transitioning makes you happy, you're not faking. to be faking something, you have to TRY to fake it. and the rates of trans people regretting transition is incredibly low. it sounds like your dad just wants you to not be trans and to prevent you from transitioning. also, knowing about being trans from the internet isn't isn't bad thing. many of us wouldn't know about being trans if it wasn't for the internet, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't still BE trans. we just wouldn't know what it was and would be miserable. also, congrats on starting t soon and good luck with your transition!!! starting out is a bit scary, but it'll be amazing. transitioning has been incredible for me and many others, and I hope it is for you too!!!!
What if he's wrong and it's the best choice you ever made?

Early in my transition I started doubting and second guessing myself a lot, I came to this later in life, 37, but seeing the arc of my life it was clear and I had that to look at, then think what my life was like before and ask if it's better to go nack how I was, miserable, or keep trying for what could be a better life. I kept going, choosing to risk being a new me and maybe happy, instead of bad to constant emotional numbness and depression.

Transition is HARD, others will doubt you, you will doubt yourself, you will have terrible next tier imposter syndrome, you will question yourself a lot. You will think of turning back, maybe life was easier before.

But, here's the thing about being trans, you will also wonder and doubt yourself if you turn back. Maybe that better life existed, maybe you gave up your chance, maybe you actually would have been happier if you'd gone through with it.

Maybe you too wake up 37 with regret at a life that never was because someone else thought they knew better than you about yourself.

Only you know. This choicd involves no one else, and you choose how much their opinion matters or not, I specifically did not seek out my Father's advice because he for sure would be against it with no knowledge and then seek bias research to influence me. He was the last to know 8 months after already being on HRT.

This is you, and no one else.

You can also start, and always have the option to just stop. Some changes will be with you forever, but, if those changes start to happen and they excite you and euphoria kicks in, well, maybe you decide it's all worth it.

Only you get to decide this. Just you.
If you get hrt, don‘t you have a therapist who helps you? That would be a valuable help.  
If you have severe doubts, know you can transition at any age. You can take an extra week or extra year to feel confident what to do.  

I made a check list of all possible reasons why people (supposedly) stopped transition or detransitioned to whatever degree and thought about wether those things applied to me. Even the most silly ones. That helped a ton. :-)  
Like: do I want hrt to fix anything else than body dysphoria?, did abuse play a role that I don’t identify with women? could I possibly have internalized misogyny or hate women? Did someone tell me I cannot be a woman (lol)? Etc.  

Are you [informed](http://www.ftmguide.org) about all the changes and which ones last? Transitioning is a slow process and you can stop hrt at any time. You can take each change and make an action plan for it, for example:  

Voice changes and hair growth would be 
lasting and among the ealiest changes (butt hair more likely than a beard at first), what do I do if I don‘t like them? Is it *likely* that I won‘t like them?  

Possible answers:  
Unlikely, I dreamt of a low voice and hair since I was a kid. I could pay attention to myself, how I feel about the changes and stop asap if they freak me out.  
I can inform myself about hair removal options and voice feminization practice. Could I deal with being a gnc woman with fuzz & deep voice? Probably, I was always gnc.
Whether he's purposely or accidentally scaring you don't let someone else tell you who you are. If you don't already have a therapist you should definitely see one and bring this up. Trust me starting HRT for me was kind of nerve wracking because I'm definitely scared of change as it's something I can't control. However, I was so excited by the thought of my body changing (feminizing in my case) and my mind feeling like I'm not constantly at war with myself or my body that it finally felt like the only logical solution. For me this has been the case.

If you still need to figure things out that's okay but remember it's your identity so make sure it's you who is deciding who you are and don't let anybody try to tell you who you are.
21yo MTF here. Our parents are gen Xers. Unless they intentionally exposed themselves to trans perspectives or are just extremely open minded, they don't really get it. My parents have made that extremely clear as I've come out to them, and said similar things. I've been sent detransition articles and stuff about the ""side effects"" of HRT.

Luckily for me, they were still open minded enough to listen and learn, and over time theyve calmed down. I hope your father is like this. But obviously, we're not quite the same, and I know you've probably been out far longer than me because of how difficult it is to get T in comparison to E. So, idk.

Another thing I found helpful was stressing the gradual process of HRT and how I could stop at any point if the changes scared me. Now, you and I both know we won't with relative certainty, but I think it helped my parents to know that their ""what if youre wrong"" question actually had a pretty reasonable solution. ""If I'm wrong I'll know once things start to change, and I will realize before they change too drastically."" Heck, remembering this helps me when I start questioning myself.

Ultimately, if you need to, drop contact to only whats necessary (at least for a while). That should make him realize that he needs to choose between keeping you in his life and being stubborn and close-minded. That doesn't mean he'll choose the right thing, but I think its a good shot because of how it makes him really think about what he wants in life in regards to you.

Also, since we seem to be in a similar sorta situation, if you ever wanted to chat my DMs are open :)

All of that questioning and using different pronouns is part of the process of figuring out who you are.

Only you get to decide who you really are.
from one child of a ""I dont want you to ruin your life; but I actually mean I am not ready to support you and I want you to remain the same for my sake"" parent to another, please, dont let his input sway your desicion.

you're doing this to make yourself happy and more comfy in your own skin; it's okay if you have your own doubts but your dad's opinion does not deserve to have the same value as your own opinion on your *own* body.
Thank you everyone for all your awesome comments I feel a lot better and more sure of myself now happy transitioning to all of you and I wish y’all a safe and happy life
Sounds like you didn't ghost him the moment he reacted badly. Best to do so asap, and come back in a few years.
Wrong sub but your father is the a**hole he I toxic and you are fine
I switched identities and pronouns for myself for years even when I wasn't out to anyone just because I didn't feel cis, it's normal to question things and now I'm 20 and I'm very certain about who I am, and I'm not cis. The internet I think HAS influenced some people to try to be trans but I think that that’s actually a very low number of people, and if you've been feeling like this for years and you're excited for the changes I don't think you're pretending or you'll regret it
Wait you're letting someone else tell you how you feel? Quit that nonsense and start exploring how you feel. Don't let others sway you so easily.
Hi Azreil ! Don't forget that doubting is legit. It's a normal thing and not knowing everything about yourself is valid. Doubt can be caused by many emotions and events too! You already a lot of things I'm about to say but :
(SO SORRY IT'S SO LONGG)

1 - Many ppl will try to shame you, being invalidating and ""evaluate"" your transness in such a rude way. Which is fucked up knowing that you're probably in a bad mental state because of dysphoria and that confusing-ass li(e)fe. and that's NONE of their business. No every trans person has the same sensitivity so it's easier for some of them to break down. But what's sure is that, it feels like our questioning is being used against us and mocked for sure.
The cheat code is basically doing whatever the F you want once you're an adult and see who tf ""regrets"" being such a gatekeeping boomer afterwards. 

2 - I know comparing is bad but, I'm also very nervous about going on HRT even if the dream has been keeping me alive for years. I don't know when I'll finally reach that goal but, when I think about how painful life is right know because of dysphoria, I know it's the right thing to do. 

3 - And if you're not sure at the moment it's ok. If you say you're a dude, you're a dude. But you could also be genderfluid, cis, non-binary, etc. Whenever you like. Every identity in that community is ok, under hormones or not. 
But the question is, are you interested in the effects HRT could give you? Would they make you euphoric? 

These are the questions I ask myself whenever I doubt about myself when people take me down. 

Hope I helped a bit haha
That’s a tight name
well if youve been a trans guy for a while and youve decided you want to be this way then you can go through with it if you want, but if you have just decided then you might want to wait a little to make sure. whatever path you choose, i wish you luck.
100% agree ^^^
The issue is he didn’t even say anything when I came out and the only time he ever actually says anything is when my mom isn’t there but that’s not often cause I don’t live with my parents and my dad just came down by himself
Ugh, the previous generations suck. My dad was the same, all nice one minute and as soon as he can talk freely he's all scathing
Oh yeah my boyfriend wants to know if you wanna be friends
Yeah…
Sure 😊 who'd say no, honestly

I came out to my family and I feel worse	"CW: transphobia

So, I told my family I've been questioning for a long time and that I'm now starting to medically transition. 

I thought they would be fairly accepting and they've always been supportive of trans rights when I've talked about it before, so I felt lucky and comfortable coming out to them.

They were fine and supportive, except for my mom who said she'd always love me and wanted to support me but proceeded to throw out a ton of transphobic points.

She said she always thought of me as a boy and always would, told me I was making it up because I want to be oppressed because I like being the underdog (???).

She said I'd never pass because I'm too tall and have manly hands etc, said I had masculine hobbies (like video games, lmao).

She said she didn't want me to be verbally or physically abused and she would worry about it (yes, because the trauma of a parent not accepting your identity is much better).

And basically concluded with the old classic ""trans women aren't real women"".



I'm just devastated because I really thought she understood and was accepting of trans people, and even said she ""accepts"" me and would always love me. 
I thought it would be great to get it off my chest but now it feels like it weighs heavier.

I wish I hadn't told her yet and I'd just gone ahead with transitioning because now I'm SO full of doubt and imposter syndrome that I'm considering just cancelling my appointments.

Anyway, I just wanted your guys thoughts and support on this. I know it's nothing new for us and I recognise I'm lucky to have an otherwise supportive family but this still really sucks.

(My name is Eden (she/her) if you want to give affirmations (pls do))"	"Oh hon, I'm so sorry!

A few things come to mind:

* Give her time to process. She is going to need to do a lot of reading, possibly find support groups to talk about stuff, and that's a good and helpful thing. 
* Find someone that she knows personally and likes, who is super trans supportive and at least somewhat informed - they may be better able to hear these things from an outside voice.
* I'd start with sending her links to positive articles intended for parents of newly out trans folk. ""How to be supportive of your transgender child and WHY it's so important"", etc.
* IF after reading a bunch of those + time (whatever you feel is appropriate - but I'd suggest at least a month) - send her links about how NOT supporting trans people leads to high rates of suicide - that her negative behavior (which would include not using your chosen name and correct pronouns) - could lead to a much worse outcome than ALL of the negative things that SHE is worried about.
* Process and make peace with the fact that she may not come around, or that it may take a long time, and it may be one tiny piece at a time. Definitely process this stuff with a therapist if you have access.
I think many cisgender people have no idea what is possible in a transition but most likely her response is entirely emotional.  It sounds like she thinks being trans is a choice.  Maybe she’ll realize it’s not something we can turn off.  She can’t protect you from people not liking who you are and forcing you to change yourself in some way to accommodate others is just wrong.  We can decided not to transition but that often leaves us unwell in other ways.
I LOOOOOOVE when video games are brought up as being a masculine hobby. My sister literally texted me this morning that she got home from work and my mum was cursing at Diablo 3. My sister loves the Grand Theft Auto series. Gtfoh with that lol I happen to play a lot more games but it doesn’t make me any less feminine.
Eden is such a beautiful name for a beautiful woman. Who is very real!

Seek your own happiness, this doubt is external not internal, don't let her idiocy shake your sense of self. Estrogen changed my life in that it made me able to live, I hope it changes yours too.
Ah yes, the famous ""I love whatever you are, but because you're trans, you're dead to me""
she seems to think being trans is a choice. And if she says all these things her opinion isnt worth being taken if you ask me.
Mine was the same way. Initially accepting/confused, but then started telling me all the reasons why it wouldn’t work. I’ve tried to discuss recently but she just gets worked up and blatantly tells me she doesn’t want to try to understand.

It’s frustrating. I hope for the best :(
God, same here sister. Same thing happened to me when I came out to my mother. Granted, I'm likely younger than you (15), but there is one thing that I can say. Your other family (at least from what you said) seem like they fully support and accept you. While I don't have much advice to give you, I think the fact that the rest if your family was good with it is a great sign. Again, not trying to take away from what she said (My mom said the same things, it honestly sucks to hear those things from your own mother) but I think she does still love you, and hopefully  things will get better and she'll hopefully come around some day. I wish you the best of luck Eden! Stay strong! Your sisters here are always here to support you!
I'm not good with advice or anything, but Eden is such a pretty name! You got this girl! ❤️🥰🌸
Im so sorry about that Eden )): if your family can't see you as the great woman you are than they don't deserve to anyways okay ? I understand unsupportive families are shitty, the things they're telling you are very false. You are a real woman and you don't deserve this treatment in the slightest. I sincerely hope things get better for you.
My mom had a horrible reaction to my coming out (FtM).

I've learned over the years that a lot of it was fear, and a lot of it still is fear.  And while I can't fully rest all her fears, just being a steady show to her that the fears are fueling her reactions and responses have brought her around a bit.

Now, saying that, it is quite an emotional undertaking to have done (and still do) that.  If there comes a point that it's best for you to step back and remove yourself from the emotional weight and hurt that brings...always do that.  Keep yourself safe above all things.

A few things I have to constantly remind myself for perspective:

I've known my whole life I was trans.  Maybe not ""trans"" as I didn't know the term until around 99-2000, but that something didn't sit right with my gender.

My mind turned this over 24/7/365, and by the time it was too much and I let it out, it was a geyser of relief to FINALLY say it.

And when the response was ""What? No."" I was absolutely crushed.  Like your mom, my mom was very androgynous, damn near masculine but proudly touted she was a woman that could ""do everything a man could and more"".  So to my mom, you could be a masculine woman.  You could do everything a man can and still be a woman...why would I say I'm a man...that didn't make sense.

It's been my mind 24/7/365 and I had to come to realize to them, I dropped an nuke on them out of the blue.  People are very good at rationalizing to themselves and I basically took away my mom's entire lifetime of me in her perception in an instant.  And it was immediately flooded by fear, her religion, her fear again.

Time.  It's the absolute most important part of the entire process.  For you, and for them.  Give them time to come to terms with the information that is new to them.  And give yourself time to breathe and calm.

My mom went from ""You'll burn in hell, it's an unholy abomination of god"" to randomly sending texts that says ""What's the weather today, weatherman, Shane?"" (my preferred name).  She still doesn't say my name in person, and every now and then she's made remarks about ""I wish you would get over this already""  But they've always come at times of extreme fear and stress for her.

I've had a very long journey through therapy to get to where I am and it's allowed me to give my mom a massive berth of grace in her responses towards me as I know she suffers as well with mental health but comes from the generation of ""it's just nerves"".

If you can do therapy, I absolutely recommend it.  Even if the entire thing isn't focused on your transition, it will help immensely to be able to vent to someone who is there to listen and offer perspective you may not think of when you're worked up and angry.  It's helped me immensely deal with my anger and depression.

Give everyone time to process and move from there.  It may take weeks, months, (in my case) years.  I had the added layer of having an identical twin so I felt I was effectively erasing my twin's identity without her consent...but she's been the absolute most supportive of all.  

Sorry for the novel.  I just want to know I've been there.  You know who you are.  Be you.  They're just meeting who you've known your whole life, it will take time.
Hey Eden, sorry to hear you had this experience and that your mom sucks. I had a fairly similar experience with my mother (except I knew she was transphobic from the beginning). Honestly, I think there’s no better way to flush out transphobia than to see how people respond to their child, parent, spouse, or partner coming out as trans - people are often far more able to superficially accept transness outside the family.

Don’t cancel your appointments. Your future self will be upset if you do. And at the end of the day, don’t let your mom’s reactions influence your actions and decisions. When she’s dead (and for all the time before then!), you’re the one who is going to have to live with yourself. Don’t hesitate to set boundaries as needed. I catered to my transphobic mother for years, cared about her needs and wants over my own, and delayed coming out so she could have the child that she wanted for a little longer - and when I finally came out, she definitely did not have even a fraction of that level of consideration for me. I now regret waiting so long.
I’m so sorry Eden. 
Don’t cancel your appointments, you’ll get through this and feel better after. 
Try not to listen to the hurtful things she said while trying to convince you not to proceed, they aren’t true. She’s afraid and will take time to process and understand. It’s going to be ok.
Eden is a lovely name!

I hope she comes around and gets on board with being actually supportive. 

I personally am just trucking along and have made it clear to my parents that they can catch up when they like. I’m almost 40, though, and an only child, so if they want a bitch to come do all sorts of home maintenance stuff and whatnot, they don’t have much choice but to get themselves right! 😂
Well it's going to get worse before it gets better but cheer up. Because nothing should be more important to you than you and your Divine connection to yourself, and who you are and learning to love yourself learning to see yourself in others learning to love others you have to love your family you know but they're not always going to accept the way You are that's their karmic battle that they have to go through in order to understand their own feelings or so;their development of their spiritual evolution. So therefore worry about your own spiritual evolution and be true to yourself all the while loving them no matter how much they don't accept you.
Eden, we’re much in a similar situation ourself, of “supportive” in someways, but transphobic in others. Our father is extremely supportive of medical transitioning as he realizes it makes us happy, but is strongly disapproving of name and pronoun changing, as he will “always see us as his daughter/deadname”, because that’s what he decided I am. That even if I could have a “real man body”, he could never change how he sees us. And as for my mother… that’s a losing battle against a wall. Yeah, she’s pro-gay rights, but otherwise finds gender identity silly as “biological sex” is all that matters, and that gender non-conforming people are “gross”. 

I sometimes wish that they would actually disown me or hate me, so I could cut them out of my heart. But the partial support is the agony of holding out hope they may one day change.

You don’t have to have feminine hobbies, be short, or have small hands to be a woman. You don’t have to be in the closet just to avoid transphobic violence. Transitioning is to make your life bearable, and you *know* it will make you feel better, Eden. Even if no one in your life sees you as a woman (which I find doubtful), know that we do.
No shit you feel worse, that sounds awful! However they might mellow as time passes. There comes a realisation that you either love and accept your child, or nobody will come see you at the care home down the line. Their feelings aren't somehow superior to your identity. Keep a cool head for now, this is gonna be bumpy, but things change. And you definitely, for sure are already amazing and going to only grow into a more comfortable, happier self as you follow your path now. The sweetest victory is being happy despite what other people think.
hello eden! im sure your mum will come round to your way of thinking soon! don't worry, you'll always have the community holding you up if you need us to, for now, stay strong, you got this! go girl <3
Thanks so much, I think this all sounds like good and relevent advice, particularly giving her time. I do think she means the best but just doesn't understand she's being transphobic yet, so educating her is a great step on the right direction.
Hey Eden, I just wanna add that while all of this is super helpful, it’s NOT your responsibility to educate other people. Especially right now when it sounds like maybe your energy would be better spent looking after yourself. But that’s your call. Either way, sending hugs. Thank you for being your beautiful self. You’re truly a blessing to this world.
I think part of her attitude comes from her being quite androgynous herself. She's said before she used to love being mistaken for a boy, she's always had short hair and uses the gender neutral nickname of her name.
I think she felt it was a choice for her so must be choice for others.

And you're right, I'm sure her main exposure to trans people has been from largely transphobic media so she's just uneducated.
Honestly most trans people think the same things before their egg finally cracks.... I wouldn't expect a cis person to get it right away either...
It's so funny like, it's an entire medium??
Pretty sure it's a neutral hobby when it comes to gender these days anyway.
Also flashbacks to when a supposedly supportive friend said I had ""only feminine hobbies"" because I sometimes paint stuff.... I should have asked him to name some female painters because the asshole probably didnt know any. I know it's because of misogyny but all the most famous painters are men.
Thank you so much:) I really needed this.
I definitely recognise how lucky I am to have an otherwise supportive family and the support this community has shown me means the world too. We got this, sis:)
You're right, I've heard these points a thousand times before and I know they're not true but it's especially hard hearing them from someone I love. 

Thank you for the support.
You've got this. Reach out to community whenever you need help! <3
Uh….

There is a non-zero chance that this is making her VERY uncomfortable right now, for reasons she can’t fully explain. 

Sometimes having an adult child come out forces a parent to re-examine themselves, and their egg cracks. 

Not saying this is what’s up, but it is absolutely within the realm of possibility.
Yeah maybe in the 90s/early 2000’s it was male dominant, or us girls were just more quiet enjoying the medium. Tbf we still are really quiet, but more open about playing. A good majority of my online friends are women that play Overwatch together ffs. It’s such a ridiculous assertion that I can’t help but laugh whenever it comes up. 

If they support you regardless of their feelings, they’ll most likely come around when they recognize how serious you are and how much happier it makes you. My mum was about the same with the supporting but not entirely with it? She really wanted me to think about it and I’m sure she was hoping it was a phase I’d leave behind, texted her a month later and her response to how much happier I seem brought her around more I think. It’s hard to know for sure but she seems even more supportive than before. 

This turned into a lot longer of a message than I expected, but I wish you the best Eden. You got this love, whether they come around or not <3
This! Focus on the good parts 😊💜👍
You said it. I know she'll come around to you Eden! Good luck with your journey!
Totally, I think I lot of gals are put off by the culture around it (including myself) so there's not much visibility.
It is such a laughable argument though like, girls aren't allowed to enjoy entertainment??

I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts and experience, thank you <3
Yep dudes will harass women until they stop playing or hide the fact that they're women then it seems like its ""only men"""	sab579	trans	146	0.99	2022-01-22 20:20:03
How do you guys feel about this, I’m a bit conflicted.		"100% positive. I'm happy for them saying they're living their best life on testosterone and willing to answer questions about what taking T is like, which is incredibly beneficial to the trans community. I've noticed that cisgender people are more willing to listen seriously to other cisgender people on these topics. There's nothing wrong at all with someone who doesn't identify as FtM taking testosterone; it's just medicine
Makes sense, testosterone has a huge role in muscular and bone production. Glad that it helped them recover and cool that they made a disclaimer that they're not identifying as trans nor speaking on behalf of trans folks yet seems to be knowledgeable about what it means to be trans. what a cool post. Sorry you're conflicted, OP :( I liked it, was interesting
I think it's great that T was helpful for them, and I'm not going to police the language someone uses for themselves, but that isn't really what trans means. It doesn't mean transitioning from one thing to another, it means ""on the other side of."" Someone whose gender identity is ""on the other side"" of their assigned sex, or their assigned sex and gender don't align. Transition isn't necessary to be trans, and doesn't make someone trans. So maybe they don't identify with their sex assigned at birth, I can't make that assumption, but it seems like they're promoting an inaccurate idea of what being trans is.
I dont think they should be answering questions about trans people.
I mean. I think it’s great that they’re open about their condition and how being on T has influenced their life. I don’t like how they said they are “divulging trans secrets” when it seems like they aren’t trans nor do they say whether or not they are queer in some other aspect.
Good for that person I reckon but this has nothing to do with being trans so I see no connection? So I don’t understand why they’re speaking on trans stuff?
I’m sorry if this came out rudely I didn’t mean it to; good for them tho
Honestly...needs more context. I'd want to have a conversation with this person to get a better picture of what's going on. Based on the limited info, it feels like they were kinda uninformed. Like, doctors said they had to take T for a disease completely unrelated to gender, and in response either they or their parents or both thought, ""Well, I guess that means boy,"" even though they never identified that way. Not sure that means they're actually cis though...I would think that having to take so much T that it changes your physiology would be pretty detrimental to a cis woman's mental health. But again, not really enough info there so 🤷‍♀️
Btw I posted this as “help me understand” things rather that “look at this transphobia”. 

I don’t know the whole picture because the replies to the comments are avoiding/vague,but I’m not accusing this person of transphobia.
Whatever makes them happy. They have the freedom to do whatever they want with their body and identity
""I've never understood the concept of gender""

Non binary much?
Interesting
I'm a tad confused on their gender identity / gender expression, but this comes across as just positive. It makes me think of how hormone treatment and other stuff that often gets gatekept as exclusive to trans people's healthcare is actually something a lot of cis people can benefit from. Gender affirming care is for everyone who has a gender to affirm and care for. So no matter what's op's identity, I'm glad they are living their best life
It’s medical, I see no issue. And they didn’t mind it so I think it’s a good thing. If they’re living a good life, who am I to judge?
Was this person just coincidentally trans?
This is in line with everything we as a whole tend to stand for. Sex has nothing to do with gender. Everyone should be able to present or identify with whatever best suits them. The gender nonconforming are valid in their presentation.

  
Here we have someone who does not care about gendered norms/sex, and is just doing what they can to be healthy. This is a 10/10
They’re just talking about their experience
If this person isn't suffering from crippling dysphoria from this then they're not cis, the body image issues this would cause a cis woman would be as bad as trans dysphoria. Sounds like they're just naturally agendered, mentally.
idk how this is triggering unless youre believe humans actual biology is a binary, which isnt true at all
its awesome :) we share every experience (hrt, questioning your gender, the medical experience, the community) up to out identity. i share thst with transgender people of other identities, cisgender people who detransitioned, etc
Oh I know, it more of them saying they transitioned to male when in reality they’re just taking T. 

I mean they could be nonbinary, but if they aren’t a trans man or nonbinary then I’d think it’s kinda weird for them to consider themself a trans person.

Personally it would be great if more cis people talked about taking hormones because it would really normalize it for both trans and cis people alike.
so nonbinary people arent trans?

trans just means transition. you transitioned away from your birthgender!
So I really see two possibilities 1 is shining a light on how stupid a lot of this discourse has gotten in the main stream

Or it’s clickbait
They’ve never confirmed it. 

I mean it’s only “problematic” if they aren’t trans because they said they want to disclose “trans secrets”, aka speak on the trans community. 

I think it’s very important for cis people who take hormones to encourage conversation about it as that benefits them and trans people because it gets rid of stigma, but if they’re a cis person talking on behalf of the trans community just because they’re taking T then there’s some issues.
Gnc doesn’t equal trans.

Sure they can speak for the gnc community as a cis gnc person, but they shouldn’t speak for the trans community if they aren’t trans. 

I mean if they’re nonbinary then yeah what they’re saying is great, but if not then frankly them disclosing “trans secrets” is a bit ehhhh ya know
You dont need to be dysphoric to be trans. Just because they’re not dysphoric doesn’t mean they’re nb. Regardless, as long as theyre happy with it, then good for them :)
Bad take
Did you really just say that you have to have dysphoria to be cis? I mean ok I guess. (damn people can’t even call themselves cis these days without y’all getting angry)
The thing is op essentially refuses to elaborate on wether or not they are apart of the trans community, and when asked if they were nonbinary they brushed it off with a “I’ll get back to you later”. 

I suppose the problem I’d have with it is if op is a cis woman taking T and saying she’s a part of a the trans community.
The only issue is, op hasn’t actually confirmed they’re trans, aka nonbinary in this case, so they’re essentially speaking on behalf of the trans community despite possibly being cis.
I see where you're coming from now! Personally the title feels more clickbait-y than transphobic-y to me, but I can see how it might be interpreted badly
I mean, wouldn't NOT saying they transitioned to male give grounds for saying that everyone else who takes T is just a ""female on testosterone"" as well or something?
If you take ""male"" and ""female"" as sex terms and ""man"" and ""woman"" as gender terms, then the way they said it is accurate. Testosterone will transition a person to the male sex, regardless of whether they're transgender. (Though this person sounds agender to me, so still transgender.)
Where did I say that? Nonbinary people don't identify with their sex assigned at birth. Trans, as a prefix, means ""on the other side of."" Cis means ""on the same side of."" It's a misconception that trans means ""transition,"" although transition is important for a lot of trans people.
They aren't speaking for the trans community. You asked how we felt about it, I stated that we should support this because it aligns with everything we promote
I do wonder whether there are people out there whose minds would be just fine on either hormone profile. I guess they'd be neurologically ambigender or something.
so, this is a really complex problem lol I am viewed by the general public as a cis man, i am “afab” so to trans people i am viewed as a trans man. By proxy i am a part of the trans community, we need eachother to survive and i have no problems iding with transness as a movement, it means alot to me. but if we were all actually talking about how i feel on an individual level towards the binarist concept of cis vs trans i have a lot of issues viewing this problem in that manner. There are systemic problems with viewing this as a cis vs trans issue… theres a premise here that validates colonial white dominant views of sex as legitimate… which is the problem trans people are dealing with to begin with… not only are trans people dealing with this oppression, “cis” people are as well because binary sex is a violent unnatural system hurting all of us in different ways… i think simplifying this is a mistake and it does a lot of good of recognizing where our oppression originated from and ways we can deconstruct our own biases no matter how much they deviate from accepted norms
Oh yeah like I said I don’t want to accuse them of anything, especially if it’s completely accidental, because we don’t have the whole picture yet. 

I mean either way it’s definitely a curious experience on their side I bet.
thing is, testosterone is often part of treatment for menopause symptoms so there's already a known medical reason for cis women to take testosterone (im aware the person in the post isn't taking it for menopause)
> ""It doesn't mean transitioning from one thing to another, it means ""on the other side of.""

That sounds like a gender binary, two sides to a coin, opposites -- youre either a girl or you go to the other side and youre a boy or vice versa. I am 'nonbinary' in a way and i do not at all fit into  how you are defining this

Transitioning from one thing to another includes everyone. Trans for transition, you've transitioned from female to male, from male to nonbinary, from \*birth gender\* to genderqueer or whatever other combination you

I dont feel like i've transitioned to the other side of my birth gender. While the original term transsexual was coined as trans via latin, since at the time (1910's) there was quite widely only male or female, we have expanded FAR further and there is no opposite anymore ... unless of course you're a biological essentialist
Fair point!
That's what the prefix trans- literally means. It's used in other words too. The thing all trans people have in common is not identifying with their sex assigned at birth; their gender identity is NOT ""on the same side"" of their assigned sex, regardless of whether their gender identity is binary or nonbinary. 

>Transitioning from one thing to another includes everyone. Trans for transition, you've transitioned from female to male, from male to nonbinary, from *birth gender* to genderqueer or whatever other combination you

It really does not, since there are trans people who don't transition. What matters is that their identity isn't the same as their assigned sex. 

>unless of course you're a biological essentialist

I feel like you're misunderstanding me and trying to make me out as some horrible exclusionist. The most inclusive definition of transgender that I know of is someone whose assigned sex at birth does not align with their gender identity, which includes binary, nonbinary, transitioning, and non-transitioning people."	11bbikn	trans	145	0.95	2023-02-25 04:06:31
Fuck it. (Replies to as many transphobes I can find on twitter)		"<3 keep kickin their asses out there we appreciate the fuck outa you lol
Detransition only due to trauma and fear confirmed personally. I wasnt not trans when i shut down and exiled for 2 years.


I thought id be safer if i never ever left my home excpet to buy groceries. Ghosts dont get called he or she and they dont have bio sexes. Going back to easy, no effort mode seemed okay....til i remembered i didnt transition because it was easy but because i feel more like a me i like.
Keep up the good fight :)
Yup...let someone convince me I wasn't trans and it seemed safer and easier to go along with that for 10 odd years. I'd love to see studies on detransitioners who then begin transitioning again when they're safer
2% only detran.  Like 98% transitioning is a pretty dam good number, but I guess fuck us for existing I am I right🙄?
Great work:)
Even if I decided I was a man, I wouldn't regret the hrt because that's how I always wanted to look, female or not
I have zero energy or desire to engage with these people. Not sure how or why you do it. I have a hard time believing that anybody's minds are changed after an argument online. Ever.

I feel like the only time someone's mind would be changed is when they care about someone who is trans.

I hope your efforts bear some fruit though.  🫡
I detransitioned because of pressures I felt from people around me (not that they were saying I should detransition, it was just a feeling onset by heavy drug use as well...I really was in a bad place) but after being a boy again for 2 years I realized transitioning in the first place really is the path for me, which is why I REtransitioned!  I have no regrets though, spending those 2 years presenting male again really helped me find myself and now I am no longer having any doubts about my current transition.
That's right. Their stupidity must be thundered in their faces.
The whole detrans ""discourse"" or whatever you would even call it has always been weird to me. Like most detransitioners, even the ones who are cis, are pretty chill in my experience? Like our communities aren't inherently opposed, we're all just trying to figure out who we are, but there's a small subset who just use it as an excuse to justify their transphobia. Also there's a lot of cis people who aren't detransitioners trying to start fights between trans and detrans people and the whole things just fucking cringe.
Don’t give those trolls (or any trolls in general) your attention. That’s what they crave so much, so in my opinion, it’s just not worth the effort. Ignore them or just block them without engaging.
Funnily enough the 1-2% “detrans” number also includes people who stopped medically transitioning but are still trans (even if they went back later), people who ID’d as binary-trans and later non-binary, people who stopped transitioning for safety or financial reasons, and then people who actually realized they were cis. The studies on this shit are SO bad fr
Actually, that number is an average of multiple age groups that were observed. I think the age group that was six or older had a rate of detransition closer to 0.5%. That overall statistic was brought down by much younger children who were significantly more likely to later identify as cis.

I think it's funny that people think you have to come out as a toddler to ""really be trans"" when teens and older children statistically have much lower rates of detransition. I mean, it makes sense that an age group that barely has a grasp on the human language doesn't have a super firm grasp on their sense of identity. I just find it odd how people blatantly ignore facts and research.
Heck yeah, nothing wrong with being a pretty and female-looking boy! :)
I'm pretty sure the stats are about 1/3 of people who detransition do it because they actually regret it, and the rest do it for all the reasons listed above
You find it odd how people blatantly ignore facts and reaserch.

I expect them to blatantly ignore facts and research.

We're not the same.

i hate all those dogmatic idiots who never question anything as long it fits their agenda."	zmcd9u	trans	142	1.0	2022-12-15 04:45:04
Trans content in social media made me question my gender identity, but I realized at the end that I was just a gender nonconforming cisgender male...and I have zero regrets going on this introspective journey :)	"I want to share my own experience given all this negative spin on detransitioners and people to have been “misled” into transitioning. I think we just have to normalize gender dysphoria and questioning one's gender identity, even if the person turns out to just be a cisgender nonconforming person at the end of the day to counter all these overblown stories about detransitioning. The important thing is that public health resources in counseling and mental health are made available to everyone, so they are guided throughout the process. For me, it helped guide me to a realization that I just wanted to break free from the hold of toxic masculinity and gender roles in society, rather than something as deeper as gender euphoria which made me realize I was just cisgender after all. As someone bullied for having feminine features as a kid, it also helped me make peace with it and gain confidence of the body I was born with.

Regardless, I never really felt that I wasted time going on this journey. It made me much more aware of myself. Dressing femme in public allowed me to experience the ""male gaze"" in public...which helped me become much more empathetic to the women around me, with one friend even sharing her sexual harassment experiences with me. Ironically, it made me much more in tune with my masculinity and I could feel having less toxic masculinity within me. When I become a parent, I will now be more likely to just allow my kids to explore much like how I did.

Thanks to everyone I interacted here and with all the other trans related subs. I may not have turned trans at the end of it, but you have now one ally in me and I will fight for you all. As for me, I may continue presenting femme as well to normalize men wearing female clothes in my own way :)"	"I think you make an excellent point. People need support to question gender norms without stressing about the end point. A lot of gender norms remain toxic - example men shouldn’t show or even experience vulnerable emotions; women shouldn’t show or even experience anger at any significant intensity. The freedom to discover or confirm our gender should be free from the shackles of rigid and ultimately dehumanizing gender roles
100% agree. More people should explore their gender with an open mind. Congrats to you on unlocking cis+! It’s just like being normal cisgender except you get to do it on purpose now instead of muddling around obeying expectations just because you don’t entirely hate it.
That’s really neat! I’m proud that you were so open to exploration, some people are not. Thank you for sharing.
It is completely ok to take stock in everything, question your identity, and realize that everything is as it should be
Self discovery is the most important part of any personal journey.
What a lovely journey. 
And with the current political environment,  being gnc is trans enough to stay connected to the community.  🥰
We will all need to unify as much as possible to survive the growing intolerance.

This is such a beautiful and thoughtful post detailed a journey that should be normalized!  Thank you for sharing.

All the points resonate very strongly with me, but the ultimate outcome is that am non-binary and plan to go on HRT.  Once I realized I could do whatever I wanted without society’s judgement, things got so much better.
I’m happy that you look at your journey this way, instead of yea those trans propaganda brain washed me into believing I’m one of them. It’s very true that if the society stopped hating lgbtq in general, a lot of cis would have a chance to unlock cis+, which means to live a life free from toxic masculinity/femininity and being themselves.
If you don't mind, could you share how you concluded on a cisgender identity for yourself? I fail to understand how ""gender euphoria"" is an aspect to evaluate such (as you seem to suggest) as it would seem to be something both trans and cisgender people could experience. If you are male/female, why did you identity as man/woman as opposed to simply not having an identity based on gender? What aspect of ""gender"" was helping define your identity?
I love how you put it. Cis+ unlocked indeed!
I think more people need to unlock cis+. Cis ppl should have to live as the opposite gender to prove they arent trans, rather than trans ppl having to prove they are. Everyone can enjoy nonconformity."	122p798	trans	143	0.96	2023-03-26 15:08:34
The biggest mistake I've made in my life was being honest	"I came out about a year ago and to the okay support of my parents. I badly wanted and needed HRT (and I still do, just even more so), and since I was 15 at the time and live in Denmark, I had to be referred to Sexologisk Klinik (roughly translates Sexological Clinic). 

Before coming out, I had been certain of my gender for about a month following my 2-3-month gender crisis, so when I was asked about how long I had been aware and out, I told them exactly that and that I had now noticed some pretty clear signs from as early as 4 years old. I thought that was the best answer, that honesty was the best solution. By god how I was wrong.

After almost a year of inconsistent consultations and a bunch of fucking bullshit, I received a message that I had been rejected HRT due to ""premature gender identity"" a few weeks ago. I haven't even had the chance to confront them about it and hear what's gonna happen now because the moved my consultation back 3 weeks, but if I'm unkucky, they could force me to wait until I can get informed consent at 18 (which btw can take like a year and a half for no reason) and thereby be tortured for up to another 3 years and lose a huge portion of my youth. 

All because I picked honesty and ""morality"" over myself in face of shitty unprofessional people having control over my life and future. 

Never again."	"yeah it sucks. when I'm going to have a ""commission"" to change my legal gender i am absolutely certainly going to lie. they might not see the problem with the fact that i am only attracted to men or that i played with ""girls"" toys as a child but I don't want to risk that. don't see anything morally bad with this. this is honestly none of their business and i shouldn't be analysed by a special committee to be allowed to transition after 18. so i am going to tell them whatever they want to hear and be safe.
I am so sorry to hear that. I wish all countries had proper informed consent gender affirming care like the US does where treatment is timely and only requires consent from the patient (or minor patient and their parents). It would prevent so much unnecessary suffering. Arbitrary roadblocks and gatekeeping sound appealing to only those who have no idea what it's like to suffer from crippling gender dysphoria.
I was 16 when i got my hrt and it took me 19 days after my consultation. Europe has so much fucking gatekeeping. Happens here too but not nearly as aggressively. And if it does you can switch services
The wall of suspicion you have to go through in Denmark in order to get started on HRT is infuriating. 

If your parents support you, maybe you can ask them to help kick in some doors and demand reevaluation? Put on some pressure. Or make a complaint to Patientklagenævnet. Maybe it'll bother them enough to relent. 

Otherwise GenderGP could be an alternative until you turn 18.
I am so sorry you have to go through this gatekeeping bullshit hun.

Please try to find HRT options from a private care facility if possible. If not you can ask your parents about options by mail.
This 100% would have happened to me except for the fact I'd been in the NHS mental health system my entire life beforehand. You learn quickly that you have to exaggerate your issues to get help which is incredibly sad. In fact I lost all my therapy support because I said I was fine one time then they said I was no longer a considerable risk after a terrible breakdown. The exact same is true when trying to get any kind of financial support. You have to demean yourself just to get the help you need.

Appeal it and be very clear how much this situation has stressed you out and caused any mental distress. There's no guarantee but if you try and convey all that they might show some morality. Good luck and stay strong.
As you’ve found out, it’s very dumb to cooperate against an entity that defects against you by default. If you know that they will predictably defect, then you also need to defect.
What??? I thought knowing you were trans in early childhood would be to your advantage, not detriment! What kind of reasoning is that???
As a dane I'm truly sorry for you, my big sib(he/they) went through something similar bc Kbh is apparently a lot more binary then Aalborg, so bc he is non binary they made the call that he also wasn't ready for hormones even though he was more then ready and had knew since he was 12 and came out when he where 18 it made his process 1 year almost 2 years longer 😒
I’m sorry this is happening, I don’t know how to help since I don’t know how Denmark’s process for HRT goes. But if you do have to wait until you can get HRT, don’t worry about losing your youth. So many people don’t even know they’re trans until their late 20s or even later and don’t get HRT until even later thang that and still look and feel amazing.

I hope you get it sooner rather than later, but later is a lot better than never
Hi there,

To everyone who carrs. I life in Germany. Before i can start with htr, hairs, name/sexchange or anything else i need 2 seperate documents by 2 different psychiatrist that i have to take to the court and according to the current law, that is about to change, i have to officiale feel/life with the gender i want to be identefied with for 2 years. 

I know that such things seem rather cruel and time consuming, but thanks to my mother who still wants to change my mind, i got bombarded with reports of people who rushed their transition by lieing or by doing it with a ""notsolegal"" way. And all of them regreted it and many of them tried to go back.

To prevent such things we got things like the one you are complainig about. I know it's hard for you right now but please consider that they just want the best for you.

If i get to hear the same i'll still will feel down and angry but i would still think about their point of view.
Honesty is never a mistake. Instead of approaching this from a position of ""i was honest therefore it didnt work out the way i wanted.""

Try to see it from the perspective of the doctors. ""This person may have rushed to a decision and we dont want to do irreversible damage to their body before we can make an accurate diagnosis.""

Informed consent at 18 is still better then no treatment at all, which is what alot of trans people are facing every day.

Begin your social transition, this will begin to alleviate your feelings of dysphoria and provide you with the experiences of your preferred gender. You can begin this journey anytime you want, and you dont need a doctors permission to do so.

I understand youre frustrated but transitioning shouldn't begin with medical treatment. It should start with social integration. You need to become comfortable with your identity in public and see how life is as your preferred gender. This will take time and over the course of your social transition you may find the experiences don't live up to your expectations or they may exceed your expectations.

You may find your identity is not what you thought it was and you may come to a better understanding of who you are or even a different identity that makes you happier. These are all things you need to consider and your doctors want you to have the time to consider them before you move into the medical side of transition.
Yep, this is the way. I wish someone had told me so I didn't have to learn the hard way. I've been lying innocently to save myself from bullshit my entire life, this is just the kind of thing I could've pulled off no problem too.
You'd win my gameshow with this answer
Must be nice... Super happy for you
My parents barely support my medical journey, and I don't think it's nearly enough to want to complain or go against what the doctors say so....

But can you tell me more about GenderGP and how it works here? 👀👀
Hmmm what do you mean by ""private care facility"" and ""options by mail"" exactly?
It really is depressing yeah, thanks for the words
Look i don't even know what they're smoking in there but i am fairly certain that they aren't even gender specialists so like wtf even
I have a non-binary friend who's told me about how the kbh government treats and views non-binary people. It's so fucking weird and outdated. Gross honestly.
When I said ""losing my youth"" I was actually talking about all these years that go by that I can't fully enjoy and where I can't be myself, I know it's never too late to transition. But thank you still!
another german here, you only need 2 gutachten for the name and gender marker change, and for nothing else. the rest are all indications and befundschreiben, and the difference is very important.

detransition rates are very low, and of that low percentage most people detransition due to pressure from society/their peers. gatekeeping does nothing for us, they don't want to ""help"" us, they want to make it harder for us.
Oh I recognise their point of view alright, I just think it's all incredibly ridiculous and fucked up
I fully socially transitioned like 10 months ago and even though it's better I'm still suffering from crippling dysphoria. I am completely confident in my identity, I have never been more certain of anything in my life. And sure, treatment 3-4 years after coming out is better than no treatment, but this is not a pain competition, I am still in constant torture and it is only getting worse. I have done literally everything I can, the only thing left is medical treatment.

And I've heard the doctors, they don't understand gender for shit, the whole system is bullshit and dysfunctional.
Here, my honestly absolutely was an innocent mistake that resulted in the something nobody should have to go through and phrasing it any other way diminishes the fact that there is a serious problem going on here.

Sorry not sorry if I sound aggressive but this is exactly all the shit I'm sick of being told. Without knowing more than you did, you can't just make all these assumptions, so don't come here and play devil's advocate. Thank you.
GenderGP is a private organisation that provides healthcare for trans people in the UK and EU. I've heard of people using them in Denmark, and I have considered them myself, since there's probably about a year left of waiting for HRT through the public healthcare system.

Since it's private, it costs more. I think the initial start up price is around 2000 DKK, and then its a few hundred a month for hormones.

They do require some paperwork, and a blood test which they need your doctor to perform, so it depends if your doctor is willing to cooperate.  

&#x200B;

I heard about GenderGP at a meeting of Transgruppen at LGBT+ Denmark, so you could go to one of their meetings if you want help. They meet in Copenhagen every other friday. There might also be someone who can help you with your current problems with sexologisk klinik. Apart from that, it's also a good place to meet other trans people.

Heres a link for more info: [https://lgbt.dk/transgruppen/](https://lgbt.dk/transgruppen/)

&#x200B;

And let me just say I hate what they are doing to you. It's like the worst nightmare. You sit at these mandatory consultations in front of a person who has unrestricted power to ruin your life. Such an unfair balance of power.
Public healthcare can have different guidelines than a private practice. And less waiting.

Stuff ordered by mail would come from a country without a prescription. Like from Turkey or Russia.
It really is 😒
Yeah but without them you will be gatekept by a paywall sweetie and also that all of them want to make it harder also isn't true. To see it just from one perspective is the bliss of ignorance. But ok to you all. You are human and can do whatever you want. I just tried to make a valid point for the other side.
Yeah i know that some of it seems like bs but believe me there is a meaning behind it. I don't want to say that your point isn't valid, too. I know the urge and how you want to change, i know how it is to get one set back after another. I waited 3,5 month only for the court to tell me ""you can pay us now 1,5 k so that we can organize the psychiatrists"" and at the dermatology i got a timeplan for my hair removal for over 4 f...in years.

But this is a big desission that will effect your whole life. If you realy are 100% sure after this time i'm happy for you and you should still be honest because if that's the case they will clearly see it.
10 months of social transitioning is not enough time to know youre going to be happy with this decision for the next 60 years or more of your life. Maybe you feel like it is for you, but from a doctor's perspective, when making a decision that will impact a person forever they need to have a feeling of certainty.

There are many people who have gone through transition and later regretted the decision. Their lives are destroyed forever. All your doctors are trying to do is make sure youre not one of those people. Theyre not doing it because they hate you or they dont want you to transition. Theyre doing it because they dont want you to make a decision you may regret later.

They are directly responsible for your healthcare and treatment, ultimately that means they get to live with the guilt of the people they may end up hurting if they make a wrong diagnosis.

If you feel you need to yell at me as a surrogate for your doctors, im fine with that. I only came to offer advice and a different perspective. Its not my intention to upset you more, just to give you insight into why your doctors are doing what they are.
Wow thank you so much for the information and emmpathy, I really really appreciate it❤️
Although I love GenderGP, has it not technically been outlawed to do private HRT in Denmark?
Well I promised my mom to not go DIY if she supported me (one of the many manipulative tactics I had to resort to that, despite not being prideful, worked).

But I'll check the private healthcare thing out for sure, thanks a lot!
it's telling you are the one unwilling to listen. in an argument ""sweetie"" is not the right place for that name, it's quite disrespectful to the other party. 

other than that i have to say that i am actually painfully aware of how the system works. to bend to the will of the cistem in hopes to achieve their ""acceptance"" is not the way, i'd suggest our community stand up and fight this unnecessary gatekeeping. no one has ever gotten their rights by obeying those in power.

i'm going to have to pay for my own surgery because of gatekeeping. making transitioning easier for all trans people will....help them. it is suicide prevention. it is our right to have autonomy over our own bodies. nobody is gonna wake up one day and say ""yeah, i feel like getting a orchiectomy today!"". people should always be able to do whatever they want with their bodies (with for example the informed consent model), because it is THEIR choice, THEIR body, and it should be THEIR right.
That was and is the case and I was honest. They did not clearly see it.
While I suppose I appreciate your insight, the doctors (who btw aren't even gender specialists) have told me the exact same things and while I believe their intention I have many reasons to think a lot of what they (and by extension you) have said is pretty bullshit. I'm not gonna get into that as I'm really fucking tired of arguing this because I've said these things a billion times to my braindead mother who gets her ""research"" from boomer facebook and skewed news media, so I will leave this here. I hope you understand.






But thank you for letting me yell at you, I needed that, and I'm sorry. And although I strongly disagree with most of your points, I like your attitude and vibe and I respect you.
Hope some of it works out for you!<3

If you are interested in doing a bit of light activism, there's going to be a debate on sunday between the prime minister candidates on DR, and you can write a question that they might get to answer. I've already posted a question about why trans people have to go through so much questioning to get started on HRT. Maybe you could formulate a question about why teens and minors are forced to go through an undesired puberty, only to have to correct it when they turn 18, or something like that. Put it on the agenda, so to speak.

Link to the question post here: https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/stil-spoergsmaal-til-statsministerkanditaterne-hvad-er-vigtigt-dig
Last I heard about it was someone asking if it would be a problem if they started on HRT with GenderGP until they could switch to the public healthcare option, and the answer from people from LGBT+ Denmark was no. So I think it's still viable.
I am saying to go over those options with them, not behind their back.

Estrogen mono therapy is very safe. 6 mg of sublingual pills per day has almost no health risks as it is a natural hormone.

Will take 4 to 6 weeks before your T will become suppressed.

I hope you are able to find a path forward. Fuck those gate keepers.
Ok, i tried to lock but holiest of all bullshmidts. 

1. I tried to make valid points for both sides. You know see and try to understand each other opinions. But ok then i'm the unwilling on.
2. Noone over told anything about bending to someone. I said some parts of the law make sense whily others seem sensless. And btw. If you think there is no fighting and no changes you lifed under a rock for the last decades.
3. You are totaly right. Our bodey our choice. However there are enough people who struggle with their gender and it's good that they have to talk to a pfoffesional before they rush a desition they may regret. And another btw. Good if you found a surgeon that'll do this for you and that you can pay but many can't do that so that prevents noone from nothing. Suicide prevention is finding help, having someone to talk to so basicly people who aid you on your way.
Ok, then try it again. F... i don't know what s..t i'll get to hear of them. It's f...ed that your future and happynes is in the hands of someone else. All i want to say is that you should stay honest. I thought the same thing. Preparing a story, tell them what they need to hear, but i for once am sick of that shit. I want to be open and honest about myself and to my self. And yes I want to build my happynes on the truth. If you want something else then do it.
Apologies, but if i can leave you with one more point to consider.

The more people who report a status of detrans and regret the more strict these regulations on transitioning will become. And if it gets bad enough they will start pulling licenses from doctors altogether or even begin banning medical transition across the board. As with many things in life there is a proper balance that needs to be struck between the good we intend and the unintentional harm we end up causing.

I fully expect the day you begin your medical transition will be one of the best days of your life and i truly wish you could start as soon as tomorrow. But if it means that some of us need to wait in order for all of us to continue to have access to these treatments then it is a cost we should bear with a defiant grin. Your suffering today means others will have greater access to this type of care tomorrow.

I know it doesnt help how you feel right now. But you will get there. Youre not alone and if you ever need to talk my dms are always open. You can scream at me till your lungs burst. I dont mind at all. Ive been there. I had to wait 5 years to begin my medical transition. And it was hell. I started 3.5 months ago. So im not far removed from where you are now.
Based✨
Thanks a lot for everything ❤️
I frankly don't give a fuck if they know the truth. I don't give a fuck about them so it is very unimportant to me. 

To quote Zuko, I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am. Building happiness on the truth or not, either way will always be a battle to me, and I'm just trying to win a quickly as possible so I can start my real life and build my happiness on what really matters to me.
The solution should and will be a better system, not suffering. I will not be forced a martyr.
Ok, before i continue arguing ar say anything alse, how old are you? You don't need to answer but you justed sounded like the spoiled brat i hoped you were not.
I'm only closing in on 17. I'm not sure how that defines whether I'm a spoiled brat or not though? Is it just cause I don't care if doctors treat danish trans teens like crap know my exact story? Or because it doesn't matter to me how I get where I desperately need to go, so my life can finally start?"	x35nce	trans	144	0.97	2022-09-01 11:53:19
New Hampshire is looking to pass an anti-trans bill	"The bill seeks to clarify that men and women are only to be treated and recognized as such if they are “biological women”. 

They are considering it right now. 

If you live in New Hampshire, or you just happen to have any thoughts on the matter, then feel free to contact a NH Republican representative. 

That Texas shit already happened. This NH is happenING. (In committee now.)

EDIT:

You can find the state reps, and their emails, off of this address. Feel free to let them know your thoughts. 

https://www.citizenscount.org/elected-officials"	"Well, I doubt this is going to pass, given that majority-Republican House and Senate passed (and the Republican governor signed) the 2018 gender identity nondiscrimination law that this law attempts to roll back. So I doubt this has enough traction--but again, New Hampshire is weird and stranger things have happened.
It’s always funny to me that the aggressively “live free or die” (more like “live cheap or die”) state pulls authoritarian bullshit like this
I swear its like almost every state is passing these nowadays. Indiana is trying to pass a bill that stops trans girls from playing in school sports and the house and senate passed it already
What is going on in America wtf. I am so sorry for all of you.
Thanx for the heads-up...
The US is getting closer and closer to committing genocide. What’s next? Forcing all trans people into “rehabilitation camps”? I can see it happening
WTAF?
Does anyone want to tell them about intersex people?
Having lived in New Hampshire before this honestly doesn’t surprise me 😑
This is true, smart person here.
There a GWAR lyric sung by the leader of the high hypocrites The Morality Squad, that I always think about when I read the slogan:

“Freedom to all the people
Brave, true and strong,
Freedom to all the people
Unless I think you’re wrong!”
“Land of the free, if you’re like me”


Time for anarchy :)
The only thing to do is to write your rep now, when it’s happening. 

And then vote later. 

Unless you go a lot of time on your hands and then you can try to get others to do the same.
It stirs up the conservative base and no politician gives a fuck about trans people enough to really go to bat for us because we are such a low percentage of the voter base. Trans people only have the rights we have because it is hard to not read laws discriminatory against women as also discriminatory against trans people. 

But if there is some landmark case saying it is ok to discriminate on the basic of identity, then expect all of those rights to go away. 

That is what this bill seeks to do. It’s red meat for the Republican case who wants to see a minority oppressed or shoved back in the closet. 

“Fuck those freaks, I got an election to win.”

If you do not like it, then write a NH state rep.
I don’t know if it’s real hot to throw the word “genocide” around. Just call it what it is: Attempts to make ignorance and hate the law of the land.  Legalized oppression of a minority.

Cis people should care because once it happens to trans peeps, it’s going to start happening to other minorities.  Every advance since the revolution can be rolled back if no one says anything.

Don’t write it up on Reddit. Write a NH state house rep. I did. I recommend a cordial but firm tone.
Buh-b-b-b-but it's basic biology! /s
Excellent!
Yeah I wrote to my rep, the odds seem high that it will get signed but hopefully it won't

Transphobic family sad I've grown distant	"They are ""proud conservatives"" which comes with all the usual off-handed transphobic comments and jokes. I still see them as family, but it gets harder and harder to. It hurts so much to hear them say how much it hurt them that I've distanced myself from them, but then they don't at all respect my younger sibling's identity. How am I supposed to feel comfortable around them knowing my sibling and I can't even be ourselves around them?? I already feel so disconnected from them and every positive moment I have around them is becoming tainted by the memories of the things they've said. I don't think I could ever tell them who I really am, I'm scared to lose what tiny bit of familiarity I have left with them but I don't think there is any saving our relationship"	"We are your family now.
Sad that they've driven you away, such hypocrites.
I plan on cutting out most of my family right before I come out (still hiding). Though dealing with it currently and i want to scream at all of them. It hurts but it's making me push them away even further
I don't talk to a lot of my family because of things like this. I grew up with a highly reactionary family and over time I distanced myself from most of them as I discovered my queer and trans self
Tell them you will be glad to reconnect so long as they become full marxists /s
Same. My mother in law is such a negative person to everyone, she's already complained people don't want to be around her, and that's not even bringing the trans stuff into it. My wife and I had her and her husband over for dinner and he made a genuine effort to behave well, treat us all with respect and take part in the social occasion. My mother in law wouldn't look me in the eye, she wouldn't hug me, she avoided me and just made things so awkward.

My own parents also can't let go of their own ideas to see the reality in front of them. I'm surprised by how much this hurts, but I just can't see how being part of a toxic relationship will do anything but just make me feel bad.
I'm part of your family now
I know it sucks but you can't be familiars with people who pride themselves in who they hate. If you're a proud conservative, you're proud of being a willfully ignorant, bad person. It's my job to take care of myself. Surrounding myself with people who hate just me because they can't figure out how to deal with their own issues is NOT the way.

The second best thing I ever did was to become lonely, and learn to be my own best company and support. The best thing I ever did was to then go build friendships with a new sense of self worth and way higher standards as to who gets to hang out with me.
Ik the feeling, they get mad at u for not being with them but the second ur with them they insult u😔 smh. Atleast u have us
You don’t owe them anything. If you wanted to you can simply tell them that they’re horrible people, why they’re horrible and unless they change they won’t have a family.
I have the same issue. We’ve basically reached a happy equilibrium where I still “stay in contact” but I don’t actually tell them anything. I’ll probably cut them off entirely when my partner and I skip town.
The only thing that changed my conservative family was cutting them off. They wanted to pretend I wasn’t respectful of their beliefs, which I explained their beliefs cross my boundaries. They are mean, why would I want them in my life

We are slowly talking atill, I don’t have much hope they will change but at least they know where the line is
Before I even realized I was trans my dad told me if I was any kind of queer I wasn't welcome around ""his family"". Thankfully my parents are divorced and I have support from my mom , but as soon as I realized I was trans I pre-emptively went no contact with my dad. It's worth it to be happy in your own skin
eh fuck em, sounds like they are just sad they cant control you anymore
What I would do in your situation, is try and set up something to fall back on in case things get bad. And when I am comfortable, come out to them. If they don't like it, I have somewhere to go and be safe. But they may surprise you. 

I had a homophobic co-worker who was a firm conservative. But one day he came in with a pride flag temporary tattoo on his hand. So I asked him about it, and he said his son came out as gay, and while he was very against the idea at first, his love for his son was stronger than his dislike for the community. And after seeing how happy his son was and after meeting people in the community, he realized that there was nothing to hate. 

Basically, if your family truly loves you, they will accept you. It may take some adjustment, and they definitely won't be perfect. But they will try. And If they don't, then leave. If they can't accept you for who you are, then they are not really the family you need or want. 

I wish you luck, and I hope whatever you decide to do goes well.
One of us! One of us! 💙💗🤍💗💙
💚💚💚
I just wish they could see that maybe there’s a reason I’m drifting so much
It really does hurt, I don’t understand why they hold onto these beliefs so strongly. I wish you the best of luck 💚
I'm already doing so even though my mom accepts me she dislikes many aspects about me 
My brother to 
Some of my family members as well 
Imm going complete none contact with this entire family moms sisters are t supports and well I can't handle knowing that so im going to completely block everyone and delete contact information as well I don't even want them to know where I'll be buried it's that bad that I don't even want future generations of my current family members to know who I was or am I don't even want updates on them anymore I don't even care about them my mom or anything I have 6 months left and my therapist is trying to change my mind on doing it to cut them out for the rest of my long life as you can tell I will never forgive them 
The threats and abuse mentally and physically they all were involved in to try to change me 
Autism is one reason to why they wanted me to also forcing me on medication 
Threats were worse for me 
I will never ever want anything to do with this mentally messed up family again
Yeah, I expect something similar. It’s sad but I’d rather be happy than ridiculed by the people I trusted most
LMAOOO fr, I’d love to see the day 💚
People like that are hard enough to deal with as strangers, I’m sorry you have to deal with her in your own family. It’s sad how many people are so willing to be hateful for no reason
💚💚💚
As sad as it is, I know you’re right. I hate to see my family like this, but I’m not going to spend my life arguing on why I should be allowed to be who I am. My identity shouldn’t be a condition to their love. I’m glad you have been able to surround yourself with people who make you happy 💚
Definitely, one week my mom cried because my girlfriend and I don’t spend time with them. This week I hear her laughing at jokes about trans people and having political conversations within ear shot of us so we can hear all of their fun opinions. Thank you 💚
I wish it was that easy. They’re generally friendly, know when to not talk about their beliefs to strangers, and have the backing of pretty much all of our extended family. I would lose all of them, they lose nothing
I feel like there’s not much else to do, I don’t think they would change to keep me around. “I’m entitled to my beliefs”
Setting that boundary is important, I admire you for that. They are super strong believers in the “I’m entitled to my beliefs” thing, if I don’t get over their horrible world views, then I’m the bad guy
No one’s said it directly, but they refused to accept my younger siblings identity on several occasions, so it’s kind of a silent statement. I still heavily rely on them, California is so expensive 😭, but I’m just sad to see the people I grew up with just get worse and worse. I’m glad you have the support of your mom! Having people around makes it easier, at least I know I’m not alone
I’m definitely getting sick of dealing with it, but if this really is about control then there’s nothing that will bring me back
Yeah, I’m moving away for school for a bit, so I’ll hopefully find a nice fall back place there. But I’d be reaching if I thought they could surprise me. They were given years to accept my younger sibling, at the very least they finally accepted my sibling’s name. I hope for the best, but a crying mom and a yelling dad and brother are in my future. Thank you, I hope things go well too
Gooble gobble one of us!
Be straightforward with them.  It’s hard sometimes to have adult relationships with our parents but your relationship will either be stronger for it or not.  Either way, things will improve.
I don't know either. Thank you. Same to you
Because Christian conservatives believe that if they accept LGBT people for who they are, they're somehow betraying God. Ass-backwards logic if you ask me, and that's coming from a Christian trans girl. Jesus accepts us, just as we are, so if you're trying to be Christian, you're supposed to do the same. Just my thoughts, I sincerely hope everything works out for you
Don’t talk like that! You have value too! It sucks that your family can’t see that but they’re not worthy of you!
Then as they say in Russia, Soviet. They’re absolutely correct that they’re entitled to their beliefs. However, actions have consequences, and the action of “maintaining beliefs that are harmful to my child” has the consequence of “my child not wanting to be around me anymore.”
Exactly. I had to explain, “why would I keep people in my life that think I’m insane, that hurt me, that think horrible things about me, that miss the person who was miserable, that refuse to consider me”
And they would still try to couch it in language that distracts from the obvious so I had to be like “you’re mean to me. It’s not as complicated as “beliefs”. You think and say things that hurt my feelings. If you love me, how you treat me should matter to you.”
Just remember that they are abusing the shield of victim - if they are the victims then they don’t have to change - which means they will find a way to be the victims. Which is why every time you bring something up that hurt them it turns into a competition of grievances. Stick to the boundary metaphor, ask them if they would keep you in their life if you punches them in the face every time you saw them. Would it matter if you sincerely believed it’s the best way to greet someone? Of course not - being punched in the face sucks, your intentions don’t really change how it feels. If someone refuses to stop hurting you, or even refuses to consider that they are hurting you, then they need to go. That’s abuse.
Yeah, I know I’ll have to say something eventually. Whether they accept me or not, I’m not going to stick around people who don’t think I should exist
I don’t know if it’s better or worse, but they aren’t even religious anymore. They grew up Mormon but God doesn’t come into play when they make decisions anymore, as far as I know. Whatever prevents them from accepting LGBT people is all them. The rest of my family though, could learn a lot from you
Thank you 💚 I’m just wishing I didn’t feel like my choice was happy family or being myself
I just hope they view having me in their life as a better alternative to being transphobic
I’m not looking forward to that conversation, there’s no winning with them. I guess o can get a lot of practice and advice here before hand, so thank you 💚💚
Thank you, this helps so much! They love arguing but I’m terrible at it. I hadn’t really considered this approach, thank you 💚💚
I hope so too hun 🤗
I’m sorry, you don’t deserve this. It gets easier."	w9vjsy	trans	142	0.99	2022-07-28 01:00:35
Cis people aren't the CEOs of gender	"throwaway bc obviously lol

TL;DR: nobody needs to look cis, not even cis people themselves.

&#x200B;

so I've noticed a trend not only in this subreddit but also in the trans community in general that ""passing"" is like the highest achievement of being trans. Passing as a cis person obviously. No one's asking if you pass for a gamer or if you pass as an engineer.

I can't help but wonder why? I genuinely think that ""passing"" as a cis person shouldn't be the ultimate goal of transitioning. In fact, I think people who are gnc and don't pass are bitchin' and lichterally the pillars of society.

Nobody needs to ""pass"" not even cis people themselves. In fact, the whole notion of ""passing"" seems like internalized transphobia and racism and fatphobia to me. When I thought I was like 1100% cis I didn't ""pass"" for cis. I'm fat and I'm not USAmerican White. I'm what people would call ""exotic"" and yet, I didn't pass 100% of the time. Not even with this hell of a rack I have.

One of my friends, who is a Black gnc person didn't ""pass"" as a woman because her nose is wide and her back is wide and they were constantly asked if they were a ""real woman.""

And let's not get into how transmasc people apparently need a beard to pass half of the time. A lot of native American cis men don't grow a beard naturally, they wear their hair long and they're still considered men. Except when it comes to White spaces where their masculinity will be questioned on account of their long hair.

And what about people who for safety reasons can't pass because they can't transition. Are they less trans because of it? Do nonbinary people have to look androgynous to be nonbinary? Not really, because gender presentation/performance is different from gender identity and I think we all know it right?

Do you see what I'm getting at? Thought? Opinions?

btw this is in no way meant to attack or invalidate people who want to pursue a physical transition or dismiss people who have suffered transphobia bc they dont pass. This is meant as food for thought on how we perceive the trans experience in general, but also to question our own biases when commenting on people's posts. Especially because most of the ""Do I pass?"" posts are made by wh1te people who ""pass"", so people who know they don't pass or who don't pass 100% of the time are looking at them and maybe even thinking to themselves ""well, I'll never look like that"". Hell, a lot of young people use reddit and they're looking at all these people who pass and internalizing all these ideas of what being trans means, instead of discovering it by themselves.

In the end, being trans is a deeply personal experience and no one can tell you how to be trans, but I think that aspiring to be cis shouldn't be ***it***, y'know?"	"Additionally, when I see someone in public who doesn't ""pass"" (i.e. is obviously a gnc person), it makes me feel a little safer. Like there's some sort of unspoken alliance just by existing near each other.

There's certainly something to be said for being able to go invisible in a group of people, but damnit I just extra appreciate those who are open and visible and proud.
True. Some people will never pass but they aren't lesser trans people because of it.
I'm openly trans to everyone in my life. I wear a trans flag dogtag, a trans flag lanyard, and find visibility very important. I also did everything in my power to be able to pass. The reason I did that is because part of my dysphoria was social. More than being misgendered, it was not being ""included in womanhood"" in people's minds unless they actively reminded themselves, and if you have to remind yourself that I'm a woman, then you're going to treat me differently. It others me from the social contexts and constructs of womanhood.

I pass these days, and it's a good place, because I'm still openly trans, but people don't need to remind themselves that I'm a woman, so I don't get ""othered"" in a thousand tiny ways like I used to.

I don't want to be cis. I don't want to be seen as cis.  I just want people to not have to mentally prompt themselves to include me in the category of my own gender.
In my experience there's a big gap between people who mostly interact in gay or trans subcultures and have a lot of gay and trans friends vs people who don't have those community connections (especially the ones who were straight-married before coming out). If you're in the former group, there's a lot less of a sense that \~\*\~passing\~\*\~ as cis is the goal compared to the latter group. Both of these are obviously competely valid ways to express your gender although on Reddit members of the latter group sometimes talk in ways that sound like internalized transphobia which is saddening.
The whole point of being trans is having gender incongruence. Most of us would give anything to be cis. Passing allows us to look in the mirror and see someone who looks cis, someone who matches what we see in our heads. It's also security and safety. Passing is a very very reasonable, understandable, logical, and commendable pursuit for a trans person. I do not personally understand the internal workings of anyone who desires to NOT pass but I obviously don't think less of them for it and I believe whatever path they desire to walk is fine and they should be able to do so, ideally in a society that is kind and accepting of all where they can be safe from harm. Passing isn't always the end all be all for everyone but posts that seem to disregard (unintentionally, I imagine) the immense gravity it holds on most trans people just kind of get to me sometimes.
I tend to agree agree but I also noticed you put passing at odds with being NGC which isn't necessarily the case. If I have a passing goal it would be to present as a man even in full femme drag so not everyones passing goals are just meant to conform with cisnormativity.
Fam I just don't want dysphoria and want to look pretty. Plus no harassment or misgendering.

It's not that deep.
[deleted]
I totally agree, but I’m too busy laughing at the title because it reminded me of the CEO of sex meme 😂😂😂
I totally agree that passing as cis doesn't have to be the goal. In fact, this site has a great article on this topic. 

https://www.transjoy.co/2021/10/04/why-passing-doesnt-define-your-transition/
As a trans single parent with mixed abilities from a mixed heritage blended family… I just want to send you endlesss unconditional community love and solidarity sibling for writing this. 

Trans liberation 💙
I agree with it all. I wish I could openly not pass more in public but it feels too dangerous. I’m non binary but would enjoy the option of passing as a cis woman because it would make life easier sometimes. Even though I’m not a woman (or a man)
I agree with the sentiment, but you lost me at racism and fatphobia. How is that relevant here?
Then what is the point of us being trans? If not to reach the male or female state we’ve been deprived of our whole lives. While I agree we don’t HAVE to “look” a certain way, don’t we? For the sake of our mental health, and to reach that physical state we were never allowed to fully express. I think non-binary ppl are very different from us in this conversation, they’re not trying to be male or female or present as fully one or the other. But we are trying to, we’ve always been trying to. Ofc those who can’t transition, I sympathize with, it can’t be helped and I feel horrible for them. But for those who can, isn’t that the point of it all? To reaffirm our identities. How we dress doesn’t really matter-not trying to say we have to wear the stereotypical dresses-don’t wanna play into misogyny or being sexist there. Also agree on the beard thing, definitely not needed, but it seems to help a lot of transmasc folks feel much more validated when they can grow one.

I think the issue we seem to face is that if we’re going to enter all these spaces, and let people know who we are, and live our truth, we need to look the part, which plays in our favor bc it’s so validating! Because we’ll never be cis, but getting as close to presenting as such has always been the goal has it not? I think if it isn’t, then maybe someone is more on the non-binary scope (which is totally fine!).
Nor are trans people
Thanks for that 🙏🏻
I agree. Whether or not you pass shouldn't matter. However, I want to pass. Not because society expects it. I want to pass for me. I want to feel like a girl and be treated like one.
One of my biggest issues as a trans guy is my height, because every white cis guy I know is taller than me, but a lot of men of color are even shorter than me. It’s something I definitely need to work on internally, but fucking hell do I wish dysphoria wasn’t so based on what the world sees in me
Thanks for saying this, I absolutely needed to hear this
I agree with what your saying. I don’t think anyone should feel like they have to pass based on social pressure from others. If someone is happy with how they look, even if they are not passing, that is more than enough. The biggest thing, in my opinion, is that the person is happy. For many trans people passing is what makes them most comfortable, for those who prefer a less (idk how to word but I guess I would say) “stereotypical” look of a male/female that is great. 

I know I personally prefer to pass. It makes me feel more comfortable. It also allows me to avoid awkward conversations. I seriously respect trans people who can talk about their experience and share. I just struggle to be one of those people. I hope one day to get there, and I’m trying my best to become more confident but until then I do prefer to pass. 

I do feel like the “do I pass” question is mostly asked by people just starting transitioning, and it’s understandable why. You are still figuring yourself out and sometimes what feels like the safest way to do that is to pass completely. 

To the trans people who are openly trans I love you guys. You make the stealth trans people feel safe and valid by just being around and that’s amazing. To those who are stealth I love you guys too and take your time to find out who you are!
being in a community with lots of trans people completely ruined my sense of what “passing” looks like. Half the cis people I meet, I “clock” as trans and then they’ll misgender me or say some dumbass cis nonsense and I’ll be like “damn. but ur the one that looks like a tr*nny”
The trans panic defense is a closely related legal strategy applied in cases of assault, manslaughter, or murder of a transgender individual with whom the assailant(s) had engaged in or was close to engaging in sexual relations with and claim to have been unaware that the victim was transgender,[1][2][5] producing in the attacker an alleged trans panic reaction, often a manifestation of homophobia and transphobia.[6][7]

straight from wikipedia pal

some people really need to study lgbtq+ history
trans people are the ceo of sex
Cis Black women get called men/man-like animal names as an insult, especially in the USA. Trans women of color experience this doubly so. Anti-blackness and racism is in our hair preferences, teachings on haircare, color schemes, and even the cut of our clothing. Fatphobia also has roots in anti-black rhetoric as well. 

Societal beauty standards that one ""must achieve to pass as a trans person"" are absolutely influenced by racism and fatphobia. Like shaving and bleaching ""requirements"" for example. Even things like OP posted about like nose and shoulder width are judged based off of racist or fatphobic tropes. I've literally seen so many posts like: ""hey am I allowed to be a transman if I'm brown/black/fat/etc? The only trans people I see are skinny and white""

I think an example of this type of thing happening in community is when Native American transmasculine people or transmen post about their transition/passing and people will start commenting like: ""You don't pass because your hair is long!! Gotta cut it OMG"" while completely glossing over how masc hair is done in that culture, and the USA/Canada has had a raunchy bad history of doing f-ed up things to their hair, so suggesting a cut is way out of line when put in context. Or when people will be talking about how 'feminine' full lips are, and how it keeps you from passing, when lots of POC have full lips on all genders, it's just a fetishized trait, so now it's associated with just women in pop culture when it's just....lips!

TL;Dr Trans people get told that to ""pass"" they need to live up to certain beauty standards. These standards are often rooted in racism and fatphobia, and so are even more difficult/damaging to achieve for POC/fat people/ disabled people/anyone who doesn't fit the ""perfect"" mold.
racism comes into play because beauty standards are typically eurocentric, but imo it’s more the effect of colonisation than just general racism
I'm reading Whipping Girl right now, and it addresses what you're bringing up. It's an excellent read and I recommend it.

A point she makes is that ""passing"" is not something the trans person does. The term ""passing"" is an oppressive term used to cover the fact that in a cis centric society everyone is gendering everyone constantly. If you meet all of a person's criteria and they condescend to gender you correctly, then you ""pass"". But that's shitty. That's them judging you. Fuck that. 

What trans people do when they transition is we attempt to resolve the gender dysphoria we are experiencing--not pass. That's about us and our self perception and we owe that judgey clerk at the supermarket that misgendered us nothing but a face full of spit. Our goal is not to get shitty people to gender us correctly. 

This is a subtle distinction to make but it's important. Feeling comfortable with your gender presentation and happy with who you see in the mirror is your job. 

""Passing"" is an oppressive game forced on you by a bigoted society. 

Think about what it meant/means for ""black"" people to pass as ""white"" in the states. First of all, the categories are all screwy, because the ""black"" person in question could have as much African American ancestry as a ""white"" person who's never had to think about ""passing"". Second of all, ""passing"" is not something that the person can actually do. It's a status conferred on them or not by each person they meet--and that status comes with the privileges that would be due anyone in a reasonable society.

That situation is obviously insane and oppressive. So is ours. We might be forced to play that game for fair treatment or safety, but we should not for one second fool ourselves into thinking that that's our game. That oppression. 

Even the word ""gender dysphoria"" conflates these two problems. Some of what we experience as gender dysphoria is all the social baggage dumped on us for being trans. The other part of it is internal gender incongruence.
For a lot of trans people, passing is a major goal, and that is completely fine and sometimes necessary for safety or a positive self-image. But passing is sure as hell not the overall ""point"" of being trans, and not trying to pass does not make someone non-binary. For a good illustration of this, just look at cis people. There are tons of butch women who do not try to look passing (and often get harassed just like trans people) or even explicitly try to not pass as women. That doesn't make them non-binary in any way, it's just how they present themselves; Vice versa for feminine men. Gender is not stored in the presentation, so to speak

TL;DR trans people can be GNC just like cis people can.
When you say ""different from us"", do you mean to say that non binary folks are not trans then?
The point of transition for me is addressing dysphoria and eliminating the suffering it causes me ; some of what this entails also has the side effect of making me pass for cis, and some of it has no bearing on whether I pass or not but still helps with dysphoria. I.e , I may be able to alleviate my dysphoria in ways that do not require me to pass for cis necessarily.
And to add more onto the fatphobia element, my partner is transmasc. His boobs are so big that binding does nothing. We live paycheck to paycheck, it's likely he won't afford top surgery for a long time. During that time, he's taken less seriously or told he isn't trying hard enough. The standard to ""pass"" to be taken seriously is bullcrap.

Also, I'm a transmasc who likes presenting feminine. Basically, I'm gnc. I've got the hairy legs, the facial hair, but I rock skirts and crop tops. I'm not taken as seriously for it. Not sure what point I'm making, if any, by sharing. P much, OP is right
Anyone insulting people for their looks is a complete ass.
Different cultures have different beauty standards, I do suppose that there is a certain eurocentrism to western beauty standards but this is to be expected given that we're majority white (especially in Europe). People of one race tend to prefer features of their own race and I don't think that this is necessarily racism in and of itself, in the same way that being gay doesn't mean you somehow hate the opposite sex.
I know that some trans ppl can Also be non-binary but if I’m being honest it’s very hard for me to wrap my head around it and I’ll often forget about it. When I said “different” it wasn’t meant in a negative way, just in a -I believe the context of this conversation in particular should be more steered towards trans people- but I’m always open to learning more and I’d hate to make anyone feel shitty. I just don’t like seeing conversations that would make more sense split up be grouped together when the experiences are so vastly different.
Eurocentric beauty standards (coming from a US standpoint) are a direct result of colonisation and racism. This isn’t a “people like people similar to them” thing. it’s a “POC historically were and still are treated as lesser than whites” thing.

Even asian beauty standards lean towards whiteness, despite white people being a minority in Asia. it’s partially colorism that has been ingrained in society for ages, and partially how there are so many rich white people people in media."	vxhfk9	trans	139	0.91	2022-07-12 18:01:13
Is it wrong to buy Hogwarts Legacy?	"Hi there
Please consider English is not my main language, I'm not a very well-spoken person and I only fairly recently started questioning my gender so some things I say might be completely wrong and in that case, I encourage anyone to correct me :)

My opinions come from my personal experience and beliefs as an artist myself.

I believe that once I consume any type of art, let it be a book, a game or a drawing, the emotions I'll feel are mine and only mine, not of the artist anymore. When I draw something and I publish it, in a way it does become at least emotionally property of whoever sees it. It's yours to interpret. Whatever you feel when you see it it's the valid and right way to see it. I encourage you to have a different interpretation from my original idea if it reflects more your personal experience.
That's why it comes very easy for me to separate the art from the artist. When I think of Harry Potter, Rowling doesn't exist, but I remember instead the good times I had while reading the books and watching the films and how they made me feel part of something.

Harry Potter and ""the Marauders"" had a HUGE impact on my life as a child and even now that I'm an adult. Especially now that I'm exploring more the fandom side with fanfictions that are truly extraordinary and fix all the details that in Rowling's story are a little off. I deeply relate to a few of the characters, for reasons that are not very happy, but still reading about them still brings me so much joy that I really need at the moment. 

Hogwarts Legacy is the kind of game that I've been waiting for since I was a child at this point. It's exactly what I wanted and being able to play it would make me incredibly happy. Would it be selfish to want to buy it? The only problem with pirating is that it would take a bit to find and especially early on it might be a bit broken. While it might be an alternative I'd like to own a copy myself so I can play it as soon as possible without worrying about viruses and different issues when eventually they release patches, new versions and mods (like the problems I sometimes have with a specific version of Skyrim working only with a specific version of a mod I want to use)

I'll bring another example. I recently bought 2 Harry Potter themed pillows because only now that I have my own money I can treat myself with these things. Every time I see those pillows they make me happy and almost make me feel like I'm there, at Hogwarts in the common room or something. But technically I supported her by giving her a portion of the money I spent because of the logo. Does that make me awful? Does it mean that I shouldn't have bought them even if they make me happy and the pillow on its own doesn't have anything transphobic? But because I indirectly supported economically an awful person who is already extremely rich?

Me having issues with my own gender identity I should be mad. And I am don't get me wrong. I feel quite conflicted or I wouldn't have made this post. But I find it extremely exhausting to keep being angry. The franchise makes me happy and it will continue to do so. Is it so wrong?

Edit: thank you all so much for all the insights that I really needed. I wasn't aware of the plotline about stopping a slave revolt so before making any decision I'm definitely gonna wait until the game comes out to properly understand how it plays out. At this point making my own game sounds a lot less stressful

Edit 2: Okay since this post is gaining traction outside of the community if I see any comment that is in any way attacking ""the lgbt community (which I am part of btw) for being dramatic"" you will be blocked. You are not going to use MY post were I'm expressing my conflict to share hate and attack a group I'm literally part of thank you very much."	"Yes.

Death of the author isn't a thing when the author still profits off the material and uses that money to spread hate.
The issue is, that Big-Terf earns money, that she can use to fight trans people. As soon as she is dead, this might change, but as long as she is living, she can put the money you give her into the fight against us.
I was a big fan of Harry Potter when I was a young kid but now I can’t even look at it the same knowing the creator is hateful to something I cannot control. Ugh oh well…
I'd say yes, it is wrong to buy it, but not just for the obvious problems with J.K. Rowling. The game itself has an awful plotline where the protagonist literally stops a slave revolt (the goblins, which to make it even worse are antisemitic stereotypes).
Yes. You show support with your purchases. Buying her material is supporting her, which in turn allows her to continue to be a POS human.
i would wait a bit after the release and then try to pirate it
JKR tweeted yesterday that anyone who supports trans rights is completely “incompatible” with owning ANY of her intellectual property whether it was bought 20 years ago or today… she doesn’t want us as fans. she doesn’t even care about our money anymore she’s so prejudiced.
besides her indirectly being a terf the game is directly antisemitic and pro authoritarianism so like ya giving a terf money isn’t great but i feel like the issues with the game itself are more repulsive
People shouldn't buy anything that contributes to giving Rowling money or a platform. 

I won't condemn people and tell them they're horrible people because they did something that's bad though.
Yea it’s wrong. Just stop interacting with the Harry Potter IP until it is no longer culturally relavent she has power to kill trans people. And she has. So yeah it’s bad after Joanne terf queen dies then we can talk about Harry Potter agian
I hate JK Rowling as much as anybody else on here, but I also loved the Harry Potter universe as a child and I’m looking forward to playing the game. I play on PC so getting a second hand physical copy is out of the question, and the game will probably incorporate Denuvo DRM so a crack is also very unlikely to come out anytime soon, if ever.

If you purchase the game from steam for $60, 30% of that money goes to Valve, leaving exactly $42 for WB.
Development costs, marketing budget, and the company’s profits will all take a substantial cut from that money. How much do you think Rowling will get? I bet it’s less than a dollar per copy sold.

If you want to get the game, then I recommend making a donation to a trans rights organization, that should do more net good than not buying the game and not making the donation.

This is just my take, and I understand if you disagree. I loved Harry Potter growing up and seeing the author actively try to jeopardize the safety and well-being of my community is really sad. I wish that my existence would stop being a political issue and that my identity would be the last thing that people would think about, but it is what it is.
Do what you want, I’m not here to police the things that make people happy. But yeah, I wouldn’t buy the game. Sure, she won’t suffer financially. But as long as people keep buying her stuff, WB will continue to give her massive deals and continue allowing her to spread her hate.

Imagine if HP stopped being such a cultural staple and we *could* ignore JK Rowling. It would be nice, but as it stands she holds a lot of cultural power. As long as her words are being used in anti-trans legislation worldwide, we really shouldn’t be supporting her works
Yes, you’re giving money to the TERF queen to keep propagating her filth
People have strong opinions, and while I certainly wouldn’t choose to buy anything she would profit off, it doesn’t make *you* awful. It’s kind of similar to voting, as other people have already said. Your individual contribution doesn’t mean a lot, but if everyone makes the same choice we start seeing consequences.

I don’t think anyone here is going to ease your conscious about this, unfortunately. It really is up to you whether you think a bit of support for a known transphobe is worth enjoying something you grew up with.
I will never give that woman a cent of my money.
Honestly, I'd say just buy GoW 2018. Better story, relatively same price, Kratos VA actually supports LGBTQ+ people, and also big swords go brrt.
I will not support JK Rowlings transphobia.

**She will not get a dime from me.**
Joanne K Rowling will use your own money to make your existence as close to illegal as it can be if you're trans in any way.

Will make other people's existence as close to illegal as possible if you're not.

For the only reason that she decided to hate them out of the blue.
Giving her money ! I thought the game looked great and absolutely joked for half a second about getting it and hiding it but no... just friggin no ... does she need to have a swastika tattoo and blood dripping fangs for one to grasp the seriousness of her reach and the damages done by her supporters... defund bigotry , defend each other,  define equality  . ✌

English isn't your main language, which means I would assume your birthplace is not in England or the United States. 

I am saying this for a VERY specific reason. I will answer your question with a question from me. You can answer it for yourself. 

Wherever you were born in, let's say I said ""(Place you were born in) is horrible. I will now actively exclude them from the rights they deserve."" I would never say that IRL, but this is a hypothetical. Let's say I also have a famous book series that has video games and so many merchandise and everything a fan could want and more. So much so that this is even called a world. I am not dead. I am very much alive and EVERY item sold under my company's name leads me to getting a portion of the money sold from EVERYTHING with it's name on it. 

Knowing I am an active member in excluding you from your deserved rights, would you say it's okay for your friend to support me? They say that art can be separated from the artist while asking you if it is okay to line the pockets of hate. Your friend also KNOWS I said what I said and knows that I made it a point to make things worse and worse by going more and more against the people who grew up where you did (including you). 

Would you say yes? 

Remember: as I am alive, a yes means allowing your friend to support me financially, giving me more power to hate.

Also, side note: I don't hate based on location. I don't hate based on anything but morality. This situation is all hypothetical.
If you really want to play it you should probably pirate it. Jk Rowling doesn’t deserve any of your money.
I’d wait for the reviews, because the game may be a mess at launch. It doesn’t include quidditch or any real side mini games. Seems like a pretty tailored Action adventure game rather than immersive RPG. In regards to whether supporting JK Rowling if you purchase the game, it’s up to you. Her views are trash and she is clearly led by bigotry about gender, but remember she had no real input in the game. Also, though she may receive a considerable royalty from the sales of the game, the intention of developers were to make the game for every fan not the ones she says deserves it. The main majority of sales will go to Warner Bros anyway.
its a game about antisemitism by a racist and white power writer who uses her money to directly fund alt right bullshit, it is extremely not okay to purchase this game, ignoring the trans side entierly, its STILL bad and evil to purchase and THEN ON TOP shes also a transphobe
Yes, and from what I've heard, it's not very good.

Apparently the story is about putting down a slave rebellion.
Well… it’s complicated. Firstly, yes it’s kinda wrong. Obviously, no one should JK anymore by buying anything from here. And I would say it’s best to boycott the game. 

Here’s the problem though. Harry Potter has already become such a huge part of our cultural zeitgeist over the past decades, that this fictional world and the characters have been with some of us for the entirety of our lives, and are likely very important to a lot of people. I know that’s at least for me the case, and most people my age (and above) in my country. It’s not that easy to just delete that kind of attachment from one’s cultural identity. So I get it when it is important for some people to still entertain that, especially in an RPG video game, which is what a lot of fans have been waiting for for years.

Here’s my take for someone who feels this attached to Harry Potter: hold off on buying, just until the reviews and sales numbers of the first couple weeks are released. If it is not good or an unfinished mess (which, let’s face it, is very possible with modern AAA games), then don’t buy it. You will not have lost anything worth playing. If the sales are middling and a lot of people are also boycotting it, I also wouldn’t buy it, as your contribution would make a difference. If, however, it is the best thing since sliced bread, and millions of people have bought it within the first month, then well… I won’t judge you for buying it. If it is that important to you, it’ll give you a whole lot and (in the grand scheme) your contribution won’t have made a big difference for an already successful game.
I just get why people just can't wait and buy them second hand. Triple A games are so expensive these days anyway.
Yeah, just pirate it if you wanna play it. r/piracy subreddit has a whole megathread of places to pirate from which is pretty simple. Plus, they update the download links for a game with the new patches and stuff up on the sites too.

The game's story is just gonna be a jackshit plot full of anti-Semitism and racism. So you're not missing out on much, but I understand the appeal of just fucking around and interacting with an open world HP game.

Personally, I'll probably pirate it if the game offers up subplots, side quests and other shit that might be decent. If not, the game just isn't worth anyone's time
As people are saying, buying this game puts money in the pocket of TERF, but you don’t exactly have to *buy* it
Yes it’s wrong
Yes it is wrong. I don’t care about your personal art philosophy. You’re giving money to an individual who WILL use it to harm others as well as the corporation who is willing to work with her, and you’re financially supporting a product that directly and indirectly supports harm to others. I’m really sorry that this is the franchise that makes you so happy, but I don’t think the joy you feel from looking at a pillow offsets the fact that you’re financially supporting people who at the very least don’t care about a group of people’s human rights, and at worst are actively working to oppress them. JK and her cronies take every purchase of Harry Potter related shit as support for their politics.

EDIT: for the record, this is coming from someone who was such a fan of HP he had to get a new set of the books because his old set was falling apart due to re-reading them so much. I LOVED the series dearly and it made me very happy. This does not change the fact that the harm its creators do (and the shitty elements in the actual material) exist and are much more serious than my fond memories.
If you have to play it pirate it.

Your money is going towards JK Rowling who is actively making trans people's lives harder and is a terf.
She just today sent hate towards a youtuber called Jessie Gender.

Buy Harry potter merch second hand, or from Etsy, where there's no money going towards JK if you want to get new merch.
Keep your old merch if you want to, but don't give any more money to JK Rowling, she's actively hurting trans people's lives.
Enough with the piracy bullshit. Don't interact with this franchise. Seriously, how hard is that for people?
Yes, the funds go to a woman who actively engages in hate including writing self insert terf books under a pseudonym that comes from an equally horrible man, but pirating I can't say is too bad...
I feel like, despite many different opinions here, buying this game does not mean you support her. Yes, it may support Rowling, but that doesnt mean you support her. I dont think its inherently wrong to get this if you really want it. I wont buy it because i dont want to give her any money, but i will not condemn others or look down upon others if they choose differently from me. i do understand Rowling is an awful piece of shit, but i also understand Harry Potter has had a massive effect of people. Do as you wish
I refer you to Jessie Gender's tweet on the matter. 

Tl;dr: it's ok to still enjoy the things you already own but buying new stuff from Joanne is funding her continued efforts to genocide us.
People are blowing this JKR thing and the plot line WAY out of proportion. Like it’s a video game!!! It’s not transphobic nor antisemitic. Get off of social media and touch grass, please. God I’m Gen Z and even I have to admit my generation is so soft. Always the virtue signaling. Always with the “woe is me” attitude. Seek mental help and grow up.
The author in question is already rich, her making more money on the game won't do anything. And most people will buy it regardless, so a handful of missed sales from conscientious objectors won't accomplish anything

Pick your battles, this isn't something that ultimately matters
The saddest part of all of this is that I could easily write an essay talking about how trans friendly Harry Potter is, with one huge theme of the books being to accept and love people for who they are rather than who society thinks they are. Then the author had to go and ruin that.
Yes.
It kinda hurts seeing some of these reapplies- because Harry Potter was literally everything to me as a kid- and while I try to avoid things that are t fandom made or whatever to not support Rowling I do agree that pirating the stuff might be the right way to go as I feel bad having some of my old Harry Potter stuff out on display from when I was younger I wouldn’t risk viruses or breaking your device for it- do what makes you happy- tho my advice would be to be aware and try to support these ppl as little as possible without sacrificing your happiness like try to buy fandom made stuff instead of officially licensed merch where possible but if this game is something you really want I’d say go for it if there’s no other safe way to get it idk
it is wrong, no question about it. the story is said to justify the slavery in the books/films, she profits directly from the sales, the game devs have already earned all they will off of it so buying it doesnt support any decent artists.
Yes is the simple answer.

I won't fault anyone for enjoying Hogwarts Legacy as a game, art is art, you like what you like. But if you buy Hogwarts Legacy you are funnelling money into the pockets of Joanme Rowling. She has made it explicitly clear that she takes anyone paying for her merch as an endorsement of her ideals and she will use that money to hurt trans people.

No one is saying you can't enjoy Harry Potter. It was a big part of a lot of people's childhoods and it would be unreasonable to expect everyone to jettison it wholesale. However if you continue to buy licensed merchandise in whatever form, you are contributing to her ability to further marginalise trans people.

If you want to play the game, I would suggest pirating it. If you pay for it, you are in essence saying that your entertainment is more important than the safety of trans people.

Unfortunately the concept of death of the author can only be realised when the author is actually dead. There is no separating art from the artist when the artist is still around and using that art to hurt people.
I also love Harry Potter for similar reasons but the way I go about it is I buy from small businesses. This way JKR isn’t profiting and I’m also supporting small business people and I get what I want in the end
Yes, yes it is, you know better than to financially help transphobic people/companies/entities
Now be good girl and don't buy any Harry Potter products and any other products that make that transphobic author any money ok hun. We of course still love you very much and continue to be here for you. You are a good girl. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
I’m going to be honest I didn’t read all this because the only answer is Its Wrong! Buying it directly puts money in Jks pockets and she views everyone who financially supports her as a supporter of her beliefs. There is no justifying it.
It is wrong no matter how you put it when you're giving money to a TERF.

Just pirate it.
Yes. End of. 

Supporting HP in any light at this point is support for JK.
Everybody on this thread mad holier than thou, but there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Every single thing you buy for fun or are forced to buy came at the cost of the suffering of others. Don't deprive yourself of something you enjoy because you don't want to make a millionaire 75c richer. And If you're going to, don't do it because you're letting people on reddit judge your morals, do it because you think it's the right thing to do.
Honestly your happiness is more important than the moral battle because at the end of the day J. K. Rowling is making a trans person happy 💜 also I bet if she knew it would really piss her off XD

One thing that would be really fantastic is if we started a trend where people were making stories and art about the all Harry Potter characters being trans and tagged her social media in the posts. It’s not possible for us to stop her from making money but we can twist her creation into some thing that she would hate 💜 and honestly I feel like a lot of other people could get behind that too
Support in all forms to the artist is an act of treason upon those that the author ""hates"". You are also complicit in their hate by buying their products. There are other games, there are other movies, there will be other authors. The only way you discourage hate in a capitalistic society is by voting with your wallet. You pay them money you vote for them. You withhold money from them you vote against the hate they stand for. What's worth more? Their hate? Your ""need"" to buy a silly game from them? Or, standing up against that hate by taking away the one thing they want more than anything in the world. Your money and your approval of them by receiving that money from you. Do the right thing. Do what your heart says is right. Hate the haters. I am intolerant of intolerance. ;)
Piracy > founding the deaths of trans people.  It shouldn't be hard choice. Sometimes I feel mega corporations brainwashed the minds of consumers,  for some piracy seme.to be worse than murder lol. When in reality whichever is good of bad depends a lot in the context. Don't let megacorporation and billiomaries root your brain.
I agree it is a bad a thing to give Rowling money, however I have the same dilemma. As a queer person, there's very VERY few things from my childhood that make me feel true happiness, and one of them was Harry Potter. It seems stupid but I went through real grieve when the whole Rowling transphobia thing came out cuz I felt like this last thing I had left from my childhood had also been taken away from me. With time, my personal decision has been to keep enjoying in, privately, and only speak about it with close friends, so at least I don't give it more publicity or whatever, but I'm not willing to give away one of the few things that make me feel joy. If you feel a similar way, tbh I believe it's just fine to go and enjoy the game. The transphobe is fuckin rich already anyway, torturing ourselves into not enjoying one of the few things we like isn't gonna change it.
What's so wrong with waiting a couple weeks and pirating it?
Yes.
Yes
If they like something masculine, (sports, wood carving, etc) I recommend giving a gift like that
Yes
For legal reasons, I can’t advise you to pirate it.
ive been told that rowling’s already been given all that the game devs are going to give her. so any profits go straight to the company, not rowling. so i dont think its wrong
PIRATE IT.
Yes.  


no nice way to put it.
No it’s not wrong!  Just do what you want don’t worry about what other people “disapprove” of!  And I know this post is gonna get downvoted but I don’t care!! Don’t give up on things you love just because other people tell you to!
I’ll start with the short answer and give my reasoning behind it. Is it wrong to buy the game? No, not at all. Yes JK Rowling has some horrendously disgusting views and is putting her billion dollar net worth towards some truly awful organizations, but Rowling has had no hand in the making of this game - asides from crafting the world twenty or so years ago. The devs of the game have been fighting to ensure that there are trans inclusive options (for example you don’t choose the characters gender, rather you choose their gender identity at the final screen and it has no bearing on your characters visual appearance) and characters, and I think it really shows. My recommendation is to decide whether or not you want to buy this game based solely on whether you would enjoy it - it’s not going to make JK’s pockets any deeper than they already are, but it will help to support the developers who want to make this series a safe place for all of us again
No. JK Rowling will have tons of money to spend on her hateful causes either way, whether or not you purchase this game is not gonna have an effect on her finances. It's not a very good game from what I hear, so that might be worth considering, but there's not really much of a moral dilemma. If you can play the game without it being ruined for you by the thought of what an asshole JK Rowling is, it's fine to buy it and play it.
I would just say wait a bit and buy it second hand. At least that way you are putting money into someone else’s pocket instead of directly into Rowling’s pocket.
Yes.

You don't have to be angry forever, but you could also choose to move on. Identifying so strongly with a media franchise isn't healthy.

You also don't have to give money to an antisemitic game in a setting made by a neoliberal transphobe.
It's a bad game made by a bad person. Don't even pirate it. There is better shit out there.
It isn't wrong at all, if you like it then you get to like it. I personally dislike Rowling for her actions, but it's not my choice to make other people not buy Harry Potter stuff. it's if they want to buy it.
Def pirate it if you can safely tho.
Just download the pirate game
I think it’s ultimately up to the individual. I think it’s fine, even though I won’t buy it, because avalanche studios is an independent, massive game company with dozens of workers and creators who made this game independent of Rowling. Unless she was directly involved (which she isn’t) or the creators also share really problematic beliefs, there’s enough of a gap between what she’s done and the creation of this game. That’s why I don’t support the books or the new movies as they were written by Rowling, but I support the parks and the original movies. 

I also think that she already makes so much money, that boycotting this game, even if no copies were sold, she would still be completely untouched. That’s also just hurting the creators of the game itself
I'm quite conflicted on this topic... 
I really like the harry Potter franchise and I started loving it before I knew Rowling was transphobic.

If there was a way to buy Harry Potter related things without financing Rowling I would love to do that. 
I have the same issue with FNaF products. The creator gave money to politicians that I don't agree with, but now the game has an amazing community who also creates games and stories. But that's kinda different because the creator retired so idk... 

I don't think the Harry Potter franchise is evil because the person who wrote the books is evil, but if when I buy something related to the franchise the money go to Rowling I don't think I would. 

Anyways it's kind of your choice, it's a delicate topic and you should do what you think is ok 🤷‍♂️
Buy it used, you get the game and don’t fund J K.
I'm probably getting it. The development team seems very against rowlings actions and they are working to rid the game of her hate. She doesn't have much influence at all in the development either and probably won't profit as much as people think. Even if she did she's already rich so it's not going to change her influence finance wise
just pirate it lmaoa pm if you want a link to a site where it will be on on launch day
it is morally wrong, but it’s not like you can’t buy it. i’ll probably buy it anyway
I've preordered it. It was completely sold out for the PS4 so I got it for my switch. One less sale wouldn't make any difference when lots of money had already been made from it. I might have considered not buying it if other people were doing the same, but that is clearly not the case so I'm not going to deprive myself of joy when other people are happy playing it 🤷‍♂️
Just fucking buy it you couldnt care less about anything related to JKR being a TERF anyways. I swear Im tired of those people tryna seem like good people for brownie points. Just be an actual ally and shut up.
I wouldn’t call it morally wrong, personally I don’t think ethics come into it strongly. Like, yeah you’re giving to this franchise…but like big whoop. Like, you’re just a single person, and your influence on this is zero, and you shouldn’t feel bad for the decision of the companies who made this. Because like Warner Brothers could’ve decided to stop making things in this franchise, but they didn’t, because they don’t care about what Rowling says or does. What they want to do is pass on that question to you, they want you to feel bad because you see a video game that you think sounds fun, and want to play it. Because if the question becomes a personal question, that insulates them from criticism. 

The fact is this, you have zero impact on this, whether you play it or not money will be made, and if you decide not to play it the only person that impacts is you, and the only thing it does is reinforce this toxic mentality that these corporations have created which is that you should feel bad for their unethical choices. 

Basically do whatever you want, if you decide not to play it because of JKR that’s fair enough, and even though I criticized the mentality of making the choice a reflection of your own ethics…I also understand entirely, because I often have a hard time doing similar things where I know I have no impact, and it doesn’t matter my choice, but I still make myself feel bad, I totally understand that choice. But if you decide to buy it, do so, and don’t feel bad about the unethical decisions of other entities who legitimately had an ethical question/decision to answer here.
I don’t think that liking Harry Potter is wrong and I don’t think that the author of Harry Potter is distraught about the trans community not buying her books. I think that you buying a couple books is not going to help some tyrannical dictator nor will it spread hate more than it already has. The author of Harry Potter does not need money to spread hate. If Harry Potter books are fulfilling to you I say go getem
no, buy the game if you want
however you feel about it honestly

death of the author exists but know that jkr gets her paycheck when the deal is signed.  *she already has all the money she’ll get for this.*  does buying this won’t give her money but it will signal to companies that 1 more person is interested in harry potter stuff.  no shame for supporting it and no shame for not supporting it.  do whatever you think is ok
Enjoy what u wamt to enjoy. Its ur life
Not at all. She’ll still make plenty of money with or without your purchase, nothing will change for her if you do or do not buy any Harry Potter related merchandise. The only thing that changes is you and your enjoyment of life. Do whatever makes you happy, we only have 1 life. It’s not worth it to make yourself miserable over this when absolutely nothing will change if you do or do not buy the game.
Well maybe I will get in trouble for saying this but fuck it, in cases like this piracy is an option, just wait a bit and it will eventually be cracked. You can also buy a second hand of a physical copy of the game, this way you will legitimately obtain the game while not giving any money to the author or studio
Absolutely not in my opinion. Rowling had nothing to do with the development of the game. It's the same thinking as pirating AAA games because they are cooperate giants instead of indie developers. But those indie developers aspire to be in a cooperate giant role. I doubt she will make much money off of the game since all she had to do with it is the story. You are giving money to people you don't agree with every single day without knowing who they are so I don't see why this is different.
Do what makes you happy.
Just because she's a jerk doesn't mean you can't enjoy Harry Potter I hate the jerk but I still like Harry Potter
Try and find a way to pirate it. if that doesn't work then like tbh its so inconsequential that you literally might as well buy it. the amount that you would lose from not getting to play the game that's really important to you is probably more than what JK rowling would gain from you buying it so like...
Steal it if you can. I’d recommend this about any digital formatted material. Most of us are poor. Take what you can, because those that are rich steal everything not nailed down using tax laws and any other laws they can hide behind. Fuk them. And especially fuk JK. She’s a troll and a POS… BTW, I’m really old. I loved the Harry Potter books and movies. Own the books own the movies. I love them and I agree with what you said about owning the personal feelings from enjoying the material. However, going forward, I wouldn’t spent one red fukn cent on anything from that cunt.
just pirate it
Yes.
Steal it lol
Join the dark side...
Yep
yes it is.
Yes. Simply yes.
The topic is a grey area, but remember, pirating is morally okay in some situations.  Either that or, like a lot of WB games, it will either come to gamepass or playstation plus at some point. You can download it without paying for it yourself. But if you are on switch or PC? Yar har fiddle dee dee, being a pirate is alright with me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: More specifically, a big corporation isn't going to ACTUALLY be hurting just because you pirate a game. The developers have already been paid. And the publisher is already deciding whether to cut them loose or keep them on for the next project. Our purchase really means nothing to them for the thousands that are going to purchase it. Probably just to spite us. Piracy is not okay when it is a small indie developer trying to share a passion project, or make their mark in the industry. WB is a big corporation making millions off of tax write offs, shady business deals, and merch sales alone for various projects. WB is a company that is morally okay to pirate from. So go nuts.
When they manage to make the game not antisemitic and you can play a trans charakter I will buy it. I dont really think I will though 😸.
Personally I don't like to support bad people unless I'm extremely passionate about that thing, even then I tend to make less purchases when I discover that they aren't supportive or whatever the bad thing might be.
Never buy anything with that name on it. It goes right into her pocket. If you REALLY want to play it that badly, pirate it, i'm sure it will be really easy to do once its released. And if you're scared of prating it, buy it secondhand.
It’s also wrong because there is no online gaming in higwarts legacy
I heard the reasons why people dislike the game... so I pre-odered the game for 2 consoles and pre-ordered the game as a Christmas present to a friend.
It's a game.
Rowlings involvement is the basic fantasy world around it. She rich.
The actual people involved are the programmers and designers that create it.... Those include people of different background, culture and sexual orientation.
Those are the people whose job, future and family might depend on the success of the game. Those are the people you punish by boycotting it.... Not Rowling....
I honestly can't stand this destruction aggressive behaviour of the LGBQT crybabies....
It's mere attention seeking, nothing more..... On the cost of others... 
Stop your whining and grow a pair (of any genitals of your sexual preference, because you are the same as anyone else and you should be allowed to express yourself the way you want. But I honestly don't care more about your whining for attention seeking as I care about that of any cis person -> absolutely zero. And in this way, any LGBTQ person has the same value to me as a cis person)
I know this is an old post so I’m hoping I’ll avoid the downvote mobs. 

It’s not wrong. It’s your $$ do what you want. 

It’s honestly more WRONG for other people to say what can and can’t do with YOUR OWN $$. 

You can separate the art from the artists. Don’t listen to other people.

JK is irreverent twat, and Harry Potter is much bigger than she ever will be.

Personally I pre ordered it. People fail to realize.. JK was PAID for the IP already… WAY before any of her dumb tweets.. and the money she got from that deal is more that any royalties she’s getting from game sales.. so it’s moot point. 

You’re not contributing much if anything to her terf shit.. she’s already a fucking billionaire.. and will do what she wants. 

Also the terf shit she is funding.. isn’t actually effect anyone in their day to day life.. people like to get mad for the sake of getting mad. 

So do what you want, buy the game, play the game, make videos on the game steam the game. 

Don’t over think it and enjoy your life, don’t let other people tell you what you can and cannot do with your own cash
First world problems.
This. If you can pirate it, fine, whatever. If you bought it already before you learned, well, the money’s spent, may as well enjoy it if you still want to. But spending more money in ways that enrich aggressive bigots who actively fund hate groups in trying to get bigoted laws passed is actively contributing to that bigoted effort whether that’s your motive or not. 

Put it this way, if someone were selling chocolate as a fundraiser to build a puppy-kicking machine, being very open about their desire to kick puppies more efficiently and make sure no puppy remains unkicked, would it be ok to buy their fundraiser chocolate just because you like chocolate a bunch?

Find another form of entertainment. There’s plenty of chocolate that doesn’t fund a puppy-kicking machine.
Probably not even after she dies to be honest. A lot of big money people set up foundations and the sale from their art form after their death goes to the foundation that will then use that in whatever way the person wanted. I can't honestly see her not doing this. She's in the process right now of setting up a women's thing (I can't remember what it was for) and its for cis women only.
I wish people would talk about this aspect more. It’s not only giving her your money, but also choosing to ignore all of the other racism, antisemitism and more within the books and this game. Her world is not fun despite her being transphobic, it’s poorly written with bigotry in every chapter.

Edited to add: I just think it shows people have no backbone to support their own supposed morals. Sure a single person purchasing the game wont do much, but everyone claiming that THEY are the exception and it isn’t a big deal means a shitton of people are excusing themselves cuz “they’re just one person”. So a shitton of people are purchasing the game giving this woman money.
This is a bit of a misconception, and an assumption.

We don't know what the character is going to do with the goblin rebellion, and we don't know how it'll play out. We don't know if the main character will start out with the typical anti-human sentiments that were likely common at the time, but they then transition into being sympathetic to the goblin cause. We don't know if the goblins will be attacking students and civilians, requiring the main character to respond in defense, rather than to suppress the revolt.

Not to mention there are similar concepts in plenty of other IP. Skyrim, for one. Do you fight for the stormcloaks that discriminate against elves? Or do you fight for the Empire, which is falling apart from within?

Second, the claims that the portrayal of goblins is anti-Semitic has been disproven a few times.

Goblins in Harry Potter are portrayed pretty well in line with European fairy tales about Goblins, which predate anti-Semitic tropes. The similarities are coincidental, rather than intentional.

Suffice it to say, we don't know how the goblin revolts will play out, and the claims of anti-Semitism have been disproven.
There’s a pretty good thread about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/x0n0fn/even_if_the_transphobia_doesnt_bother_you_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from r/WitchesVsPatriarchy
We don’t know anything about the plot besides the tagline “possible goblin rebellion” and that the major mystery will be ancient magic. It’s too early to know exactly what route the story will follow
I thought the house elves were slaves and the goblins were she who shall not be named's beliefs in Nazi propaganda of Jewish bankers made in the Wizarding world?

Either way she's absolutely disgusting so I guess it doesn't matter.
Yet we kill countless innocent people in games and don't blink an eye.. Lol
It's fiction, the goblins are not stand ins for Jewish people, it's in the Wizarding World, so it's from the perspective of fictional magic people in a fictional world, also we gotta remember that this is just stuff that is established in the Wizarding universe, it's no different than any other horrible thing established in any other universe.
Yes! STEAL IT!!!
Be gay. Do crime.
This is the best answer lol
So basically you do seperate the art from the artist. But you just want to steal. If you pirate you have the same views as her. Because it is a world made from her ip so indirectly from her mind. So you do agree with her than
Wow, what a moronic bitch. Even the actors themselves (and almost all fans) disagree with her, and it’s honestly just as much of not more theirs than hers. Fuck her. It’s not even her call to make on who is “allowed” to enjoy the HP universe and story. Egotistical as fuck.
indirectly? she literally just tweeted “merry terfmas” and has been VERY clear that she has transphobic beliefs *and is proud of it.* iirc she’s also donated to anti-trans organizations. i’d say she’s a terf very directly

sorry if this comes off as aggressive, i promise it’s not targeted at you. jkr just makes me so mad and it sucks cuz i really like harry potter
Directly anti-Semitic and pro-authoritarian?

First the claims that the portrayal of goblins is anti-Semetic have been disproven. Second we have no idea how the story line will play out with the goblin revolt. We know there will be choices in-game related to the plot. It's very possible the player character is able to develop sympathy for the goblins and doesn't take part in any sort of suppression.

Even if they do, who cares? It's art. There are portrayals of slaves in media all the time.
Absolutely agree with you there. Boycotting sounds good and all, but it doesn’t actually help people who are actively struggling. It certainly won’t stop religious organizations in the US from funding anti-LGBTQ politicians and their rhetoric
This thread makes me sad because there's a lot of judgment being thrown at anyone that would consider buying this game. Like it sucks that money is going to someone like Joanne, but placing individual responsibility on any single person isn't fair or realistic. No ethical consumption under capitalism, y'know? Should people be shamed for buying factory farmed meat? Produce from farms that exploit undocumented workers? Cars that add to pollution? Consumable items with plastic packaging? Getting services at a for-profit hospital or clinic? All of these things are bad but it's not any one consumer's fault. And if you're not going to flame someone for all these other things but you would for buying this game, where's the morality in that? Transphobia is fucking awful but it's a hard sell that it's any more worth starting fights over than pollution, animal cruelty, labor exploitation, healthcare inequality, etc. And it wouldn't be worth being a toxic asshole to people over indirectly supporting those things either, because they individually have no power over those things, just as we have no power over Joanne's transphobia.
Exactly this. There is such a thing as separating the art from the artist. Unfortunately that has had to happen alot lately. The story itself has all been about love and accepting people for who they are. It does suck that she is going to profit from the game due to her owning the IP. Though thankfully had no involvement on the story itself outside of keeping the lore intact... Dont want another cursed child incident. Truthfully I agree it should be a choice. And whether or not you play the game shouldnt decide whether or not your a transphob that some people may claim you to be..   


I know some trans people that are excited for the game and obviously despise and are hurt over JK for her words against the trans community. Hopefully the recent talks from WB is true and they plan on trying to get her to sell it completely to them. Because they want to make new movies... but not with her in the picture.
PIRATE TIME BA-BY
You cant blame people for liking the franchise, i have friends who are going to buy it and i dont chastise them for it. We all know the creator is trash but im not going to let that drive a wedge between me and my friends that support me. This is where piracy works perfectly less money goes to the terf and people get to enjoy the content. 

It’s a crappy situation but we should try and make the best of it. At the end of the day every sane person knows is trash. The only thing we accomplish by trying to force our friends away from the franchise is making ourselves seem overbearing.

Lmfao literally
This is silly. Of couse there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. But its also important to do things that don't directly have an affect on you as a person. Morals vs ethics.
Thank you!!! Can’t believe I had to scroll this far to find a reasonable take lol
i think you’re a little naive, she would not be pissed that harry potter made a trans person happy, she’s be laughing knowing that she’s getting money from a trans person. money that will go straight into the pockets of other people trying to kill trans people.
What a sweet answer and I agree!
Treason is going a bit far, that kind if rhetoric only alienates people that are on the fence. Also this isnt some random brand its pretty ingrained in alot of peoples childhood. 

I know it sucks that the author of a prolific franchise hates us, but if every trans person got into arguments with their friends about this we would all seem pretty unhinged. Everyone knows the creator is trash and honestly I don’t know if trans people are even a big enough group to make a dent in the revenue.
[deleted]
once that thing people love starts directly harming me or other people i hold dearly, i think i have a legitimate right to be peeved about it and try and stop them from doing it.
Agreeeeeeeeeeed :3
Joanne wasn't even involved in the making of this game lmao.
the whole mentality of ""it's just one sale"" is bullshit. once everyone starts thinking that it's not just one sale is it?

you framed it in a way that makes it seem not that bad, that means more people are probably gonna buy it just because ""it's only one sale"".
Okay but...they only keep making it because it make money. If it doesn't make enough money because people stop buying it, especially if they have a cited reason of ""Rowling's hate speech"" then yeah, they might question the ethics of working with her.
I think that’s something you have to decide.   Personally I will not buy it.  I used to love Harry Potter and still do.  I haven’t seen, bought, or even viewed any HP on tv which was hard because I used to always watch it.  That’s just me though.   I know she had little say over this project but she still gets paid because it’s her IP.   We all have to personally decide where the line is.
JK’s net worth is in the billions. Whether or not this game sells will have no perceived impact on her financially. Pirating the game would only hurt the development team who have been fighting add trans inclusive options such as in the character development. I understand where you’re coming from, but let’s be honest she probably makes more in a day from the deal with universal studios amusement park than this game will generate in a 5 year span
What if someone back in the day with a huge pile of money set up a foundation to spread pro slavery propaganda or something else that is unethical? Would we still see campaigns of pro slavery today from it or would there have been interventions? Assuming the money doesn't run out.
Well, we know the villain is a goblin named Ranrok that incited a goblin rebellion in Harry Potter history. Even if the conflict isn't blatantly ""stopping a slave revolt,"" they still have the antisemitic caricature as the main antagonist.
Crimes are ok if they are against people you don't like?
i most definitely do not share her views or agree with her- i have no interest in the game and have no idea what the game is about other than harry potter. the truth is people want the game. for whatever reason that may be; it could be playing with a friend, nostalgic attachment to harry potter, general interest in video games i have no idea. i’ve never pirated a game before- but if you have such a strong desire to get a game despite it being made by someone who has terrible views, then pirating is pretty much the best way to do that as it doesn’t directly/financially support the creator. otherwise i mean- just don’t get the game, right?
""almost all fans""  
Hmmmm, not really. Actually those who hate JK Rowling are a tiny minority. Hogwarts Legacy isn't even out yet and it's the best selling game on Steam in a long time.
no lol i worded that very poorly. she is a HUGE terf, it’s just that her terfiness isn’t directly manifested in the game, and purchasing and playing the game only indirectly validates it, vs engaging with the game itself validating her antisemitism
Yeah, she seems pretty unrepentant and proud of her shitty views. Also she pals around with other TERFs who pal around with fascists (neo-nazis, white identitarians, christian fascists, etc.) and has shown support for these views which are not only anti-trans, but are also anti-queer in general, and also misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, and antisemitic. Basically if you support any human rights cause JKR should raise an eyebrow for the company she keeps.

And before anyone comes at me and says you aren't responsible for who your friends and associates associate with, do you have any friends who are close buddies with avowed fascists? I'm gonna guess not cause it's a pretty hard lapse in judgement to look past.
I feel like which artists we choose to support is a different conundrum than many of the other examples you mention. We all have to eat and all affordable food comes with baggage. And yea, we all need entertainment, but if we’re going to use our money and voice and time to enjoy an artist’s work I don’t think it’s so bad to prefer an artist who is enjoyable rather than one who wants us dead. There’s tons of authors and game makers. Tons of less awful people that would love to have 1% of notorious terf Jk rowlings influence and appreciation. Anyway yeah I don’t try to shame anyone either but I do try to avoid giving help and support to the most outspoken of transphobic voices
I have beef with the way OP came here just to gaslight us how Hogwarts Legacy situation isnt that bad. IN A TRANS SUB. When the author uses her power to belittle us.

That being said i agree with you. Its like the ""brush your teeth with a cup of water"" to save the planet. Effective step but then you have factories doing more damage in a hour than your whole lifetime. Who gives a shit someone pays 50$ for her game when actors could have made a statement by refusing to participate in her movies or studios not working with her on behalf of her transphobia. 

The sad truth is little can affect her. Shes rich, she has influence, she could get 0 money till her death and still live well.
Thank you for being the only sane person on this
I don't have to imagine it. Harry Potter was the driving force behind me not only learning to read but developing a love for fantasy. That's the hobby I'll be continuing.
you seem to forget that just about every trans person more than likely spent their entire childhood (and often more) as a gender different from how we identify now. part of transitioning is leaving that behind. 

“I’m invested in this” is not an excuse to continue supporting someone who is actively working to kill us. i do not understand how anybody would want to uplift a franchise that a) is already extremely problematic in itself, being riddled with antisemitism & classism, and b) was created by an awful trans-hating cunt.
Actually it is pretty easy to cut off childhood media franchises. You can just find something else. Attaching yourself to media that way is unhealthy and uncritical.

The thing is that most hobbies aren't harmful. Nobody who knits is going to be told they should stop because of moral complications.

But stories? There are millions of stories. If a story sucks, you can just find a new one.
I'm a black disabled queer trans person. There is no item I could buy that wouldn't directly victimize me or someone else. There is no item anyone could buy. Why do you only care about morals when the group you belong to is involved? You gonna stop eating bananas because Chiquita uses slave labor or nah? Also, I'm poor. Telling people their morals aren't in tact for buying things that hurt people when I can't afford to buy things that don't hurt people means I should just.. die? This isn't about just a game it's about everything. Imma stay silly, thanks.
Look at the end of the day the terf is never going to be successfully boycotted and she has more money than she knows what to do with(800 mil). The only thing I could see getting her deplatformed is if she went all kanye and attacked jewish people.

If harry potter merch makes OP happy then thats what matters most. The worst thing we can do as a community is drive a wedge between trans Harry Potter fans and the rest of the community. We are already a somewhat isolated group and I don’t want to see people get more isolated just because they like Harry Potter.
well it's turning your back on them is I guess what I wanted to say. it was a flow of consciousness and the correct word failed me at that moment and I unfortunately used one that has a trigger effect for many. Was a bit harsh. For this I do apologize. I don't edit, I should. Every penny counts ask any accountant. Can't have a dollar without a penny. Use the money for good, contribute it to fight the hate instead of fueling the demons of hate. Do you really need more stuff? Can't you borrow it from someone or buy a used one in a few months off ebay? Steal it? Boycotts work if you work them. Get supporters on board. Go make yourself heard like it's Stonewall. I don't like nor care for the whole genre, so no love lost here for JK to begin with, but I get people have a sentimental attachment to it and that is hard to let go of. That's the part that hurts. Like lost innocence.
If a horrible person writes a book, I don't buy it. If Hitler wrote a book say, and called it ""My Struggle"" about how he had to struggle to survive as a educated white person in a educated white person dominated world, and he put the blame on his failures on poc, the disabled, lgbtqia and any other marginalized communities that are easy to make scapegoats, and encouraged others to denigrate and belittle those communities, I'd be not at all willing to pay money to read it. I can't help it if joe corporate cheats on his wife and is mean to dogs. So I might buy his brand of shoe. Totally different things here. Apples meet oranges.
It's different when it's a cultural product that reflects the worldview of the creator. Utility products don't have that kind of baggage.

For example, if I heard a movie director was racist, I would indeed stop watching their movies.
Well it’s not about you!  You’re free to boycott something you’re against but it’s not fair for you to make someone else stop.  And it’s not directly harming you.  If ANYTHING, it’s indirect.
I agree it's not a great mentality but when a majority of people are thinking like this, it's kind of impossible to do anything about it.
I'm sure there's even some people buying this game who aren't even aware of how shitty JK Rowling is. They're just there to play the game and that's it. I doubt any reasonable consumer genuinely wants to support someone like JK. 

I think about this mentality from time to time and it can be applied to alot of things. For example, recycling. It's pretty good for the environment.
If I do my part, that's great. But recycling only really seems effective when everyone takes part. Is everyone taking part in it? No. But I'm not going to use that as my reasoning to NOT recycle.

I know comparing a game to something like recycling may seem silly but they are similar mentalities
You’re not wrong, but like…that’s never going to happen. Because like even if people decide to take a principled stance against this, which is fair enough there are still countless who either don’t know, or either are actively onboard with JKR. And that is fundamentally the issue at play here. Even if OP doesn’t buy the game they will be outweighed (most likely) by those who do, because it doesn’t matter what JKR says or does to them. Therefore, they will never face that ethical question, because either it won’t get to that point or if it does they may still disregard that, and argue that it is a fluke. My point fundamentally is that companies have no ethics, they will fuck over anybody and everybody for a dollar, and when they do they will foot the blame to the consumer such as OP.
If people are asking for opinions on whether or not it’s ok to buy it, I’m gonna give mine. I can’t actually prevent you from buying a game just because I think it’s morally wrong to do so.
That's not how development works. The developers have been paid what they are going to be paid. They do not get extra money based on sales numbers.

And by the way, the lead designer on Hogwarts Legacy is a massive misogynist and vocal supporter of gamer gate, the social movement that has bullied more than one female developer to suicide.
What on earth are you talking about, get out of here with that disingenuous nonsense.
The only intervention that happens in that case is when the thing being supported becomes illegal. A pro Slavery campaign would cease because Slavery is illegal. Places like the UK and America can't even seem to legislate hate crimes against black people or women to be illegal (or at least enforceably so) so the chances that discrimination against trans people because illegal enough that her estate can't support it anymore is very unlikely. By the time it happens, HP will be a distant memory.
That's not what I was saying, but I'll play your game.
Then the people who feed more money into this person by buying their products would be funding even more people to get hurt than would have if people stop funding this moron. It may stop eventually but the collateral damage of people who are hurt by this rhetoric will be higher.

What I was saying was referencing the the previous comment or saying it would be ok to buy her crap once she's dead because then she can't continue her tirade against trans people. She absolutely can continue her tirade if she sets up a foundation to do so.
I believe the goblins in the series are based off the folklore creatures from the Middle Ages mixed with dwarves from fantasy series like the Lord of the Rings, rather than the antisemitic caricature made to compare Jews to monsters and demons. Truly is disgusting what depths people have gone and will go to harm others
I don’t condone people buying the game, but I have to say I don’t think the majority of those buyers necessarily like her or support her views. They’re supporting her monetarily, which as I said I don’t condone, but I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that the game sales is indicative of people who love or respect JK. I’ve been in the HP fandom and spaces for years and transphobia seems pretty staunchly opposite to what the majority of them like and stand for, a lot of them even being LGBT themselves, like myself. But I understand I’ve only seen a tiny fraction. I think what you’ll see a lot of people saying is that they don’t feel like buying the game is directly supporting her, and more so supporting the game studio, etc. Or that there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism, or they don’t feel like them specifically refraining from doing something they’ll enjoy (playing a long awaited game) is going to have much of an affect on an already FILTHY RICH terf. I still don’t agree with buying it, but I think that’s what most people might say when you ask why they’ll buy a game that’s connected to someone so hateful.
Right, it's not a perfect 1:1. But still, the overall point remains the same, that people can be super needlessly toxic about this kind of stuff. People are acting like anyone that buys the game is a traitor who hates trans people and that $60 is a game-changer in spreading or stopping transphobia. I don't plan on buying the game and spending money on things tied to explicitly bigoted people doesn't sit right with me either, but all the in-fighting and ""no true Scotsman"" bullshit has got to go.
I'm so sorry if it came out that way. I definetly think it's a big deal or I wouldn't have asked. I know first hand how damaging her influence is. I thought this was the right sub since I wanted an opinion from people who are trans and not from some random people who are not affected by it. Could you please quote where it seems that way so I can edit it? Again I'm so sorry I really didn't mean to and if I sounded disrespectful in any way I would like to know
They probably don’t mean to gaslight, and are feeling conflicted about liking something created by a controversial author. That’s why they bothered making this post.

A lot of people who like Harry Potter don’t connect it with the author at all. I prefer fanfiction, so it’s easy for me to not support her while still enjoying it. But she still has the rights to it, so official products fund her on some level and I try to avoid that. My point is, the world of Harry Potter is almost completely separated from the author. You can appreciate it without supporting her. Actors in the movies disavow her, and substantial parts of the fandom does too. 

OP is struggling to decide how they feel and how they want to approach this, and are telling us how they’ve self-justified it. That’s not really gaslighting. 

And I think boycotting her product can have an affect. If everything related to her barely sells, her reputation suffers, and she’ll struggle to find companies to partner with. It’s obviously not perfect, but it does something.
You’re using the term “gaslight” incorrectly. What you’re calling gaslighting is someone presenting a view different than yours, that you find offensive. 

Gaslighting is when one person directly attempts to alter another person’s perception of truth or reality, with intention, on purpose. 

You can 100% disagree with their take, but this is not gaslighting.
[deleted]
Give me a break. That's reaching. You're equating life to just not support a video game because it's creator is a transphobe. The multitudes in which those two things are diffent are HUGE.
this is the worst mindset to have. “it’ll never happen so why not keep supporting her” is exactly the reason it will never happen
>Well it’s not about you! 

no, it's not about me, it's about the fact you and others are content with supporting a terf just to play a game. i know everyone's willing to abandon their morals for convenience or fun every now and then, but this is still annoying and i have a right to be annoyed. 

sure, it's not directly harming me, but that support given is still a bad thing that can and most likely will impact people whether you like it or not. just because something isn't impacting me specifically, doesn't mean i can't be mad about it.

and even then, indirect harm is STILL HARM.
>I know comparing a game to something like recycling may seem silly but they are similar mentalities

no i absolutely understand it

i just wish i could *make* people be better with this sorta stuff. it can be so infuriating
But at the same time, companies don't want most of the money, they're only Happy if they get ALL of the money. If a game doesn't meet expected targets, either from slightly less sales, reviews, etc then they'll be less inclined to produce more. It's already happened to their mobile games. The HP franchise is a behemoth on weak legs; it's creator is controversial, it's newest properties have been very weak and underperforming, and people are starting to see the commercialization of it the way star wars got when Disney took over. This game doesn't need to fail, it just needs to not succeed flawlessly for it to be a big hit against Rowling and WB. Companies aren't unstoppable. Voting with your wallet does work. Especially in the gaming sphere.
You didn’t . Whatsoever . You asked a question. Anyone who makes you feel bad is the problem NOT YOU . AT ALL
Laugh it off honestly
You’re not gaslighting anyone, you’ve been respectful and asked a genuine question. Don’t fret over it
yeah but also looking at hp from a contemporary lens it’s… fucking awful. it’s incredibly fatphobic and antisemitic, the transphobic snipes about rita skeeter are thinly veiled, and hermione was laughed at for trying to abolish elf slavery (which of course, they *liked*). plus harry sees all this shit happen with the ministry of magic and decides to be a cop anyway. like… i’m sorry, op & commenter. i really am. i am nonbinary and have a hp tattoo (that i now despise) from before the terf shit came out. but knowing what we know now i don’t understand how some of y’all feel okay with continuing to engage with this fandom. read another book! try rick riordan!
Who said anything about easy? Doing the right thing only when it doesn't impact you is easy. Interacting with this franchise directly contributes to JK's social, political, and yes monetary power. People are being asked to look critically at their contribution to that. And for many, that's too much to ask. Arguments like this, may make that more palatable, but no less problematic. At the end of the day, folks will do as their conscience dictates.
I'm saying my opinion applies to both situations. This convo is no longer about video games, apparently now its about ethical/moral consumption. I've shared my opinion and if you don't like it that's okay. If you haven't already, You will probably never have to experience something that would force that opinion upon you and I'm grateful for that. But I hope you stick to your own morals and stop shopping at every company that does business with/supports chik-fil-a. It's a long list. If you truly believe this, you'll Google it and make a long list of all the places you can't shop. If you believe in your own opinion that is.
I mean personally i dont buy any harry potter merch, but im not going to bash someone who enjoys it. Also J. K. Rowling is 57 years old lets say she lives till 90 god forbid, her net worth is currently 800 million dollars. She could blow 24 million dollars a year for the next 33 years. So yeah she is set for life at this point even if harry potter died off today. So yes boycotting at this point is pointless. 

And the most important thing we can do is stand together and support each other as a community. If we let stupid shit like who likes Harry Potter divide us then that’s only hurting us. There are literally people in the thread saying anyone who buys Harry Potter merch is a traitor. That’s not OK, that’s the opposite of supporting each other.
“Voting with your wallet” is meaningless nonsense. Either you will be outvoted, or you will end up voting for someone who’s a more covert evil than the original evil. The effect of one individual or even 1000 individuals is overall in the grand scheme of things irrelevant.
That's a lot of speculation on your part.
the opposite of supporting each other is giving money to the people trying to kill us, not saying “hey it’s okay that you’re giving money to people trying to kill us”
People like you are the reason we end up with shitty politicians because instead of using your vote you just whine and say ""whaaaa, voting doesn't matter!"" 
Quit being a pessimist. In this case ""voting"" Is literally ""do nothing"". Maybe OP can take a lesson in that from you.
And not enough on yours. You've only considered yourself. Maybe you should step into someone else's shoes for a moment and research/think about how hard it actually is to live in a way that *you* think is moral. Have a good day ☆
So you really just want to be mad at something even if it’s at the cost of some trans people. The world isnt black and white, there are gray areas. 

There is literally nothing you or anyone can possibly do to stop J. K. Rowling from donating to those shitty groups. She already has hundreds of millions of dollars. That fight is lost, it sucks but that’s life, Life sucks sometimes. 

If you want to not give J. K. Rowling your money that’s fine. But don’t give other people shit for enjoying Harry Potter. Because half the clothes in your closet were probably made by underage sweatshop workers that you supported. Fast food, thats made by criminally underpaid workers desperately trying to make rent. Bottled water is produced by companies who are stealing water from communities. You can’t throw a stone in this world without hitting A company or a person that takes advantage of people or has shitty beliefs. 

The one thing we can do, and it’s by far the most important thing, is stop the trying to make our fellow trans people feel bad about buying something as simple as a Harry Potter pillow.
Ok serious question for you…what sparked this change in topic? Like, nothing we previously were talking had to do with actual voting, like why pivot the conversation? As to the other things you say you’re correct, I believe that voting doesn’t matter. I fundamentally don’t believe that change can come from the ballot box, I don’t see that as being pessimistic though, I do believe change can and will come as that it is the eventual nature of things (although it’s not so linear as things just automatically change for the better, you have to work for that) I am optimistic in this belief. 

But again this comes back to the fundamental debate that exists within this conversation, your belief that the actions of an individual whether that’s OP buying Hogwarts Legacy, or my opposition to voting, has a fundamental impact, which is contrast to my belief that neither OP buying the game or me not voting has a fundamental impact because there are structures that exist outside of the action or inaction of the individual that impair that action from having any real impact. Fundamentally speaking, I have no impact on what politicians are elected or what policies they pursue, because I could vote in every single election for a candidate who best reflects my beliefs, but one of the following will occur: A. Not win because of money which stands in opposition to their election (I.e. Jeremy Corbyn is the best example I can think of), B. Win but not have the power to make any change because of the structures which exist outside of themselves, C. Win and become part of the structure they may have wished to change, and thus wish to maintain that structure (B&C is any so called “progressive” or “democratic socialist” within like the US), D. Win and then be removed by that structure outside of themselves (I.e. Salvador Allende).
Lol what do i have to research or think about? I'm literally talking about making a personal decision not to support someone who has a hatred for who i am/most people are here. Talking about the ethics of living in capitalism is a larger issue. That's not the conversation we are having here. 

I am all for debating/talking about that and i understand it's difficult to make decisions when you're not financially equipped to do so. I do. I've lived my whole life that way. But honestly there's no connection between what you're talking about here. Moral and ethical aren't the same thing.
your viewpoint is so twisted. nobody is going to die if they can’t buy Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy. buying Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy, however, can *and will* aid in the harm of trans people. Yes, i absolutely will give shit to any person, trans or not, for giving money to people who are a direct danger to the trans community. 

not everything is black & white, but this subject absolutely is. i have no interest in responding to you further as you clearly care more about your precious little harry potter than the lives and wellbeing of the people in this community.
Don’t waste your time on that child
This right here is literally the wedge driving I was talking about. I don’t even own anything Harry Potter related. 

The only thing I care about is not alienating other trans people. I’m not gonna get mad at a trans person for buying the stupid game. Because when you do that you’re the one causing the problem with that one person. You’re pushing them away because of something stupid. And now they have one less friend or community member to lean on. All because you want to be self righteous.
Just because it’s black and white to you doesn’t make the situation any less nuanced. Universal Studios has an entire section of a theme park for the Harry Potter IP, which likely generates more revenue in a day than this game could possible hope to make in 5 years. There isn’t an ethical way to consume in today’s capitalistic climate, so my recommendation to all is that if they must purchase or engage in said media, then match their money or time and direct it to organizations that support the communities that would be hurt"	zp0rci	trans	138	0.85	2022-12-18 15:12:58
Tattoos	What kind of tattoos do you have about your identity?	"i have ""HE"" on my arm and the mars symbol on my thigh
I have tons of tattoos, I got a fox on my arm as my ‘coming out’ gift to myself. I just like foxes and they are cool.

After I get chest surgery I’m planning to get a black feather to cover the scars, it’s going to have pink, blue and white birds flying out of the top of it
I have ""trans antichrist"" in small typewriter font tucked in with my other tattoos. Pretty edgy I know but I like it.

Edit: https://imgur.com/gallery/DEpTJ1S here's all my tats, I'm instantly getting flamed and downvoted on imgur lol
I have a rotting unicorn on my thigh...its so dope.
Been meaning to get a lil raven in a Hawaiian shirt as I like to think of myself as less of a person and more of a conspiracy of 13 ravens pretending to be human
I have the two gender symbols with static in the middle of them that kinda look the they’re pulling into each other

Please ignore the hairy body, I’m still a work in progress
My goal after top surgery is to get monster teeth over my chest scars with green teeth and purple outline. I want them to give off random portal vibes
Not a single one about my identity. That shit is already permanent mental trauma lol I don’t need the daily reminder
Apollon and Hyakinthos, each on an arm. I plan on getting more tattos but oof
I was kinda dumb a handful of years back. Still in major denial about who I was, and I was in a very ""masculine"" environment. And upon some liquid courage I went out with some team mates and got a tattoo I regret. It's not a bad tattoo, it's actually well done. It just gives off major masculine vibes and while sometimes I like that, it makes me sad whenever I see it in a bathing suit or go sleevless
Ever since I came out, I wanted to get one on the inside of my wrist that was like an black M that was in a very like professional sariff font, like it was typed on a type writer. Then I wanted what looked like red marker crossing it out and writing an F above it in my hand writing. I don't have it yet and I have other tattoos I wanna get first, but I still really like the idea and wanna get it eventually
I have the date (without month) when I came out tattooed to my left wrist. My birthday is the same day, just a different month.

It combines a lot of my likes and I went with pink white and blue for the crystal color scheme in it to represent my being trans
none yet, but i want to get an infinity sign with the superimposed mars/vensus

i also have an idea to get a jesus fish with a pink line coming off it to represent the act of anamnesis (""unforgetting"") from philip k dicks valis (being hit by a pink laserbeam reflecting off a jesus fish necklace), since the red pill from the matrix is an allegory for both anamnesis/gnosis and for hrt, so by the transitive property jesus fish+pink laser represents hrt
I want to get a blue butterfly once I finish my GRS and FFS operations. Since that'll mark the day I finished my transition.
Had an idea for the dark side of the moon art but it's either just the bi flag or the progress flag
I plan on getting Figment with the Non-binary flag, and a Ghost with hairy legs and high heels in Pansexual colors
I have a hand holding a pendant with a diamond, it symbolizes my feminity 🥰
Not exactly an ""identity""-specific tattoo, but I'm planning a full sleeve to cover my RFF phalloplasty scars.

It's going to be garden themed, based on 1900's botanical illustrations. Not sure what all the plants will be, but there will be a green carnation worked in there somewhere.

My current plan is that it will be full coverage up to my elbow, then start thin out a bit, with just a single tree branch continuing up across my shoulder and onto my chest (and across my top surgery scars). I haven't decided what type of tree yet, or season. I'm leaning towards an apple tree in mid-summer, when the small apples are starting to grow.
I have a semicolon with the dot being a heart with script writing saying "" my story isn't over"" through the middle of the semicolon . To remind me to keep going with my transition. Next I want a butterfly in trans pride colors.
None yet, but ill get Aviciis logo soon.
I don't have any yet, but I want to get a small Perthro rune under my collarbone

I find its meaning quite fitting: ""Perthro is the rune that symbolizes interaction between the free will and external constraints and limitations. [...] Perthro has a connection to wyrd, what’s possible, and what can happen.""
It's not an overly obvious one but I have a chameleon on my leg.  He's chilling on a paintbrush with his artist hat and sketchbook, and the paint on the paintbrush is in the trans flag colors.  His name is Danielle :3


Means something to be as I'm both trans and an artist, and I love chameleons lol
I don't have a tattoo, yet. I'm planning on getting a Phoenix in the trans flag colors after I have bottom surgery.
I just got a red heart with a pink outline yesterday, and i intend on getting another at some point. The second one will be a cupcake. The wrapping on the bottom will be like a baby/pale blue, the frosting will be white, and there'll be a pink cherry on the tippy top.
Ok, so I hope I can explain this adequately: I got my very first tattoo as a self dedication to transitioning when I decided I was going to. It's based on the artwork from The Open Door album by Evanescence (cause that band's music helped me so much when I was struggling with my identity and dysphoria). The ""e"" logo is wrapped up in a knotwork of vines that form the Venus symbol for womanhood, with the Lacrymosa moth's wings making the ""arms"" of the symbol. Around the top blossom three nightshade berries, one for each of the women in my immediate family: my mom, sister, and me.
I literally only have dragon tattoos
I have a mechanical OuroBoros on my back left shoulder. It represents me in soooo many ways.
I have a few that are related to identity, although not all of them would immediately be obvious to others. One is rainbow colors so kinda obvious but another is part of a poem that has felt important during my transition
I have a drawing of my upper half with top surgery scars and flowers around some that only grow where I come from and some sakuras too
I have a female symbol on my forearm wreathed in wildflowers. It was my first tattoo that I got on my six month anniversary of starting hormones
Most of my thigh has 2 koi in a yin/yan. The upward swimming fish (traditionally representing struggle) is a masc black and red while the downward swimming fish (traditionally representing overcoming) is a more femme pink/orange. There’s a few sakura blossoms floating in the water with them.

I wanted in a place I could show off dressed more femme and not be prominent dressed masc
None yet, but I plan on getting a butterfly with the wings being trans pride colours, probably once I start to transition. Y'know, like I'm waiting to emerge from my cocoon into my beautiful new self and be free. Or something like that. 

That's my current idea, but maybe I'll go with something else. There's a lot of creative ideas in this thread.
Atari logo with trans flag gradient colors
I have a Batman Forever tattoo, it doesn't really say much about my identity but it's rad af. But really, I would love to get something queer related, but I have no idea what yet.
I'm getting mushroom tattoos. They transform so much from a single spore into a full body, and I kinda feel that.

Also, we all know what they look like.

Especially stinkhorns.
I have lyrics from an Against Me song off Transgender Dysphoria Blues on my right forearm
I want to get the chemical composition of dopamine on over some self inflicted scars I want to reclaim.

Ooh! I have two tattoos about being trans. One is the Latin text “Ab Principio”, which means from the beginning, which is something I connected to the idea that my identity has always been with me.
The other is a sleeve of kintsugi which I always related to the process of pain and relearning myself during my life.
I currently don't have any (unless you count my monster tab lmao) but I plan to get an atlas moth on my chest after top surgery, moreso to represent feeling free from this bullshit and I plan to get a tattoo that incorporates the trans symbol ⚧ and a rainbow
When I finally start HRT, I’m considering getting a blue, pink and white phoenix with my name above and the date I start below it
i have “pretty boy” on my left forearm and “t4t” in a heart on my thigh :)
I have the molecule of estradiol on my chest
I don't have any yet, but I want to get a little trans flag :)
I put my crescent moon back on my wrist. I did it when I was 15 I think and it faded after about a year. It's the moon as a symbol of the divine feminine. It just seemed a fitting representation of my inner state (this was long before my egg cracked.)

Fast forward a decade and I got a tattoo kit. I finally put it back where it goes in the middle of my huge breakdown last February that led to me finally cracking. I'm working on putting the trans symbol underneath it and then when I'm done with that I'm putting a heavily personalized ankh on the back of my arm.

I decided a long time ago I'm only ever doing my own tattoos.
I have the date where I started HRT written in binary on my forearm
None. I dislike tattoos (for myself anyway). On the other hand, I'm probably going to pierce myself shut one day 🤷‍♀️
none about my identity and i don’t plan on any about that, mainly because i feel like it’s not something i want tattooed on me. i see tattoos as a physical manifesto on my skin of who i am inside. i’m not trans on the inside, i’m just a guy.
Ooh, you should tattoo He-Man as well! You know, 'cause he's **HE**-Man.
I really hope you’re a trans guy / transmasc or else that’s super unfortunate 😅
I got my first tattoo of a raven with a pentagram for myself when I crcacked.  Basically a big Fuck you to my false identity which was terrified of anything that would make me stick out.
maned wolf is the best fox thats not a fox
Sick
Sick. I wish I didnt have allergy to tattoo paint.
Impressive.
That's awesome
Wait that's rad as hell, how does it look? Asking cause I might want to steal it.

Are you talking about the mythical characters, or things named after said mythical characters?
forgot to add that i’m gonna opt out of nipples for top surgery, meaning i can tattoo on anything i want for nipples. spiders, smiley faces, flowers, ANYTHING i want >:)!
That's really cool of an idea!
as my tag says i am transmasc yes but the beauty of the ""HE"" tattoo is i can make it she, they, hey, the, etc.
Dang thats no good! Sorry friend :(
THANK YOU!  I love it so much
I don't know how to put the picture in a reply.  Dm you?
We are a mischievous bunch… appreciate the support :)
For now, I have the mythical characters (bust) the bottom is wrapped woth their represented flora. Apollon has laurel and Hykinthos has Hyacinths. Later I will add an background and various elements to each. Apollon will have the Sun and Hyakinthos will have the Moon,
Oh shit dude sorry! I missed that. But yeah that’s super cool
that is... fucking sick
:( Thanks
If you don't mind thank you!
You could get other cool things like piercings :))
My family would probably criticize me, they are more ok with tattoos + I would love to get piercings, but in a girl body, so probably in the future.

No meds does not mean no trans	"I'm getting tired of seeing invalidation or insults thrown at people in our community about medical transition. Its more infuriating seeing it come from people in the trans community. I (mtf) have been on hormones for some time, they work phenomenal for me. They are a massive double edged sword when it comes to new and intense feelings to process, but I've always been an emotional human so its been great to have that extra level of introspection. I also have trans friends, coworkers, and idols. Among them, some of the most distinguished and beautiful or handsome individuals do not take hormones, and two of the women I'm talking about make me envious and insecure from how beautiful and feminine they are.. without hormones..
Some people literally just cant take them for any number of reasons that dont need to be listed *because they dont freaking matter* and its nobody else's business. If you think you know someones identity better than them, youre wrong. I don't understand how this endemic of trans exclusion has spread through our own community but holy wow the hypocrisy. 

To the people guilty of this: Shame on you. Learn to **support your community.**

To everyone: You are valid in your identity, you are a beautiful person no matter what parts you were given, and no matter what you plan on doing with them. I love you ❤

End rant"	"absolutely true! I’m transmasc non binary and i’m not sure yet if i want to take hormones for the rest of my life or maybe just try them out for a while ( i think thats possible, not sure tho) but as you said, as long as the person is comfortable with their identity, we should refer to them correctly bc we’re all just kind souls trapped in a body that we more or less like or dislike (Your Body does NOT define your Identity!)
Couldn't agree more. 

I do also think that there is some confusion about what transitioning actually means, the different aspects and continual process that literally begins the moment we become aware or cognisant of being trans and is a life long journey that any kind of medical intervention is merely a possible facet of, and not at all necessary (to be trans/ for all), which gets all mixed the complex feelings and internalised transphobia many have, which comes out in ways that some people just don't understand how harmful they are being to others, while just trying to express how they feel.

It's messy and difficult, like so much of all of this is with how hard the world is for us. I'm absolutely not defending or make justifications for the people I describe above, and I am fervently against transmedicalist views to be clear. I just wish there was a simple way to convey to our siblings that their hurt and how society has twisted their perception can also hurt others, and that we all were more readily able to see that in these people and support it (though I absolutely understand that it is a lot and more than a lot of people can handle). I wish there was a simple answer.

Sorry for the long, rambling reply. I just wish we could all support and accept that each of our transness is unique to us and absolutely doesn't need to be measured or come with any expectations or gatekeeping, and everyone, especially our siblings doing this to themselves and others, could just see how unnecessary and harmful it is.

Love and solidarity ❤️🖤
Transmedicalism is so gross.
There are zero rules on how to express or not express being transgender.Thats the only choice.It is not a freaking contest or a race to win.Each journey is as unique as the individual taking it and there is no perverbial yardstick to measure it. Being comfortable in your own skin is the only metric that matters measure that against do no harm take no shit for balance.My feels🤷‍♀️
when i was just a young cis lesbian, i watched a lot of queer creators on youtube. calvin garrah was one of those. now that i’ve grown up me and my friends joke about our favourite transphobic trans person. him. he put out the ideas that every trans person needs to conform to their preferred genders stereotypes. non binary people were bad. if you didn’t ‘make an effort to pass’, meaning not conforming to masculine/feminine stereotypes, then you were a trans trender. he thought that if anyone experience wasn’t the same as his then they were faking. he thought you had to have dysphoria and want to medically transition to be really trans. i’m so glad i actually realised that his views are not just wrong but harmful to the community. so many people like me, and even cis people will be looking for information on trans topics and his videos will show up, enforcing his views even more. i hope all those people finally realise that you need nothing to be trans, other than the mere feeling that you aren’t the gender you were born as. trans guys can be feminin. trans women can be masculine. no kne needs to medically transition if they don’t want to. i’m glad there’s people like you spreading the word, although it does sadden me that people need to be enforced if this.
Yep.

Being trans is separate from medical transition. Medical transition is not available to all, and not desired by all - *and that’s okay*.

There is no requirement for being trans beyond the self-claimed identity. And the requirement for being a decent person is listening to people when they discuss their identity and treating them in accordance.
I would love to start T someday for myself, but right now i just cant afford it as im living paycheck to paycheck and still getting used to living as an adult on my own which isnt cheap at all lol. Just bc i cant afford T or top surgery like i want yet, doesnt make me any less trans and nonbinary. Every person's transition is different and theres no one way u HAVE to do it
I agree wholeheartedly. To each their own and one has no saying on the feelings of others. Your identity is yours and is valid if it makes sense to you and it identifies who you are.

But I have a lingering feeling that this post is related to a (now deleted) post earlier today which gave a wrong idea of this community. Let’s keep us together as we are stronger that way. Let’s keep the peace and love this place is known to be.
Or in my case yes meds no hormones because I'm terrified I won't get hormones because I have mental health issues
Truscum are scum, preach it!
Just remember, if you start testosterone, the changes do not reverse when you come off it. Whatever physical changes happen will be permanent. Not to discourage you. Just so you're informed.
Its such a small portion of trans people who behave like this, but they give cannon fodder to media outlets and internet bigots who represent a much larger demographic.
Thanks for your response. This was shared independently, but Im glad if it is relevant.

This post was not meant to target any r/ communities and was not meant to imply that there is regular toxicity in this or similar subs, or as commonplace in analog (irl) communities. Its just something Ive noticed a lot more from select individuals lately. Its simply meant as a message back to the very few people whos hurtful words are felt far and wide, and a letter of support to those who are affected by these people.  Nothing but love here <3 and Im sorry if I implied it had anything to do with the wonderful people of this subreddit.
oh yes thank you
Exactly, and it's so, so damaging to our entire community every time they do.

I think I'm hurt.....	"So I've been a lurker here for a while and I really feel safe here even though I don't interact, but something just happened that really made me feel the need to speak out.

So here's the backstory: I've been friends with a trans woman for a little over a year now and it was great, I finally found someone I could share my emotions with and actually talk about how I'm feeling when it comes to my identity.

But that changed really fast.

We went down this conversation where she began asking me if I wanted to fully transition, gender affirming surgery and all. Mind you I don't even think I'm trans, since I identity as non-binary anyway. But it started to get really dicey, and at a point I even felt like she was trying to manipulate me into fully transitioning? Is that even a thing?

But anyway, since I'm not one to have my mind changed by someone else easily, it came down to her asking me how I plan to go about my transition. And I said what took me years to find out about myself,  ""It took me years to find peace in myself and make this decision""

And BAM, she blocks me. And I don't know why, but that really hurt me to my core.

Sorry for the rant😅"	"Ouch. Tbh you probably dodged a bullet there. Seems she was looking for a transition buddy, not a friend.
>And BAM, she blocks me. And I don't know why, but that really hurt me to my core.


You were vulnerable with her,  she slams the door on your face and your most private thoughts.


I would be worried if you weren't hurt by this.


>I even felt like she was trying to manipulate me into fully transitioning? Is that even a thing?


I'm guessing it could be? But I'm wondering if it's more like projection or a misunderstanding about your authentic identity that she can't 'get'.  I'm getting truscum vibes from this...


You have the right to be your authentic self,  and you have the right to get there in the time period you feel is your pace. Your feelings are valid and you get to feel hurt when you're rejected like this.

But you still get to be you.  And ppl that truly care will validate that and honor your identity.


I think you probably dodged a bullet. If someone shows you who they are,  believe them..
1) I’m sorry that she blocked you after telling her your feelings. You don’t deserve that at all. You deserve someone who will listen with an open heart & mind when you’re talking about something as personal as your gender 
2) Nonbinary is under the trans umbrella ☂ Trans just means being anything other than what the doctor told you that you were at birth. Unless you were assigned nonbinary at birth
There are some people that have this idea that they always know what's best for people, and because this is a feeling they have, it can't be argued or logic'd with. In their minds, they probably thought they knew you better than you know yourself, suggested what worked for them (but might not work for you), and then when you kindly explained your own feelings and thoughts, they got offended, acted immaturely by blocking you instead of talking it out and/or keeping an open mind.

This person is toxic. You are 100% better off without them.
Almost sounds like the trash took itself out
This sounds like projection, as in she might have been projecting some insecurities concerning how she went about her own transition onto you? I'm sorry this happened hun :( based on what you shared you have every right to be hurt, but it sounds like her breaking off the friendship is a net good thing because it'll hopefully make room for someone else who's far less toxic than that.
just so you know non binary does count as trans
It's okay my friend, if you're comfortable the way you are then that's good, but if anybody tells you otherwise then just walk away from them
Yeah she had her own agenda and I dont think it was being friends. I wish you the best though. 🥺🙏
Sorry you got hurt.  Unfortunatly, thats just a risk of being open with people.  Its more a reflection on her than you.

If it helps, not all trans people have to ""fully"" transition.  I'd argue thats not even a thing.  I think there are some who disagree with this but.. I think they are wrong.

I'm pre everything amd part of the older crowd, but lack of transitioning doesnt invalidate my transness up to this point in my life.  Many of us don't transition for a variaty of reasons, but that doesent mean we are not trans.  Trans people existed even before there were medical options to help and they are/were just as valid as you or I.

Also not everyones transition looks the same.  Some only transition socially, some do hrt and don't get srs, and yes some of us are non binary, and dont fall fully under either umbrella.  Were all still trans and unique in our own way, and were all still valid.

Keep being you.  This random internet stranger belives in you.
Have a friend who's still my friend but has left a bad taste in my mouth with some of the ways she talked to her friends. We had a friend who was seemingly a cis male, but she refused to use he/him pronouns for them and insisted on using they/them and insisted they just hadn't realized it yet. About two months of this and they came out as nonbinary and my friend started pushing for them to get on estrogen. She also got pushy about her partner stopping his testosterone. I'll never mention how off that made her seem to me, but it did.
For the sake of saying it, you don't need to transition to be valid. You are valid exactly as you are happy being.
She probably has a warped view of what being trans is for a lot of people. Sounds like a transmed (someone who believes you have to have surgery to be 'truly trans') Likely due to transphobes telling her so. Sorry you lost a friendship, If you don't want to do a medical transition that's up to you- don't let anyone tell you otherwise even a friend!
Yea, I guess. 😹🤷‍♀️
Yeah I think so too, I've been saying it to myself that I don't need that kind of person in my life if that's their perspective. It's nice to know that I'm appreciated somewhere tho🥰
Transmed. Not truscum.
1) thanks for that, it really means a lot🥰
2) I didn't even know that, I just learned something😲
I totally agree with that, thanks🥰
This sounds like my dad, wow! Going off what worked for them and not me (my dad has trauma he has never dealt with which he dealt with by drinking alcohol to excess til his doc told him to stop)
Lmaoooo, this has to be the funniest comment I've gotten😹😹
Yeaaa, all these comments made me realize that and I honestly feel much better about the whole situation ^w^
Bingo!!
Yeaaaa I've just found that out :0
Thank uuuuu😌😌😌
Thats really sweet🥺 thank you for that❤
Woah, that's like the same exact same thing I went through but your situation seems to be a lot more serious. Hopefully she doesn't turn on you next 🥺
Thanks for that🥰 and I know
Thank you for that🥺❤
Having a circle of support is like gardening,  for those relationships to bloom they need tending and regular weeding. 


Just always try to evaluate what they give vs what your giving / getting.  Any negative imbalance may eventually become toxic. 


Best to show those ppl the door but fast. I'm truly sorry for your loss though.. I know it hurts just the same. Hugs
Good call.

I loathe when members of any already marginalized group refer to other members of the same marginalized group as “scum.” And the other side are just as bad.

It’s almost as though some people try to create a sense that they’re “the good ones,” utterly oblivious to the fact that if the people who hate us had their way, we’d *ALL* be off to the gas chamber together.
Perhaps that’s where the disconnect came from: she understood you to be trans because you’re Enby and you didn’t know that Enby is a trans identity.
I'm happy to have helped! I hope the next trans friend you make is someone who will be willing to listen to you and your thoughts. Best of luck to you, hun \~
I mean if she was a friend she wouldn't care what steps YOU take in YOUR transition she would just celebrate the victories and be there for you in the bad times.
Your very welcome. Keep your head up ok.
She hasn't, but I think that's because I am trans and fully intend to medically transition.
I hope all goes well for you!
Yeaaa it really did, but being here makes it better. I'll get through this :)
That, plus said ""truscum"" and transmeds have completely different ideals
Hmmmm, well then🤔
There's a possibility I didn't think of

Advice for my nephew	My 14 year old nephew came out as trans a few months ago, first to me, then to his mom & step dad. The problem is his parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and think he has been brainwashed or something. They refuse to accept him as Dylan, and still call him Isabel and make fun of his chosen identity. I used to be a witness but left the religion because it's very restrictive and children are forced to go along  and conform to their parents' beliefs. He is 14 and in the state of Maine cannot yet be emancipated and if I were to take him in, my sister could force him back home, legally. What do I do in the meantime to support him? I want to help but I feel helpless.	"Someone else pointed out LegalAdvice, and I do think that's a good plan. In the meantime, however, I think just him knowing that you support him will help. Keep talking to him, keep reminding him in whatever ways you think are best that you support him in his identity.
Okay this is bad advice, but my friend did this in a similar situation. 

The only way you can take him in is if his parents basically kick him out. If he formally leaves the religion and is shunned you could achieve this. 

He at 14 would have to be okay with being no contact with his parents. That is a big and difficult decision to make at any age but especially so young. It causes a lot of trauma and heart break, but it’s possible that would be less than living with his parents for the next four years. It isn’t ideal, his parents could still decide they want him back at anytime between now and when he turns 18 (or is old enough to be legally emancipated, which I believe also requires parent consent in some states). 

I wouldn’t jump to this idea first, but as a last resort it could at the very least get him a break. Before you agree to this you would need to be aware you would be agreeing to adopt a hurting child. That is not a small task. You sound like you absolutely care a lot and want to help however you can, but make sure you’re able to provide the care he needs before jumping in to agree to taking him in. If he leaves the rest of his family he’s gonna need a lot of support. 

Other than that, keep doing what you’re doing. Be supportive. Love him, and be there for him. He’ll appreciate you forever even if he can’t express it as much as he wants to.
There is no irony more pure than a JW calling someone brainwashed...
Brainstorm to get him out of there: Not sure what state you are in, but maybe you could devise a plan to take him in “for college purposes.” In this light, he would be better situated to go to state colleges than in Maine, by attending high school in your area. 

Sorry. Religion is a real yoke on the human spirit.
I would advice you to ask the same question on r/legaladvice, because it seems like a very tricky situation that and you would need as much general trans advices than information on what you can legally do to help that poor child
Give him support. Make sure he knows he is seen, heard, and valid. 

Taking him from his parents is an extreme measure in several directions. Doing so also usually requires abuse in the eye of the law rather than disrespecting gender identity. 

Really just be there as a support person. Check in regularly, keep an eye out for depression and any connected concerns (suicidal thoughts or tendencies especially). Someone that doesn't feel they can come to anyone, especially thier parents, are art higher risk.

Broken record, but be their ally, their support, whatever that looks like. Make yourself the fun uncle that their parents are cool with you taking him for outings, and use that time to let him express himself how he feels that most comfortable.
I guess here more to vent than get advice seeing as there is not much I can do :-(
talk to him let home know that you care and are trying to help. maybe try to get him so masc clothes or a binder if he doesn’t have them
I grew up in a jehovahs witness family. I dont think much can be done tbh. Maybe visit and take them out and be super gender affirming with them and be there as support when the family is being a bunch of ass hats. And when the day comes for emancipation (not sure about the laws there) you can help them through it and provide shelter and what not. I can understand what its like growing up in that environment. Just be there for them as much as you can.
Please contact [Pine Tree Legal Assistance](http://ptla.org). I am a law student who has classmates who will be interning there this summer and I can also reach out to people inside the legal community who may be able to help you if PTLA can't.
The best thing you can do aside legal action is to accept him, Text him every once and a while to check in on him or if you live close enough hangout with him often just to let him know he is loved and appreciated.
Make him feel supported then do legal trickery
I'm hoping so
buy clothes for him that could be interpreted as masculine or feminine maybe. also make sure he knows about binding safety!! 

and getting him a haircut could be a good idea but if his parents’ ideas of punishment are severe, maybe hold off on that until he has more freedom
I had a similar experience with my 16yo niece. She came out to me and my sister, then to her mother who is very religious. She told her that Jesus will punish her by letting her burn in hell. This may not sound like much help but constant communication and support is the best you can do for the time being. I keep constant communication to show her there is support in her family and people that accept her just as she is. The religion aspect for it is the tricky part. I did not tell my niece to stop believing in religion but also what her mom said is not true either. I approach it from an open minded viewpoint and express to her how there is more than 1 religion and to each their own on what they want to believe. It is a shitty situation to be in but support support and support are truly helpful especially when this young.
A big thing is to help him hold on to his sanity for the next four years. When you talk to him, call him by his correct name and pronouns. Help him find safe ways to express himself. If he's safe to do so, encourage him to come out to some supportive friends. 

Sounds like he's in for a rough few years at home. Keep him focused on the future.
i love how supportive you are :) one note though, telling people someones deadname even when you support them upsets the majority of trans people as youre spreading a really personal part of their past to others. if you were to refer to their deadname, just say, ""his deadname"" instead of the actual deadname
Report to cps
One affirming person can make a difference.  Keep accepting him as Dylan and create as much space for him to be himself as you can, even if it is only via phone calls or letters or emails.

That subreddit is full of people with no actual legal knowledge giving legal advice. It's like the relationship advice subreddit where any little issue means you should break up or divorce.
Love your user name btw

We're both in Maine. Actually not far from each other. But I'm not allowed to see him because I am not a Witness anymore. The religion shuns people who leave and are ""unrepentant sinners""
I'm an aunt, but I get the idea. I can't see him though because I left the religion and am shunned by my family that are Witnesses. And he wants to leave, but can't.
If you got out, maybe he can, too.💖💖💖
Thank you
and!! if his parents have a reliable routine (and don’t monitor his online presence too heavily) look for (lgbtq safe) therapists that offer online services
Thank you!! Sifu hotman was already taken or I would have nabbed that one
Right, sorry. Unfamiliar with the JW world.

dressing rooms are wack	"Hi, I’m a 17 y/o trans girl. I don’t really post at all because I’m pretty shy and the internet is hard for me, but I decided to write this out because I think that it will help me feel a bit better. 

I’m away from home at the moment, and I went clothes shopping with a new friend today who is super supportive of my gender identity. We went to a clothes store because we were joking about how I kept wearing the same few articles of clothing everyday. I got a few things I wanted to try and we walked over the women’s dressing rooms, but the employees told me I had to go upstairs to the men’s changing rooms. It was awkward because I didn’t really understand them at first, and my friend and I kinda just stood there for a minute before I said okay and we walked away. I put away one of the clothing items that was more feminine and kept a more androgynous dress shirt. My friend said that they didn’t know what to say to the person in the moment and I told them that I didn’t either. To fast forward, I ended up getting a t shirt that gave me a little bit of gender euphoria and we left to go grab dinner. 

This experience was still hanging over me, hence why I’m writing this. It really struck me how I don’t really pass as much as I thought. I have long felt I look quite androgynous (I have medium length hair, feminine glasses, and fairly androgynous clothing) but now I feel kinda uneasy about it all. Apologies for the long post, I simply felt I needed to give this a try and vent a bit. I know that this is far from last time the things other people around me will say or do will put me here emotionally, and it’s pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, but it still hurts."	"I’m sorry they did that to you. I think about this type of thing a lot when I’m dress or skirt shopping. Idk any solutions or tips other than a lot of thrift stores just have a couple unisex dressing rooms in the back so it doesn’t matter? I hope things change for all of us.
The Karen in me wants to call the manager at that store.
*hugs* people suck :)
I’m so sorry that happened to you! I’m a mom of a transitioning teen. I’m so sorry the world is set up for and to reinforce the binary and that your sense of how you may appear to other was rattled. Being shy is really hard when who you are often means you have to be an advocate for yourself in ways that can be so hard. Wondering if your supportive friend is less shy? If so, I wonder… what would it be like if they could call the store you want to shop at and ask to speak to a manager. Once the manager is on the phone they could say something like. Hello, thank you for taking time to talk with me. I’m a avid fan of your store and know you’re committed to excellent customer service. I have a friend who’d like to shop at your store but, before doing so, we’d like to know what your policy is on equal human rights for all shoppers and how your staff are trained, ensuring that every customer has equal human rights and freedom to shop specifically by being able to allow customers to  identify their own gender, use the fitting rooms that match the gender they identify and can shop freely without being denied access, experience harassment and having  a positive experience?  Then let the manage chat up their response and reflect back what you hear.. Im hearing you say…., did I get that right? Reflect back even if it’s positive what they are saying. Then, if it’s a store that says there’s training but you’ve had a bad experiences you could say…. Your approach Is so just and affirming of equal human right but, our experience shows that perhaps more specific follow up training is needed for your staff. Then you would explain what happened. If the manager says we follow corporate or don’t have training…. You could ask how you could help to bring forth the concerns about human rights violations at the company/store both to them and corporate and to help their store make changes? You could say, as you know the recent ruling regarding customer experiences around gender expression and human rights at Zara  is precedent setting. Do you know that case? If not, let me tell you about it. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1198151
There are some great ways you could foster equality at your store, amongst your staff and be inclusive for all patrons. Thanks for your time. 

In fact, as I’m writing this I’m going to do this for shops in my area because I can and it can be a way for me to be an ally. 

Here’s this as a nifty resource too:

https://www.transgendermap.com/social/clothing-accessories/retailers/?amp

As for your lingering feelings, I cannot imagine how hard it is to feel confidence in your gender expression and then feel knocked down. It may feel like a minor incident but how we are perceived and treated in public matters and impacts us deeply as human beings. To be misgendered hurts. I know I am working on being better about misgendering others and using gender affirming language every time I open my mouth knowing if I don’t I could cause harm. Often everyone is working to not offend but it’s geared towards the majority- not offending people who are straight, white, cis, etc. It’s engrained in us to uphold the white male Christian way, we can unravel it one word at a time, one action at a time and it be done NOT just by the people who deserve equal rights and who are marginalized but by the people who have privilege and power and access to stand up with less fear of harm. 

Thank YOU for your courage today sharing and I promise you I will talk to every manager of every store I can as I move through my day to day so that you can do so more safely and access the same human rights I have when I shop. And insert virtual hug here!
Even before I came out I have never used changing rooms because people always thought (knew) I was a man (I’m ftm) and now that I’m out people think I’m female for some reason so I just learned my sizes and hope for the best when buying stuff
I don’t take bullshit like that from people anymore now that (according to a lot of people) I pass. I would’ve talked some shit right there
Ça the fuck are those rooms even gendered at all? you're alone in there
That’s awful of them, keep your head up and don’t let their hate bring you down. You’re valid and should know we all have your back. If you ever need to vent, feel free to DM. Stay positive girl! :)
I went to victoria secret to try on bras and they didnt care treated me like any other cis women
That's so bad. What a weirdo staff at the store.
Here in Germany it doesn't matter by law which dressing areas or toilets you use, if you don't bother anyone (but a lot people don't know their rights here ...). In a lot of stores here you have unisex dressing cabines.

Don't let yourself be down. I bet, the rest of the trip with your friend was nice though, wasn't it?
Just keep doing what you do. There has always been and always will be people that suck. But that shouldn't bother you at all! ;)
This makes no sense to me as a European. We don't have gendered dressing rooms where I live. Why should that even exist? Everyone has their own stall, it's not like people are going to change their clothes in front of everyone else. If there are some stores that have a different floor for ""womens"" and ""mens"" clothing they might have different changing rooms but I don't think clothing store employees should be allowed to enforce rules on who is allowed to enter which changing rooms. Parents go in with their kids, people might not look like the picture they have in mind of how a specific gender should look, and even if someone isn't trans they might just want to try on some pieces of clothing that is labeled to be for another gender but they shouldn't have to go to a whole different floor to try it on... I'm sorry that happened, I don't know if it would actually help, but you could try to contact the company about that. It's 2022 and just allowing everyone to use the changing room they want to use shouldn't take that much effort from them!
That's terrible, I would've died😅😭

My first time clothes shopping was in a similar situation, I was in a whole other state by myself for a month, and made a trans friend who insisted on taking me shopping.

Ended up going to JC Penney I think, and there was one supportive employee that helped us into the changing room. 

It was just... All the customers were being weird, circling around over and over again aimlessly, staring and being nosy, it was so uncomfortable 😭
In my experience thrift stores are the best, I've never had a problem in a thrift store but retailers are different for some reason. I guess I'd chalk it up to class, thrift stores are working class friendly, retailers aren't so much.
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I too am a very shy trans woman and would probably be too afraid to even go clothes shopping
>Apologies for the long post, I simply felt I needed to give this a try and vent a bit. I know that this is far from last time the things other people around me will say or do will put me here emotionally, and it’s pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, but it still hurts.

If it hurts enough to warrant venting, clearly it's not as minor as you might want to think. Undermining these things is a valid defense mechanism, but it can also be a dangerous trap. Bottling up emotions does not seem, I think, to be a healthy long-term coping strategy. You were treated in a hurtful way, lacking simple compassion and denying you basic dignity. It's okay to feel hurt by this, and even if it could make some transphobes think you're frail or weak... Fuck 'em. They don't know what it's like. The devil is in the details, and the subtle things tend to be quite significant, even if they don't feel like they should be. Don't beat yourself up over the fact that it got under your skin. It sucks, but as an armchair therapist on reddit that knows nothing about anything (but can make some good guesses based on personal experience), I can say that it's probably good to allow yourself to process these things and you don't need to justify it or apologize to anyone.
It’s dumb that the dressing rooms are gendered anyways, there’s only one person in each one at a time.
Oh my gosh!! So many people have seen this and left really kind, helpful, and supportive comments!! When I am able to, I want to respond to every one of them, though it may take a little bit because I’m in a college summer program rn. Thank you all so so much; waking up to read all your comments has made me smile and feel supported and loved. I definitely think it’s worth calling the manager of the store, and I’m going to ask my friend if they can help me do that later today!! Again, it’s hard to express how much I appreciate you all 😊
You paid them money for a shirt. From the business’ perspective that is a positive signal saying that you endorse their behavior. 

You post here while hiding the name of the store you want to, which in actual fact is defending the reputation of the company and preventing other people from being able to avoid the store in the future. 

You feel upset. But your actions help make sure this will happen again. Why do you carry water for the system? Name and shame the store, and don’t give them your economic endorsement in the future!
I really appreciate the commiseration, makes me feel not so alone. That’s actually a good tip in itself, I didn’t know that about thrift stores. I’m new to the whole clothes shopping game :))  

I hope so too, it’s all pretty crappy at the moment ://
haha me too!! I like to think that in an alternate universe when the employee told me that it was a women’s changing room I would have said “perfect, I’m in the right spot!” Would have been a power move tbh
thank you!! yeah, they really do sometimes
Wow! You go, momma bear! Thanks for being so awesome. 💋
Wow!! Thank you so much for the support and for being so thoughtful in how I could speak up about my experience in their store! I also really appreciate the trans resources you linked, those are very helpful!! :))
Target did away with gendered dressing rooms. You might want to try shopping there.

If this ever happens to you again, please, look them straight in the eye and explain to them calmly but with conviction that you are trying on ladies clothes and you prefer to use the ladies dressing room. If they refuse, hand them all of the things you were going to try on and tell them that you won’t be purchasing ANYTHING that you don’t try on.  Then walk away. There are plenty of stores with sales associates that are trained to respect their customers. 

Brick and mortar stores are closing all over the place because of the online competition. These stores CANNOT afford to turn away customers. Tell all of your friends and family to stay away from this store. Post it on your socials. Write online reviews. Hit them where it hurts. Take your business to supportive merchants.
I guess it depends on the country and store.
If you're out id say to put your foot down on the matter.

Of course it might be different in your country. In my country - Canada - I have never been turned away from a changeroom. Shop dressing rooms, I mean. I personally have no intention of ever going into a pool/gym changeroom
Aww thank you for being so awesome!! I wish my teen thought I was awesome too lol! I’m their enemy right now as it usually goes during these teen years and times when hard stuff is happening.

I just finished The Gender Dysphoria Bible and holy crap it's like someone read my theoretical diary and wrote an essay on it.	"I was questioning back in my early teens (now early 20s) about my gender identity. Raised super Christian so I smothered it with every bone in my body. now I'm free from that and those same emotions are returning and over the past few days they have been ripping me apart. 

I found a link to The GDB here on reddit earlier today and I've never felt so validated before in my life, in any subject matter. 

I feel excited, nervous, relieved, supported. All the things. coursing through my blood right now its crazy. (who knew it wasn't ""normal"" to go to bed every night wishing you'd wake up another gender) 

Anyway. thanks for coming to my Ted talk. I'm calling various health insurance providers tomorrow to find out which Gender Therapists near me are in network and if they cover HRT/Counseling and if it's not uber expensive, surgery. Later on of course.

<3"	"It really is an incredible resource, isn’t it?
ikr The GDB is so fuckin useful its actually what helped me tell myself im trans and happy for ya OP congrats my guy/girl <3
Yeah I read that at 3 am like 3 weeks ago... bought myself some midnight McDonald’s as a coming out to myself present because I had no where else on my brains to hide 🥲
[deleted]
It really should be pinned.
Yeah, the gdb is eye opening.
I need to finish reading that,
Thank you so much for sharing this! How have I never seen this before?
Thanks for mentioning this. I didn’t know about this and have just read it. Great information.
Omg it so is. I'm so glad I found it!
I think I can confidently (at least to myself for the first time ever) respond girl to that question! self discovery is a wonderful drug
I think I might do that lolol it's a very relieving feeling finding out who you are

Here you go
I highly recommend it x3
i feel the same lolol I'd have figured this out a hot minute ago if I'd seen it lolol, all in good time I suppose
its so helpfulll
i think im gonna cry lol once again congrats on discovering who you truly are :)

"""We found an account with similar information to yours"""	"I'm trying to turn on electricity for a new place I'm going to be moving into on the 3rd but SCE wont let me use anything but my dead name. I put in my new information and it just auto completes it to my dead name despite both having updated the name on my account and trying to create a new one. I am so frustrated right now this is ridiculous. So many websites don't support changing your name or glitch out when you do. It's so disheartening. I got my name legally changed almost 2 years ago I shouldn't sill have to deal with stuff like this. I want to be able to just forget about my dead name so bad but I can't because bullshit like this keeps happening.

Edit: finally got someone on the phone who knew how to do their job. I had to send over a picture of my ID to verify my identity but as long as there's no issues with that I should be good."	"Have you called them?  Normally utilities and whatnot would want to use your legal name and name changes don’t just happen with trans people.
I remember a few sites were a little odd with changing my details after sorting out my deed poll (UK). Paypal comes to mind but I think there were two others.

Basically when I made the accounts I didn't have to provide any documents or ID, I just entered my details and that was that. When I went to change my name, gender and title all of a sudden they wanted copies of my passport, driving license and my updated birth cert.

Funny thing is in the UK, for most purposes, this is all self declared. I don't even need a deed poll to change my name, a deed poll is just a formal declaration of my name change. You can write one yourself and as long as you have 2 witnesses it's 100% valid.

So in the end I just closed the accounts and made new ones with my correct details. My position is that if they didn't need any documents to open the account then they don't need any to update their records.

I don't know if this is something you can do but it's how I got around the red tape.
You definitely have to update every little thing once you change name and gender. Even your phone number will appear with your deadname if you don’t call the company and change it
I don't know where you are at, but is there a local office you can go to and speak with someone?  I had to do that with PSEG.  Just a suggestion.  Hopefully everything works out for you.
Do what you need to get the account set up and get the power on. Then worry about getting it corrected after the fact.
Aw we look esports lounge excuse me pl
I deal with this pretty regularly.  I have had to switch jobs, doctors and other things.  I have no advice.  Just wanted you to know that you are not alone in your frustration.
Currently on hold. They keep telling me to use the website that doesn't work and hanging up.
Hell if you get married and change your last name you have to do all this.  I know my pa had constant problem with his middle name becuase it got messed up I believe when he was born.  That was over 70 years ago and IT STILL gets messed up from time to time.  I blame a lack of universal ID meaning no one can just pull from it and auto update information.
That was my thought too but it fails. I think it's because my dead name isn't associated with my social security number.
Weird, yeah keep trying by any means you can (e-mail/phone), hopefully it’s just incompetence.  I’ve been auto-disconnected a lot of times by call centres.
There should definitely be a easy way to update things!
Then try a new email address. And your new legal name.
I did. It's finding my old account through the SSN.
OMG wouldn't it be easier to just go buy a couple dozen solar panels, some lithium ion batteries, a charge controller, a DC/AC inverter and some wire, &tc.  install it all, and never deal with those evil bastards again? Because it feels like it would be.
Is there a way to log into the old account and delete it?
Honestly, if I wasn't renting....
I ""deactivated"" the online ID but I don't think that actually removes the account just the website login.
Correct. You may need to activate it, to either edit the name or delete it."	x1u1vk	trans	127	0.97	2022-08-30 20:48:11
straight up fuck the NHS	"okay yeah they are trying they’re best with limited funding and all that but i don’t wanna have to deal with their weird rules and shit.

i’m going on holiday soon and i need a “covid pass” to get onboard the flight but i need to verify my identity to get a covid pass which requires me to take a recording of my face and they compare it to my passport. ah yes, exactly why i wanted right now, to look at my face after trying my best not to look in reflective surfaces too much for the last few months.

oh yeah i also have to type out my full birth name like 250000 times and it makes me feel like complete shit, i’m just waiting for them to ask me for a fucking dna test to prove i’m AMAB or a written letter from my parents to verify that they gave me a name i hate.

anyway, hope you’re all doing well out there!"	"Fr, I'm currently fighting my gp over every last detail cus apparently their practice can't provide blood tests but the same Dr can do them privately in the same clinic
Sadly it isn't the NHS's fault, fascist Tories have done this to our healthcare. They have done this to every British person however through increasing waiting times to push people going private. 
The Tories designed the system to fail so their business buddies will get money and them too.

Edit: as for the rules and regulations, this is the medical community, their gatekeeping, years of TERF's ""activism"" and much more.
Oh so that's why they didnt accept my application.
Fuck that.
Assuming were both referring to the national honor society.
I just bit the bullet with this one and put it under my old details. It’s still valid even if you transition, so long as you know your old name, address, yadda yadda. It sucks but at least it means I don’t have to worry about for a while
I was going to ask how this isn't a violation of the Gender Recognition Act but I guess you need the Gender Recognition Certificate for that to apply?

Left UK 20 years ago but got Gender Recognition Certificate last year. Didn't really need it, but got it anyway just in case
Sorry to hear that, don't forget to vote.
yeah their treatment of trans people is honestly a joke, i hope everything gets better from here for you :)
That’s such blatant corruption
yeah i know, it’s just annoying
Ah yes, the national honour society, that oh so famous NHS haha
I've had my first taste of hope, I was recently able to get referred to the East of England pilot scheme
Vote labour in the next general election. Push your friends and family too. Yes, labour is the lesser of two evils but it is our only chance right now until greens can gain more traction.

I want out dressed in full fem for the first time	So recently ive been going through a bit of a gender identity crisis and a while back I got myself some fem clothes to try out (im 20 amab and still live with family btw), mostly I wear them around the house when no one else is home but tonight I couldnt sleep and wanted to go on a walk so I thought about it and decided I wanted to try to go out fem presenting so took a big step and put on a full fem outfit, put up my hair, put on a mask, and left. The most nerve-racking part was getting in and out of the house and I was nervous for the first 10 minutes or so and when the occasional cars would drive by but other than that I was surprisingly really comfortable, I even walked past a couple of other people and a couple times almost forgot that I was fem presenting. I walked for about an hour before coming home and it felt really nice being comfortable with myself in public, maybe ill go for longer next time. I still dont know exactly where I land on the gender spectrum yet and I definitely dont think im ready to go out during the day yet but this was a big step for me and im proud of myself	"YO IM SO PROUD OF YOU!!
Congrats!! Hope you're a step closer to figuring stuff out!

I remember the first time I went for a walk full femme I couldn't get over how...not self conscious I was...like I was worried I'd get clocked cos I'm not in the best area but I wasn't self conscious. Still a lot of denial floating about but nice to see other people feeling similarly!
I'm so so proud of you! <3 i too went full fem in public recently. it was the happiest i felt in a very long time.
Proud of you 😉
It's a huge step"	s23iv3	trans	125	0.98	2022-01-12 10:50:54
I finally came out to my wife	"Long story short, I (MTF) have been seeing a number of medical personnel specifically trained to treat patients with gender identity issues through the transgender department of our health provider. 

I have an appointment in 2 weeks where I discuss HRT, and since it will be a video call, I need to take this from home, where we both work (me part time, her full time). My conscious got the best of me and I broke down (its been happening a lot recently) and wanted to tell her of what was coming and how I didn’t want to hide this anymore. 

She (cis hetero) had the day off, and kids were at school. As usual she was playing games, and I told her I needed to speak with her about something important. I don’t do this very often, so she hit pause, and we talked. 

I said that I am seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist, about some serious mental issues that I have been having, and I was going through further treatment that required a lot of testing, evaluations and appointments. 

She listened. 

I told her I was really emotional over these last few weeks and months and I needed professional help. 

She said – you are more emotional than most. (lol – shes not wrong). 

I replied, this is different, I cant stop these thoughts anymore. We still haven’t talked about specifics yet. 

I told her this was the same issue I had last sought counseling for, gender identity, which was several years ago. 

She didn’t say anything. 

I said the Drs can treat this 2 ways, either repress the thoughts or treat this through hormones that allow the brain to function at a normal level without the gender confusion. 

She simply said – I have seen the changes in you over the last few weeks and months. You have become kinder, more patience, and a better person. Whatever is going to continue bringing out that person in you, I will support you. 

I explained this treatment including adding estrogen to my body. 

She didn’t say anything. 

I said, this is the transgender department I am working with.

She repeated what she said earlier, I like the new you, and if the new you means this continuing this treatment, then I am all for it. 

She stood up and we hugged. Then she said I love you. 

Maybe this true story is for you, or maybe this doesn’t apply to you, but if I can reach one person who will keep hope that your transition can have a happy start – then I hope I have made a difference."	"This reminds me a lot how I came out. The only difference being I haven’t talked to any professional about it yet.
I’ve noticed that people in general, especially family is much more accepting then I would ever have thought.

I’m closer to my partner then ever before, same goes with my parents. They’re super supportive even though I never thought they’d be!
I like it very much
You've 100% reached that at least one person. I am so proud of you btw <3
Keep going and keep talking at every step you can. It's wonderful that you've had this positive and wonderful response. But don't forget your partner is now going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions in their head.  As much as you need their support, she will also need some.
Wishing you both lots of happiness
You gave me happy tears! I gotta go to work with this sobby face now!
I'm not crying, it's dusty in here......
fantastic, congratz. 

looks like you found a good one. My story is very similar. My family has been totally supportive.
I was impressed at ""she hit the pause button"".  Super happy for you. 💕
Good luck
congrats - we need more stories of hope to give hope to those that need it. Best wishes for you!
awww - thanks for letting me know this post made a difference! But, I am one of many here that wish you the best and only the best on your own personal journey. Good Luck Girl!
Playgrounds are for everyone... ?

At least that's me.
I hear you - I want to have her space, and I will continue being the best partner I can be. We just talked all day, about little things, just sharing. I wont give that up, its bringing us closer, and thats all I really want, that I am changing, for the better. I can focus better on the medical issues now, knowing that I dont have worry about hiding or if she supports me. A friend of mine gave me some good advice, dont overwhelm her with your thoughts and ideas about the new you, just be a partner for now. I like that advice, and will use it wisely.
some bastard keeps cutting onions in the room...
its funny - part of me thinks she knew this was coming, and was waiting for me the whole time...
Probably so.   And it sounds like she is genuinely happy with the changes in your personality.   My wife is the same and it makes it easier for me to relax and go deeper into my experience."	pny5cy	trans	126	1.0	2021-09-14 07:33:11
Are all non binary people trans?	"This isn't meant to disrespect or invalidate non binary people or their identities in ANY way, just something I had been wondering about. as a binary trans person it's not something I'm really knowledgeable about.

I'm aware there are nb people who transition in some way (physically or socially ex. name or pronouns) but there are also people who identify as nb that keep their name or don't care if they are referred to with gendered pronouns. again, not saying there's anything wrong with that or that either is less valid, but I just wonder if the second group would be considered trans, or if they would even consider themselves trans.

for them is the non binary label referring to actually being something other than male or female or does it refer to them not conforming to the gender binary?

for clarification I'm *not* referring to people who want transition but are unable to because of their environment.

edit: yes I see the irony in having binary yes and no options but I'm asking for peoples opinions/ personal experience. I already know that there are trans nb people, I'm asking if you believe that *all* nb people are trans

By definition, non-binary is under the trans umbrella however not all non-binary people identify as trans.

I'm noticing a common misconception. Transgender does not mean transitioning. Its an adjective to describe people who's gender differs from their assigned gender at birth (AGAB).
Yeah it depends. Some of the people you’re describing consider themselves trans, some don’t. The way I think of it is that non-binary overlaps with being trans but isn’t necessarily coextensive with it, if that makes sense.
In the purest sense that they are not cis? Yes absolutely.

In the sense that they have to use or feel comfortable having or using the label to describe themselves? Absolutely up to the individual.
It depends on what context.

As a categorization i.e. scientific or academic: Yes, complicated by the possibility of a society existing that does not assign gender at birth; trans as we understand it now means living as a gender identity that's different to what you were assigned at birth.

As an identity, it's up to the individual to decide whether they want to self-identify as trans and consider themselves a part of the trans community.
Non binary comes under the trans umbrella but not all nonbinary people consider themselves or feel trans. Which is valid and how they feel about themselves/their gender.

I'm nonbinary and trans.
i am genderqueer (and non-binary i am okay with both terms) and i love my transness as it is. i don't know why other enbies would refrain from calling themselves trans /gen
i mean okay so. *technically* yes because if you are not the gender you're assigned at birth you're technically transgender , but it's in the end up to the individual on if they identify with trans or not -
It can be argued that intersex non-binary people are cisgender, but since trans tends to be with regards to assigned gender at birth, and hospitals are generally not great and assign everybody either male or female at birth, all non-binary people are trans, to my knowledge.
The irony of giving a binary option to answer a question about the identity of non-binary people 😂
As I’m not non-binary, I think this is an answer for individual non-binary people to give for themselves.
By definition yes because trans is just identifying as something other than your agab but not all enby people are comfortable being called trans for whatever reason.

So in conclusion kinda yes but also kinda no.
i personally identify as not cis, i'm just not comfortable enough with like saying i'm trans. but if we're being technical being trans means not identifying with ur agab so apart from intersex people, yeah we're all trans.
Idk about nb people as a whole but personally i call myself trans even though I'm nb, it's just that i feel more fem than anything else and I'm amab.
Yes, if they choose to label themselves as that.
I had nothing to add as everyone else already clarified that, sticking to the definition of transgender being anyone who doesn't identify/live by their assigned gender at birth, then yeah, Enby people may be considered part of the trans umbrella, but I consider it each individual's choice what to identify, and which label to use.

This is something that (almost) every commenter before me has said but I still wanted to participate because I find funny af that we can't decide on a binary answer but we do sorta agree in a ""non-binary"" answer hahaha
Ive seen nonbinary people who dont think of themselves as trans, not for any self hating reason, just personal preference on their part
The way it has been explained to me by my NB friends is that they are trans because no one is assigned non-binary at birth.
Ehhh. I’d say it depends, and I’d just play it by ear (like, asking them). Things vary a lot, and that can include how they feel.
My thoughts are that all enbys are to be given the trans umbrella. If they want to open it to fit underneath it, good. If they don't, also good.

Basically, I am to treat them as belonging as a trans person and if they tell me they don't, I do the work to see them how they want.
if their non-binary gender is different than their AGAB, then yes, technically, they are under the trans umbrella- however not every enby uses trans as a label, for various reasons, and that's fine. personally I consider myself trans and enby, but I usually just say enby, because trans kinda feels redundant to mention as well. so it really only comes up for stuff like this XD
well yes, technically. By definition they are all trans because they don’t identify with their agab, but not all nonbinary people label themselves as trans.
I personally believe that as long as someone doesn't identify with their birth gender, regardless of how much, they fall under the trans umbrella
I don't think this is truly a yes or no question. For me, yes. I believe every nonbinary person belongs under the trans umbrella. Regardless of if they transition or not. However, I acknowledge that there are some nonbinary people out there who feel the trans label isn't for them, and choose not to use it. That's a real and valid experience that I don't want to erase. But on the whole, nonbinary people are trans unless they feel/decide otherwise as an individual.
I vote no because i dont wanna force non binary people into a label. It is under the trans umbrella but some people dont wish to identify that way
My logic is like a train track. If you're not cisgender, you're switching away the track of cis gender and transitioning to another track (gender). That's just me though and how I think. Everyone is valid. At the end, only non cis people can decide if they identify as trans or not.
Technically no, because you could theorically raise a child in as nb and let them choose afterward (wich could make every man/woman raised like that trans funnily enough*), so if they chose to stay nb they could be cis nb.

Effectively yes, because raising a child in a nb way is very rare today. And since almost every non binary person where raised binary, I guess it would make them trans.


*I gotta say: the distinction cis/trans would become obsolete in that scenario, I'd like to see a society that let children chose themselves their gender.
This is giving me the same vibes as “If you’re bi/pan then are you gay?”
All non-binary people are under the trans umbrella, however not all choose to identify as trans (I didn't until I had my epiphany)
All nonbinary people can claim the trans label, not all nonbinary people do.
Yes, because it’s not assigned at birth, HOWEVER not all nonbinary people identify with the label, and that should be respected
Are all non-binary people transgender by definition: yes
Do all non-binary people have to use the label of transgender to still be valid: no
‘Trans’ does NOT mean ‘transition’. It means ‘transgender’. And that means identifying as something other than your AGAB. There are binary trans people who don’t transition for any number of reasons. That doesn’t make them not trans. Trans is a condition of being, not something you do. 

Unless you were born into one of the few extant societies that use a non-binary gendering system, if you are non-binary then your are *by definition* trans, especially for purposes of discussion and solidarity for political and social activism. 

That said, many non-binary choose not to use the term to describe themselves, for various reasons. Others do. It’s neither right nor wrong. It’s their choice. No one else gets to gatekeep.
Personally, I'd say most; unless anyone was assigned a gender other than male/female at birth, then by being nb they are not their AGAB, which is the definition of trans.
I see it as ""Yes, but actually no"" since they don't need to take the label if they choose not to.
If a non binary person says they don't identify as trans, then they aren't trans. That's kinda exactly how this is supposed to work. So asking for others ""opinions"" kinda misses the point.
Another person's opinion on whether a non binary person is trans or not isn't relevant. Otherwise we'd have to start accepting the opinions of transphobes.

It might seem like an extreme example. But if someone says they aren't something and you try to explain to them why they're wrong about their own identity...

Well I think I've made the point I was trying to make.
I'd say so. By detention trans people identify as a gender that is not their agab. Assuming most people were assigned either male or female, then non-binary, meaning outside of the male/female binary, would by default put them as a gender differing from their agab.
Trans means not identifying as your agab. Non-binary people weren’t assigned non-binary at birth, therefore yes they are all trans.
It’s both yes and no…. Yes in the fact that non-binary is under the trans umbrella, no in the fact that not all non-binary people use the trans label.
You’re going to get subjective answers because there’s not a one-size-fits-all answer. For me, I identify as non-binary and transmasc. I’m on an average dose of T. I get gender euphoria with every masculinizing change on T. I present androgynous to masc depending on the day. I crave as much bottom growth as my body will allow. I feel more comfortable with “he” pronouns than “they.” But I also don’t live 100% feeling like I’m male. There’s an “other” in me - an in-between. It takes a lot of courage and commitment to being authentic for me to not just call myself a trans male and try and pass exclusively as one. But my truth is, that doesn’t feel right for me. 

You’re asking important questions but you’re still asking for a binary answer. :)
it depends on what they would want to be labeled as :)
as someone who is non-binary and on hrt i do consider myself trans. anyone no matter how they look can be non binary  it’s all love at the end of the day!🖤
I have a friend whos nb but he doesn’t identify as trans
Fuck I miss clicked I’m sorry y’all. Meant to click yes
Idk how to feel on as a trans non-binary peroan I get the worst of both worlds
Nonbinary people are only trans if they identify as trans, we shouldn’t force our labels on them.
If you identify as any gender different than what you where assigned at birth you are transgender
The way I see it is if your not cis your trans but some people just don’t want to use that label. So yea
Nonbinary is under the trans umbrella, so yea technically all nb are trans, but you don't have to identify with it. Whatever makes people comfy 💖
they do fall under the trans umbrella so under technical terms yes

Does that mean all non binary folk are going to and have to identity with a trans label, no
As an agender the term transgender (""to another gender"") doesn't feel quiet right, but if it is just used to state I don't like my assigned gender at birth than it is alright 👌
The Non-Binary term falls under the Trans umbrella. What each non binary person identifies as, I cannot possibly say
technically yes. trans means that your gender does not match the gender you were assigned at birth, so yes, every non-binary person is trans(except maybe intersex people? I am not informed enough on that tho). however, there are a lot of non-binary people who do not use that term. so it depends on the context you wanna use it in.
I think to be non binary, you *have* to be trans, but it's just a label anyway. Anyone who isn't cis is trans.
It is possibly for an intersex person to identify as non-binary, thus you can be a cisgender non-binary person :)
[deleted]
No not all. People who are outside the binary sex’s and also have non binary gender are actually cis because they identify as their birth gender (sorry if I’m not using the right wording here)
not all enby people identify as trans, so no
Honestly I would say yes. People who say they are nb but not trans are just confusing nb and gnc most of the time
Asides from certain intersex nonbinary people (and fictional enby characters), yes.
Trans means to transition. We are choosing a gender to move toward, and rejecting the one assigned to us. Nonbinary doesn't really reject or accept anything. It's just a bit of light crossdressing. Trans people have to take hormones and get surgeries. Not at all the same thing.
If u dont transition if u dont change literally any aspect of ur life then u cant be trans cuz u literally transitioned nothing u would be a literal trans trender saying ur trans when ur not
Non binary is gender nonconforming. Not TRANSgender.

Edit: But we should still accept them into the trans community with open arms because they experience dysphoria too.
[removed]
I 100% disagree with enbys being in the trans umbrella.
Gender nonconforming yes both are defined by this definition.

I see enbys more as a refusal to adhere to the genders that exist in society. There is no transition, it is literally a removal from gender. Existing in a nothing state. The ones that fall under gender fluid are like, I feel male today and female another. This isn’t anywhere close to the same experience. I see it more as cherry picking the pros and refusing to deal with the cons of any given gender. 

Now those that actually transition ie trans. The umbrella is mtf and ftm. 

But feeling male some days or female another isn’t trans.

Edit.

If y’all gunna downvote my opinion which is based off what I have seen from the vast majority of enbys and those that use they/them pronouns. At least counter it. Tell me why I am wrong because the way I see it my experience is way fucking different.

Not to mention y’all literally make it more difficult for those that actually do transition. You literally help the argument of the right. Because they literally use you to justify why I am a “man”.

With that being said enbys aren’t trans.

Now the ones that are mtfnb or ftmtnb maybe y’all trans? But my point of going into a nothing state still stands, because society is masc or fem there is almost no whatever. Until that changes enby literally is an outsider. Existing outside of society while still being there.


Now those of us that stay in the mtf and ftm. And medically and socially transition. We are still within society because we are simply changing teams so to speak. This is 100% fundamentally different.
I think or mabye not.
as an nb person I do think all nb people are trans, but people are allowed to not want that label and I fully respect that. 

To me, it would seem that the definition of trans is being a gender different than what you were assigned, and since no one (at least in the traditional western ideas of gender/sex) is assigned nb at birth, that would make all nb people trans. 

Fully up for debate tho!
how can i vote for both
Personally i think yes. They dont identify with their birth sex, a lot tend to get somesort of surgery, or at least hormone therapy.


And if their not up for that, some will do things to alter their appearance to look more androgynous.
Either way they go through some sort of medical transition (surgery or hormones) or social transition (pro-nouns or personal style).


But of course its more up to the actual person to decide these things, and not really anyone else. If their non-binary, great! If their a non-binary trans-person Also great!
The definition of trans is identifying with a gender that differs from your assigned sex at birth so by definition yes non binary people are trans. 

The nuance that's missing in that statement however is that not all non binary people identity with the trans label. Which is fine. Some identify with the term cis based on their experiences which is also fine. 

Technically non binary does equate to being trans. Individuals don't have to use a word because it ""technically"" applies to them is all.
I usually imagine the distinction being that transgender ppl are binary trans and just “trans” refers to ppl who are seeking some form of transition whether that be medical, social or what not. 

I think when you get to this level of queerness though labels stop mattering so much, a lot of trans ppl I know just say gender queer and a lot say enby trans and some say enby but they don’t feel comfortable saying trans. It’s all valid just go with what you feel.
no! not all nonbinary people consider themselves trans, i do personally hc i'm nonbinary transmasc. but there's many who don't.
Not all of them. I might be non-binary or genderfluid, but I am not trans. I am just here supporting everyone here. I might yeet my boobs some day because it gives me body dysmorphia.
I consider myself non binary. I do not consider myself trans. That’s all.
My GF is non-binary and does not consider themselves trans. So, no.
That's what the white stripe is for, as long as they don't fully identify with their birth gender then they are trans.
No. Being trans and NB are different. I know both trans and cis NB people.
I had some trouble with this and upon pondering I voted no, my reasoning is someone can identify as how ever they please. That is what being a part of the LGBTQ+ community is all about right? Being yourself and authentically you. If someone identifies as non-binary but says they are not trans why should we deny them what they label themselves as?
They're definitely not cis, so I vote yes.
I voted 'no' because it's up to the non-binary person themselves whether they identify as trans or not.
Trans means that your gender identity doesn't match the gender you were assigned at birth. Since people aren't typically assigned NB at birth, it stands to reason that all NBs are trans. 

I consider myself trans, even though I'm a masc presenting AMAB, who isn't bothered by he/him pronouns. Even if most people see me as a man, it doesn't make me one. Just like if a binary trans person doesn't pass, it doesn't mean that they aren't their gender. 

Some NB people don't feel comfortable calling themselves trans, and that's perfectly valid. But any NB can call themself trans if it's something that they feel applies to them.
to me, trans is identifying as something other than what you were born as. however i do get that some might not identify as trans.
there can be cis intersex enbies.
Didn't vote because I think some are and some aren't.

I identity as non-binary. Actually when I reconnected with a friend and former colleague of mine after years of no contact and after they'd (1) realized they are trans and (2) are now a gender therapist at queer-specific clinic and I'd mentioned I was struggling with gender and we talked about it and he was like ""welllll ... identify however you want and that's valid and it's not for me to say but fwiw, just so you know, you meet diagnostic criteria and I'd write you a WPATH letter right now"" lmfao

But I, personally, don't identity as trans. I don't have body dysphoria and it really is meaningfully different for people who do. On that one point I do admit to being very sympathetic to transmeds, tbqh. Those of you who need to actually _transition_ go through so much more. I'm low key tearing up right now honestly at the thought of how hard it is in this garbage world to just be true to yourself. ❤️ you all so much. 

so yeah that's where I'm at

Edit: my friend works at Mazzoni Center in Philly. I'd recommend it if you're in the area. No gatekeeping. You can DM me for his name if you want (though I'll double check with him). Pretty sure he'd support informed consent but the world we live in means navigating this bullshit world and meeting diagnostic criteria.
I think It depends on what the person is comfortable with and what they want to label themself so no, not all
I mean, I put no simply for the fact that there are nb people who don't identify as trans. Who am I, someone who is not and will never know what it is to be nb, to tell them what they are?
Simple. I support self-identification as it is the best heuristic from a therapeutic standpoint. Some enbies don’t identify as trans so I answered no.
I think they can decide, like the definition of trans includes non-binary people, but like if they don’t want to be under the label then they don’t have to
I think this is a perfect explanation. I'd add on, it should be noted some people just have an alternative gender expression without a different gender identity. If you're a girl who likes masculine clothes,names and even pronouns, but you still identify as female, that doesn't make you trans at all. It's your gender identity (the part of you that says are you at your core a guy, gal, or something else) that determines if you are trans or NB. Not just how you present.
I mean, no one (at least in modern western society) is assigned non-binary at birth, sadly :/
I think the misconception comes from, at least within the English language, the “trans” prefix in “transgender” and the “trans” prefix in “transition” don’t have the same definition, but lots of folks seem to believe they do.

The “trans” in “transition” means “so as to change”.

The “trans” in “transgender” means “on the other side of”. Why? Because the word “transgender” is meant to linguistically be the opposite of the word “cisgender”; and the prefix “cis” in “cisgender” means “on this side”.

All that to say that “transgender” does not equal “transition”. They just happen to use the same prefix (at least in English).
[deleted]
I remember talking (on Reddit) to an intersex NB person that identifies as cis, so there is at least one
Lol
lmao how so
I'm not trying to debate the validity or existence of nb people  I'm just hoping for responses from people who are nb themselves or know nb people  and what their experience has been
Tbh he hardly identifies as nb either (he uses masc pronouns ppl and actively says he just doesn’t like that ppl think men can’t have pink hair and that’s his entire reason for being nb, other than that he’s pretty  transphobic by default) this isn’t a jab at the idea of being nb this is a jab at a shitty friend for being transphobic
For the last time, intersex is not a gender, and not all non-binary/intersex people are perfectly androgynous.
No that's incorrect. Many nonbinary people who are not intersex do not identify/feel transgender. And I'm sure many nonbinary intersex people do feel trans.
Nonbinary people who are intersex can still be trans. Many intersex people are forcibly assigned a gender at birth, and also intersex and nonbinary are two different identities, so it's not like they 'match' to make a person cis. Intersex is not just a nonbinary body and nonbinary isn't just wanting to be intersex. And there is absolutely NO cis privilege derived from being both intersex and nonbinary like there is being both afab and female or amab and male. People really need to stop treating nonbinary and intersex as a catch all third gender and trying to fit those intentities into the same framework as binary trans. You can't go 'oh people assigned male at birth who still identify as male and people assigned female at birth who still identify as female are privileged and cis, so nonbinary intersex must be the same' you can't just apply the same logic with no consideration for the actual experiences and identities, the oppression both groups face, and the fact that intersex and nonbinary have never meant the same thing and have their own distinct histories and identities and connotations.
Also some don’t want to identify as trans if their gender presents similar to what they where identified as at birth but that’s a bit more complex
*says transphobic, nbphobic crap*

*totally retcons said crap even though the crap is still there*

*is a contradictory truscum*
Begone truscum
> At least counter it

ok

> I see enbys more as a refusal to adhere to the genders that exist in society. There is no transition, it is literally a removal from gender

This is gendervoid specifically, plenty of NBs are not gendervoid and still consider themselves to be on a spectrum between male and female, not removed from the concept altogether. Also some do get varying degrees of surgeries and hormones.

> The ones that fall under gender fluid are like, I feel male today and female another.

There are binary gender fluid individuals so it doesn’t really make sense to target the NBs for this specifically. As for it’s own merits, the brain is complicated and largely unmapped, I see no reason that this couldn’t be possible, similar to how dysphoria levels can fluctuate over time.

> You literally help the argument of the right. Because they literally use you to justify why I am a “man”.

Frankly the reactionaries were never going to ignore us just because we were all binary, they have chosen gender as the battle line and that will not change until they find a new group they consider even easier to dehumanize. Besides, this isn’t like an ill advised easily reframe-able slogan the left has rallied behind, these are humans that exist. They are what they are so we just have to plan our defenses with that fact taken into account.
Only if they were in a culture that assigned at non-binary gender at birth. In most Western and Western-colonized/occupied cultures, intersex people are coercively assigned a binary gender (and often surgically operated on without consent). 

Remember that non-binary is not a third gender or androgyny (though a non-binary could present androgynously), but an alternative, non-categorical conceptual framework of gendering that replaces the Gender Binary. Despite what the name might naturally lead one to think, it’s not the gender equivalent of intersex. Intersex could go on to identify as non-binary, but if they were assigned a binary gender at birth, that would make them trans.
So by that logic every single non binary person is trans by definition of the word? 

I’m confused
Intersex isn't a gender.
""gay"" is often used as an umbrella term for any sexuality that is not heterosexual so it's similar to how ""trans"" is an umbrella for anyone who is not cis
True! As a binary/not intersex trans person it’s not really for me to decide or have a say on, if you feel trans you’re trans, if you don’t you’re not! I’m overthinking this, and that first comment was wrong, that’s my bad!
Yknow what I’m overthinking this, if you identify as trans you’re trans, if you don’t you’re not, sorry for the word dump, and the incorrect assumption!
truscum because being trans means something.
I may be wrong but they could be referring to how some non-binary people do not identify as transgender.

If I am wrong, then yeah begone truscum!

Edit: I just looked at their profile. You're right. This person doesn't belong here.
Ok my point is that the experience is completely different.

I’m saying nb should be it’s own category and gender fluid people the category above nb.

The fact that I have always felt like a girl, even though I presented very cishet (for my fucking safety). This is not the same, When I feel male it cause massive disphoria, not oh I’m a boy today and a girl tomorrow. This is insulting to me. 

My physically changing my body via hormones and probably a few surgeries so I feel complete. 

We are not the same.

The only thing that is the same is we are gender nonconforming.

I am not ok being male at all.

Which is why I said metaphorically that nbs exist in a nothing space because it litterally is a nothing space. The binary is male and female, nb exists outside of that. And in society today it is a nothing space.

Also when you have people with a beard and wearing a dress JVN. People will say see, he’s just faking it. This is exactly why I want it separated. I have nothing against these individuals. But saying we are under the trans umbrella is absurd.
> Only if they were in a culture that assigned at non-binary gender at birth. In most Western and Western-colonized/occupied cultures, intersex people are coercively assigned a binary gender (and often surgically operated on without consent).

While this has been true for most of modern Western history, it has changed in recent years in many Western countries, and there have been more and more people assigned intersex. It's also possible to retroactively change your birth certificate, so existing intersex people increasingly have the option to actually change their AGAB.

> Despite what the name might naturally lead one to think, it’s not the gender equivalent of intersex. Intersex could go on to identify as non-binary, but if they were assigned a binary gender at birth, that would make them trans.

It's not the equivalent, yes, but a person assigned intersex could identify as cis non-binary, that's my entire point.
By definition, yes. But it’s up to them if they want to individually use the label of ‘trans’ to describe themselves. Many do, some don’t. Individual comfort and choice.
That makes me feel like some people are just dodging the stigma and discrimination and further stigmatizing it :(
So I get downvotes for voicing something that doesn’t make me feel good. Got it. Can’t open up or ask questions.
It’s rather that 1) those do still present mostly as their AGAB don’t want to occupy space or talk over binary trans people who are dealing with the issues involved in transitioning their presentation, and/or 2) they are either shamed by or otherwise tired of dealing with harassment from transmedicalists and truscum. 

The general vibe that I get is that it is a reaction to gatekeeping from within the trans community. To dump on them as trying to avoid the stigma of being trans serves only to put them in a double bind. 

I live with a binary trans person. I am non-binary and still present mostly as my AGAB in daily life (I may make a more binary-ish transition later on, but that’s not what being trans is about). I’m not going to stand beside them and publicly call myself trans in most contexts, as I would feel (rightly or wrongly) guilty about seeming to trivialize their experience, not afraid of stigma for myself (I would be afraid of being seen by binary trans people as not trans enough, actually). But on a conceptual level, I absolutely do consider that I’m trans by definition because no one in my culture is assigned any gender outside the gender binary at birth. Does that make sense?

T4T But With a cis person	When I figured myself out and came out, I was in a relationship. My girlfriend is wonderful and accepts me, and I appreciate her so much, but I feel like something is missing when I see T4T couples. There’s a level of understanding and trust there that sometimes I feel isn’t in my relationship. I don’t just want to leave my girlfriend because she is cis, she is wonderful and supportive most of the time. But I do really feel like I’m missing out on love/connection from my community. I don’t really know many other lesbians like me in my life, which I think adds to this feeling. Any advice welcome, I’m not really sure to go about anything but I really do find myself wishing I was with someone who understood the subtleties of my identity only another person like me would know.	"All of us want to be understood by our partners and feel accepted that’s totally natural. In any relationship, usually it comes from having open dialogue and conversations- which most people don’t especially around hard conversations like this. 

If we don’t have those talks, That can lead to resentment or feelings like you’re having now of not feeling understood or the lack of trust you mentioned. Have you spoken to her about how you feel? Why do you think you’re missing out on something that is not in your current relationship?
Personally I respect T4T people but I don't have it in my to pick and choose who I fall in love with, and honestly it doesn't make much of a difference. I can relate to a trans person in my dysphoria, but my cis bf and I had a similar upbringing, matching goals, and common interests. Thats why Im with him. I would still be with him if he was trans, what I'm trying to say is that, for me, someone's transness or cissness isnt an attributing factor to dating.
I mean no offense but what does T4T mean?
I would say while what you're feeling Is valid, dont glamourise t4t too much. Because some of the trans ppl in my life have been the least supportive, most disheartening, least understanding people I've met. Everyone views being trans differently so being with another trans person wont necessarily open you up to a deeper connection
i think making more trans friends would definitely help at least somewhat with these feelings. assuming you're american, once you're 18 (i saw ur 17 in a recentish post) the app Lex is a great way to meet lgbt people & events in your area and it's not specifically geared towards dating. in my experience (ohio+socal) it has a lot of trans people and lesbians, but i'm sure it varies in other cities. you can also of course meet other trans people online in a million different ways !
100% this.  I deleted my reply because you said it so well.
Trans for trans - a relationship between two trans people

Am I too old to be questioning my gender?	"I'm 40, married, have kids.  Shouldn't I know who I am by now?  I feel like the more I try to figure myself out, the harder it is to quantify.  Some days I want to be a guy so badly it hurts, while on others I'm actually almost happy with my female curves.  I don't like the thought of only ever being a woman;  my entire life, in my dreams I've always been a man, and there are so many things I want to experience as a man.  On the other hand, I like my life with my husband and children, and I'm overall fairly happy.  I've been doing a lot of research, and I feel like genderfluid best describes how I feel, and looking back I can see some signs, but shouldn't I have realised this before now?

&#x200B;

My husband is being very supportive, but thinks this is all in my head.  I've been reading lots of gay romance books the last few years, and he thinks they're giving me *ideas*.  He believes that if I get out of the house more often and interact more with the real world, these thoughts will go away.  And I can't help but wonder, *is he right?*  Surely, if I were actually something other than 100% female, I would have questioned my identity in my younger years?

&#x200B;

I'm afraid of blowing up my life.  My husband doesn't want me to be anything other than what I am, whoever that happens to be, but he's been very clear: he is only romantically interested in women, so if I identify as anything other than a woman at all times, that's it for us.  

&#x200B;

I wish someone would tell me who I am so definitively that I couldn't deny it.  I wish I could make this decision without fear of losing the person I love so much."	"Nope.  People like us who grew up in the 80s/90s very often were not exposed to even the possibility of being another gender until later in life, so I feel like there are a lot of us who are just now figuring this out.  I'm 38 and just came out to my wife this year.  While I had thoughts about this earlier, I literally had no idea to even suspect anything until after I was 30.  Now of course I see signs going back to when I was 5, but I had no idea at the time what it meant.  It's not uncommon at all to not realize these things until you're older, especially when you grow up in a time or place that gives no thought or discussion to gender identity or sexual orientation.
You should visit r/TransLater for inspiration.
You're not too old. You can start questioning at any age. 
Please think of your own happiness before your husband's. This is your life and you deserve to live it freely and happily, as yourself. If you aren't happy living the way you are now, you deserve to discover who are and discover what in life could make you happier. 
I believe in you!
Also transmasc - my mom said the same things about me when I was reading a lot of mlm/gay lit. 

Here's the thing though, it didn't give me ideas. I saw myself in those stories, and I wanted to be a man/masc person with another man. I wanted the romance in those books for myself, and to be part of it. Now I get to! Good luck to you.
No. I fully figured out that I'm trans (amab) age 41. was signs before that, but got buried deeper and deeper until I had to deal with it.

Life is exploring what it is.
Plenty of people begin transitioning in our 40s.

Don't believe people who tell you it's too late.  They're lying.  

My wife left me when I came out.  My heart was broken worse than ever before in my life.  I cried every day for six months straight.  

I still don't regret it.
I was born in 1963 and I knew, but denied it till my 40's. What little news of trans people that popped into my life was accompanied by condemnation of the person by everyone within earshot.

When was young I got picked on by an older boy b/c I was ""funny looking"" not in a femme way, just he wanted to push me around. I had never been bullied and thought I was going to die. I think he saw the fear, didn't touch me, but made some mock threats to save face among the other boys and I just avoided him for years until I got older.

My mind processed this as anyone who is different is a target. So for decades I did the best to fit in and especially fade in to the background. Not ideal when you are male to female! Finally I just gave up and found people I could talk to about this and the journey began.

I think we all question are we trans enough? Because most of our lives we were told we had to be who we were perceived as.
I didn't know who I was until I was 44. Too old only exists in our minds.
A lot of us don't figure it out until we're in our 40's. It happens! You're the only one who can tell anyone definitively who you are. I guess there's the ""Button Question"". If you could press a button and change gender to your ideal form, would you press it? Did you say yes, of course? I did. Well, what if I told you that it was a series of buttons in a long process and if you dial your doctor, you can get referred to a gender clinic and get the ball rolling? 

If you have a partner who gives you ultimatums, that's a HUGE red flag to me. I don't know how to tell you this but your life is going to blow up sooner or later, and you'll be better off if you take the reins and dictate how that shit goes down. Get a good Family Lawyer, open new bank accounts in only your name, and protect your own assets and interests, no matter what happens. People grow and relationships change. Don't let the heartbreak of it all overwhelm you and don't engage in destructive behaviors like arguing, threats, recriminations, and the sort of bitterness that often goes along with dissolution and divorce, for your own sake and for your kids, too. Gender fluid flows and people drift apart. There's no need to feel bad about that, you had several good years of that relationship, and you can celebrate it. Be honest with yourself about who you are and the rest will follow.
You're not too old. I'm turning 40 next month, and I just started this whole journey six months ago.

As for blowing up your life... It sucks. Trying to ignore it day after day weighs on you. I spent 30 years being depressed, and I didn't even really know why. Once I knew, though, it got worse. I couldn't go back to the low-level depression that had defined my life before. The choices were to admit who I am and embrace it, or become suicidal.

I'm not sure which outcome would be more disruptive for your own life.

If your husband isn't into men, then... that sucks. It's not his fault, and it isn't yours either. There's nobody there to blame. I will say that my daughter had no problem calling me ""Mom"" when my wife and I talked to her. She's six, though. Six-year-olds are cool with pretty much everything.
I came out last year at the age of 41.  I’ve been on hormones for 9 months now.  

We all come out in our own time in our own way when we are ready.  There’s no rule that’s says you must know by age X or come out by age Y to be a valid trans person.  Many of us born in the 80’s did not understand what we are.  That’s not our fault.  If you’re gender fluid then you’re transgender and there’s nothing wrong with it.  There is no shame in being yourself.  Your husband doesn’t seem know a great deal about trans people or the trans experience.
It sounds like you've felt this for years, but are only now really paying attention to those feelings.

I finally figured out that I'm trans non-binary gender fluid at the age of 49 last year, but I had thoughts about being a boy as young as 4 years old. 

When I was a kid, someone would call me a boy and all my friends and family would yell at them that I was a girl and get really mad that they called me a boy. I liked being called a boy, but got scared from everyone correcting the stranger that said it. 

Eventually I convinced myself that I could only be a girl/woman. It took me years to finally figure out I'm not a cis woman.

You need to figure out if staying with your husband is enough incentive to stay in the closet, or would you be better off dumping him so you can be your true self.
there is no such thing as being too old to question your gender. many people don’t gain the knowledge or language necessary to identify what they’re feeling regarding their gender until much later in life. there’s no shame in that. i figured out i was trans at 15, but if i hadn’t had access to education on what trans people are and helpful terminology i might not have figured myself out as early.

i can’t say i have experience with being in a relationship and then figuring out you’re trans, but my best advice is to be as open and honest with your husband as possible. experiment with your gender expression. figure out what you like. maybe try out a different name and pronouns if that feels right. and in the end, if you decide you’re actually cis that’s completely okay too. 

if you need any help finding trans resources i’d be happy to help
Enby trans here. Came out to my wife about ten months ago. There were signs before, but I never seriously considered I could be trans/Enby before.

I am 53…
Nope. I don’t relate to ‘knowing’ as a child either, took me until my early 20s after seeing a movie about a trans person
Never too old.
Nope not too late to question your gender. I was doing it at about your age as well. 44 now and for years I just thought I was a crossdresser but after a lot of thinking I realized I was a woman. Nearly 2 years later now im living as a woman full-time.
I'm sorry to hear about the honest terror you're experiencing right now. I figured it out around 37 and, for similar reasons of not wanting to blow up my life, didn't transition until a year later. My wife stayed and we are incredibly happy together, though after a rough year, but I know from many other couples that this often isn't the case.   


I'm sorry : (  Know that 1) you're beautiful and 2) everything was set up for us to see 'transness' as an awkward joke, so it makes sense to have not seen it in ourselves.

Take care and reach out if you need people.
Absolutely not! There is no age limit to finding out who/what you are, in any facet of life. It is an unfortunate truth that without education a lot of trans people do not/can not identify themselves, and even ten years ago that education was scarce to nonexistent, let alone 40. Don’t be afraid to be who you are, and don’t let someone else tell you how you feel and what you think is wrong or delusional. No one knows you better than you know yourself.
My wife sounds like your husband. I don't dislike my life *per se*, but I definitely don't feel comfortable in my skin. I call myself genderqueer. She's made it clear to me that she's as CIS and Straight as she cna be, and she doesn't want to be with a woman. I grew up in a conservative home, and I know I carry a lot of internalized stuff that tells me some really terrible things sometimes.

I don't have advice. Just understanding. It's tough. If you figure out what you're going to do, let me know. :)
You’re never too old to learn who you are
> but thinks this is all in my head

I mean, to be fair, gender identity kind of is. I know what he means, but our sense of self is what drives us, and there is research that trans brains resemble more their cis counter parts than AGAB.

As for ""to old"" I've seen people flourish at 50 and up. I was 33 when I realized 11 months ago. Since I'm down over 60lb and 10 months HRT.

I did kind of go fast, but I just had to know and the longer I've been on HRT the more I like who I am becoming, or rather who I am finally coming out.

Unfortunately, nobody can tell you if you are trans. That is something you have to answer yourself. All we can do is tell you our experience and hope it helps you figure out yours.
I'm 26, AMAB, trans fem. The little bit I will share is that I would always look in the mirror and feel like I ""liked"" my reflection. Like objectively speaking I could look at myself and say, ""yeah this is an attractive body for a guy. I guess I'm attractive."" So there was some pride and I felt that this is what it felt like to ""like"" your own appearance.

Over the years and more recently I have more clarity. I still look like a guy (pre-everything) but now I like how I look in the mirror *but only when I focus on my feminine qualities.* Like if I turn to the side and feel like I have more curves. Noticing and acknowledging the gendered quality of my interest in my body was informative - I like when I look feminine, I wish I looked more feminine, I am on a path to look and present more feminine. 

There's a lot of introspection, soul searching, and digging into your genuine feelings with this. It's never too late. The more you discover about yourself, fortunately or unfortunately, you may realize nothing else matters except living as true to yourself. Like the cat's out of the bag. Or maybe not and you're totally cis🤷🏼 no matter what you discover I wish you luck.
I transitioned (MtF) when I was 40.  I have two kids.  It was rough, but I have an amazing relationship with my kids, and I remarried to an incredible man.

But allow me to repeat: it was rouuuuuuugh.  I've learned what real faith is.

I don't regret it.  It caused some pain, but where I'm at now, over a decade later, life is better than it ever was.  It doesn't come free.  I am scarred, but life was scratching me up pretty good long before.

I won't deny that my life followed the stereotypical path: I lost all of my friends.  I lost my job (they hired me back later).  I was lost and alone and lonely for a long time, but I took solace in the idea that I was doing what was right for me.  This is just me, but I think the world yearns for people to be themselves, not just talk about it.  We people \*are\* themselves, it's like carving a path through the jungle of life and inevitably other people find themselves following the cleared way, maybe taking the path further or elsewhere.

I know I didn't directly answer your questions, but at the end of the day, it's up to you how you answer your own questions, and to decide if the answers you pick take you closer to where you want to be in your life, whether that's ""right here"" or ""somewhere over there.""
Nah, there are folks who are considerably older who've transitioned! There's no time frame or limit in discovering yourself. Your happiness and peace of mind comes first and foremost, and if in your mind's eye see yourself as a man and it makes you happy, then you should pursue it.

I've felt similarly in the 'how didn't I see this' mindset. I feel it's actually very common to just not question anything until we're into our adulthoods. I grew up in the 90's where trans people simply weren't spoken about, and if so, it was very negatively or as the butt of a cruel joke, especially in a religious/conservative household. Now, as an adult transmasculine, I'm happier than ever that I took the plunge and started exploring my own identity and am well on my journey. BE FREE, MY DEAR, BE FREEEEEE
It's never too late to become yourself. Something in you has been awoken and you need to take the proper time to explore it, wherever it may lead. At the end of the day, being true to yourself is the most important thing. Maybe you are trans and maybe your marriage will end. But if you are and you try to suppress it, it may cause even bigger problems for your family and marriage, and especially, to yourself.
I was turning 35 when I went from questioning to cracked. I had dreams before of being femme or andro but it coincided this time with some realizations with my therapist and such and the dream felt so absolutely goddamn euphoric. And I'll be honest, a lot of it has sucked so hard. But there have also been some awesome moments. I led the founding of the LGBTQ+ ERG at my company. I've helped talk others through their experiences with coming out in various forms.

There are some things in my life that are significantly important to me. My partner, my kids, my parents, our new home being built. And while they're all fully supportive of me, I'm also the biggest cashflow in our home by a wide margin. Going headfirst into a total transformation would incur costs and changes and impacts that I can't even come close to comprehending. So I take it slow. A bit at a time. And I take solace in the knowledge it's never too late.
Bruh your never too old you do you boo I'm 20 and I'm Trans female so fr you do you be who you want to🥰
uh no def not if anything It makes sense because a lot of people your age grew up in a far worse time 
little representation and a lot of lgbt stuff was taboo until the 2000’s
Never too late. Like many others brought up in the 80s/90s I had no clue there was other options. Growing up in the ghetto much less so. Luckily my wife introduced me to the concept of Genderfluidity in my early 20’s so I had a stepping stone but I was so repressed and beaten down that I would do anything to make everyone else happy - even at the cost of my own happiness. Took me 9 more years to realize it was just hurting me and nobody gave a shit about all the people-pleasing. Some of my friends were even like “bout time you think about yourself”. It’s a balancing of the scales for you now. Will you suffer more exploring who you may actually be, or suffer more being who everyone else wants you to be? And how much do you weigh your happiness against your suffering? Only you can decide this, and I wish it were easier for all of us but c’est la vie
You are NEVER to old to live your truth. I hope you find comfort wether you transition or not:)
No
I have a friend in their 60s who is transitioning.

Doubts are normal, and no one is saying you \*have\* to transition, or even that you're definitely trans. But it's worth figuring out the answer right? Because for some people they will never be happy without transitioning. It does at least seem like you had some desires earlier in life, given that you dream as a man. It's hard to figure these things out sometimes, particularly if the idea of people being trans isn't one you hear of much.

I suppose ultimately you have to ask yourself, if it is truly the case that your husband will leave you, whether or not you will be happier as a man, or in your marriage. I know that's a terrible choice to make, and I'm sorry. You should choose whatever is best for you in the end.
Absolutely not, you're never too old! ❤️ The first trans person I ever met was a woman who had come out in her 60's with 4 grankids. She told me she never thought to question her gender until maybe her 50's, because people didn't talk about this kind of stuff back in her day. Personally, I didn't start questioning until my mid 20's either for the same reason: i grew up in a rural town where no one talked about things like gender and sexuality, and had i not moved into the city and met the people I did, I honestly don't know if I would have figured it out. It makes it hard to know that kind of stuff about yourself when you didn't know it was even an option.

I'm sorry your husband doesn't believe you. I can't offer advice on that front, but you're still valid, even if it took you longer to realise.
No. Don't even have to read your age, you're never too old.
I'm only 28, and about a year on testosterone. I had the same fears of 'being too late' when I realized I was trans. But I quickly realized, I only didn't catch on to the fact I was trans because I didn't know being trans was an option until my mid-twenties. If I knew about trans guys in my early twenties, or teens, or even as a kid; I know I would have identified as a trans guy at that time. Also, my home growing up was crazy religious and conservative. So even if I knew, I likely would have still been in the closet. Just the same as I stayed in the closet about being queer sexually growing up, I would have been closeted as a trans guy. But that's also hindsight, I could have very well just denied everything. 

I'm still young, but one thing I've learned being an adult: no one really knows what they are doing. It's all just motions, and pretending, and acting off of stuff that worked in the past. I know people in their 40s and 50s who still have no idea what on earth they are doing, or who they are. Some of them are just discovering they are asexual, or polyamorous, or bisexual, or trans, etc. 

Just try not to worry too much about labels, or wasted time, or not realizing early enough, etc. In your situation, try and think about what feels most important long-term for you. Would you rather stay a 'woman' for the rest of your life solely for the comfort of your partner? Do you think you will still be fine with that choice later in life? If the answer is yes, then that's fine. If the answer is no, then for both of your sakes...wouldn't it be better to experiment now? If twenty years down the line you can't take it anymore, and your partner still isn't open to being with anyone who doesn't identify as a women...then you will both be in the same situation you are in now, just further down the line. 

Really look into yourself, and also talk with your husband. Would he be fine with you trying out different clothes? Different names? Different pronouns? Would that be something that could work for both of you to test your comfort level without any changes to your body? That would be the first step, to see if the relationship could still work, and what changes need to be made to feel more comfortable. After that would be stuff like HRT and surgeries, if you did feel more comfortable with more masculine clothes/names/pronouns/etc. (or even feminine, if you are non-binary or just a more feminine trans guy). 

Best of luck on figuring all this out. There really is no rush, even if it might feel like it. Take things in your own time, and know that you don't owe anyone (even yourself) a definite answer before you are ready to give one.
Never too old to question hun. I hope you figure things out
It is *NEVER* too late to be honest with yourself. 

I had four grown kids and a 28 year marriage when I realized I just couldn’t man-up anymore.
Nope. It took me 50 years to finally figure it all out. Better late then never, I suppose. I belong to the Tracer army(transgender/asexual)
It’s never to old. I’m 30 and I just came to terms identifying as a female. There is no time table. Be who you are.
Thank you!  I *did* have a very conservative upbringing - I first heard the term *trans* as an adult, and in a very negative way.  So good to know I'm not too late!
Same. I’ll be 37 in a month, my egg cracked a couple weeks ago. So much of my childhood makes way more sense through the ‘I’m transmasc’ lense. 

While it makes my childhood make more sense, brain go brrrrrrrr about what that means for my present day.
I agree with you about the 80s/90s kid thing. I had no idea what transgender was until I was an adult. I’m 40 now and my egg broke last month. Like you, I now recognize signs throughout my life that pointed to the fact that I was actually a girl rather than a boy.
Joined!
I feel the same: I want to be with a man *as* a man.  But to play devil's advocate, if I had never read any queer lit, would it have even occurred to me?  Maybe I'd still be blissfully ignorant of what I want.
Haha too right!
Aww your daughter sounds awesome!  How'd your wife handle it?
My husband works with lots of people in the queer community, but due to his upbringing, he still feels that being trans is a mental illness.  To be fair to him, though, he's trying really hard to be patient and understanding with me.  It's not his fault he's not attracted to boys any more than it's my fault that I feel like one sometimes.
Yes!  I would *love* resources!
Yay I'm not alone!  If it's not too personal to share, how did your wife take it?  Was it difficult for her/your relationship?
Thank you!  Would you mind telling me more about how you and your wife worked through your transition?
My heart aches for you!  Are you and your wife working through things, or called it quits?  How are *you* feeling?  I hope you have someone trustworthy you can talk to; if not - I'm here for you!
Thanks!  I definitely need the luck!  I'm not great at introspection, so I'm struggling a bit with all of this.  Hopefully I'll come out better on the other end.  :)
I admire your bravery, and am so glad that it worked out for you, and you're happy now.  I don't have your courage, though, and I don't think I would survive going through what you did.
Haha thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!  You bring up some really good questions, which I am going to put some thought into answering for myself.  Just need to remind myself not to be impatient, lol.
Yep, same here.  I don't think I heard the word until I was in college, and didn't meet anyone that I knew was trans until I was 30 (which kind of put me on my current path lol).
A lot of trans millennials first exposure to the concept of a trans person was Ace Ventura.
Was going to suggest this as well.
So, I can't tell you what would've happened, or how your identity would be shaped otherwise, because I'm not you, and I don't know your life. 

What I do know is that those feelings of being different, of not quite fitting in, of feeling like an imposter, of being ""wrong"" somehow always existed within me before I ever read those stories. I know that those stories helped me identify those feelings, but even back then I didn't just wake up and realize I was trans after reading them.

It took a lot of conscious work on my part to acknowledge that I might be trans. It was such an othered group for me growing up, but my brother realized and came out as a boy when he was 12. I was almost 20. That started my journey in exploring the trans community in order to both understand him and better protect my brother from our mom. 

Its the people in that journey who helped me ask myself the right questions. My husband is a trans man,, and he is the first person who really ever asked me what I *wanted* to be. Sure, reading queer fiction influenced me. But the influence wasn't on my gender, it just made more sense when I looked back. It influenced me to look for partners who cared about me, and to be proud of being queer, whatever that might look like for me.

I dont know what would have happened if you'd never read the stories you read, but Im sure that one way or another, now or 20 years from now, you might have realized something all along was a little off. 

I hope this helps! You're never too old, hun. It will get easier, and it gets easier faster if you are kind to yourself. Don't gaslight your experiences, and try to remember that being trans is normal - it's society that makes a big deal of it.
Coming from the other side I always loved the idea of lesbian relationships. I could not really understand other types of relationships, and as far as straight relationships go most of them don't even seem to like each other.

I was never confident enough to approach women as a man, so I've been single my whole life. I did wish I could be a girl to be, among other things, a lesbian because it made more sense to me, but then I thought I was being creepy and fetishizing lesbians.

Come to fined out in the last 11 months of accepting myself I have *way* more in common with lesbians than I ever had with straight men.

TL;DR: We find outlets for our desires, even if we don't realize that is what we are doing.
Heh. She was relieved.

I was at the airport, on my way home, and she had asked me how I was feeling. I had just spent most of my free time on that trip reading this subreddit, some public blog posts, and assorted other trans publications, (getting more and more freaked out as I recognized everything they were talking about) and I told her all about it.

She helped so much. We spent the next few hours with her asking me questions and helping me work through everything. I'm grateful that I basically got to come out to myself and her in the same conversation. Once my egg was well and truly cracked, she then confessed that for some time, she had been trying to deal with her own ""big gay feelings"".

It's kind of weird. I've had a few people tell me that they were usually only into women, but that they thought of me as maybe being acceptable too, which confused them. Well, mystery solved!

this is more directed towards trans youth but i think it could be helpful for you as well
Check out my profile and the first post there (“My story”).

In short, it was difficult but she accepted it, and she is a great support…

But please, do checkout the post and some following ones where I continued reporting (my daughter’s reaction, etc.)
Everyone is different, but a few things ended up being very important. 

For her, she needed to learn how to take our life together one day at a time. Thinking of future changes would make her anxious and turned off. But if she thought on any given day, ""Am I happy with this person today?"" the answer was Yes. 

For me, my personality didn't change hugely. This is to say that I have met quite a few trans people who, in transitioning, try to relive their life and act like they're 14 again, both finding themselves entirely new and wearing clothes that possibly look less appropriate on any adult. Along with that, I also transitioned somewhat slowly. So I didn't just get a new wardrobe overnight. 

For both of us, we talked so much together and with others. She especially worked hard to find other couples like us, ones that were open to making it work but were also terrified. Now, through this, she helps run an online trans-spouse support group that's based out of Vermont. 

You're welcome to read what we've written so far about the experience: [https://wedidnotasktobe.wordpress.com/](https://wedidnotasktobe.wordpress.com/)

I'm happy to talk more if you're looking for it. Honestly, transitioning is such a lonely experience. It's great to find someone who can relate.
I mean, same! I am seeing a therapist to speak about my lifelong dysphoria and what, if anything, is to be done about it. I hope you have a similar outlet.

My wife and I are... working on our relationship. It's been rough for a while, and me telling her about my mental reality hasn't been easy for her, and she would just prefer I stay in the closet, so I don't get a lot of time or space to explore or anything. So, working on the relationship, but not in this regard. In this regard, it's definitely ""I can't deal with this so I'm not going to,"" and I'm staying in my role for the time being until I can do so no longer.

How are you doing? It seems your hubs kind of wants to narrate your internal life for you? I may be overstating. How long has he know? Change is hard. This sort of change, moreso.
If I may ask, how did your wife handle your coming out?
I had no conception of Ace Ventura as being trans... what did I miss?
I had no conception of Ace Ventura as being trans... what did I miss?
Thank you for your kind words!  I feel so overwhelmed right now, and yeah, I'm second guessing every thought I've ever had.  I'm glad you have a spouse who understands you so well!
Okay, I have to admit to some jealousy here.  There's no way my husband will be relieved, or pleased, or anything positive, but it in no way lessens my happiness for you!
Thank you!
I read them all!  Thanks for sharing your story.  It sounds like the people who matter in your life have been beautifully supportive.  Also, you look fantastic!  So happy!
Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply!  I will definitely check out your link.  My enthusiasm wants to jump in with both feet, but I think you're right - slow and steady is the key.  My husband and I have been talking a lot about everything, but unfortunately we live in a small town and as far as I can find there's no community for me/us to talk to.
My husband and I have been married for 20 years, so he knows me pretty well.  I don't think he's trying to tell me what to think so much as telling me what *he* thinks, which is ""blame it on your reading choices.""  I told him a week ago about how I feel kind of masculine sometimes, have even picked out a guy's name for myself.  I expected him to get mad, to be honest, but he was calm and listened.  Pretty sure he thinks I'm mentally ill now, though.  If I don't take it all back and pass it off as a temporary fantasy, I'll probably lose him.

I hope you and your wife are able to work things out, and that you can comfortably be your true self with her.  <3
About as well as I could have hoped.  Asked me questions about what I wanted to do, helped me find a gender therapist and trans friendly hair place.  I can't recommend her enough 🤣.  We're still taking it slow, because I don't want to dump a full life's worth of released trans tendencies on her at once, but we're making our way forward together.
“Laces out”
It wasn't him (Ace Ventura), but another character. Played for 'laughs' when the woman turned out to be a trans woman. Lot's of gagging and transphobic bs when Ace forcibly stripped her in front of others to 'expose' the fact that she was trans. So, not positive at all.
Of course! Its natural. I hope your journey brings you joy and happiness, though!  Lemme know if you ever wanna talk more :)
Thank you very much.

If I may: be who you are and live **your** life.

I was so afraid before I came out to my wife… and for what? Nothing.

Life is so much better for both of us now and tbh our love for each other just grew stronger and bigger. Not to say that things can’t get worse… they *can*… but until then, I try to live **my** life.

The thing I realized after coming out was: the people who really love me will continue doing so regardless. All the others were faking it and are not worth spending time with them anymore… 

All my love and warmest wishes to you.

😘
22 years for me. Running full speed yet standing completely still.

I hope you can figure out what's going on for you and what, if anything, you choose to do about it. Hopefully your partner will come around.
Horray for understanding spouses!  Sounds like you picked a good one.  :)
Ok I was trippin' for a second. I remember that movie having pretty much the basest humor imaginable.
I don't have your courage, but thank you for the boost!  Hopefully I can get there soon.  :)"	xchthi	trans	121	0.96	2022-09-12 16:49:17
Ran into my first major transphobe. I could use some encouragement. <3	"I work in the service industry. Details withheld to protect my identity, and my job if coworkers/supervisors see this.  I experienced my first major transphobic event/slur today. On top of my already pegged anxiety, it has had my mood shifting between crying and depressed and angry as frack.  


 I was helping a customer today. She was as pleasant as one could ask at first.  The first time she was unable to get her way she started to get nasty with me, strait into Karen mode.  Asked to see the manager. A lower manager came over. I told them exactly the chain of events, what the customer wanted, and what I said. The manger looked at the customer, and back to me and said sounds like you did what you were supposed to, supporting me and leaves.

In response to this the KAREN shouted I haven't even told my side of it yet.  ""This stupid heshe won't give me my discounts!"" To which I calmly responded, ""Excuse me, what did you say."" Her retort was ""You f\*ing heard me you f\*ing heshe\*"" To which I slightly less calmly said, ""That is enough, we are no longer serving you. Your verbal abuse is not welcome. I will call someone to get your unpaid for items, because I am unable to lift the heavy items.""  
She then rammed me with her electric cart, and chased the manager who had just walked away. I slowly walked over there and informed him I had refused her further service for verbal abuse and slurs. Of course being younger he just took the path of least resistance and gave in to her demands. This made me so mad I almost walked out right there. Not the young guy just trying to save himself a headache, he isn't a real manager and I dont blame him. But the karen throwing around verbal abuse and slurs and still getting her way.

I called over the major manager on duty and told him what happened. I said ""if it had been the N word or another racial slur she would have been escorted out without further questions."" He walked over to do just that once he know, but by then she had already gotten her way and finished her transaction. SO he just let her go and told me if it happens again to disengage completely and call a major manager directly. I could tell he was upset that I had been mistreated, and knew I was upset. He sent someone to give me a break right as soon as someone was free. Which was good because I was on the verge of tears.

&#x200B;

In the grand  scheme of things it was just one customer, and it wasn't the T word. But it still hurts. Here I am 12ish hours later and my feelings are still raw from this.

Edit: thank you everyone for all the comments. By the time I was able to post I was mostly over it.  Being able to share it was the cathartic release I really needed. All of your comments remind me that I am not alone, and that we all process things like this slightly differently. Love you all <3."	"If I ever see her I will suplex her for you. Not that I know either of you. I’ll just have to suplex every transphobe until I get the right one.
First off, I'd like to say I am sorry you had this experience with a such a hateful person.

There is no excuse for hate or ignorance of any kind.

But the worst of this situation is over now and you had time to de-escalate your emotions and post your story here which is very healthy.

I've worked in customer service for years. Being called every name in the book because they hate the company I work for.

When I took the job, i was immediately told that customers are from all walks of life and they will be nasty and rude. This is where skill shines in de-escalation tactics even dealing with any outspoken ""Karen"". 

Big companies will always take the customers side because of social media and negative customer reviews or influence. Also because it's easier to give Karen what she wants and can de-escalate the employee later because we all have to make a living so we keep our jobs rather than looking for another one. Believe me honey, we're all replaceable to some extent regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. I don't like it any more than you do but companies see their employees as numbers and that's it. 

They educate on sensitivity training because they want to avoid any complications with being labeled as non-supportive to certain groups so they appeal to everyone, even transphobic people. And sadly, they will fire an employee for other reasons rather than the real reason, discrimination or just wait for the employee to quit. ""At will employment"" in most states meaning we can fire you for any reason just like you can quit for any reason.

This doesn't excuse this type of behavior the customer has but it is the way the world works, sadly. I wish you all the love and support for dealing with a customer such as this and I hope you have less interactions than I do on the phone daily.

Sending my love and prayers for you that you more people can have compassion for you.
I’m so sorry. :(
If I ever see her I will Detroit Smash her into the sun for you. You definitely didn’t deserve that.
Huge hugs!  This is one of the TOUGHEST parts of service industry.  The navigation and balance between customers being absolutely shitty and at what point do you stop providing service 😣  I would have totally had them escorted out... no good will come from how that person is interacting.
Call her a piece of she-it
*sends some internet hugs*

Sorry, you had to go through that.
Hugs
She was just looking for something to get at you. She wanted that reaction out of you, I’m so proud of you for getting through this tho. Don’t give them the reaction they want, even though it’s hard. You got this girl ♡
Ok. Sooo as someone who has worked retail for probably 1/4 of my 29 years retail customers are amoung some of the worst human beings on the planet. I always laugh at Karen's and bonded with my coworkers over making fun of their absurd requests. 
Look up viva la dirt league: Karen's on YouTube if you want a good laugh. It might just cheer you up. 😂

Other than that *hugs* you'll be ok. Your strong and pretty. Not many individuals have the strength to go through what this community does on a daily basis. 😊🥰
Fuckin charge her with assault she hit you with her cart....furthermore state it was based on your gender...might get a hate crime thrown in there
Fuck the Karen and fuck your manager too tbh
What does not kill you will only make you stronger.
It sounds like you did everything you could. The fact that the actual manager is on your side is a good thing. You not know you can’t trust this assistant manager or wherever he is to have your back.

If she shows up again. Call the actual manager immediately and pointed out the customer and reiterate exactly what happened last time. 

If she never shows up again, Then is not something you’ll ever have to worry about again from this vile person.
You can never expect a company to have your back, or anyone in managerial positions to have your back, because company policy is about avoiding expenses.

I try to keep in mind that people who act like this always reach for the first, most relevant insult(which when they scream at me is t-slur, f-slur etc) they can for anyone they’re interacting with, and they probably have an even more sad life than me, which is why they feel the need to be hurtful whenever they can.
Back during covid when I worked retail,  I was sent upfront by the door to make sure only a certain amount of customers got into the store and that they had a mask etc etc. Anyway during this I got called every thing under the sun especially if they saw my pronoun buttons so I understand where you're coming from but I am glad upure able to tell them you won't serve them anymore i can't really do that I'd LOVE to do that though omg kudos
I know it’s not what you want to hear but you strike me as quite young (not a bad thing) and as a trans lady myself but on the late end of the age scale I have to urge you to learn how to let this kind of thing just roll off. Trust me I know it’s a lot easier said that done but showing a reaction to these transphobic folk is only going to enable/encourage them to continue their actions. 

Unfortunately it’s a lot like dealing with a toddler, if you just ignore them and act like you didn’t hear them it’s quite earth shattering in their minds. It won’t change them but I promise you’ll save yourself a lot of torment and trouble. 
Sorry you have to deal with this but that’s customer service for you it doesn’t matter what you are if they aren’t getting their way it’s personal.

Anyways.. I just hope you have a better day tomorrow. Seriously hurts to see people going through this.
OH YEA I HELLP U
Yesss! Love the my hero reference
I love VLDL. <3. I try to ignore the hate and just focus on the customers who are nice. This was just too far for me.
P.s. still sucks tho :/ I’m sorry you had to deal with that, I worked as a barista for awhile and heard a lot of awful shit so I feel you
I am not young in age, but I have only been openly trans for a year. While I half agree with you, that a reaction is what they want.  No reaction or consequences let's them think they can get away with it. Only through social consequences will the casual use of slurs be deincetivized.
😙
I can understand that. I'm sure you'll be ok though. It will just take some time 😄"	ys69o6	trans	121	0.98	2022-11-11 09:57:53

is it normal to fantasize about having male genitalia as a cis woman?	nearly every time i am intimate, alone or with my boyfriend, i imagine that i have male genitalia. i also often enjoy pretending that i am a cis male, and enjoy flattening my chest when i do so. sometimes i am comfortable with being a woman, but sometimes i’m also comfortable being a male. is this normal for a cisgendered woman? or could this potentially be a gender identity issue?	"Is it ""Normal"" as in ""within the range of human experience""? _Absolutely._

Normal as in ""something a cis woman could theoretically experience and have that be okay and valid""? _Its possible._  gender and sexuality and fantasy are complicated and can be intertwined but also aren't necessarily inherently linked nor do they always ""match"". And like, genderplay is a thing. 

But normal as in ""common for your average cis woman to experience""? _No._ While it's possible that this is just a sexual fantasy for you, its not a particularly common experience for cis women and may be worth exploring a bit further. The main question I'd ask yourself is if this feeling is purely restricted to the bedroom, or if the desire or comfort with the idea of being male extends outside of that context and into the rest of your life. If it comes up outside of sex, I'd definitely put some thought into if presenting more masculine or being perceived as a guy in your daily life is something that appeals to you. I can't give you the answers, only you can find them through questioning.
I mean, I used to think I was a cis woman doing that, but, you know, eh... Look where I ended.

Maybe it is normal, who knows! But, my experience definitely isn't going to prove that statement.

Either way, that's not that important right now. Whatever makes you feel comfortable at this moment in time, is. There is no shame in exploring your gender, and there is none in taking forever to figure it out.
Not an issue. Just something you'll probably want to explore 🙂
r/egg_irl \- Congratulations! It's a boy!

In serious though, um, no it's not really normal, at least as far as I'm able to understand how cis people work (can't full because, uh, I'm trans, so have to guess) but turns out, cis people don't think about their gender or have gender identity issues much at all. They might wonder ""Huh wonder what life like that would be like"" for a bit after seeing a show like Freaky Friday, or other movies where two people swap their minds for the body of another. They might consider it for like a short time, then go back about their life as a cis man/woman, and not think about it again.

For myself, I'd wonder what having a woman's body was like... every day. For literal decades, or any time I was being intimate. I would dress as women do, I was happier seeing myself presenting more feminine.

Go figure, that person in the mirror was who I really was, and was trying to be, but pretending not to see. Until, as the expression around these parts goes, ""My egg cracked"" and I accepted the reality for what it was.

This may not be true for you, maybe you're genderfluid, maybe some times you feel like a woman, others a masculine person, maybe in certain situations it's one or the other, maybe you're non-binary.

But generally speaking, cis people tend to not think about it much at all, and their content or even happy being men or women as they are and going about their lives.

But chances are, if you're questioning yourself more than once or twice a year, uh, yeah. You might be some flavor of the LGBTQ+ rainbow.
What even is normal? You are allowed to explore gender identity and sexuality as much as you want! It's good you're here, I wish you luck finding yourself. You might be a cis woman, you might not be. You might be trans binary or non-binary. The world of gender is broad! Have fun with it.
To have consistently, maybe less so. Highly recommend looking at this website to explore! https://genderdysphoria.fyi/

I didn’t consider myself uncomfortable as a cisgender woman either until I was far into my exploration of a masculine gender. It kind of takes experiencing the other side to realize what comfort is or not.
who's gonna tell him?
Could be a cis mascgirl (opposite of femboy) but it does sound like you might be trans in some way.

Based on this description i'd doubt that you're binary trans but i wouldn't rule it out. You're more likely to be some form of non-binary, possibly a multigender (bigender, pangender e.c.t.) but i'd look into others too. (Demigender, genderfluid, agender, cassgender)

The main difference between if you're trans or just gender non-conforming (mascgirl) is whether you enjoy existing as the opposite gender or if you simply enjoy presenting masculine (permanently or occasionally).

I'm not here to tell you what you are, only you can do that. But I can help with resources & information.

r/egg_irl is a very good sub to check out just in general, along with other trans meme subs.

https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en is a more descriptive & direct source, it's a good read for all. Confirmed trans, questioning, or even confirmed cis.

Best thing to do is just look into gender identities to see if any meld with how you feel.
It can absolutely be normal, but it also can be an indicator of being Trans man/non binary.
I kinda experienced something similar when I was younger and it turned out I’m gender fluid which does mean I’m trans like I think the best mindset is you don’t have to be only one all the time to be trans I don’t know if you are trans but questioning your gender and thinking about stuff never hurts and if you come to the conclusion that you are cis after that that is ok just do what feels right for you
I'm a male fantasizing about having a kitty lol
yeah, why not? 

it could be a gender identity thing, yeah. it could also just be a gender presentation thing. maybe you're genderfluid, maybe you're gender nonconforming, maybe you're just a lady who likes to feel a little like a dude sometimes. the state of humanity is one of pretty infinite possibilities. don't worry about it too much. embrace it!
Sometimes but I definitely prefer having a non-bearded fave or to lose my current voice.  But I relate. That I’m non-binary non cis.
Just knowing something about what you do in a sexual context doesn't really tell us anything concrete about your gender. It would probably be a good idea to examine your own gender a bit more to get in touch with yourself and your own identity. Maybe it's related to being trans, but maybe not.
You may likely be trans and that is completely ok if you are. If you are try not to be hard on yourself and do whatever you can to be you (almost endless possibilities)
Normal, maybe. Common, no. If you feel comfortable as you are then great. Otherwise, maybe some self reflection would help.
Honestly same, but I don’t know what it means for sure. Ive been thinking I could be gender fluid. Either way it’s probably not a very cis way to think.
Perhaps you are a butch woman who likes pegging.

But it sounds a lot more like you are a transguy.
Have you considered you may be outside the binary?
r/egg_irl
Short answer: yes. You can fantasize about anything really. If you are worried about how other people will feel, it's your own desires and that's its own validity. What is considered ""normal or not"" doesn't exist rather that phrase is used to mean ""What is commonly said, thought, and done around my community?"" And you have no idea the fantasies that others have around you. People are not as normal as you many think they are.

If these thoughts get to the point where they are greatly affecting your life in a way you don't want them to, then looking into why is not a bad idea. Is there a desire to be a man physically? Are you just curious about what it would be like? Or is it just a fantasy and your brain likes being in that headspace? It doesn't have to mean anything. There doesn't have to be a change in your life if you figure out your desires, but knowing why you have these thoughts might put your worries at ease and you might feel happier with them.
You can have body dysmophia and not be trans, also most trans people don't have body dysmorphia to begin with, Gender =/= Genitalia.
Might be gender stuff. Maybe bigender or gender fluid? It’s ok to explore
Could be him, her, they, or who knows. I'm sure the OP will figure it out soon."	vtxahl	trans	121	0.98	2022-07-08 00:22:08

"My cishet sister told me (trans masc) she knows what it's like being trans because she's ""an empath"""	"Okay for context, I'm bi trans masculine and 21, my sister is cishet and 26. So it's not like she's some 13 year old saying this shit on a whim cuz she heard it on TikTok. Basically, the other day i had a pretty heavy argument with my sister because I said that I don't have a good relationship with my parents because they constantly misgender me, express disapproval towards gay people and are just overall ignorant. And my sister kept insisting that i should just talk it out with them because it's bad to be at odds with your parents because they're family. She had actually cut them off some years ago cuz they disapproved of her boyfriend but she eventually talked it out with them and is in good terms. So she kept insisting that her methods would work just with me. And i told her that our parents disapproving of her boyfriend is completely different from them completely invalidating and attacking an identity that i was born with and cannot choose. We eventually started going back and forth and i said that the argument was going nowhere because she's cishet, she's an outsider to the LGBT+ community, so she can't understand what homophobia and transphobia feel like. And she seemed so offended, saying how she reads all about trans issues and knows the struggles. So i said that she can be as educated as she wants on transphobia but will never have to actually *live* it because she's cishet. And finally she snapped and said ""you know, I'm an empath. I can understand and feel transphobia. I know what it's like""

I'm sorry *what*???????? It took everything in my power not to lose my mind. She claims she's an ally and said has been ""nothing but supportive"" towards me (yet has never used my correct pronouns and says she's fine with gay people ""but not the ones that are too obvious and shove it in your face"") but then goes on to spew bullshit like this. Like, why is it that supposed cishet ""allies"" get so offended when you tell them they're not part of the queer community??? It's true. They can feel sympathetic towards us and even angry that trans/homophobia exists but they're never going to experience it first hand. It's been like 2 weeks since my sister said that and i have not spoken to her since. I'm trying to move on but I just cannot wrap my head around how a grown ass woman can believe she's an empath and can understand the trans experience. I almost wanted to tell her ""you've been watching too many TikToks"". We're immigrants and POC and she's a woman so she knows what racial discrimination and misogyny feel like but she's also married to a wealthy white cishet man, is a housewife by choice and she's cishet herself so she has a very limited experience with transphobia and homophobia. Especially the shit that low-income queer people have to go through, like medical, housing and employment discrimination rooted in trans/homophobia. 

Her and her husband are rather popular online and she likes to say how liberal and open-minded she is. If only her followers knew she actually says this kind of shit."	"Does she use healing crystals or whatever too?  

The whole “empath” thing sounds like the kind of person with too much time on their hands that wants to be special would say.

I’m so sorry about your sister.  You can never convince people that believe they hold some kind of mystic powers.
Omg sorry but yeah this really sounds like so much bullshit 😅😅😅 you're totally right, she can't know what it feels like until she actually experiences it. Her reaction should have been ""you're right, I cannot know what it feels, but I'm 100% with you and I want to do anything I can to support you"" and actually DO the things you would ask her to do, like gendering you correctly and using the right pronoun. The whole ""I'm an empath"" thing does sound like she's living in a tiktok bubble, or at the very least in a bubble that's not reality. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this! I had a fight with my PhD colleague recently too, she basically said that she genders people according to their genitals... And then she claims that she's supportive and all haha. So I feel you! Being a family member must be even more horrible though :( I hope your sister gets more open-minded at some point, hopefully soon! In the meantime, good luck and take care :)
If she was really empathic, she'd have known not to say something so invalidating
god i hate empaths

it's just another word for ""dickhead who projects their own emotions onto you and decides what you must feel"". not to mention how ableist they are to people who have lower levels of empathy
I  so sorry 😂😂 I thought all that empath stuff was a big joke, oh noooooo, that sucks so hard. Cishet people be like that sometimes, some stranger said to me she knew the pain of being gay because her cousin was gay, like, really? Anyways you don't owe your parents shit, if they keep treating you like that give them an ultimatum. Either start making an effort or stop seeing their kid. 

As for your sister, write down what you want to say to her. Have some rough drafts, be clear and concise. Use a lot of ""I am"" sentences. ""When you say.... I am.... Because...."" Be gentle, but be firm. 

Something that might help with someone who is cis but can ""feel"" being trans, write down what you feel when you're misgendered by a stranger, then by your parents. If you're not a writer it might take a few tries to get right, but write it all down. THEN, you ask her to tell you what SHE feels is the trans experience. Be patient, listen. Grit your teeth, whatever you have to do. When she gets it wrong, take out your writing, and either read it to her, or let her read it. If you need some help or examples, PM me, or look on this subreddit some more, maybe make a post asking for more people to help you out (with their permission to use their words). If a trans person writes exactly how you feel, there's nothing wrong with using their words to try and reason with you sister. 

The reason you're writing everything down is so you don't get your words mixed up in the moment. It's to keep emotions down and things calm. For her case specifically, it's so you don't ""change your answer"" after she tries to prove she's an empath. 

Another thing, make this a sit down, make sure she knows you want to talk to her about things and that it really hurt you when she said that. This shouldn't be a surprise thrown at her, it should be an invitation to talk. Make it a lunch or dinner and talk afterwards (afterwards. You don't want to talk when you're hungry, the conversation could go long, if it's messy you don't want to eat with a sour stomach, that kind of stuff) as a side note, you might not want to mention it's about the trans thing because she could ""do her research"" and copy a trans person's words and read them verbatim. Just say you want to have a heart to heart.

Cis people do this thing where they mention how hard it is for THEM that YOU'RE trans, so have a (calm) response prepared. Again, write it down. You don't have to read off your writings like a script. Use them as reference, like if you find yourself getting upset or frustrated, refer back to them. 

Another tidbit of advice is, if possible, to have a third party. When doing some grout work with a relationship, it can be helpful to have a type of moderator. A neutral party that both of you know, I wouldn't use her boyfriend since he'll likely be unable to be impartial. Their job is to keep things at an even pace, emotions calm, and call out unreasonable bullshit. You might not want a third party. And that's fine too. It's just something I've used before that helps. 

There's a few ways this can go, best case scenario she sees how wrong she's been etc etc. She might need time to think on it, that's probably the most neutral outcome, and of course there's always a chance she's going to make it all about her and try to flip the table on you and make you feel guilty. I have never had that happen to me when I have done one of these sit downs. Sometimes the person will start to do that, but usually with enough talking it calms down.

I feel it's worth mentioning I'm trans masc too, if that helps(?) But in short, write down what you want to say. Keep things calm. Even if she starts yelling, keep it cool. PM me if you want, and good luck. Sorry I wrote so much 😳
I'm so sorry to hear this and obviously, I completely agree with you. Your sister's reaction was a classic stereotype - someone who is transphobic and homophobic but says otherwise. If she was a true empath she would have to acknowledge this somehow, a lot of people in our community have experienced it.

You mentioned she and her husband are popular on social media. If you speak to her about this again you might want to ask her if she would post what she said to you online.

I wish you the best and lots of love.
lol literal irl meme
Your sister is an attention seeking genetic defect
This made me laugh so hard.

Then I read the article content and my mirth disappeared. The only way I could think would be via an example. Take a skill that you know how to do, ask her to read up about it until she is confident she can do it well, then take her to go and do it with you. Explain to her after she fails to do it as well as you that experience is important. You can feel empathy for others and attempt to understand their struggles, but unless you experience it specifically you don't really understand. It is the same with learning a skill you can read all you want but you'll never be any good until you practice.

A less intensive way to do this would be to ask her to do a backflip. When she says she cant, aske her why, she understands how to do one, so why can't she do it?
I literally hate bringing this up because it sounds so pretentious, but my psychiatrist has told me I'm an empath, and for me at least, when say I see someone crying, I begin crying too. I am good at putting myself in others positions and somewhat understanding how they are feeling. Obviously though, something like dysphoria I imagine is very hard to understand for people who don't experience it, but I do wanna say that maybe she can imagine the general feeling of not being comfortable with certain aspects/features of yourself because of your gender, and get a general feeling of sadness. 

But like, honestly, I know how fucking invalidating it must feel for a cishet person to tell you they know how you feel, after everything you've gone through. If she actually could feel empathy on a higher level, she would've understood how you would feel when she said something like that, and would apologize, or just not say it in the first place.

I've seen a spike in the amount of use the word empath gets recently, especially on tik tok, so I assume a lot of people are just assuming they are an empath because they have the ability to feel empathy, which obviously isn't true, it's just people who can especially relate to and feel others feelings, despite them not experiencing it themselves.
Lol what, that's not how any of this works. That's not empathy, that's pretentious BS.
The irony is that she said to me ""you're not that special"" when i told her that some experience are unique to queer people.....
Please don't generalize an entire group of people, I would hope at least people in this community people would be more accepting, but I guess not, bigotry lies everywhere. 

I definitely understand the notion of hating people who act like they know all your problems and can feel them exactly how you do, because that's literally impossible. Extreme empathy will never reach the level of personal experience, so people who act like they can do that are assholes.

Also, saying empaths are ableist to people who have a harder time feeling empathy is like saying people who aren't physically impaired are ableist to those who are, just for existing."	s6g5ak	trans	110	0.98	2022-01-17 21:58:08
Would it be fun to organize a girls night with my girl friends for my trans (mtf) sister's birthday?	"First off, I hope this isn't the wrong place to post this. I'm trying to be supportive for my sister but I don't know any other trans people to bounce my ideas off of so Im hoping you guys could be of help.

A little backstory, my sister came out as trans quite a while ago. The dynamic in my family is that we only speak about the good things in our lives, and when things are not that great or are difficult, we keep them for ourselves. So, even though she has come out, everyone in my family has kind of ignored it and still refers to her by her boy name and as he/him.

A while ago I asked her (through texts) if she would like me to call her by her chosen name and use female pronouns. She said that she would like that, just not around our family, especially our brother. Since I don't see her a lot outside of family gatherings (we aren't really that close), I haven't done so yet in real life, but I have when texting her.

I've been thinking about this situation and I can imagine that it is hard for her, so I want to help her with finding her true identity and hopefully being accepted by our family one day. 

So I thought of an activity that might be fun, as a birthday present or something. I am female myself and have a lot of female friends. If my friends would be into it, I could organize a girls night, with things like some kind of makeover, some games, or other ""girly"" activities. Just an evening in which she can feel like one of the girls.

Do you think that this would be a good idea? Would you be into this if a sibling suggested it, even if you aren't that close with them or know any of their girl friends? And if you would be into it, do you have any fun suggestions for activities to do?

Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated, so thanks in advance to anyone responding :)"	"Yeah, that sounds like it'd be really special for her. Like anything to make her feel like one of the girls is awesome!
Absolutely! If one of my friends said that they wanted me to come along for a girls night out I would say yes in a heartbeat
Yes, that would be a great idea. She will know without a doubt that you are supporting her, and if your friends are supportive as well, that will be a good boost to your sisters morale!
itd probably be a great experience for her! sometimes early on in transition, a lot of trans women will feel incredibly dysphoric when they see themselves with dresses and makeup, but i think in a scenario where shes Just One Of The Girls, itd be an amazing experience.
It sounds like a fun idea, one I wish could have happened to me.

But remember to ask your sister first m'kay. Let her tell you what she thinks first. Sometimes even though we want things, being with girls, especially when you're just a recently out transfem, can be kind of intimidating. So make sure she knows about it first and she knows it'll be a safe space.
Bless you for supporting your new sister.  My suggestion is this, ask.  Don't necessarily do it as a surprise. Your new sister made a big decision to be happy. But, clearly they also are trying to respect the feelings of family and friends around them. Trying not to stir up trouble. Also, they seem a bit shy and tentative with the clues you have given. My guess is they would love your suggestion but also be a bit scared as a lot of this is new to them.  Only they know if theY will be comfortable doing a girls night. I have a few other suggestions on how you can show support. Let her know you support her with words. Find out what she REALLY wants for gifts for birthdays and holidays but may be to scared to ask from less accepting family or friends.  She might be telling mom and dad she wants is a fishing pole but secretly dying every time she passes a certain silver bracelet. If she seems shy to the whole girls night out due to numbers try taking her out just by yourself at first.  Try and put yourself in her place. Your new to being a girl? What you you need to learn and know. How can you help her learn?  You may especially be helpful during transition if she hormonal changes offer to be her guide or just listen. She isn't going to know what hit her first time hormonal blues show up as a female. She is going to want to know things like do you try and hide your feelings? The loneliest part of transition for me was I had to learn everything myself, hopefully with a caring sister like yourself your new sister doesn't.
Maybe ask her first, I know it will ruin the surprise. If my sister did this to me, I wouldn't be able to do anything, I would cry, partially form panic and partially from being too emotional about all this. Make sure she would like that, because it could be uncomfortable for her to show herself to many people. If she isn't out publicly this could be uncomfortable for her. I would panic, personally. I don't want to discourage you, but just keep in mind that she might react differently. I (myself) and I position in which I am wouldn't want that. It might turn out really good, and she will love it and it might reinforce her confidence and make her feel better, but keep in mind that she might not like it.
I'm a 33yo woman and a friend and I organize these nights every month so I can ""catch up"". We usually describe them as 'food, wine, icecream, chickflicks and regrets in the morning'. They're awesome, and I _finally_ know about some of those romantic movies they all talked about before I transitioned.

But yeah, as others suggested, ask her if she would like this.
Absolutely."	u066yq	trans	115	0.95	2022-04-10 00:32:59
Reddit's Policy Update on Gender Identity and Advertising	"[Some of you may already be aware that Reddit has changed it's policy on self-diagnosed gender identity and advertising](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12boszd/policy_update_on_gender_identity_and_ads/), but either way we figured it may be worth giving some help regarding this change in general.

ftm + lesbian relationships	"(please only reply to this if you are trans or a lesbian, those are the only opinions i care about with this) 

hello im a 17 year old trans man and recently i’ve seen a lot of discourse around this. i have seen a lot of people saying that lesbian and ftm pairings within relationships are completely valid and don’t invalidate either identity. a couple of years ago i dated a girl who i was under the impression of being bi, she knew i was trans the whole relationship, i later found out she was telling other people she was a lesbian throughout the relationship which caused me a lot of dysphoria. i have always seen lesbians as being non men who are attracted to non men so i’m not sure where dating trans men fits into this unless you don’t see them as men. i really want to understand this more so i’d love to know the opinions of any other trans people or lesbians."	"(Ftm here) I feel like that would be the same as saying a gay guy dates cis men but also dates trans women. It just doesn't make any sense. Trans women are real women and Trans men are real men. It makes no sense to say you only love women and then date a man :/
I’m 25, ftm, and my wife (up until a few months ago when I came out) identified as lesbian. We’ve been together 6 years, married for 1. I know my wife sees me as a real man, and it’ll get easier for her to do so as I medically transition. I think when it comes to dating, lesbians will not typically want to date trans men, and that’s fine! But when you’ve been with someone for a longer period of time, it becomes less about sexuality and more about who the person is at their core. My wife and I weren’t going to throw away 6 years because of my identity. There’s nuance to this and it’s important to remember that. My wife now just identifies as queer and she’s okay with that. Sexuality is fluid and I feel like sometimes the trans community chooses to ignore that.
This makes no sense. If your a man, trans or cis, you wouldn't be dating a lesbian. Lesbians aren't attracted to men, if they are attracted to you then they don't see you as a man.

As a trans woman I would never date a gay man. Because any gay man are attracted to men, which I am not. The things they would be attracted to in me would be the things I hate about myself. Things that I will change given the opportunity. Hardly a good foundation for a relationship!
I definitely see that as invalidating, I know there are some lesbians who will date people of any gender but still identify as lesbian and that's valid, but your ex was being inconsiderate and should have something more like ""lesbian in a queer relationship "" idk I'm transfemme and if i'm missing some more nuance lmk
i'm transmasc, lesbian. 

I feel like your ex was definitely wrong for having you in that situation. Your definition of what you think a lesbian in aligns with mine. 

From the fact that she was telling people that she was a lesbian despite being with you, I'm assuming that maybe she just likes feeling like ""other"" or telling people she doesn't date men. (That's probably a stretch but that's how I feel)
[deleted]
trans men are men, and as a lesbian, I dont want to date a man. If the person is trans-masc but doesn't identify as a man, then its different, but trans men are men! I had this issue with my ex in the past where they identified as a lesbian but was still romantically talking to a trans man, which is fucked up
This is extremely invalidating. As a lesbian it is always nmlnm so if she was considering you to be nm then she is the problem, and you have a right to feel invalidated.
>i have always seen lesbians as being non men who are attracted to non men

you're exactly right. if you're a man, and she's attracted to you, she's not a lesbian. likewise, if you're a man and are attracted to women, that's straight
Definitely invalidating. You aren’t a woman, you’re a man. And a woman dating a man isn’t a lesbian relationship, it’s a straight one.
Was she telling people that she was IN a lesbian relationship or that she IS a lesbian?

Either way, the fact that she never mentioned any of this to you and that you had to find out from other people is a red flag imo, especially when she called herself bi prior to the relationship but switched to lesbian after from what I understand.

I generally feel like that is an important thing to communicate precisely because of the dysphoria it can induce, and she _should_ have known and respected you enough to at least think through what she was saying and ask you about it first.

For context, my partner is NB trans-masc, uses he/him and they/them. We're both ace. We've talked about me identifying as lesbian and he's totally cool with it, whereas he identifies as bi. If he wasn't cool with it, I would just identify as bi too.

It seems so trivial to cis people (and, surprisingly, some trans people too) but it's important that they respect us for who we are, not who they think we are or want us to be.
if you ask me, its a matter of what labels make people uncomfortable. transmasc lesbians exist, but its a bit more controversial when trans *men* come into play. regardless, your gf should have talked to you about what labels made you feel comfortable before going around saying shes a lesbian.
MtF here, I would say that would be very invalidating and not at all what the relationship is. I am in a lesbian relationship, although I am AMAB and still in the early stages of transitioning, my cis girlfriend always refers to me as a woman and pushes the point across that she is a lesbian. If she had considered our relationship to be straight, it would be similar to being considered lesbian if I was AFAB but identifying as Trans masc.
I think it depends on the situation. Historically, trans men and lesbians have been squeezed into the same corner of society based on assumptions that we're all ""defective women."" It's no surprise to me that there's still some affinity between our communities, and some lesbians might be comfortable dating trans men and vice versa. It's of course possible for it to be invalidating, but I don't think that's always the case. 

Imo, other people's personal relationships should not be up for public debate.
I am a pansexual, but yes, for me that is a straight relationship, not a lesbian one, I could never consider it as such because, oh lord, how many times did I say this men are men-trans, cis, doesn't matter.
as a trans person if you say you’re a lesbian and date a trans guy that is misgendering and pretty fucking shitty
with this situation, i think my good friend ""flipping the roles to help people better understand"" can take this one.

so, you think it's ok for a lesbian to be attracted to a trans man (despite him being a man, and the whole point of being a lesbian is NOT being attracted to men).

now let's switch it up a bit. would you also be ok with a gay man being attracted to a trans woman? no? then maybe a lesbian being attracted to a trans guy isn't so great after all.
Ftm guy and tho I'm gay I have had that with straight men. It's transphobic usually . Or maybe they are scared to accept they are into men? Regardless. Its usually toxic. When I've had it happen, they really saw me as a masculine girl instead of a guy.
My personal opinion... Trans men can't be included as lesbians... Trans mascs can. I.e if you are a non-binary person leaning slightly masc, then you're a non man, but still masc, and lesbian is non men loving non men but if you're a binary trans man then no not lesbian because men do not fall into the category of lesbian. Masculine non men of course, but not men.
i started dating my friend, who's a lesbian, before i realized i was trans. we kept dating during/after my transition and only recently broke up for unrelated reasons. i never felt invalidated by her being a lesbian, she respects my gender and called me her boyfriend and everything. we just knew i was her exception, sexual orientation isn't black and white yk. to be fair i'm nonbinary tho, but i present very masculine most of the time, and i'd consider myself a guy but not a man if that makes sense. i think if i was a binary guy the experience would have been essentially the same tho
A rose by any other name is just as sweet. 

Is she attracted to you and does she love you? Are you attracted to her and do you love her?

On some level the labels cease to matter at all. You gotta figure out which level that is for you.
She's either bi or a chaser
MTF here, that sucks and I’m sorry to here. My gf considers us lesbian which is validating. If she won’t accept your identity. That’s something you need to bring up to her.
If you are a man and she is a lesbian she is invalidating your gender. I would also feel the way you are feeling.
Mtf here! I would definitely feel like it was a sign that my partner didn’t view me as the person I am. Nothing throws me off more from engaging with someone that’s hitting on me…than seeing their sexuality is listed as gay…complete turn off and invalidating to me as a woman.
Trans femme lesbian here.

Sexuality is complicated enough without thinking about how trans people fit into the equation, let alone when going outside the binary or transitioning.

People are almost never attracted to just one gender, even if they do identify as straight/gay/lesbian. It’s totally valid for a lesbian to date a man, even a cis man, if thats who they happen to be attracted to at that point. It doesn’t invalidate anyone’s identity.

The only issue that I can see then is that your SOs identity and communication about it is causing you dysphoria, which is also very valid. I would have a talk with them, non comfrontationally, and just say “I want you to identify how you want and express it freely, but when you do it can make me feel dysphoric” and just have an open and kind conversation about it to see if there’s a compromise you can come to.
I think it's fine just as long as the lesbian doesn't refuse to address the trans man as male. As a transfem, I'd probably still date a gay man so long as he didn't call me a boy. I think it's ultimately down to a matter of preference, whether or not you feel your identity is being challenged. If you have no qualms with it, then by all means, feel free to date.
this story has made me understand it more!! i’m glad that your marriage has been able to stay strong as i know a lot of relationships don’t survive when someone comes out as trans. there is nuisance but in this i was referring to lesbians getting with trans men who are already out and i hadn’t really thought about the concept of people coming out whilst in a relationship.
This is such a sweet story. It’s how it should be in a perfect world. You’re right about who someone is at their core is the most important part. Your wife chose you over a label, that’s gotta feel good.

I kind is feel the people who cling to labels even after discovering they may no longer fit the definition maybe have a bit of an identity crisis. I know a lot of us have social circles that almost entirely hinges on having that label, and I will always feel that’s not necessarily a good thing.
Exactly! However, it may be the case that she had always been a lesbian and never realised that she is not. I think it can go two ways. She either has to embrace that she is attracted to men as well as woman and she is in fact bi. Or, she is not attracted to men and is therefore attracted to you for the wrong reasons. Or perhaps she is attracted to men but has some kind of fear for genitals. Anyways, it seems like a communication problem and perhaps it is time for having a good discussion about this together.
yeah i mean i think she didn’t view me as a guy because she’s only dated girls since we broke up which was over 2 years ago
i am definitely very much binary trans
she was saying she is a lesbian i believe. that relationship wasn’t very good anyway 

she didn’t understand my dysphoria and pressured me into some intimate things i wasn’t really comfortable with which wasn’t great.
i’m definitely completely binary trans and i’ve always been like that. never ever felt comfortable with they/them.
so basically it was a validating experience for me overall because my partner was very supportive of trans ppl and respected my gender, others might not be depending on who the lesbian partner is as a person
Ah, yeah lesbians getting with trans men who are out is not a lesbian relationship. No nuance there lol. 

I’m learning as I go! When you find your person, you just gotta get through the hard shit. Losing her seems more painful than anything else in the world and I know she feels the same!
So your ex definitely didn't see you as a man, whether she realized this or not it's the truth. Any lesbian who dates trans men is no better than a cishet girl who will date trans girls or a cishet guy who would date trans guys. Whether conscious of it or not, they're being transphobic
that’s so sweet!! i am a bit of a hopeless romantic so i long to find “the one” one day despite not having much luck so far in all of my relationships.
I agree with you entirely. Im 21 mtf in a lesbian relationship now. We've been together for 3 years, 2.5 of them before I cracked. She still sees herself as straight, which is weird and invalidating at times but overall we're happy. Theres nuance to that. Starting with the knowledge is just shitty tho. Either you don't see them as a man (ew) or you're not as lesbian as you think lmao.

Side note, I dont think my gfs as straight as she thinks she is lol. She really likes my legs, which are and have always been the most feminine part of me. Convo the other night went kinda like this:

Me: So you like my legs?
Her: Yeah.
Me: Like in a girl way?
Her:...uh no.
Me: So they look like guys legs? 😞
Her: Oh no, no.
Me: They look like girls legs then?
Her: Oh yes, absolutely. Not like a guy at all.
Me: And they turn you on?
Her: Mhm 😁
Me: Thats not very straight, yknow.
Her:... look, I'm a straight woman...

Uh huh, yeah, I'm sure you are, honey 😆 

I guess she could just like feminine men but she's been very adamant that I'm starting to not look like a feminine man and just like a girl. And she definitely sees me as one. I think it might just be a weird adjustment for her which is totally understandable. Sexuality is weird 🤷
You’ll find someone! I had to go through a lot with toxic relationships. I’m also a huge hopeless romantic…don’t let anyone take that from you. You have to go through some shit to find out what you DONT want, and then, when you don’t even expect it, you’ll find your person.
I think after a while many relationships become romantically powered, where as at the beginning of many relationships they are sexually driven. That is to say over time sexual attraction becomes driven by romantic attraction. 

I believe it’s entirely possible that you GF could still be straight, and that you could be the only woman she will ever find attractive.

Why do we believe cis kids when they tell us their gender identity, but not trans kids?		"“Children shouldn’t transition because they will change their mind but also they shouldn’t transition because their gender identity is fixed lmao we just hate trans people”
also ffs, the non reversible part comes quite a bit later on this path, and careful observation during the initial phase would probably reveal whether this is the right thing to do or not. Why are these people so often uneducated when it comes to the things they're writing about??
Feels weird champ I knew I wanted to be a girl at age 8 @.@
Because they're bigots. They're not interested in reported the truth, they're interested in reporting their own hatred of trans people.

I can't transition because my mother is in denial about my identity	"For about 4 years I have had the feeling that I wasn't in the right direction I should say for identity and that I was being my true self and until recently I wasn't aware that I was transgender mtf. I am currently 15 and living with my mother seeing as how my parents have divorced when I was younger. My father is extremely transphobic and won't even consider changing his opinions about my identity, but my mother is very progressive and respects pronouns, gender identity, and sexualities. However she is in denial about my own identity. I've had multiple conversations with her over the past few months about me needing to transition for the sake of my mental health. Seeing as how 9 months ago I had been admitted into a psychological hospital and diagnosed with gender dysphoria and generalized anxiety disorder, but anytime I try to convince her to let me start hrt she'll say ""Well you've been wrong in the past and I know you, you're my son. If you were trans I'd be able to tell.""

It hurts so much to have to live like this and I don't have an answer to this issue. Please if anyone has a possible solution tell me it would mean the world to me see as how I'm struggling once again with my depression and have been having severe panic attacks over this."

""Really? How so? Please enlighten me on how you know I'm cis. Describe what WOULD make you know that I'm trans?""
Fifteen. Wait.

Some parents assume they own their kids.
it really sucks to have a parent outright deny you when you're presenting honestly. a good quote you might get her with is ""when someone tells/shows you who they are, believe them."" idk family is hard. you're valid, and you don't deserve to be invalidated by the person who's supposed to support you.
I would not suggest challenging your mom to say *how* she'd be able to tell, because that challenge already implies that you agree she can do this, but just don't understand her techniques.

I don't think you *do* agree that she can do that, so it's best not to frame the issue in a way that already puts points on her side of the court.

IMO, a better take would be to simply state that she can't in fact do that.

Maybe try something like this. It's a bit of a rant, but maybe she needs to hear it:

You could tell? No, Mom, you couldn't. You don't live inside my head. You don't know what it's like to be me. You don't know what it's like to feel this way, and I'm sorry but it's incredibly offensive and arrogant for you to suggest that you know how I feel better than I do. They're *my* feelings. *I'm* the one who feels them, not you. And where do you think my anxiety problems *come* from, Mom? It wasn't from you and Dad splitting up. I mean, that wasn't great, but it didn't cause my anxiety. I have felt this way *forever*, and the stress of it is what's giving me anxiety and panic attacks. I get that now. That's what gender dysphoria *is*, Mom. You know, the thing *I was diagnosed with*? It's this constant stress of having to fit your square peg into a round hole just to keep everybody *else* happy. When do I get to be happy, Mom? Isn't fifteen years of suffering enough? Or must I keep suffering, keep pretending, just so nobody else has to change how they see me? I know my identity. I know who I am. I'm *telling* you who I am, and I'm asking for help.

And yeah, I've been wrong before. Of course I have. You have too. We're only human. But seriously, throwing 'I've been wrong in the past' in my face is basically the same as saying you would only believe what I'm telling you if I had somehow managed to go fifteen years without ever making a mistake. And I'm sorry, but holding me to a literally inhuman standard *just* to get you to believe what I am telling you about my own feelings, that's pretty messed up, Mom. Everybody makes mistakes. That's just life. That's how we learn. That's how we know more today than we did yesterday. Well, today I know more about *me* than I did yesterday. So I'm telling you, because don't you *want* me to tell you about the important things in my life? Or you can just flatly refuse to even consider it and signal to me that you're not someone I *can* talk to.

That's the deal mom. I'm trans, I'm your daughter, and I need help. But because I'm fifteen the law says I need your permission to get that help. So what's it going to be? Are you going to be a mom and *help me*? Or are you going to bury your head in the sand and pretend like none of this is happening and ignore my pain for the next three years until I'm 18 and don't need your permission anymore? I can't make that choice for you, Mom. All I can tell you is that only one of those choices gives you a happy child, but either of those choices, for the better or for the worse, I will remember forever. I will always remember whether you came through for me, or whether you turned your back on my suffering.
It’s too bad there is not somewhere else you could live, such as a friend or otter family member. That’s one reason my nephew is with me so often.
Hang in there! It’s a terrible situation, but you will get to a point where YOU get to make the major decisions in your life.
Maybe she thinks you will cause yourself irreversiable damage and that you will regret yourself when you exit your teenage years. 

This almost never happends though. 99.9% of all teenagers that transtition get better. Tell this to your mother
When you are in contact with a therapist ask them to Talk to your mom about it. If you dont then call a LGBTQ or trans support Hotline and explain everything to them. They can talk to your mom as Well.
Not OP, but my parents said the same thing.

Accordingto them, I have ""male qualities"" that are somehow impossible to explain yet totally negate my ability to be transfem.

🤷‍♀️
I don't think it's an ownership thing, my mom has always let me be independent and only claims ""ownership"" in a the legal sense seeing as how she is my legal guardian.
I'll be sure have a talk with her about that sometime in the next week or the following week.
This made me teary eyed reading it, you don't even know my how my thinking process works, but this it too accurate thank you, I will use these points in the future with my mom. I plan on talking to her in the next week because of scheduling. Even then im afraid of confrontations so I may chicken out. If that happens I'll be sure to come back to this thread and recoup in a way.
I unfortunately can't go anywhere else to stay for a prolonged amount of time. The best I can do is go to my friends house or have my partner comeover to my house and hangout with them.
To your mum: ""Ooh okay! Yeah I see those qualities in you dad. Thank you for alerting me to those qualities! How cool is it that you and I share the same gender as men?""

And simply refuse to back down, pretending that you understand those qualities seeing as you have them.
If it's too hard to say it--and wow do I get that--it's ok to type it up in your own words (or steal mine. They're free) and print it out. Then you can just tell her ""this is too hard to just say so I wrote it down"" and hand it to her.
Will do if it has to come down to that. Thank you seriously, I'm glad this community exists."	vi0jmp	trans	101	0.98	2022-06-22 08:48:50
Talking here because I can’t talk about it anywhere else.	Hello, I’m an 18yo Hispanic male living in a very conservative house and I think I’m trans, for as long as I can remember, I’ve been struggling with my gender identity. I remember when I was 9 years old, I used to lock myself in my parents room just to try on my mothers clothes because they just felt amazing and comfortable. Shortly after that I started using eyeliner but I was caught and beaten so I never wore feminine clothing after that.Until high school.It got worse to the point where every time I was alone I wore women’s clothes.Then this year I started college and I started buying womens clothes for myself and hiding them. I bought tops and bras and panties because they felt good, they felt right. But I always regretted feeling that way. Now every night I pray to Whatever God is out there to please turn me into a woman because I don’t like being a man. I just want someone to talk to.	"Oh honey, as someone who also comes from a transphobic Hispanic household I get how hard it is. I send you a lot of love and positive vibes, and if you need someone to talk to, you can DM me.
This sounds really difficult. Sending lots of love 💕
Damn. I'm Mexican and my family is old-school. I understand. I'm pansexual and I haven't told them yet. My partner is the only one that really knows. We may not know each other but I can see what you are going through. I don't ever mind lending an ear. I'm down to talk. I wish you the best and good luck.
Hey! Hispanic trans woman here. Same exact upbringing here, except I just grabbed my sisters clothes/dolls etc.  My dad did everything to prevent me from being a woman, and it started when I was a child. I got my ass beat many times, but at around 15 I stopped giving a fuck and did what I wanted. By the time I was your age I was already taking hormones and tbh, no major changes happened until 2-3 years. They would’ve never known if I didn’t tell them. Which I did, dad hated it but I’m 28 now and from the time I was 23 he has accepted me as his daughter. He calls me his baby girl, his diamond, he’s so sweet and our relationship is better than it ever was. He’s a construction worker, in his early 50s, beer drinking macho man. There’s hope!
Try the discord of this subreddit very chill place :)
I'm sorry that you are having such a hard time sis. I believe things will get better as you get older and have more freedom from your parents. 

You are getting started and there is no rush, be who want to be when you can safely, and don't feel guilty!! And in the meantime, maybe you cab try to educated your parents a little at a time, so when you decide if you want to come out to them they may be more ready.
[deleted]
Hey DM me if you want to chat.  I went through this same thing and it was not easy, I lost contact with my family for a year due to not supportive over time my mom has come to accept me and even buy me clothes but I know how much family means in Hispanic heritage so losing mine when I first came out hurt.  I also did the same thing trying on my mom clothes, I got my nails painted by my cousin and that got me in trouble so I repressed it.  But yeah feel free to DM I’d be happy to chat
Hi sis! As a transfemme enby who is Hispanic and in a similar situation as you are now, you have my condolences and my support. When I was younger, I was verbally abused for wearing my mom's clothes, and yet it felt right, and I felt sad when I couldn't get clothes like that for myself.

I'm open to DMs if you ever need to vent or talk about anything! <3
Thank you! It has been tough.I’ve wanted to take hrt but that is impossible since I know what my parents will do
Thank you so much!
Thank you!
I do want to take hormones but I dont have the money to do it.I have insurance but I’m scared of what’s going to happen when my parents find out.They might disown me.
Thank you, but I don’t know how to do that without getting suspicious stares.
What happened after? Did you come out?
That’s what I’m worried about, abandoning me and  not supporting me.
Thank you
Well you are 18, so you don’t need legal permission from parents anymore. If I may ask, do you go to or planning to go to college? Like are you planning on living with your family much longer?
You need to find a local LGBT center.  They can help you, I got my hormones for free this way, for YEARS. Doesn’t matter what they will say, do, or think. It’s your life, you’re the one that has to live in that body for another 60 or more years.
I am in college right now but since it’s close I don’t need to live on campus.
I’ll look into that
Ok gotcha, well you could always try doing it in secret, though of course that is a decision for you to analyze and to feel comfortable with. 

Something you could also do, is simply take Testosterone blockers to avoid any further masculinization while waiting to eventually take estrogen. There is no physical change to worry about getting caught.
Good luck OP♥️"	t1d78n	trans	104	0.98	2022-02-25 20:09:34
My Mom refuses to get me gender-reaffirming medication i.e Estrogen	"My parents have shown nothing but love and support for me since the two years I’ve been out and open to them. They have made my life as a Trans-Girl as comfortable and lovely as humanly possible, are utterly supportive of my chosen Gender-identity.  I have been a  part of a select few of Trans People whose parents are genuinely invested and devoted to affirming my gender.

However my mother is quite adamant that i should abstain from utilizing gender-affirming medication thus rendering my dreams of transitioning non-existent. I repeatedly relay to them that i refuse to transition and such however it is all a front. Gender Dysphoria is tearing me apart,  i see Trans-women in media successfully transitioning and seeing the woman that they were meant to be in the mirror. 

What should i do? I’m a minor and i don’t know how long i can keep up the façade of not wanting to medically transition.

P.S my Aunt from Europe who is queer herself, is paying us a visit soon. She’s an enlightened and progressive woman who is a proud member of our community, she may aid me in convincing my mother to enable me getting HRT."	"You may have to educate them on the importance of HRT and it's many wonderful benefits.
This website might help, see if you can get them to look through it. It explains so much and is so beneficial ✨

https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en

https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/second-puberty-fem

Hope this helps!
Tell them how you feel. If they’ve been supportive so far I hope they’ll listen. You don’t _want_ HRT, you **NEED** HRT.
The sooner you start, the better for your body and your mind. Girlmoding, no deadnames and such are nice and gender affirming things, but what you basically need is to have the right hormones in your body. You will basically live the puberty you were meant to have thanks to HRT. Explain how much dysphoria it causes you and how much every day you wait is a pain for you.
Try getting blockers. 

Tell your parents:
They’re completely reversible, and will just delay puberty. As soon as you’re off them, puberty will start again.
it is a good idea to talk to your aunt, see if she could help you out.  


Also try explain to your mother the real physical and emotional pain that is going through an unwanted puberty, and ask her what is she worrying about so much, may be from there you can made her realize that is not a bad or dangerous thing   


good luck :3
Parents listen to professionals. Look up a doctor in your area who specializes in this and have them call and schedule a meeting with your parents.
Tell your parents if they want a grandchild they can either accept you on HRT as an adopted parent, or not at all.
Actually tell your mother this-

Ask her how it would feel if she got all of her estrogen stripped from her, and was forced to take testosterone for the rest of her life

Tell her that's how you feel, you're a woman, and you want to be a woman physically, and tell her that you are a women with no estrogen and an increasing testosterone. Its a good Segway to elaborate on other points, because it starts with putting her into your shoes.
I’m a non-confrontational person so it’s gonna take a lot of guts but if it means living my authentic self then get that bread ig
Thank You sm <3 these comments are fueling my drive to educate my mother on how HRT is truly beneficial
misconceptions and prejudices are rampant where i come from, it may be quite difficult to shake those pre-conceived notions off of my mom but if it means her blessing to finally medical transition then so be it <3

Thank you so much btw :> i haven’t interacted in a community full of like-minded individuals in a while.
well we do have a Doctor in our family, he may know of  an endocrinologist <3
Don’t think of it as confronting, you’re confiding in them. Hopefully they’ll see that the best way to help you is by getting you HRT.
It's basically a second puberty, nothing to be scared of. Show how much you are sure of yourself and don't let them doubt. I think they will understand <3"	x2edah	trans	96	0.97	2022-08-31 14:00:06

Why TF do we need to spend hours justifying our gender identities?	"I swear, nobody ever goes up to a cis person and asks them ""why do you identify as \[insert gender here\]?""."	"You don't owe them shit.

And speaking for myself, I don't ""identify"" as a woman.

***I*** ***am a woman.***

Just a different variety.
I did that to kids in my school. Asking the ""Lets Go Brandon"" racist bigot boys/girls ""Why do you identify as a girl/boy?"" And one said ""shut up about this gender shit! Trans people are WEAK. Every boy would rather be a girl, they don't have to actually do it."" r/egg_irl
to be fair, no one has come up to me and asked why I identify as \[insert gender here\] either.
We don't need to justify our genders. If they demand to know why you identify as whatever you identify as, just say that's who I am and walk away. You don't owe anyone anything, especially bigots that are looking to just harrass you.
We shouldn’t, but *unfortunately* cause of ***some people…***
We don’t have to justify it. We don’t owe them an explanation.

EDIT: Pretty obvious typo. Haha
You dont need to spend hours justifying yourself.   


Just stop, if it bothers you. you dont owe anyone anything.
You dont need to.
If someone is arguing / asking you to justify your gender identity, they are never gonna be convinced and likely have contrary views. You are basically just wasting your time and counting down the timer until they say something mean and transphobic. I've learnt we can't change people's minds and there is no point trying.
Its all respect both ways.
YES literally most cis people have absolutely no answer beyond that's just what they were told they were.
i feel like people ask question of stuff they dont get so if someone ask you about your gender because the dont get and sometimes people just dont want to get it
The double standard is so irritating. My mom used to sit me down on the couch and berate me into coming up with some full-blown thesis on my gender just so she could attempt to 'disprove' every point.
Bc they think we’re freaks.
That is inspiring to me.
Thanks for saying it. Tired of who I am being something I need to explain. We don’t need to educated someone who has access to the internet and we don’t owe anyone anything. If they’re asking, they don’t know you and they don’t actually want to educate themselves they are just trying to turn it all into a political or religious debate about how what you’re doing is “wrong”
The egg is clear
ohh that’s a doll…🤭
Owe is a strong word.
We don’t owe anyone anything. Why should we? We’re not doing anything wrong.
No, we don't.
absolutely not.
How about no. lol
I'm confused as to why you got downvoted. No one is owed anything, period, and another replier mentioned that.
I'm guessing a ""don't"" was missing?

Am I really a trans woman?	"18yo MTF. Since last year, i've started to have more contect woth the trans community and begin questioning my genser identity. But then, when I talked about this topic with my parents they freaked out, i didnt expect this to happen because theyre pretry acceptive and i my best friend is trans. In tehir perspective, since i never showed any ""trans childhood signals"", i'm not really trans. So, i ask you, trans people of reddit, does it really matter if you dont confirm to your gender identity as a kid or teenager?"	"Lots of people don't figure it out when they're kids. Some people don't even figure their gender out until they're well into their adult lives. You're not any less trans for not showing early signs, that's just something cis people tend to cling onto because it's palatable.
The lack of childhood ""trans signals"" in the perception of other people is many times caused by the lack of safe space. I didn't have any signals, because every time I would have, I repressed it and/or kept it a secret and learned to not show any signs. Your parents obviously won't see any signs if all this time you have actively been hiding it from them.

Recently I came out to my best friend's boyfriend, who hasn't known me for long and he said that him and all his other friends who I've met a few times have been wondering what was up with me because all of my expressions seemed feminine. It was incredibly validating even if they just thought I was an effeminate gay man. It was the first time in my life when I came out and people said ""that makes a lot of sense"" instead of ""wtf I never saw that coming"" that my long time friends said. It felt amazing tbh

However all the people who have known me for a long time are completely oblivious to it because they are used to me being like this forever.

Edit: also, what is considered a ""trans signal"" is very very varied across people and how perceptive they are
I only transitioned in my 40s.
I never showed ""any signs"" and if you ask my mum, she would have never guessed.

That's because I didn't know being trans was a thing, didn't have the words or concepts to contextualise how I felt and so my gender feelings morphed into a bunch of other stuff.

I was socially anxious, aimless, often depressed, had body image issues, but until a couple of years ago, I would never have identified those things as trans things.

What matters is whether transition will make you happier and improve your quality of life.
If it does, if it feels right and if it allows you to live your best life, then it is right for you and yes, then you are some form of trans. There are no prerequisites to this.
Yep, totally fine.
Most likely u showed small sines as a kid but ur parents never noticed mine didn't until one year after I came out as trans as they started remembering ""red flags"" of me being trans that at the time they didn't think that much of it
But ur parents not thinking that ur trans doesn't make u any less valid
it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks as long as you feel you are trans. i’ve always felt that i wanted to be a girl ever since i can remember, but when i came out to my parents they thought the same thing. they don’t see what’s on the inside, only the outside. also gender is very fluid, even many cis girls don’t present as feminine (thinking of stereotypical tomboys), so why should trans girls have to be feminine as children to transition? i hope your parents come around, mine took a little while to accept me and are still adjusting
I personally barely showed any ""signs"" of being trans, well maybe that I really never did typical ""male"" things and that I imagined myself as a girl sometimes. But I doubt my mom would've ever guessed either.
Allow me to tell you the story of Caroline Farberger. Of course I won’t actually tell you but point is figured out she was trans at age 49, had no clue, and it was her wife that pointed out it happened. It is *never* too late to start showing signs and realize. There’s no set time you have to start showing signs. I fact you don’t have to show signs *at all*. You could one day randomly get up, try presenting as a woman that day, and realize that’s you. You’re still trans. There’s no right or wrong way to show signs, not show signs, or be trans in general. If you’re trans you’re trans and nobody can prove otherwise because you’re trans.

Tl;dr: only you can know if you’re trans. What signs you showed or didn’t show don’t matter *at all*. The only thing that matters is you.
You are a really trans woman .
I didn't figure it out until I was 19
I begin my transition in my 30's. I didn't know until my adulthood , what the hell is going on in my head. it's never too late. We aren't omniscient to know everything especially when we are kids.
it doesn’t matter. As a trans man i didn’t show any signs when i was younger either, but that doesn’t make me less trans. Every trans experience is unique, just because yours is different than others doesn’t make it less valid <33
I supresed these feelings when i was a kid becaue of rampant bullying and didnt fully crack until my 30's.  If you belive you are trans and feel like you are then you probobly are.

Cis people simply dont spend that much time thinking about it.
I went through phases where I wanted manly boyish stud but now that’s changed (and I mean actual manly boyish stuff not stuff that is just associated with masculinity for no reason) not everyone shows end all be all signs
I didn’t feel any dysphoria till 14 and even then I denied it so well that people didn’t expect it when I came out until I explained it for a good while.
Im younger than you but I feel like the reason I never showed any signs as a young kid is because I didn't have a safe space to do so. Parents often think they know everything about their kids but often theres a lot of that kids don't show and hide from their parents. I don't think your parents saying that and you not showing any signs makes you less trans :)
To add to the great replies, it's not like childbirth classes (or anything else) prepare parents to ""watch for the trans red flags(tm)"" if they even exist.
My parents were supportive, but also said that there were no signs when I was growing up.
   
That was a year and a half ago. Now we all agree that there were signs, we just didn't have the context to recognize them at the time.
Your parents have an idea of who you are…but honestly…my parents didn’t have a fucking clue who I was or paid much attention to how I acted tbh. There were plenty of signs. Have they ever heard of tomboys? Girls acting like boys. Still girls. It’s not uncommon to be trans. And live a trans experience growing up and “show no signs.”

My dad literally thought I was gay…because of how I acted growing up. Told him I was a girl…and he’s like you never showed any signs. 

He also completely rejected me buuut…I’m definitely trans despite my parents opinion of me.

You are not responsible for the mental image they have of you. You get to tell them exactly who you are and how you would like to live in this world.
How you behaved as a kid has nothing to do with whether you are or aren't trans. That is, past behaviors cannot determine your identity.

That said, I'd be shocked if you truly didn't show any signs, because [check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/va8e89/comment/ic26bq8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a similar post a while back.
Oof. I really feel this. 

When I was 8 I knew something was off, but I couldn't figure out what it was. This was 1989, people didnt talk about that stuff and I had literally no idea that trans people existed. I didn't know what to do with those feelings so I buried them. And also developed pretty bad anxiety and depression, like ya do when you repress stuff like this.

Fast forward to 35 years old, I was coming apart at the seams. A few years before that I had realized I didn't know what my gender was, but my girlfriend at the time was so unsupportive that I repressed it again, but finally I got to a place where I just couldn't deny it any more.

My parents had been super cool when I came out to them as gay,  but they took it really hard when I came out to them as trans. They got mad and said that they'd never once looked at me and thought I was ""acting like a man"", to which I asked ""What does that even mean? What would that have looked like?"" They didn't have an answer. We didn't talk for a month or so, but they did come around.

I think part of it for them was that they were so attached to the idea of me being this strong woman, and they couldn't comprehend that I had never actually been a woman despite having the physical features of one. They had this general idea of how my life was going to play out, and now I'd thrown everything up in the air. It can be hard for parents to let go of these ideas and expectations for their kid, even when the expectations are subtle. They worried I would become someone so different from myself that I wouldn't be the kid they raised anymore, and they also worried for my safety. None of this excuses their reaction, but it does explain it. 

They needed time, and resources, but they figured it out. 

I totally understand the imposter syndrome, I had it so bad. Is this really me? Am I making a giant mistake? But after 5 years of being on T, I can look in the mirror and finally see ME. I pick up my kid and know that I was meant to be his dad, not his mom.

I hope that given some time, your parents will be supportive. It's easy to doubt yourself, especially in the beginning, but deep down, you know the truth. Don't compromise - you deserve to feel comfortable in your body 💙
thanks for giving me support! i validate myself as a trans woman, but the stryggle ive been facing is to convince my parents that its something real, that i truly feel like a woman. they keep saying that never thought of me as a girl and that my friends are leading me to be transgender, bc im a people pleaser person, etc, lot of stuff that pisses me off
> That's because I didn't know being trans was a thing, didn't have the words or concepts to contextualise how I felt and so my gender feelings morphed into a bunch of other stuff.

Same. After I read genderdysphoria.fyi, I could identify dozens of things from 20+ years of dysphoria. Some of it was really eye-opening. And times when I unexpectedly experienced gender euphoria, but not understanding why it triggered a strong reaction in me (at the time).
Happy cake day Lucy. You have a lovely name 😉
This. Just this
Yeah, parents does that sometimes. Me, I haven't shown any signs before I came out to them, I hadn't figured out before 21, tho I had a lot of signs to myself since ~10. My parents have been shocked and had a hard time accepting it, but with time and explaination of my feelings to them, even my father (who was the less ok with it) ended up defending me to his family, using the correct name and gendering me correctely. It takes time, don't rush them, but make sure they think about it from your open perspective and not from their scared and defensive one.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know it's hard, but as long as they're not putting you in an unsafe environment I think it's best to keep being true to yourself. They'll either come around or they won't, but you can't decide that for other people. What you can and I believe will do is make it to a point where you're happy and fulfilled either way.
""they keep saying that (they) never thought of me as a girl""

No one knows the internal thoughts and feelings of another. They don't get to dictate your feelings especially if you've been conditioned to keep certain things hidden. 

They call you a people pleaser but fail to see how as a child the first people we want to please are our parents. We spend our entire lives slowly learning what makes them upset and avoid those things.
Right...?!
That's why I think education on these things is so, so important for going children.

I think my brother may be trans, should I talk to them about it?	"I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed here, I am in my mid twenties and live with my husband and my younger brother (18). I had custody of him since he was 17 and let him have the spare room and bathroom  in our apartment because my mother was very neglectful to him. He’s still in high school and is a good kid, I’m trying to support him until he graduates and can get on his feet. He has told me in the past that he is bisexual, and I’m very supportive of that. I myself am bi. He has told me before that his best friend is trans too which I’ve also shown support for. 

Anyways, I don’t ever go in his room unless I’m looking for something, which he knows and has never said he has a problem with it, since some of my stuff is still in there due to lack of space. I’ve also noticed that he takes our stuff sometimes without asking and doesn’t put it back, so I’ve had to go in there before looking for stuff. This morning when he was already at school I started having really bad allergies, and I couldn’t find the Benadryl anywhere so I decided to go check in his room to see if he had it. Didn’t see it when I glanced around so I peeked in his bathroom, and immediately noticed mascara on the counter, bras and bikinis and skirts hanging in the closet which is right by the shower.  I felt bad for even going in there at that point, I wasn’t trying to snoop and didn’t touch anything, just wanted some Benadryl.  I hurried out of there and feel like I violated his privacy and may have discovered something about him accidentally. I don’t think I’m going to say anything but I also want him to know that I support him and don’t want him to think he has to hide his identity from me. 

I apologize again, I have never faced a situation like this before and want to treat it delicately. Any advice is appreciated!"	"Don't try to crack an egg; build a nest.
I wouldn't try to force a conversation. Let them come out when they are ready to share, if that is what they end up doing. You can signal support through things like telling them you love and support them no matter what and letting them see you enjoying trans positive and trans inclusive media.
Nothing to add except that from what I can tell you must be an amazing sister. I can only imagine the effort it takes to hold custody over your sibling, especially at their age. The amount of thought you’ve put in shows how much you care, I’m honestly touched!
First thing first: pretend this never happened. Whether they are questioning and trying out thing, are a femboy or into drag, or are indeed a girl, if they didn't told you they are not ready yet and trying to force anything can only make things worse.

They know you're bi and are already out to you about it, they know you accept and support their trans friend, so they surely get already that they can safely come out to you if/when appropriate. 

Oh and yes: thank you for being the best sister they could have <3
Don't force anything on them or inquire on those things though I'd say maybe just showing that your supportive of trans ppl and just try to make them more comfortable with coming out though only really do it in hints bc if you just intrude on privacy and assume things it'd only make it worse
First things first the fact you came here says a lot about you as a person and as a trans person I want to thank you for your support. Honestly the most important thing is to give him time and space to explore his own identity. He'll open up to you when the time is right.
I wouldn’t talk to them about it, but one thing that you can do is make them feel safe. Be vocal about supporting trans people and trans rights. Continue to maintain a positive and comfortable home environment. Celebrate when others come out, either to you or in public. If they are in fact trans, they will make it a priority to let you know because they know you are a supportive family member. If they aren’t trans, they have a good role model to model their support of others. 💖
Cracking an egg before it’s ready kills the baby bird. Building a nest, protecting, and warming the egg lets it hatch. The best thing you can do is be a person they can talk to about this stuff. If they actually are trans, they will tell you if and when they are comfortable doing so.
You’re a really good sister!  Lot of great replies here too.
You know, one good thing you could try is to tell them a made-up or true trans story and show a positive reaction to it. So, they might feel comfortable coming out by themselves eventually.
Well, if they're leaving all that stuff out, they must be really confident with you. I would just make sure that they know you will love them no matter what.
Lots of people say not to bring it up, BUT, you know your sibling better than anyone on the internet does. Though I do support just giving space and not reacting, I would say it's good to bring up if you think they are in a dark place and possibly in a ""no one would understand"" depressive mentality. Otherwise just let them fly, show subtle support, and just gauge.
Where you all getting non garbage family from ;-;

Plz give me a link. I'd die to have a sister like this.
All i can say is i wish you were my big sister
I say you should sit down and just ask what they feel they are. That's how I came out but it's different for everyone. I wish you and your sibling luck
I’m gonna be the black sheep here and say maybe don’t act like you know, but act like it’s your idea. MANY MANY closeted crosssdressers and trans folks to include myself (I’m mostly out to my close circles) fantasized that someone would rope me into female games or whatever. Play a “ prank “ in his sleep and make him into a girl or do his nails after giving me small meds. I used to do it to my sister sloppily knowing my sister would do it back😈😂
The best thing that you can do is give him space to figure things out. It's a scary difficult thing to navigate especially when your 18. Forcing the issue will do more harm than good. 

If he realizes they might be trans or non-binary the best thing you can do is be their number one support. Let them know that you accept them for who they and let them know it's ok.
This is an amazing comment.
Thank you, that’s what I figured was best to do and I will definitely let them come to me when they’re ready!
Thank you so much, I won’t say anything to them and will continue to show support the way I have been. I doubt myself a lot and just wanted to be sure it was the right thing to do by pretending I never saw anything. I appreciate this!
Thank you! I’m not going to say anything to them about it, and just continue to show support like usual.
Totally agree! As well as make comments showing you disagree with the current political climate and all the bills they are trying to put forth against the community!"	10k8uu4	trans	93	0.97	2023-01-24 16:05:00
maybe some legends respect gender identity		"I love this idea so much. I've read a couple things that were similar. One thing was a writing prompt about a couple who had a prophecy of doom surrounding their firstborn son. They thought they were off the hook when they had a daughter instead. But then they started freaking out when he came out as trans many years later. I didn't read any of the replies to it, but I feel like it could serve as a really good analogy for being forced back into the closet. For example, the parents think they can avoid the prophecy if they deny their child's identity. And maybe it's that exact attitude they have that brings about the prophecy in the end in an ironic twist.

The other one I read was a short story about the myth that unicorns only let pure maidens ride them. The idea was that there was trans girl who was rejected by everyone, but was accepted by the unicorn.

I just really like the idea of expanding on old folklore and myth that assumes a binary worldview.

Like, assuming that these magical or mythological tales could be seen as representations of the true underlying nature of the world, it would make sense that the rigidity of genders that they sometimes seem to support is something that is only added by the perception of narrow minded humanity, and that magic had the correct more open understanding of human gender all along

I think I finally realized why I used to hate being trans so much	"For context I'm MtF and ~2 years on hrt. When I was little I never really played with dolls or wanted to wear dresses or  anything. I knew I was different than boys but I didn't know what it was. Then puberty started to hit me and I began feeling disgusted by myself. I was effeminate, yeah, but it was the only way I could cope with dysphoria.

When I started transitioning, I forced myself into another closet: I felt like I *had* to be girly, super feminine all the time. It didn't feel right. Only after I became more comfortable in my skin that I started embracing my masculinity. I mean I'm fluid but these days I'm generally feeling butch as hell. 

Then it dawned on me: Being born in a male assigned body stripped me from discovering my inner masculinity. I was disgusted by my male body so fucking much that I blamed everything masculine as harmful. 

I mean if I was AFAB I probably would've already gone through some sort of a lesbian awakening and would currently be a confused bisexual gal wearing different styles of clothing everyday and that would be it! No hating yourself for YEARS, no needless confusion, no hrt, no repression...

I'm at a point where I'm finally feeling comfortable with my gender identity and body but honestly fuck all that. Being trans is hard and things can be even harder if you're a minority within a minority.

Thanks for listening to my lil ted talk.

Tl;dr: Being trans took away my ability to view masculinity from a female perspective."	"That’s an awesome discovery. I used to want every ounce of male out of me but have learned to accept it. Once I got into yoga I learned we all have shiva (male) and shakti (female) energy flowing through us. Embracing it empowers us. Yoga has practices that get in touch with both. Naturally I was drawn to the more feminine practices first ;)
My little sister was a Tom boy. So we shared many of the same experiences with our father and with each other. Hunting, fishing, camping, basketball, softball. Climbing trees.

So I know I don't have to throw away those sides of myself because they are just as valid for me as they are for her.

I decided I was a trans woman at age 40 after first considering transitioning at age 16. Back in 1997. 24 years of trying to fit in.
Thanks for the heads up, I've now noticed that I'm gradually becoming more hostile towards men as of late. I'll have to keep that in check
yeah it can be very easy to feel like you've got to reject or avoid any kind of masculinity as a transfem. our views of gender need to be consistently interrogated; womenhood and a kind of meekness being linked together in our minds is largely a kind of internalized misogyny. womenhood is a vast range of possibility. 

the same goes for transmasculine folks who have to battle with feeling not masculine enough in their identity and feeling the need to reject parts of themselves. no, we have to accept ourselves and go beyond a base understanding of gender and presentation.
I can relate to you, but from the other end. (AFAB Non-binary, had top surgery ~5 years ago and was on T for a year for the voice change).

I was a ""tomboy"" when I was younger, but puberty hit and I wanted absolutely nothing to do with femininity whatsoever. I cried when I had to start wearing bras, I hated myself and my body and all women. I was disgusted by myself and what was expected of me in life and my appearance and I rejected ALL things that were even the slightest bit girly.

When I had top surgery and got on T, I changed my entire wardrobe, even stuff I found comfortable, just to appear more masc at the time. I have always identified as non-binary but felt like I had to ""prove"" to everyone that it wasn't a phase, that it's not this slight dysphoria, that it's real, and had to reject every feminine thing in order to make it known.

It's only now, many years after having surgery and my voice dropping that I feel more comfortable (and excited!) to wear feminine clothes. I have darker facial hair and a flat chest so I look more masculine some days, but this is the first time in over 8 years that I have grown my hair out past ear length. This is the first time in over 8 years where I've worn makeup, painted my nails, and wore heels and cute tops. I don't crawl out of my skin if someone misgenders me (either using he OR she) because I feel so much more confident and happy. Sometimes, though, I wish I had been born in a male body to begin with, so that I could have just worn a bunch of clothes and makeup and attributed it to sexuality instead of years of confusion and self-hate and the amount of time spent at therapists' offices to ""prove"" my dysphoria is enough to qualify me for surgery and HRT. 

TL;DR: as someone from the other end of this, I hear you and I feel similarly (but inverted). Thank you for sharing, it made me personally feel better knowing that maybe, just maybe, I could have ended up with the same experience regardless."	wxo6jf	trans	92	0.98	2022-08-25 20:11:24
For years, I've helped people around me discover their trans identities and saw them start hormone therapy and surgeries before me. And while I was happy for them, it took a toll on my mental health, seeing them moving forward while I was stuck in one place. Now is my time to shine (or in 57 days)		"woo!! happy for you :))
Happy for you

comedian made a transphobic joke	"I was at a medieval festival with my family and they had several performances, one of them was the said comidian. The show he made was meant for kids, now they are gonna grow up with that mindset. And the hole crowd laughed. I tried to stay calm but couldn't, i had to find a quiet place to cry at. But i couldn't find any free place.so i just wandered around feeling anxious the rest of the day. I hate it how our identities are jokes about and our suffering is ignored. The worst thing for me was how my mum praised his show several times afterwards. Did anybody at all even though about their actions? Why can't people just let us be. Are they even listening to themselves? How could someone make joke about a person being different? This person sat down and thought ""How can i joke best about this minority?"". And everyone liked it!"	"I feel you there. Being transgender is down right exhausting. 😐 I am sorry you went through that. The only positive thing I can think to say is that we are making the world change. And the future will be brighter for others because of this movement.
Bring it up with the organizers of the festival.
A lot of the medieval groups have some pretty strict rules about this kind of thing.

Anyone doing this at my local branch of the SCA would probably have been dragged off stage mid-show.
I think that comedy should not have boundaries  u should make jokes of every thing an example I'm diabetic if I go to a stand up comedy show and the comediant finds out I'm diabetic I know I'm going to be made fun of but it's comedy and I laugh with it
I'm trans too and I laught with them because it's for that that comedy show is to make fun of others and to get made fun of.

Edit: but yeah sometimes we are bit more sensitive in that day and the joke hits a little different and it can hurt but u should not pay to much attention to those jokes
The problem is that people are making offensive jokes, not that they're just making jokes.
I actually kind of agree with this, but with a pretty major caveat. No topic should be off limits, and there’s ways to joke about anything, but there’s also very, very wrong ways to joke about things. I saw a comedian who lost a family member to suicide and created whole sets around finding ways to make suicide funny. There’s also plenty of bad jokes about that. There are great jokes about being black and the black experience. And then there’s blackface."	wi0htr	trans	91	0.93	2022-08-06 22:49:45
Are you amab/afab?	Is it just me or does it really hurt when people ask this after you tell them your gender identity?	"It's essentially just cis people trying to determine what genitals you have, and it's really invasive and gross.
Someone in vr said, ""so are you like fully transitioned or...""

It wasn't said to me and I felt bad cuz the girl answered him honestly but I was about to go say, ""no, bad, stop it!""

Yeah, it sucks when people ask stuff like that. Its like saying, ""no but really...what are you?"" So disrespectful but I try not to let it get to me too much.
You had us in the first half not gonna lie
The next time someone asks me that I'll just tell them ""It's a-CAB.""
This is why I rarely ever say my AGAB. It's no one's business, all that matters is my current gender, not what someone assumed when I looked like a crumpled overcooked cabbage.
I'm just a hole, sir 🥺
yes it does! its so disrespectful, it should not matter. you identify as what you identify as and thats all that matters.
Negative, I am a meat popsicle 🥩🧊
i really, really despise being defined by what the doctor said when i was born

that's like asking me my birth weight.  it's totally irrelevant now
The only appropriate answer to this is, ""No, this is Patrick!"" While doing your best Patrick Star impression
I was about to answer the question but then I saw the description lol
When people say that it feels like they’re saying that’s all that matters
I'm akab 
Assigned keter at birth
it's very TMI and for whatever reason with trans people they just don't care about demanding details
yeah it’s stupid when people ask
Well for me it's pretty obvious because I haven't transitioned at all and I dress with the goal to hide my body instead of to appear more feminine, so I don't get asked that very much, but ya it kinda sucks.
I hate it so much
What does they mean ?
I think I've only been asked that once or twice after coming out. 

But yeah, it stings a bit cause it means something about you is somehow off to that person gender wise. 

Or they want to be extra woke nice, and overshoot by miles.
Aswag
This. Or, a am I trans test I took a while back. It said ""what's your gender"" male. Then, ""do you wish you where a girl?"" That was confusing. And questions referring as if I was a trans girl. It was confusing and I stopped mid way through. Like, that's for misgendering me. Tho, I think because I choose male even though I am afab is kina a tell tale sign lol
Just out or curiosity and it’s not meant to offend it’s really for me to learn and know .. so I don’t offend anyone in the future — you can’t ask no matter what?? So then how are you supposed to know what you’re getting into or what to expect ??  Isn’t that soemthing that should be spoken about?? I mean I obviously have no idea what the right and wrong thing is - but I know I have asked and I didn’t mean to offend and now I feel awful …
To me, asking for clarification of AGAB after having someone clearly be M/F/NB is the same as asking someone of a visible ethnic minority ""but where are you *really* from?""    


Like, you don't go up to every single person in life and say ""nice to meet you, do you have a dick or vagina?"" so that shouldn't be appropriate for trans/NB people either.
As someone who (getting pretty sure about my identity now) is nb-femme, its somewhat obvious what my assigned gender at birth if I say I'm trans, but even so the question is just rude if not upsetting. If someone want's to say their AGAB then it is up to them, and to try to intrude in and ask without them saying is just mean - I know some people have the best intentions at heart when they ask questions like that but if you know it is upsetting and still do it that is just an asshole move.
afab😩
Yup
I am a butterfly 🦋
Also I forgot to comment this but before I knew what transgender meant I would not understand trans man and trans women so it might just be slight confusion so they may ask you this question if they’ve never heard someone say ftm or mtf or do not know the acronym
Invasive and gross. Yes.

Do I go up to any cis person and talk about their genitalia? Why do you feel the need to talk about mine?

Smh my head

(Id just like to point out, I wouldn't ask a trans person that either I just thought it apt to specifically mention a scenario w/ a cis person)
Plus there’s no such thing as “fully transitioned”. I mean I more or less guess what they’re asking, but people are valid regardless of what if anything they might do to transition.
What is your vrc username? U seem cool :3
That was not intentional at all, as soon as I posted it I was like, ""Wait- does that sound right?""
This is accurate because either way I’m a bottom anyway
The fact that I am avoiding the question makes me think they know I am not. It would be nice if they just left it at that and did not ask that question.
Same--
The question is more like, ""So you say you're male but are you really male?"" And it bothers me a lot. Obviously, it might differ for others, but for me, it was someone who barely knew me and I don't think anyone feels comfortable discussing what's in their pants with anyone they don't know.
There was really no more to be said though after I said I was a guy. Then they harassed me about it.
No it's good
Also same 🤣
I dunno I’ve never been harassed after someone has asked me this I typically just go about my day I don’t really tend to notice what they say after because it’s kinda like asking me what I ate today if there were fucking with me they clearly didn’t do a good job"	ragjaq	trans	90	0.97	2021-12-06 20:14:29
I’m so confused	I don’t know what my gender is anymore, but definitely not my agab. I hate having female parts and always being called a female I hate my deadname and feminine clothes (skirts are my only acceptation)the only time I “feel like a female” is on my period, but I don’t know what my gender is, I just desperately want to find who I am. I can’t stop thinking about it I don’t know what to do. I’m stressed all the time thinking about it and trying to find my identity is causing me headaches. I’ve tried to be cisgender but It never feels right, I’ve tried using they/them pronouns but they were rarely used, right now I use he/they and identify as transgender (ftm) but that doesn’t feel quite right either. I just don’t want to have these feelings, just trying to find my identity. I’ve tried journaling but I hate just writing and not being able to receive responses/guidance so I’m here. I just want to cry. And being deadnamed doesn’t hurt as much (probably because Ive only come out to a few people so I’m used to being deadnamed) but whenever someone uses the wrong pronouns it hurts, it used to hurt a lot but it doesn’t hurt so much now. And I don’t know why, I’m just so confused, I don’t know who I am, but I need to know. I’m so sorry for all the rambling, I don’t know if this made sense to anyone since it’s just tossed together In a desperate need for advice.	"Finding your identity is a journey. I wouldn’t try to force an answer if it can be helped. Just take things day by day, pay attention to your feelings with things like clothes, mannerisms, etc, and use the information to find your identity. You don’t have to pick a label and then see if it fits. Be yourself first and then see what works :)
If your gender is just ""definitely not cis"" maybe youre genderqueer

Thata how I realized I'm queer because idk how to categorize my sexuality but its definitely not straight
Have you considered meditation? It isn't easy. It takes practice! It seems to me that you're looking outward for answers when inward is the way. And when you want to connect with yourself, meditation can absolutely help. Journalling has worked very well for me, but it doesn't vibe for everyone.
Omfg literally same here! I feel like I wrote this!! 
Yea what I think my gender is changes so much and I can't figure it out.. it's hard on the head! I feel one way one day and another the next... But now I have a men's haircut and I'm self conscious af. But I like how I look in the mirror tho... But everyone only knows my fem name. To scared to come out at work in this society... 
Ahhh
I need a counselor..
I change my gender as often as I change my underwear. The journey is what matters, not the destination.
I am amab, but I entirely understand. I tried to be cis, I tried to be MTF but neither fit. And now I am pretty confident I am non binary but there's still stuff I am figuring out. I can't stop thinking about it,  and it gives me so much anxiety. But the only way to really figure things out is by giving it time. There's something I heard awhile back, but you already know more about yourself than any cis person could ever dream of
i dont have advice that's necessarily going to be broadly applicable bc i dont know you or your situation, but i understand exactly what you're talking about here. ive been there so many times growing up and it sucks very hard. i really hope you find clarity soon.

Strength in Femininity	"There is something so empowering to surrendering your inherent masculine identity and choosing the feminine side of life. Having that default male privilege, but declining it because it doesn’t feel right. To me, womanhood is where I have found my strength. 

It feels so right and I am more confident the more feminine I become. As a lifelong struggler of social anxiety and low self-esteem, being a girl has seemed to almost cure that. It’s just so crazy to me how much self-confidence I have while identifying as female vs my male persona. 

Being a girl is so comfortable for me. All of my fears seem to fizzle away. ❤️"	"Your post has been filtered into a queue for further review based on a number of factors.

I hate everything about myself.	I hate the way my body feels, the skin on my bones feel wrong everything about my body feels wrong. I'm a transmasc non-binary (afab) and I'm constantly called she and a girl all the fucking time. I've been out for ages now and no one in my class even my teachers use my correct pronouns. They have memorised my name not my identity. I just wanna rip my skin off. I look at my body in the mirror and see a fat disgusting lump of a human and just want to crawl up into a ball and die.	"many trolls in this sub right now. Take care of yourself, you're valid and you're gonna be okay💖
Honestly same. I live in a place in which I grew up and I have a kid, and my grandma, even though she's great is having a hard time with my coming out, so every day it's getting deadnamed and misgendered. Thank god my classmates and teachers are respectful and kind so I am passionate about being somewhere I'm properly addressed. But same, I'm really dysphoric most of the time.
heya!!! transmasc non-binary and afab here as well (he/they). i didn't realize i was trans until after i was out of school (currently 21 & dropped out of college), but i hear you! my work environment was very much like this, and this is still the case for many people that are close to me. i've realized that i need to start speaking up for myself more. it's so scary especially since i am non-confrontational, but i truly do believe that i'll start seeing a change once i more consistently call people out on the misgendering & outting. it's certainly helped since i've started HRT & wearing a binder - at least for interactions with people i do not know. i had this habit at work of saying ""thank you"" anytime a customer would use my correct pronouns, even when they thought i was cis. i'm currently working on shaking out of that and standing my ground. just some personal anecdotes, but i hope you find them helpful. i'm confident that things will improve for you once you're out of the current environment that you are in! feel free to message me anytime! i love getting to know fellow transmasc enbies! ❤ hugs!
I'm sure you're beautiful

I really hope things get better for you. It's hard to get past these kinds of feelings but you just got to stay strong and work through it. Try to find someone you can trust and just talk to them, doesn't matter if nothing changes talking to someone who will listen and show they care really help, and so do hugs. Stay safe and stay strong

That's a nice thing to look forward to at least. Do you have any friends you can talk to about this? Or are there specific people who respect your pronouns? If not, do you think there's anyone you could talk to (some kind of higher-up at the school maybe?) who could help with your situation?
0d account 🙄 find something better to do
Come on, you can do better.

Edit: Your boring reply isn't showing up, except on your profile. Be thankful the internet intervened to keep you from embarassing yourself."	tuvkje	trans	87	0.88	2022-04-02 22:52:03
