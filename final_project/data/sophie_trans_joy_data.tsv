How are you both so cute

Wishing you both happiness!!! 💕
Awwww 🥺 y'all are so cute!
This is goals right here
This is a strange and dangerous time for trans folks, but I am so happy that people who feel trapped in a body that doesn't fit them, have the ability and agency to amend it to give them comfort, relief and satisfaction. I find transgender people to be some of the bravest people in our society right now. You all have my deep respect.
❤️
Oh wow happy anniversary
You two make such a lovely couple. Wishing you happy times and a wonderful Christmas
You look so cute together 🥺
Oh my god, what a cute couple!
That leather jacket is amazing 😻

Loving this

I'm so happy for you guys, congrats on starting HRT!! Hope you have a beautiful future ❤️
💕💕
Oh my gosh are you the creator of kobra olympus? I follow jamsheed studios on instagram! I would be so incredibly honored to get to see the comic. 

I'm a trans Muslim artist myself, hence why this means the world to me. Thank you, so so much
Awh thank you!!! It's very affirming for me, I love it too :) even though it looks super faint in this lighting which made me kinda sad but I'm glad it still looks good!
We really, really are :') I never thought I could feel this genuinely happy and I'm so grateful we are in each other's lives
Thank you so much !
❤️❤️❤️
Thank youu💕
💞
Thank you!!
Oh absolutely! My partner and I met in high school, neither of us were out of the closet at the time, but months after our shared class ended we both ended up coming out and transitioning seperately. When we reconnected years later, we found out that not only had we both came out as trans in the opposite direction, but we both had huge crushes on each other back then. We were friends for another year after reconnecting before we also realized that the crush had come back stronger than ever and we were actually very much in love
Haha thank you! It's actually a thin satin shirt rather than a jacket but it's a favorite of mine!
Haha we are a straight passing couple, yes. But both of us are pansexual, so even though we're in a straight relationship, we're both very much queer
Thank you!! It's one of my favorite tops that I own:)
This comment means a lot, thank you ❤️❤️
I'm actually the guy in the pic! I thrifted the top off depop and the brand, which I just checked from the label, is Inner Most! The fabric feels like satin and its thin, so not a jacket, but one of my favorite tops I own:)
Thank you !!!
I should've known the transphobes would find this somehow 💀
Nothing about this post mentions our sexuality. Yes, we're in a straight-passing relationship. Both of us are still queer.
Both of us?
Me (FTM, a trans man) and my fiancée (MTF, a trans woman) are in a t4t relationship which means a partnership where both people are trans and can therefore understand each other's experiences and better connect with each other
Thank you!! You as well! It’s certainly an exciting time, glad to finally be starting my transition! And it’s great to be sharing this whole experience with someone as well
Salaam aleikhum, my sibling <3 Yes, it's Kobra Olympus!  


DM me your email address, and you'll be the world's first recipient of the digital edition of Issue #1 Battle of the Blood Golem!
U remind me a bit of Freddy mercury
Yes yes I’m just making joke ;)

You look very happy.
Oh, ok!! That's cool, sorry I didn't read the title right lol. I have really bad eyesight and so I couldn't tell at first. I can hardly see across a room anymore even with my glasses and it scares me. Sorry about that!
The most wholesome interaction in all of existence
I don’t know what any of this is, but this is amazing.
Haha it's fine that's on me for not being clear! I seriously don't mind at all, nothing to apologize for :)
If you want to know more about my comic, I'd be happy to tell you :)
Id love to know more! :)
Thank you!

Kobra is a trans lesbian Muslim making her way as a web designer in Seattle, when she suddenly starts getting mysterious messages claiming to be from the future which accurately predict things around her. The mysterious person from the future then installs a secret app on her phone which can scan for danger, emit destructive rays, and even launch Agent Tha mode, where a suit of nanites comes out of the phone to protect her and enhance her abilities. The messages from the future then begin directing Kobra to wage a war against literal monsters who lurk in the shadows, rewriting history as it unfolds, as a soldier in the Time Wars.

Each issue will introduce a new villain, and a new supporting cast member, until the final issue of the miniseries which will see them all come together and wage an epic battle.

We're almost finished with the first issue, which we'll use as a pilot to pitch the project to major publishers. If they don't want to work with us, we'll launch a Kickstarter to fund the printing of the first issue and the production of further issues.

If you want to stay connected to the project, you can follow me here on Reddit, or else we're @JamsheedStudios on social media.

If you're able, please consider becoming a patron at Patreon.com/JamsheedStudios where for just $1 US a month, you get a weekly newsletter filled with behind the scenes goodies and first looks. We have almost all the finished pages of the comic available for all Patrons right now. If you pledge $10 or more, you get even more access, like an alpha build of our next videogame."	zehp4k	trans	4942	0.94	2022-12-06 20:50:35

Very happy, and yes!! Trans love is very real, very possible, and SO worth it ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
We appreciate it so much 💞
Thank youu:)
Thank you!! We are definitely so happy:)
that was very deep, tell me more
we bring out the best in each other, it really feels like the whole world is glowing too when we're together haha
Thank you!! I post pictures with her pretty often because I know it's awesome getting to see trans people being happy and living their best lives, I'm hoping to encourage other people to be themselves because it is VERY possible to find someone who loves and accepts you for all that you are
Haha I felt that, I pass well but I tend to present feminine sometimes (wear makeup, crop tops, etc) and I always wonder if people assume we're lesbian in public because of that. I'm so glad your partner defends you, mine is the same—we're so fiercely supportive of each other, if anyone dares be transphobic towards one of us then the other is so quick to react and protect each other at all costs
Thank you!!
Awhhh thank you:))
Just hold on, if it's meant to happen then it will! This is my first relationship ever and it's worked out so wonderfully over the years :)
[removed]
We're a man and a woman in a relationship, correct! Both of us are queer though, no straight people here :)
You’ve made my day!
Anytime 💗☺️
That's fantastic I'm so happy for you 🤗
[removed]
If I was only into women, yeah absolutely. But I'm also into men, and she's also into women. We're both pansexual—being in a m/f relationship doesn't make us any less queer ! Bisexual people aren't suddenly gay when they're dating someone of the same gender, and suddenly straight again when they date someone of the opposite gender—we're bisexual 100% of the time!

So yes, our relationship is straight, but both of us are definitely not ^^"	11qhbs5	trans	4143	0.94	2023-03-13 18:26:42
UPDATE: My partner IS trans! Thank you for helping me support her!	"POSSIBLE TRIGGERS: difficulty accepting their own identity 

I’m definitely not crying with joy, lol! /s

Things happened a lot quicker than I expected! She is still questioning her gender, but trust has already been established and I’m glad to say she feels good about coming out!

Well, after reading your helpful comments, I decided it was time to shower my partner with love and acceptance, and I had a plan to make her feel safe. I cosplay for fun sometimes, so I invited her to help me with one of my cosplays. I was going for Emily from Stardew Valley (a perfect QUEEN, just saying), so I had a blue wig already with me. She LOVES blue hair.

After she arrived, I said I could do her makeup after I did mine if she wanted. She hesitated, but she very timidly asked “can I try your wig instead?” and, of course, I said yes and helped her put on the wig. Not gonna lie, blue hair fits her perfectly! I have the prettiest girlfriend in the world! She looked at the mirror and smiled… her smile is so cute (yeah, I’m cheesy as hell, sorry not sorry)!

We spent the rest of the afternoon/early evening watching a cooking show we love and cuddling. She was still wearing makeup and the wig. Then, I showed her [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/comments/ntogxm/eggirl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) meme I found while browsing the r/egg_irl sub. She laughed hysterically and just said the softest “yeah”, and covered her face, because she was getting pretty red. Then, I said what almost all of you told me she would love for me to say.

“You know I’ll still love you if you’re trans, right?”

Tears started to show on her eyes, but she shook her head and said “‘nah, I’m cis, I wish I was born a girl, but I’m a guy, there’s nothing I can do about it”. I hugged her and said that her gender assigned at birth doesn’t matter at all to me, and she shouldn’t be ashamed of being who she is. Then, in a very low voice, she said:

“I think I might be a girl then… maybe… I don’t know”

I reassured her again that I would be with her no matter what, and that I would be by her side on her journey of self-discovery. She said she wants to try using she/her pronouns, but just when the two of us are alone. I’m happy she’s finally letting her find herself. 

Thank you so much for all the help! I’m sure, when she’s ready, she will feel loved in this amazing community. 
Makeup tips would be appreciated, lol!"	"My heart can’t handle all this sweetness 😭 You are legit partner goals.
This is so sweet.  Some of us need a bit of a push at times because we have internalized a lot of self-hate and shame.  Not that I know from experience or anything………
I am literally crying 😭 she is so lucky to have a partner like you!
That's so wholesome, I was going to bed and I said to myself ""let'a check one or two posts before bed"" and now i'll go sleeping with a big smile because you're so cute, I wish to your girlfriend a transition without majors problems ❤❤❤
I'm smiling so much from reading this.  This so is precious.  I keep rereading all the cute lines because of how amazing they are.  You're amazing OP!  I love how much you're there to support her.  I'm so glad she feels safe and is discovering herself.  I feel so happy for her!


Also makeup tips: I'm no expert.  There are some really good tutorials on YouTube. Samantha Lux has some good tutorials.

The biggest thing is trying to enhance your cheekbones imo.  Shadow (contouring) around places can make areas look smaller so can be nice on the side of the nose and face as well as under the jawline.  Some on the underside of the cheekbones with highlights on top. 

Eyeliner is also huge.  Just changing eyes can be huge.

If facial hair shadow is a thing like for me.  Laser will help, but until it kicks in some concealer and a color corrector can help.  A bit of orange can help.

A lot will depend on face shape.  A lot of amab have a longer distance between bottom of nose and upper lip.  At least I do.  You can try to add a bit extra lipstick on top or go for a more neutral or nude color to draw less attention to the lips.

Wigs help a ton.  They add so much to face shape.  You may not think you look great, and then bam throw on a wig and your makeup WAS fine. 


I think the last thing is just tell her to be patient.  Makeup takes time to get good at.  I still struggle with eyeliner.  The important thing is to have fun doing it.


I wish you two the best.  You're amazing OP!
Omg omg omg I want a partner like you. This is so wholesome
I wish my ex partner was like you when I came out 🙂
I'm not crying, my eyes are just leaking.

It was so amazing of you to treat her so kindly and make sure she knows that you love and respect her. It makes me so happy to know people like you exist.

You handled that even better than a lot of trans people, including myself, would. She's really lucky to have someone as sweet as you by her side, and I really hope for the best for you two. :)
This is such a wonderful update!! You are the sweetest partner and remind me of my partner.


Fwiw, after checking out your profile and seeing another of your posts, I can say that past me related very much to your gf with not wanting intercourse for ""reasons."" Fast forward through time and therapy and learning more and the real root of the reason wasn't insecurity about size but rather that being the penetrative partner didn't feel natural or right to me, so my subconscious came up with different reasons for not wanting to engage in that role. Of course she might be totally different from me, but I wanted to share some perspective that may help down the line!
Awwwwww. gosh. I am so happy for you both congratsss!!!!!!!!!!!!!  


You're the best!!! :)  
I'm tearing up over here :"")
omg im crying this is so sweet!!
This is such a great thing to read! I wish you both the best in this journey!
Huggles for being your awesome self and celebrating this moment in both your lives!
Your so sweet!! I loved reading this!
Wholesome.......OVERLOAD!
>Makeup tips would be appreciated, lol!

...you called? 

I'd be genuinely happy to help! Reach out to me anytime (or ask questions here if you'd rather) and I'll help as best I can!
Was not expecting to cry when I casually opened up Reddit tonight but here we are. I'm so happy for both of you! \^\_\^,
aww i love this so much!! i’m not crying either no definitely not 🥲
Wow, the emotions this makes me feel! Just wow!
Awwwwwwww

This is so incredibly heart-meltingly sweet. I'm so happy for you both!
This is such a beautiful story! Thank you for sharing this!

You’re an amazing partner, and she is so lucky to have you in her life!
I'm crying because of how sweet this is and how amazing you are. To care that much to watch her emotions and put her first is just so heartwarming. I love it! I wish the best for both of you as you go through what is just the beginning of a journey.
Fyi for future posts, there is actually a ""possible trigger"" flair iydk
It took me weeks to just say I wanted to be a woman due to the internalized transphobia and shame. Which is odd because i've never had the slightest issue with other trans people, but it really was one of those kneejerk ""everyone is valid except for me"" sort of feelings. Hell for a while I could only say that i wanted to transition from being a guy to ""the other one"" because admitting I was a woman was sooo difficult.

It sounds like your support is helping your girlfriend make progress at a phenomenal rate, and you really deserve a pat on the back for your support.
My heart! One of the biggest factors of being able to finally come out and embrace my gender is because my partner has provided safety, honesty and support during this journey. I’m so glad you can do that for your partner too!!!
Your partner is very lucky to have such a supportive and loving person in her life.
This is SO WONDERFUL! You are an amazing partner <3
Love Love Love it
This is the most wholesome shit ever 😭
This is so cute and wholesome!

Your gf is really lucky to have your as their partner!
Crying on a Thursday morning, I'm so glad you're there for her and that the blue wig was a success.
The world needs more lovely people like you 😘
Awwwww, my goodness, it's so dusty in here all of a sudden.
you are amazing, you both are, this is soo  sweet <3
IT'S TOO CUTE SEND HELP
She's very lucky to have a partner who accepts her and went to look for understanding like you did.  It's nice to see the dream scenario 😌.
I'm gonna melt, this is so cute and wholesome! Wish I had gotten that type of response from my STBX (would have made things much less lonely), but that relationship ending was for the best for both of us on many levels.

Glad to hear things went so well, and best wishes to both of you!
I have had a migraine for the last three days. My mood was crap, I'm tired and cranky.

And now I'm crying happy tears because this shit is so beautiful and I love it so much, like damn.

You two are an amazing couple and I hope you stay in love and happy together for a long, long time <3
I want a partner like you your awesome
OP, you're an amazing partner! I'm glad you helped give your partners egg a little tap to show you love her. As a trans girl myself, I can say for certain, awesome partners like you make a huge difference in our lives. Keep being supportive and I'm super glad you helped her out! :)
You are a great partner and very kind
This is so wholesome… who’s cutting onions? 🥺😭
This is one of the best things I've seen all day
My...heart...

I'm so happy for you guys!!! I hope you both have a wonderful time together with this new discovery. ^^
This is such a beautiful story. My partner is having trouble figuring out how to support me being trans. I wish they would reach out like this and support me like you are for your partner. I couldn't love your post more
ahhh! so cute!
This is the most beautiful thing I've read in a while 💜 😭
This is cute
You’re based AF! That’s some partner goals right there!
Nawwwwww. All the 💜
This made me cry at the train station, thank you ❤️
Well I reading this was like a big hug in the morning she's lucky to have somebody like you
This is so incredibly sweet, I'm just sitting here, crying from reading this. She can be very happy to have you in her life, I think you handled it very very well and it sounds like she trusts you a lot considering she generally has trouble talking about emotions and stuff like that. Congratulations on her starting the way of discovering and accepting her true self and on you for having an incredibly cute sounding girlfriend! I wish you guys all the best on this journey 💖
Now I'm getting choked up.. this is so beautiful to read. Nothing in the world makes me happier then to see someone discover their true gender identity. I'm so happy for your girlfriend and you!!!
My fucking heart. Omg this is so sweet and loving its perfect.

I know your gonna hear this a lot but you are an amazing love filled person and this post gives me the most hope I've ever had 💕

All the best to the two of you
I'll read this again and cry later when I'm not in the middle of the office. I'm so happy for both of you!
I am NOT crying ok?
Right out of a movie 🥲☺️
That sounds so sweet and cute! I'm happy for both of you \^\^ 

I wish my girlfriend was that supportive for my being mtf instead of just accepting, I've felt quite jealous \^\^' 

Congratulations and good luck girls!
This is the best and most wholesome thing I’ve ever read bar none ❤️🙏🎊
This is amazing!
Please excuse me, I believe someone is cutting onions in here.
Honest to god you are so teethrottingly sweet I can almost hear my dentist cry.
I admire you greatly and I wish we all had someone like you there for us.
Love and support from the Netherlands!
I'm tearing up at work reading this. You are the partner everybody needs. You are a beautiful, wonderful person. I hope life takes you two to incredible places <3 congrats to you and your partner! :)
This both warms and breaks my heart...I'm happy for the both of you! You are awesome! The world needs more of you! 🥰❤️
OMG, All the feels right here!
This is the most beautiful thing I've read in a looooong time. 🖤🖤🖤
“Feels targeted. Shot fired. Target has been hit right in the feels.”
Yayyy congrats! Stardew Valley is so perfect, and so are you two. Hope your love will continue to grow 💖🥺😍❤️💖
Omg I would have cried if I didn't have this annoying testosterone in my body. So heartwarming! (｡♡‿♡｡)

""I might be a girl then... Maybe... I don't know""
I feel this so hard xD, but I think I'd rather go in that direction than stay how I am.

I hope you and your girlfriend have a wonderful time together and she's very happy to have such a wonderful, caring and loving person like you <3.
OMG, this is so sweet and touching... You and your girlfriend seem to be totally cute and wholesome! Great you could talk even though it took some time for her to really open up. (I mean, that's absolutely understandable! I've also looked at your other post from before, and regarding her backstory, it's no wonder she supressed those feelings and thoughts for such a long time...)

I wish you two the best but I'm sure it will all get better now with all your loving and support. <3 (Sorry if anything sounded strange, I'm German, haha.)
I was already having a teary day, and now I'm ugly crying after reading to the end. Congratulations to both of you, and especially her! Thank you for being so patient and letting her get to her feelings while making her feel safe enough with you to do so. You are a good human 💙
i think you're single-handedly causing the entire sub to cry tears of joy....i'm in bio class rn and im tearing up and i **rarely** cry
Awesomeness!!! ❤️
OMG!! I'm not crying! So sweet!
I really envy her such a supportive partner
You are amazing! Every person should strive to be as supportive and loving as you are. I wish you two a long life of happiness and many years together. I hope one day I can find someone who'll accept and love me no matter what I choose with my body
This literally made my day! I saw your initial post and I'm sooo happy for you both. The world needs more of your kind heartedness, love, and acceptance. 

DM me, seriously, for makeup help. I have watched enough YouTube about it and specifically things for trans women that I feel like I should have an honorary cosmetology license. 

Love and happiness to you both 💜
This is so heart meltingly sweet, you're doing a fantastic job for her. For you both. This is a scary time for her but so exciting too. If you ever need more specific info down the line we're happy to give it.
That is so adorable! I’m glad that while she hasn’t exactly answered her question of who she is that she has someone as supportive as you are to help het in her journey though! It’s a long road, and a difficult one at times with lots of ups and downs.
I literally crying right now!! You and your partner sound so sweet!! Your partner is so lucky, I'm so happy for you both 🥺😭
I'm not crying you're crying
As far as makeup tips, if she has to deal with covering beard shadow you're going to want orange color corrector. I used to use one that came in a pen that worked pretty well but I went through them very quickly since I was using like a hundred times would a cis woman would use lol. Until I had laser hair removal and didn't need to cover beard shadow, I'd put down a layer of the orange color corrector, put that under a layer of concealer, and then put foundation over the top of it all
You're such a great person ❤️
This makes my heart so happy. Sending you both so much love.
I or g my gosh, I’ve spent DECADES on literally “I wish I was born a girl, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”
I'm sure you know this already, but you are amazing. Your partner is one lucky, lucky gal.
Woo 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Give her all of the hugs from us!!!
💝
Good. Good. Yeah my coffee didn’t have enjoy tears in it. Ty OP. Ty

IM NOT BAWLING YOURE BAWLING 🥺🥺🖤
Beautiful story from a beautiful person <3

Wish you all the best in supporting your girlfriend
Thank you for the love! <3
Virtual hugs for you! I know I’m just a random stranger online (and we’re probably geographically far away), but please know that I care about you and your feelings are valid! And yes, she still has a lot of self-hate, not only because of her gender, but I know she will be able to heal… and so will you :)!
I’m sorry that you’ve had to internalize this. The world is cruel to trans people, and we deserve so much better.

You’re a beautiful example of humanity - all of us who are trans are. Being trans is simply a part of the human experience, no matter how many people want to deny or destroy that.

We will not be erased, and we are beautiful.
First of all, I was assigned female at birth, identify as a woman and I too struggle with eyeliner! Lol

Second, thank you so much for these tips! I’ll check Samantha Lux out! I’ll probably learn a lot for myself as well, so me and my girl can practice together! Sounds like a fun activity!
I’m so sorry they weren’t supportive! Virtual hugs! I hope you find/found someone that truly supports you, because they exist, okay?
I could only do it so carefully because of this amazing community! People gave me some really great advices! Thank you for the love! <3
My boyfriend is trans-masc and while I also don't generally like using that thing with him taking control on top, taking good care of erogenous zones I didn't even know I had, and the way he moved I was able to imagine he was the one inside me and not be all icky feeling. I still wasn't really getting much from the thing itself but I really enjoyed the experience as a whole.

So just, something to take into consideration if you want to try something like it. I'm sure my description was garbage though...
Yep, that makes a lot of sense now that I think about it! I’ll talk to her about it when I have the opportunity!
Thank you so much! It is quite late where I live now, but tomorrow I will reach out!
Thank you for that!
What? I just want her to be happy! If she’s trans or not, I’ll be there for her! I’m bi, so really, her identifying as a man, woman or neither is just a detail to me! I love her for who she is! I’m just joyful that she trusts me enough to share her thoughts and feelings and that she’s letting her find herself!
Thank you, I appreciate it!  I’m actually married to a wonderful woman that has helped me quite a lot.  She told me that in ten years she wants to renew our vows and I can either be a man again or we can both be women.  She knows which one I wanted of course.  We have already decided that the picture (in ten years) will go in a space next to our wedding picture!  

It turned out, she was afraid I’d leave her if I transitioned and I was afraid she’d leave me!  Neither of us are going anywhere and I had so many long conversations with her after coming out to both her and myself at the same time.  I really recommend you ask your girlfriend about her experiences.  When she first thought about wanting to be a girl, If she ever tried on women’s clothes when she was younger, etc.  if she’s anything like me, the dam will break and everything will come out.
Yassss makeup together sounds so fun.
Thanks honey, the journey is tough but it gets better every day. X hugs back at you 🤗
No you're totally right! That's exactly what my partner and I do, and it feels almost like she has the penis and I've had my GCS. It's the only way we can be intimate: me on top, straddling her, her on bottom legs out straight. It's super close and intimate.
Fair enough. Sorry if I sounded like a dick. It’s just you’re saying her her her she she she, and they’ve said “I don’t know”.. sounds like you’ve decided for them. 

I have just seen first hand how people can be misguided by the love and affection they receive when coming out. Like.. they never received that as cis, and now they do as trans, no wonder it feels like the answer. 

And, understandably, I don’t think the trans community is very good at supporting people who are unsure. It’s always a push to transition and not a push for self-discovery. Not talking about you, just in general. 

When people are their own gender, they get nothing but as soon as they post themselves as the opposite gender, they are showered with love and affection, it must be really confusing for people already confused. It was for people I know.
That’s so wholesome! And yes, that’s a great idea! I’ll ask her about her experiences!
Confusing or not, no amount of positive or negative external feedback is going to change whether someone is trans or not. Same for being gay or in other ways queer. And I've seen loads of people advocating for self-discovery rather than pushing for a false positive, particularly on mypartneristrans.
Thank you, i know you dont know me but thank you.

I see a lot of myself and my ex (it didn’t work for other reasons) in the two of you and that fills me with indescribable joy. People like you are sometimes the only thing that makes this world survivable and i wish you both the very best.

I dont know if you’ve seen this around but i like giving this link out because it literally changed my life.
https://turnmeintoagirl.com/
Did you ask her about it and did it go well?  Some things are hard to get out initially.
Okay, that’s the cutest website ever, I’m sending it to my girlfriend right now!
Hi! I was finally able to talk to her in person about it! It was very emotional and quite hard for her, but it was a great conversation!
That’s really great!  I was able to do it a little easier with my wife because we have been married for well over a decade at this point.  Being younger and still (most likely) ashamed and scared of who you are inside makes it a lot harder to talk about.  I’m so glad it worked out.  I bet you’re closer than ever now!"	qmazf7	trans	2477	0.96	2021-11-04 02:43:02
Ah, the joys of friendship		"That's what a real friendship looks like!
Hahaha, now that is a real friend!
very chaotic good
Keep this human.
I’ve had some similar experiences coming out. The best of friends can be the most abusive to each other but thats how guys show love.
No one calls this bitch, bitch as much as I call my self bitch.
What a beautiful friendship 😁💜
That's cute as hell
Vulgarnouns
Awww gender affirming vulgarity
Insults are an artform 😅 express yourself! Lmaooo
I do not have to deal with this as my friend already calls me both
Love in the best form
Bitch, please.
I genuinely prefer being called bitch more than being called handsome…

Femme insults > masc complements, at least for this trans girl!
Me and my friend basically
Good name choice btw :)
If you want to cuss someone out but you're unsure of their pronouns asshole is a gender neutral insult.
I’m FtM and my boyfriend twice now has asked if it would be insulting to call me a bitch and once asked is if he should call me a dick instead of a pussy and that kills me every time
“Shut the hell up, dickhead!”

“Oh I’m sorry, hold on.”

“Shut the hell up bitchhead.”
I 💘 your friend.
Appropriately vulgar
Keep this one
Awww. That's friendship right there.
Validating insults are still validating 😂
Wtf :'c
What a great friend! It's important to know which insults your friends prefer! My best friend is a cis male (as am I) and we always call each other ""bitch"" XD
I actually enjoy being called a bitch 👉🏻👈🏻
Truly warmed my heart.
now that is true friendship
I love everything about this.
Bitch please...
110% me asking the question
This is the way I would prefer to be talked to. Not the insult part necessarily, but with people asking me what gendered terms I want them to use.
Love it x
~~they can say ""dick"" when they want to be extra insulting~~
A man should never call a woman a bitch. It’s misogynistic. This is true for a trans woman as much as any other woman. (And it’s lovely that he asked you this, OP.)
It actually reminded me of my best friend and she's a girl.
all genders do it, not just guys :P
From now on my new name shall be bitch.
There's so much more name solidarity now! We both PICKED this name, it wasn't just hoisted upon us!
Thats kind of even better :)

My dad texted me a YouTube link to a Fox news story about a person who detransitioned	"I'm not even gonna state all the obvious implications of that. 


Does anyone know of a good video of a trans person talking about how much happier they are now transitioning? I'd like to text a link back. He didn't say anything, just sent a link. I'd like to do the same and send some trans joy back in his face ☺️



**EDIT:** I thought I already had an edit to this post but it isn't showing up? Rip. 


Anyway


I did some thinking and decided to give my dad the benefit of the doubt and treat him like he's coming from a place of genuine love and concern and linked him some of the stuff you guys suggested. Worst case scenario he doesn't watch or read any of it and continues to be an ass. At least I know I tried and that he can't play the victim and say I was in the wrong.



I suspect I will get a lengthy text within the next hour or two about how I'm still wrong and not trans cause of course he knows me best (🙄) at THAT point I will just ignore him and say nothing. The nice thing is my dad takes ignoring as a ""win"" and doesn't pester or bring it up ever again usually



Also some info for those who might not have saw in the comments: I'm an adult in my mid 20s, my pronouns are he/him, and I'm a safe distance from my dad (we live in separate states) thank you all again SO much for your advice and concern. ❤️❤️❤️



**EDIT 2:** Well I woke up to this text from dad this morning. I don't even know how to respond 😐

""I am glad you understand where I am coming from. Am am glad you are happy. If it ever turn to not being so great and make you unhappy don't to afraid to change back. You have a good head on your shoulders and you think things thru. So if it make you happy then I am happy. But I am still going to refer to you as my little girl [deadname]...... unless you want to take the name we would have given you had you been born a boy ....... Travis James.""

**EDIT 3** Okay so I constantly forget that reddit doesn't know my backstory lmao I'm so used to posting on less anonymous sites. 

**Travis is NOT my chosen name. My name is Bucky**

I HATE that name. He KNOWS I want to be called Bucky. He is saying he will only call me my dead name unless I agree to his ultimatum and take the name he wants. It's just him still trying to control me"	"This is a really good summary page that can be handed off easily to people who try to push transphobic ideas:

https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/
Eh. Ignore it. But send him 10 hours of cat parade (Mitchiri Neko) https://youtu.be/eBPfnj8_4W4 and don’t say anything else

You’re welcome 💕
tbh id just ignore it. He seems to already be twisting logic to fit the narrative he wants, so sending him back a text isnt going to change his mind.
[this is](https://youtu.be/YAHaVixgqew) a video interview with a detransitioner who isn't regretful about their transition experience. 

Really insightful imo
Or even just something breaking down the actual statistics around detransition. How rare it is - and how it’s often about societal pressure more than true regret
https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg 
let Abigail speak for you
I think Jammi Dodger (idk spelling sorry) has talked about it on his youtube channel. hope it helps :(
send him an article on the high amount of divorce rates from straight couples compared to queer couples
I think there’s a statistic out there that most people who de transition do so bc they aren’t accepted by their community. If you can find that or a video that has ghat statistic w the source it might help
Well I made a YouTube video for my mother when she sent  me a fox news de-transion video.

I called it Transition Sabotage.

The only person who knows your gender and your needs is you. Some people do de-transion, and there's no shame in that. Most do it for social or economic reasons. Some are more happy in  between. Ash Hardel has a great YouTube on why they are nonbinary and has some nonbinary guest speakers who de-transioned a little.

This is hard enough for anyone to do, if you can, isolate yourself from anyone who would hold you back. That seems to be the best strategy.


https://youtu.be/5VylOdHBel0
No such thing as de transition, that’s just transitioning twice. Maybe your dad would like it if you changed your gender very often 😂 worth asking
No one who sends fox news to someone is going to change their mind from being showed evidence that they're wrong. It's all about feelings regardless of facts which makes the whole ""facts don't care about feelings"", bs that much more ironic
Go to pubmed and send him a scientific article about the likely hood of someone  wanting to transition. Mabye ad the suicide rate of unsupported trans to drive the point home
My dad was listening to it in the car and it was about this girl who transitioned for clout points and then detransitioned because she obviously wasn't happy and mocked trans people and gender dysphoria and I wanted to tear my hair out. 

Then it went onto how masculinity levels in america are dropping and that you need to testical tan to solve this problem
Look up Ryan Cassata (may have spelled his surname wrong), he talks a lot about transitioning & his journey & his family's journey, he does a lot of public speaking & raises awareness about a lot of stuff & he's got a very ""this is Trans Stuff but phrased in a way that cis people can empathise with it if they wanna start understanding us"" type of vibe with most of his videos. I know he's got a spoken poetry thing where he addresses his dad & talks about how gender dysphoria feels for him, and he writes a lot of songs too.
""I've made my choice and don't need your input into my life, "" I would say to him.
I'd just text him back, ""thats great! I hope they're as happy as I'll be when I'm fully transitioned!""
My mom did the same, except it was a YouTube link on how TikTok makes mental disabilities a trend and attached to the link was a long message on how i couldn't be trans because she ""took classes on psychology"" and she ""would've seen the signs""

I saw you already sent some links, and i honestly might do the same. Maybe when I'm a bit older though, LOL
My dad printed out an article by a detransitioner and left it on the kitchen table with a note saying ""very interesting read""
You know, subreddits like this are usually ""drop the abusive bastard now and never talk to him again"".

I'm going to say what I've said before - if there's a chance his transphobic ass will turn around and respect you and love you, it might be worth waiting for. You're on your own and safe in your own place, and can text him from a safe place and not dig in deeper than you have emotional energy for.

One of my brothers used to be transphobic, but all I'll say is now he's the only family I have anymore, and he's a damn good ally.
Sam Collins, and Jammiedodger are one of my favorite trans YouTubers. This should help
Nice, just got it
I've found an interesting video of a person who detransitioned but is really happy that they had the experience. They really considered it two transitions vs. detransitioning, IIRC. Depending on the theory of gender that most applies to you, nothing to say that you might decide to transition again in the future. Or continue one long transition. Or do stops and starts.  I think all of that should be okay to do. I'm genderfluid so I think about this stuff lol. I'll try to find the link.
if the possibility of detransitioning makes it too risky to allow a child to transition, you would also have to prove that it isn’t possible to prevent the accident transitioning of non-trans people. unfortunately for people like your dad, this really doesn’t seem to be the case.

most detransitioners arise from a very specific set of preventable circumstances. if you don’t want your kid to accidentally think they’re trans but really aren’t, the best thing to do is love them and then get them the best possible trans healthcare from some real experts
Just send him 100 gecs songs

I think I may have seen the same article. Screw Fox. I find that with trans issues, they always go with half truths, twist the facts, don’t say all the facts, lie, create an emotional narrative against trans rights, and/or blow things out of proportion. They always try to find a way to make being pro-trans a bad thing and they spread so much misinformation and hate. Unfortunately my parents listen to Fox a lot.
Faux news.  Best thing you can do is to set the parental controls to block that lying ass channel.
This is a brief comedy clip from Robin Tran that after coming out to my mom, I sat and watched with her so it was easier for her to understand.  https://youtu.be/xpnba-l3qfc
I know I'm a bit late, but here's a study you could link (sorry, not a video, but arguably better). 

[Factors Leading to “Detransition” Among Transgender and Gender Diverse People in the United States: A Mixed-Methods Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/)

> Of those who had detransitioned, 82.5% reported at least one external driving factor. Frequently endorsed external factors included pressure from family and societal stigma. History of detransition was associated with male sex assigned at birth, nonbinary gender identity, bisexual sexual orientation, and having a family unsupportive of one's gender identity. A total of 15.9% of respondents reported at least one internal driving factor, including fluctuations in or uncertainty regarding gender identity.

Feel free to read through it for more understanding, but what it mostly comes down to is that people detransition because of pressure from family and/or society. My math might be wrong here, but it looked like the total number of people in the study that detransitioned because **they** wanted to, is something like 2-3% of the trans people they surveyed.
I heard recently that most people who detransitioned were pressureed by those around them and how poorly treated them for being trans.
If your dad is a fan of some sport or has a hobby, send him a link of someone disliking the sport or hobby for some reasons.
Honestly just look at so many trans people online or im documentaries. I'm trans, ive been out since i was 12 and now im 18. I love being called a man, or being seen as a male. The euphoria i get every single time is unreal. I would transition in a heart beat if travelling and funds weren't so difficult for me
Just text back an image of a middle finger
I'll call your dad up and tell him about how my life is so much better now.
Say that most detransitioners do it because they aren’t supported or even assaulted for being themselves
It's not a video, but if he's a ""facts and logic"" type you could send him [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/) comprehensive defense of trans people that debunks just about every transphobic argument with primary sources. It's even sorted by topic, and there's a section dedicated to detransitioning!

I stopped transition for several years (although I didn't consider it ""detransitioning"" more like just a pause) and within a couple years I looked more or less exactly like I did before hormones. My voice was a little different but even it kind of went back to what it started at.

So even if someone DID regret transition, it is relatively easy to reverse everything with a little time. Surgery is a little harder to reverse obviously, but that's why you should always do so much soul searching, therapy, and research before taking those steps, as pretty much every trans person does anyway. The pearl clutching of conservatives is tedious to watch because they can't even be bothered to actually educate themselves on the whole process in the first place or they would know that their fears are utterly misplaced and emerge from vitriolic propaganda coming from the christofacist media. 

This talking point from conservatives about ""transition regret"" is just such blatant concern trolling. The facts are clear that 99% of people don't regret it, and of those that do its almost always because of the increase in transphobia they then face. Transition related surgeries have a MUCH lower regret rate that knee replacement surgery, but you don't see fox talking about that.

Potential regret is simply not a justification for keeping people from life saving medical care. I'm sorry you're dealing with a non-accepting dad!
I’d take a few
Minutes and maybe find something from Dr. Z. I’m sure I’ve seen a video she’s done that talked about either family struggling to accept or even how much happier once you’ve come to terms with who you really are. Maybe even one where she addresses how you know if you’re really trans… 

It’s not hateful, and she’s a licensed psychologist with a specialty in gender.
I hate people like this.

I understand thats your father and stuff, but seriously dude, you should put that man in his fucking place even tho he's a relative, because thats some insensitive shit.

Remember that you are your own person and that you don't need to conform to other people whether they are relatives or friends.

And Travis James is such a shitty combination. Tell your father to acquire some taste, lmao.

[removed]
what your dad did wasn't wrong, he was trying to show you how actions also have consequences.

denying the reality of detransitioning by not listening to their stories, isn't that also invalidating their experiences?

you really should consider your transitioning and what that means wholly to you, your environment and the people around you in all sphere criteria.
Unfortunately if he can send you something like that then whatever you do won't change his mind. The best thing I can think of is let him know about the cold hard facts about life expectancy of trans people depending on whether family members provide an accepting and safe environment, compared to those that don't.

Also mention that if there was a medical treatment that had a 99% success rate it would be fucking worldwide good news. But hey, if your dad can only think of the <1% that detransitioned, possibly due to societal  pressures, then that's his problem.

Sorry for the rant.
Ignore him. He's being an ass
I de-transitioned for a few years because I couldn’t get the healthcare I needed and I regretted every day of it I mean I got some of my life together again but the dysphoria as well as the sense of shame and alienation from myself and my past was intolerable and I have decided to re-transition. De transition was not a solution but accepting myself was.
About 2% of the people who [detransition](https://fenwayhealth.org/new-study-shows-discrimination-stigma-and-family-pressure-drive-detransition-among-transgender-people/) do it because they question their transgender identity. De-transitioning doesn’t improve quality of life for most people. Ask your dad if he cares about your happiness and quality of life or if he cares about how people might view him for having a trans child.
I mean you could be petty and if he is still married to your mom you could send him any news article about people getting divorced.
Check out Charlotte Clymer on Twitter, FB and Instagram. She is an advocate for the trans community in DC. She speaks openly about her time in the Army, a member of the infantry. She is also a Christian…which may help when dealing with someone who watches Fox.

Jesus christ my mom sent me that exact video yesterday
Plenty of detransitioners have retransitioned. Often the detransing is due to social pressure such as stories like this in the media. BUT the point you can use from this is that anyone can detransition if transitioning doesn’t feel right, including you. You’ll know it if you need to, but haven’t yet.
Weird suggestion, but maybe Blaire white would be a good bridge. While she talks about people who detransition, she also emphasizes how much transitioning helped her and how happy she is living her life as a woman. My opinions on her are very mixed (she’s starting to really show a lot of her right wing true colors and I’m increasingly bothered by her covid denial and worried her beliefs could shift from genuine concern for children to qanon level conspiracy) but she speaks to people with his kind of perspective and shows as an actual real life trans person that trans people aren’t the pedophilic boogeyman they’re made out by the right to be.

Literally anything out there, you can find something to back up a specific narrative. Even if 99.9% of people who transition are thrilled with it, there's always going to be someone for whom it wasn't right, and fine, good for them. 

I know loads of trans folks, none of whom have de-transitioned. 

I had to stop at one point because it was 20 years ago, and I just didn't have the support or the money to continue, but it didn't mean I didn't want to. For people who have de-transitioned, they all likely have their own individual reasons why, and that doesn't translate to your experience.
[Jamie](https://youtube.com/shorts/rQo5IEKRED8?feature=share) just posted a short!

If it helps, I'm sitting in the waiting room for my orchi right now and I'm so excited. Seriously. No man could possibly be half this excited about losing their testicles. Seriously giddy.
I came to this sub to see if anyone else was talking about this video. My religious mom also sent me this video this morning.

I am not trans so I can't give her any personal experience but I just want to give her the tools to see it from another perspective. Obviously, her info is coming from Fox, so that says a lot right there. But I know she is open to hearing about it.

She lives in her bubble but the conversation started last week because she just found out my brother's girlfriend (cis female) does drag. That was a whole lot for her to process but it did open the door to lots of questions for her. She thought only men did drag and I explained all kinds of people do. 

Based on our conversations, I don't think she's anti trans, but more so anti starting kids too young on hormones. I'm not going to pretend like I know anything about it because, like I mentioned, I don't really have a lot of personal experience. Every trans person I know (that I know of) transitioned socially or medically as an adult. I think every situation is unique and so personal.

I wanted to bring the question here. I know other people just say to ignore it, but I do want to send something her way. If she wants me to watch what she offers up, I want to give her something too.
Studies vary but I found this one https://www.ustranssurvey.org/informes#USTS . They have a section about detransitioning and found out that about 8% detransitioned, of that 8% only 11% detransitioned because they found out it wasn't for them. Other reasons were social stigma, pressure from parents or relatives to de transition, financial problems and or work problems, others detransitioned but planned on continuing in the future. If you look at other studies you will see similar reports. No treatment works 100% of the time but it doesn't mean we should discourage people from transitioning just because a small percentage deteansitioned for whatever reason.
Oh boy, the Christmas after I came out my parents gave me Gay Girl Good God. Talk about cringe. Anyone have good rebuttle books that I can start being petty too and send over?
Literally any trans youtuber
So. As much as you’d probably want to ignore him, or say something smartass…maybe educate him. Send him a quick article or link. There are a TON showing that trans members of society who aren’t allowed to transition are at a much higher rate of suicide. Is your mental health worth his pride? Theres also a lot out there showing that the rate of people who regret transitioning are lower than people who have common procedures, such as knee surgery. Nobody goes around telling people, “ahh Mike, I know your osteoarthritis is bad in the left knee, but there’s a 20% chance you’ll regret the knee replacement!”
It might be helpful to inform him that fox news has an obligation to entertainment, not news.
Jammidodger and Sam Collins both make YouTube vids . Jammi does seem to go into more detail though.
Alternatively you could ignore it.
I dunno if this would help but heres a ted talk from a father about coming to terms with and then celebrating his trans son.

https://youtu.be/GW8Plf_IXGs

Edit: its been a couple years since i’ve seen this and i forgot that he uses she/her to refer to his son pre transition which is 😬😬 
Some if his takes are outdated but I think the vid stuck with me after I watched it bc I’d never seen a conservative parent be ok with their trans kid like that
Tell him that divorce is like ten times more likely to happen than someone choosing to detransition. Lmao
Send Never Gonna Give You Up :) 

If not, maybe PhilosophyTube? https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg

You could always dump some Contrapoints stuff.
\[Here are some excellent statistics on detransition\]([https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/](https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/)). It may be worth pairing this with anecdotal evidence of trans people who have been positively effected by transition - good examples are Ashley Adamson and Rose Montoya (vloggers that focus on positive aspects of the trans experience). There have been lots of studies on how conservative people are more swayed by anecdotal evidence.

Answer: all live decisions carry a chance of regret.
just link him an article about a car crash and tell him he should never drive again
Hope they got links to parenting classes and referrals to therapists in return.

Wow that very last edit really ended powerfully
Op I'm glad your father is more supportive now
Thank you.
Thank you!! ❤️
Hey, can u dm me a link to this bc it will be rly helpful for anyone who questions my identity. 
Also sorry you had to go through that, it's so horrible (btw this is for the original post incase u r confused)
OMG this is exactly what I need. I’ve been arguing with my parents about beginning HRT for the past year and GNC for the past 2. They say they just want to wait till I’m older but all my friends have started and Im feeling left outtt!!! 
Maybe this will finally convince them!
Tysm for this!!
Saving for when I come out to my dad and inevitably going to need something to send to him
This is excellent, thank you 🙏
Then why do so many of them sewer slide
LMAOOO ty
Rofl yeah. I second this. Never respond to trolls with logic. Either don't respond or troll right back. But if you do troll, do it the trans way: *gayly.*
Omg oli love that so cute
Seriously. Because apparently they are trading things that are very irrelevant and silly. Least that's how I view what he sent em as lol
**I love you!**
Omg I might just watch it all
Mitchiri Neko!  The perfect Troll Repellent!

thank you for blessing me with that
How do you feel about the 10 hour version of [taking the hobbits to Isengard](https://youtu.be/DKP16d_WdZM) as a backup option?
I was having a sad day but this cheers me up, thanks.
I was today years old when I learned that I needed this in my life.
Disagree.

Send him this:

This is true. It's frustrating because when I initially came out he WAS watching vids of successful trans people who are happy being trans but now he's suddenly getting all his sources from fucking fox 😭 wtf happened
Exactly. He doesn’t care
Thank you! ☺️
I do have a pic of a break down of statistics that show the actual percentage of detransitioners that simply regretted it was the smallest amount. Maybe I'll just bombard him with a ton of links and info 😂 I know he won't take them seriously but it would get a point across
Just watched the whole video and it was amazing wow 🥺 I love that she acknowledged how people expect you list all the things you did as a kid that indicated being trans because my dad keeps jumping all over me for not acting masculine enough as a child to justify being trans now
Thank you ❤️
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbhv1Znv4Lk) might be the video! It's from April 2020. Jammi always impresses me with how well he understands the research around topics. 

His channel is a great resource for people who don't know much about the trans community. He has a way of mixing humour with facts that alleviates the tension commonly found in these discussions! OP, I hope things get better. I know this isn't an easy situation. Best of luck.
This is extra funny because my dad divorced my mom because he was cheating and has cheated on every single woman he's been with ever since 🤭
I have a screenshot of a study with those stats! 5% of people de transitioned because they found it wasn't right for them while 36% stopped because of their parents. Idr the amount of people surveyed but I'm pretty sure I downloaded the giant 100+ page pdf of the research simply cause I know my dad ain't gonna pour through a whole document like that lol
Thank you so much for this!! ❤️❤️ It sucks but at least we can find solidarity with parents who use Fox as a news source lmao
We've already had a conversation about detransitioners and what would happen if I stopped and I explained that the only permanent changes are body hair and voice change but in either case I can't imagine a universe where I would be unhappy with that because I've always wanted a deeper voice and more body hair if nothing else lmfao
I guess I'm constantly torn on what to do bc some trans people tell me to cut him out whereas others keep making me feel guilty for not viewing this as genuine concern from a place of love. Ik no one knows my dad but these types of things always make me doubt myself....which is a trait I definitely got because of how my dad treated me my whole life 😅
[removed]
YIKES that's sounds awful I'm sorry about that 🤢😬
Thank you for the rec!! 🥺❤️
Everyone has such good suggestions I'm having a hard time figuring out my best course of action lol
Omg I'm sorry you got a crazy parent too 😭 the signs thing is so fucking insane why are they so obsessed with that
Oh my GOD. 😭 What a fucking asshole lmfao
god that is such a boomer thing to do lol
Someone linked a video that was about 45 minutes of a person saying they were on T for 6 years and had recently stopped but didn't regret it or anything, maybe that's the one you were thinking of? I haven't had time to watch it all yet. If not that's at least 2 videos that don't paint it as something negative :)
Oh gosh thank you for all of these!!
Ikr? 😖 I didn't watch the vid he sent but I read like 3 comments before I absolutely couldn't read anymore. I mean it's insane. 

I also will forever find it funny that, aside from weaponizing de transitioners, people like my dad will be like ""I want to know more about trans people. Allow me to gather all my sources from cis people who purposely make trans people look bad and had never transitioned. Surely, these cis gendered people  who hate trans people have reliable knowledge on the subject"" 

It's like asking someone who hates baking, and specifically only bakes disgusting cakes, to bake a delicious cake for your birthday party.
I did send him a thing that shows the statistics show that most people de transition because of parents/other social reasons
LMAOO 🤣
Thank you for this insightful comment! The concept that you MIGHT regret something is such a stupid reason not to do something imo. Unless it's like, I might regret eating a snack at 3am 🤣

All I know is I'm 10 months into hrt and there is not a shadow of doubt or regret so far!
I KNOW RIGHT ok I'm glad you understood that edit cause some people thought it was cute and I forgot that no one knows my name on here 🤣 I'm way too used to Twitter and not being anonymous haha 


It's funny and stupid because my name should be one my dad of all people would like lmfao he just wants to control me. I was really busy today so I never texted him back but um yeah I am simply not going to respond if he doesn't call me the right name. It's so disrespectful on the most basic level to call someone the name YOU want to call them
I watched that one !! It's so good
Ikr like wtf you can't give me an ultimatum about my IDENTITY bro 😭 in the past he was like ""why can't you just bind and wear a fake beard and be a girl"" 😐
I can't tell if you're being a troll and saying trans people are all making a huge mistake or just me but neither is true. Also you couldn't know this but I've explained to my dad at length how I've felt this way and took years to decide if I was ever going to transition. Ive also given him plenty of sources and always answer any questions or concerns kindly. I am doing my best but the fact is he doesn't want to understand or be supportive and that is not you love and care for a child. It just alienates me.
Okay so I constantly forget that reddit doesn't know my backstory lmao I'm so used to posting on less anonymous sites. Travis is NOT my chosen name. I HATE that name. He KNOWS what name I want to be called. He is saying he will only call me my dead name unless I agree to his ultimatum and take the name he wants. It's just him still trying to control me

EDIT: deadname* not dadname lmao
I mean not really he told me he will only call me my deadname unless I pick that ugly ass travis name. I forgot to include it but my name is NOT Travis and I never want that to be my name lmao
Sure, I just sent you the link.
Facts don't matter. He's looking for confirmation of pre-existing opinions. If you showed d him the detransition rate is 1-2% and a chunk of that is social in nature, not medical, so we have 98%+ trans people are happy with their transition he would find another bullshit story to counter it. It's sadly a waste of your time.

You could say something like ""good for them, I'm glad they figured out who they were. It's hard to come out, it's hard to transition, it's also got to be hard to detransition. Luckily only 1-2% of people that transition feel that it wasn't the right choice. In general people should be given the opportunity to figure themselves out, with support and care and understanding, right daddio?"" or 10 hours of cats, whatever you think works best lol.
That wud be funny if she sent that lol
My heart belongs to the cat parade ❤️🙉
Is he religious? Cuz if so, Christianity happened. Religion will turn a person's brain to fucking mush.
my only reply would be “fox news? Seriously? Fox News? You couldn’t do any better than this? Fox News? Honestly come on now.” 

Don’t even try and explain why. Just completely discredit the source and let him process needing to find a source of information if he wants to have real discourse with you.
He sounds like the type who would say “listen to both sides” as a copout so he can agree with the side that feeds his preexisting biases instead of growing as a person. 

Tbh he’s being a massive asshole. He should be listening to you, not some Uncle Toms who Fox News dug up. If he wants more perspectives he should be listening directly to trans people, not the favorite examples of an entertainment outlet that hates us. 

I’m really sorry. If you’re old enough I’d recommend cutting him out of your life before any more of his disgusting views seep into you.
I don’t presume to know your relationship with your parents but I’ve definitely been careful with mine to add something like - “I know that any of the emotions you are feeling around this are because you love me and you want the best for me, but….” Insert argument.


My experience is that any defensiveness that they have often stems from thinking that we aren’t aware that they are acting from a place of love. Worry is a shitty way to express love. But it’s sort of natural for many parents. 

Anyway, addressing that maaaaay bypass some defensiveness. May not. Just thought I’d offer
yeah, ofc <3
I second this. Jamie's 10 year transition video always makes me tear up and it's clear how much happier he is nowadays :D
another fun article to send! “statistics for how many men cheat on their spouse”
Welp there’s also the option to be passive aggressive. Depending how petty u wanna be u could send the whole study and say something like “I can sum it up for you if you need to, it needs actual reading comprehension”
Isnt bottom growth also permanent?
Honestly what's best for you isn't for other people to decide, but you yourself.

I personally will be going no contact the instant that I can do so. Completely and totally, I value respect and my personal autonomy, and I have plenty of people who love me and respect me so I don't really feel any need to be around my relatives who do their best to bring me down.

But realistically you do need to at the very minimum set boundaries or you're just going to end up with a lot more emotional pain than needed. Like if you don't want to cut him out then it's probably in your best interest to set real boundaries with actual consequences or the behavior will not change and you'll just have to continue to deal with the disrespectful hateful nonsense he's sent you.
Uh I'm not suicidal at all fyi but someone reported me saying that I was. Hope it was not because of this comment
My parents have been relatively supportive to my coming out, but I have many trans friends whos parents are nothing short of evil, so I unfortunately have a lot of experience in this department :( if you want to talk about course of action I'd love to, i like helping people :D
I have no clue 😭😭
I think it's about the same person but this is her personal YouTube channel. [Alia's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/AliaIsmail)
Exactly
Ohhhhh well that is a completely different story then. My parents pulled similar and I just kept passively correcting and annoying them it hasn't fully worked. I hope it goes better for you eventually
That is true
Op uses he/him btw
He's not but he is republican so I guess it was inevitable. It just sucks cause despite that we had multiple conversations that sounded like he was really starting to understand me and trans people in general:/ I was weary but of course everyone tells me I need to be fair/show some grace and give him time to understand and accept this. But the more time passes, the LESS accepting he is. 


My mom is the heavy Catholic but even she is making an effort.
Yet, most scholars study things like religion and some of the great literatures of the old and new world are religious texts or influenced by. Maybe, its something else.
He's such a hypocrite because he's always crying about biased news sources and it's like my brother in Christ you watch FOX NEWS!!!
It is! Tho tbh I've barely had much of that and also feel weird discussing genitals with my dad so I didn't say much on that I don't think. I mentioned it happened but he's so dumb he probably doesn't even know what or where the clitoris is 🤣 much less how it could grow
Thanks homie 😔❤️ I'm just gonna have to set an aggressive boundary which is hard for me. I always feel bad correcting people for some reason 😓 sorry you have a difficult time too
OK sorry
Sounds like your dad has fallen to the conservative cult. Unfortunately, my entire family is in that cult and there is no way that I know of to get them to see the light. My mom told me I was going to hell and my dad compared me to a pedophile when I came out, so I'm right there with you.
That just gives red flags. Sounds like he MIGHT be engaging in terf or GC spaces if he's gradually getting less and less supportive. Caelan Conrad made a very extensive 3 part video series about this, they had a section in the first or second video about parents who want to learn how to support their trans child but end up getting sucked into GC communities. If you have the energy for these videos it's a very interesting watch/listen although highly triggering.

I don't really have any advice when it comes to this cause transphobes will turn anything you say against you to shut you up and make you stop being trans and it's really hard to reason with. But I wish you the best of luck, hang in there bud.
Not to say that there aren't definitely Republicans like this, but I am a republican and I'd never think of sending that to someone I claim to care about, I wouldn't even send it to someone I hate, because everyone, even those who are garbage, deserve the common decency of not being an ass for no reason, but if you find a link (I'm sure there's thousands out there) I'd definitely send one, because all you're doing is putting the shoe on the other foot, and there's nothing wrong with that, stay strong Royal figure (not sure how you identify but if I were to guess I'd say male?) And know that you're loved, and amazing
My parents are p liberal but they send me stuff like this too all under the „we just want you to be safe“ because look people regret it so you will too. Very frustrating
Just say “fox news is the conservatives equivalent of CNN” and watch his brain twist itself into knots
Shit. That fucking sucks. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Sorry that happened to you 😔 honestly with all the type of things fox news reports and I'm surprised he hasn't accused me of being a pedophile yet 🙄 he still has stuff of mine (I moved to a diff state) so I want those things back but after that I'm probably just gonna stop talking to him after that. I don't want to unload a bunch on you but my hope is I can find someone to come with me so I don't have to see him in person all alone
Mine wanted to die, so there’s that. Idk what’s worse.

Oh wait, I’m still in the closet after 5 1/2 years.
I doubt this will give you comfort but just know that there are Republicans and conservatives who are trying to get in and change views on certain things, and who do want the LGBTQIA+ community to feel loved and safe
Thank you 🥺 it's ironic that they say the trans cult makes you trans but they are the cult that's making people hateful. 

Luckily, my dad and I live in separate states. It's not super far but it's a long enough drive that he's not gonna put in the effort to just show up or something. So I think I'll just send a text of stuff I would genuinely like any supportive family member to watch to better understand me and just be like. Listen. I know what this biased news sources are saying and I'm not changing my mind. You can either be supportive or you can get lost 🤷🏼‍♂️
Thank you sm! 🥺 Also ur correct I'm a trans guy haha so King is good ☺️



Tbh I was just saying this to a friend. My dad is heavily Republican in that he always listens to Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, fox news, etc, totally buys into everything, always votes red, etc. He digs his heels in on most topics. But I don't think he hates trans people in that he would be loudly agreeing with the current events surrounding trans people. I don't think he cares enough about trans people generally existing to hate all of them. A Republican candidates views on trans people isn't a deciding factor for him (I don't think mf doesn't even think trans ppl are real lol) 



The problem is now he has a trans CHILD and that simply CANT be right cause he ""KNOWS"" his kid! This is less about how wrong trans people are and more about how it shouldn't be directly affecting him, ykwim? So he will use his sources to try and convince me I'm of the population of trans folks who will ultimately regret this and cry to my dad about how he should've stopped me or something weird like that.
I'm used to it now. I've learned that my family only really loves the version of me they have in their heads, not the real me. They only love me so far as I can make them look like good parents/ siblings. In fact, the only family that supports me is my brother who is also estranged from the rest of my family, so now we found solidarity in being the outcasts.
So sorry, you’re going through this.

If you send anything back, not likely to this, show him C. Jenner (no idea how to spell that gal’s name, but basically that transwoman who hangs with Terfs x/ ) on that channel. 

Like if they’re soooooo convinced on all the crap they say, why keep on a trans person. Let alone the major benefits they give their LGBTQAI+ employees.

(The answer to rhetorical question because want to include sources for anyone who needs a springboard for those dealing with “red-pilled” family members and/or dealing with gaslighting) 

One reason that I can see is because anti-trans/LGBTQAI+ speech it’s all profitable clickbait and they believe/know their viewers are dumb. Carlson even admitted on a far-right podcast that he lies to his viewers for “their own good.” And Fox’s lawyers say he can’t be believed 

https://www.npr.org/2020/09/29/917747123/you-literally-cant-believe-the-facts-tucker-carlson-tells-you-so-say-fox-s-lawye

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-admits-lying-on-show_n_613fb9bee4b09519c5085ebd

Even the mask/vaccine mandates are uber strict at Fox despite all the anti-mask rhetoric/vaccine rhetoric.

And then there was the incident of them recommending hormone therapy as a cure to Covid.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/ivermectin-fans-are-back-with-even-weirder-drugs-for-your-covid-19-including-hormone-therapy

https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/foxs-vaccine-criticism-focuses-attention-policy-80067696

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/fox-corp-staffers-are-fed-up-with-fox-news-hateful-lgbtq-coverage

These links should also have links to original sources. And “Anchorman 2” is basically a satire making fun of how Fox got started in the first place, including being set up by an Australian businessman.
I’ve only recently discovered myself, but am terrified to open up to my family
There most certainly is. Unfortunately I was stereotyping hard, I apologize for that. Unfortunately the republicans and conservatives that get all the airtime and are the loudest are the worst ones. There are good people in most groups and that includes conservatism.
This is weird to say but I'm so glad to hear you don't live with your dad hahaha! I was worried. Still sucks but oh goodness does that take a weight off one's shoulders. I can't begin to imagine how awful trans kids have it when they still live with their unsupportive families... (I came out to myself and my close circles after I moved out for college, everyone is ok with it so I've had it easy on that part honestly)

But yeah I think that's the best way to go with unsupportive people... Setting that boundary and the consequences of breaking that boundary (for example restricting or completely cutting contact) + following through those consequences is very important. Sometimes it's the only way parents will realize that they do still want their child in their life and so they have to do the work to keep them in their life.
It seems that in his weird little world he's trying to protect you, so at least you know he loves you in his own weird way, not that it matters because he's actively hurting you in doing this
Thanks so much for all of this! It's so weird how they openly admit to lying to rile people up and it still works 😭 

It's been a long time since I watched anchorman 2 but kinda wanna watch it again now that you say that 🤣
Good luck!
I agree, and I wish that those of us who want people to feel seen and loved could get some as well
I'm definitely VERY lucky wrt being openly trans and coming out and all that. I went to art school in a very progressive town with a lot of other openly trans kids, so I was also out to close friends who accepted me without question. I did however wait to move to a new state to come out to my family and start HRT, specifically because of my dad. Before now I was living in our family house alone but paying my dad rent. I definitely wanted out of that situation as fast as possible cause I did NOT need my dad to hold also being my landlord above my head. Plus he would just show up unannounced all the time 🥴

I feel a lot of guilt and that's because my two siblings stopped speaking to my dad for personal reasons. I mean aside from transphobia he isn't a good dad to his 1 cishet daughter lol. He's definitely a narcissist. I feel a lot of pressure though cause I'm the last kid he talks to and I'm afraid he might go beserk or something if all his kids cut him off. I know it's not my responsibility but would my mom and her family understand that? And I'm afraid of the whole extended family turning me into that villainous trans kid that hates his parents for not immediately accepting him without question. Again I KNOW it would be probably better to cut them all out but I have a really BIG family yanno? 😓 Idk sorry for venting so much haha
Yeah I did reply to him and just gave him the benefit of the doubt that it comes from a good place. my dad shows many narcissistic tendencies and in those cases everything they do is ""out of love"" even if it's really messed up traumatizing shit. Neither of my siblings talk to him and they arent when queer so probably says a lot more than I could. He treats each of us in very specific ways. Ex I'm the golden child, or I was. It's a very weird boat to be in. The golden child who terrifically failed and disappointed his dad 😂😓
Will Ferrell is great! 

He actually started out as a journalism major too. Anchorman and Talladega Knights are part of what he calls the “mediocre man” trilogy which is designed to be satire of white, cishet male privilege from a white, cishet male 🤣 
(And wouldn’t be surprised if it also informed his George W. Bush parody on SNL)
Hey man that's ok don't be sorry for venting, that's quite a lot you got on your shoulders yeah. 🥺 I'm glad you're in a place where your dad holds no power over your livelihood. That said he sounds like a god awful human being lol and it's definitely not your responsibility to keep in touch with him if it's affecting you negatively and he won't do anything to improve. Cutting him out doesn't mean you have to cut out your whole family, and while you could explain to them why you did, you also don't owe them any explanation if you don't want to explain yourself. 

You said your mother was making an effort to support you, wasn't she? You should keep building on that and guide her through learning to properly support you as a trans person, same for extended family members who are supportive. You might not be able to stop rumors from spreading and bigots from being bigoted, but despite it you can upkeep good relationships with people who genuinely care about you, will make effort to be good to you and will stand for you no matter what. I really don't know what your relationship with your extended family is, but you have the right to pick and choose who gets to be in your life, how often you see them, what you talk about and etc., and who doesn't get to be in your life at all. What the rest think doesn't matter. Your wellbeing comes first. And if you can find those in your extended family who will hear you and support you, those are your allies and who knows, they might be able to change others' minds and cut the rumors short.
Well, for what it's worth im proud of you, it takes a lot to stand up and day ""this is who I am. This is who I want to be. And no one can tell me otherwise."" Much love brother
Omg that's so awesome I didn't know that! I've always unironically liked anchorman 😂
Thank you 🥺🥺😭❤️❤️ that means a lot

my dad took me clothes shopping at men’s clothing stores [ftm]	"after school my dad asked if i wanted to go down to the malls in the closest city to go shopping for clothes as he just got a new job. when we went we went to men-targeted clothing stores and everytime he talked to the cashiers he used he/him pronouns! my dad has always been relatively supportive of my transition but this has been the first time he’s taken me shopping to the same stores as him and has consistently used the correct pronouns. he even called me his son!! i’m so amazingly elated that i’m shaking as i write this!! i almost feel like i’m about to cry from joy. this is the most euphoria i’ve felt since getting my binder!

hoping that anyone who reads this gets an experience like this soon because it feels amazing!!

edit: thank you for all of your wonderful comments and stories of your own! i love reading moments like these that have happened in others lives!! also to everyone who asked me to compliment my dad for them, he asked me to say for him, “thank you all and hope your transitions go well.” :)"	"That’s awesome I’m so glad this is happening to you !
Congrats man! I would hug him so tight. You are lucky. Take care
I'm very happy you have the support you need!
Congrats my man! May the support and love of your father stay FOREVERRRRR!!
You have a great dad. I’m glad you got to spend time together bonding as men.
Aww I absolutely love hearing these stories. The first time my extremely conservative mother saw me after I started presenting as a woman we sat on her bed drinking and talking for a while and she couldn't help but see me as her daughter. She spoke to me in a way that was both familiar because I have a cis sister but new because I had never experienced it. When I left that night she hugged me and told me she was happy I was her daughter 🥲. Congrats I know how great it feels.
OP this is wonderful and I'm so happy for you! My da is not quite this far with me yet (MTF) but he's always been a big advocate for my music and has been suggesting new songs to learn that'll help strengthen my high range, so I'll take it as his own weird kind of support
That's incredible op!! I (ftx/ftm) got secondhand euphoria from this post, so thank you so much!
That's so wholesome. Good job dad!
Aww 🥺 I wish my mom did this with me but the female version
This is awesome!!! I love this for you man! Must be really cool, this made me smile. Here's to all the nice dads in the world!
Oooh look at you joining the patriarchy! lol. As a trans woman I shrink from this one but it sounds like you had an amazing experience and have a good father. The closest I can come to this is I was chatting with a woman friend and a woman friend of hers who bumped into us thought I was her mum! The cheek. I 'm not that old. lol.

Good luck young shaver!
This felt so cringy until I realized you were trans masc. So excited for you. That's really sweet. Your dad sounds awesome.
Thanks for sharing this with us! What an incredibly joyful experience!
Really that's sounds good
im so happy for you, it reminds me of my awesome mom who has offered many of her old cothes to me like dresses and stuff and she has offered to teach me how to put on makeup and pluck eyebrows, and she has also bought me some feminine clothes for me.
That's super.
that’s awesome :) you should thank him!! it will mean as much to him that he’s being a good father as the shopping was to you
I'm so happy for you!!! Your dad seems so amazing
I am really glad that there are people like your father.

I am really happy for you bro
Tell your dad I think he's a legend
Thats so cool, i hope you get some nice, manly, clothes that you like
aww thats so great. congrats
this is seriously the coolest thing ever, i wish my dad had gotten to do that with me. he called me his son one (1) time and it was like the best thing ever so i totally understand
Your dad is freaking awesome!
I just told my sister yesterday that I'm transitioning (mtf), and today I sent her a picture of my hair getting longer and she said I look gorgeous. I love my family
I’m literally there with you shaking from the joy I feel for you 🥺💓
aww, thats so sweet!
I was *very* surprised too. I think seeing how happy I am is what made her accept me. She and I have always had more similar personalities and tastes than she and my sister too so I think it made it easier for her to understand me because I am **so** this woman's daughter lol. Also I'm so glad she won't bring up Trump or politics around me anymore.
this made me smile :)

i havent come out to my mother but i am planning to, this year. and i hope things between us dont change... but even if they do, seeing that even a conservative parent is eventually accepting her daughter, really gave me some hope.

i guess when there's true love, unconditional love; when a parent truly loves their child, nothing will come in the way, even if things get tough and it takes long.
You seem like a lovely person and I hope it goes well for you! I mean things did change between my mom and I because it is different being a daughter rather than a son, but if anything we're closer now than we were before. 

My mother was not always a great parent but she does love her family unconditionally. It took her about 6 months to get to the point where she was willing to see me in person after I came out to her but I know now that she was committed to being my mother no matter what(though I did not know that last part during those six months and was very worried she could never accept me)
thank you so much :)

i'm so glad that your mother finally accepted you! must have been such a relief when she met you again after those six months...
Finally feeling like myself in front of her was so freeing after waiting that long. Hanging out with her as her oldest daughter for the first time will always be one of my favorite memories. She had never been so candid about my sister either and it was *hilarious*.

As a child, did you have any early “warning signs” that you would end up being trans?	"I’m FTM. I was always a “tomboy”, but so are a lot of little girls, trans or not, so I’ll give a more specific example:

When I was really little (less than 10 years old) I loved Club Penguin. I would “”secretly”” make penguins with male usernames like xx_SK8ER_BOY_xx and do as young boys did and ask girl penguins to be my girlfriend. We went on pretend pizza dates and sent heart emojis. 

I remember I felt very scandalous playing as a boy penguin! I felt like I was being sneaky, like I was breaking a rule and at any moment I could get caught and be in trouble. But I also felt a HUGE rush of joy when other players referred to me with he/him pronouns or any sort of male-gendered language, so I kept doing it. 

What about you? What were some of your early trans “warning signs”?"	"I always assumed I picked male characters because I was attracted to men and liked to look at them, but now I realize it’s because I am a man and also men are hot.
Well, since theirs a pic of the simpsons... Todd once said to his father ""I'm jealous about girls cause they can wear dresses"" that triggert me so much, I felt him ^^ I was like 12 years old at that time
Well I always picked female characters in games cuz they felt great to me and I felt like I could associate myself closer to them
The famous question from Professor Oak. 'Are you a boy or a girl?' and picking girl.
The earliest was when I was about 8 and my 2nd grade teachers used to always say: ""I need a strong BOY to pick up these chairs"" or something along those lines. And as an AFAB, that kinda irked me IDK. I was like: ""If I was a man I could pick up those chairs."" I was just uncomfortable with that whole idea that ""Men need to be strong and women need to dainty"" since the beginning I guess. I thought nothing of it.
Fast forward about 4 years later, I find myself on role-playing forums (I was 12. Don't judge.) And I notice I would always role-play as men and never women. I would get so worked up if someone referred to me with she/her pronouns also, despite me being AFAB. Looking back at it now, I don't see how younger me couldn't take a hint.
>On a Halloween when I was 5 or 6 I was dressed up by one of my grandmothers as a girl in a flowery dress and I loved it
>At a birthday party I attended when I was 8 I pretended to be asleep on the trampoline because I heard some of the kids there wanted to put makeup on me when they had the chance
>I always understood and got along with girls more than guys growing up
>multiple times in my childhood I had audibly said “I wish I was a girl”
>I felt gross when my parental units would talk to me about “being a man” growing up
>whether I was heavyset or thin I always felt gross in my own body
There’s more but that’s most of the stuff from childhood. Maybe someone out there can relate <3
I always felt odd in dresses and skirts, but my parents of course made me wear them to church. And I cut off my hair A LOT, even though everybody said my long hair was so nice and stuff. I hated Barbie, rather played with cars and stuff, always got along with guys better…

Yeah i know these are not signs for everyone having the, to be trans but I should have had a second thought anyway.
I've always liked 'the tell' of *not being gay, but the girls let me get dressed in the same lockerroom as them when I was a teen*. Heck, even they knew I wasn't a typical fella. All other guys that tried that got kicked in the nuts.
im a writer—recently found some of my old, OLD drafts (like, middle school)… i queerbaited myself reading them. 11 year old me was writing some the queerest characters and concepts and then shoving them into cishet boxes like there was tomorrow, it’s wild to look at lol
I wanted Ranma's power to switch boy/girl at will (from the manga Ranma ½)
When I was 10 or so, my parents told me what they would have named me if I was AMAB. My first thought was “you should’ve just named me that anyway, that’s much better than my name”. The day I realized I was trans, I chose that name as my new name lol
Oh god okay here’s some of mine:

-Playing as females in games where I can choose and actively seeking out games where I played exclusively as a female (Bayonetta, Celeste, etc.)

-Several old fanfics I wrote (cringe I know) that were self-insert were always from the perspective of a female version of me. 

-When I was young, I had a weird fascination for high heels. To this day, I can’t explain it other than my sub-conscious wishing I could wear those and look pretty. 

I’ve asked my friends multiple times how it took me so long to figure this out.
In retrospect, I just never felt tied to any gender. I didn't care, I thought it was cool when people thought I was a boy. I never had very gendered interests, I had Barbies but I never 'played' with them, I just liked collecting. I liked wrestling more than anything. I just always liked to come off as androgynous and never thought much of it.
I always play female characters. Once I ""borrowed"" panties from my mom and wore them on a family trip 🤫
But I think I’m too old, too fat and to married with children to follow this path. Maybe in a next life 🥲
There’s a picture somewhere out there of me (mtf) in a ballet costume. I was probably around 4 or 5 but it was something I did frequently
When I was little the most popular games were Pokemon and runescape. I thought I had convince myself that if I were to play the game for quite a while then I would much rather look at a female character as opposed to my agab. It wasn’t until someone asked me in Rs “are you a girl?” That I really pondered why I played as female. I had no clue what “transgender” meant during that time, so I had no way of describing it.
I would avoid doing anything that could be seen as ""girly"". I thought being girly was cringe.

Before cutting it short, I ALWAYS wore a high ponytail with no extra strands of anything. It was completely flat. I would never leave the house with my hair done differently aka drawing attention to my hair by being girlier.

After switching schools (I was about 11), I tried to fit in with the boys at the new school. I even sat at an unofficial all-boys table at lunch. All of them looked at me weird. They even asked me if I don't feel weird sitting there. Felt embarrassed, didn't know why I couldn't sit with them and picked a new spot at the girls' table.

Mom picked me a first bra-like thing and wanted me to put it on. When I had it on, she came to look and also called in dad to see. Felt so fucking weird and embarrassed. They were like proud but I was obviously not.

I would often forget that I have to cover my top. When the windows are open for example.

In kindergarten when playing the ""home/family"" game I was always the cat. Sometimes dad too bc no one else particularly wanted to be the dad but I had nothing against that.

When I got hit in the ""balls"" I said ""ouch my balls"" once bc it was something that the cool older guys and my friend said. Ofc they looked at me weird and mocked me (""you don't have balls"" ""she has balls haha""). Well I didn't know what it meant but knew that boys say it and I said it to be like the boys.
as a 4-8 year old i often went round my nana's with my cousins (both afab) and wore her clothes, i also liked playing with my cousins' dolls and other 'typically feminine' toys lol
I watched a lot of girls shows when I was younger. I had no idea why I watched them over other shows but I did know I enjoyed them more than other shows. If only I knew what being trans was.
The most formative I think is when I was at a family friend's house playing with their daughter and we played dress up and I got super upset when my parents made me take off the dress I was wearing.

But I remember being super jealous around school dance season of all the girls getting to wear beautiful dresses and me just putzing around in my sausage body and Ill fitting dress shirt.
Me but I always pick the wamens
I usually pick male characters cause half the time the female ones are too hyperfeminized for my taste
I'm non binary/demigirlflux. Here's some of mine: 

Hating mirrors. 

Not liking my given name and wanting to change it. 

Not liking wearing makeup. 

I didn't like having my picture taken. 

I was uncomfortable with my chest and hated wearing bras. I also wanted to wear boxers. 

I felt out of place from the boys and girls at school. 

I always felt uncomfortable in dresses.
Mine go back as far as age 5 I remember being jealous that I couldn’t be called beautiful because I was a “boy” and like I always wanted to be a tomgirl cuz I thought there was a thing and then I held women’s clothes up to me including bras in fitting rooms
And then i always wanted to participate in girl things 
Looking back there’s so many 
 I always played as a girl in games 
I could go on and on
The trans urge to hesitate when having to choose between male and female avatars in games as a child
When I was like 11 or 12 I would sneak into my sisters room when she was still at school (I’d get home first) and steal her clothes to wear in my own room. There’s probably others but I got amnesia at a young age too so I don’t remember.
I think for me it was the opposite. When I was very little I was very feminine but with time (aggression) I started to hide, and I forced masculinity on me for a long time. I remember even picking female characters on overwatch made me uncomfortable because I felt like I was doing something wrong. Thankfully shrooms opened my eyes again and I'm starting hrt on monday and I'm super excited! It's been really hard letting go of that ""protective"" layer of masculinity I build to shield myself, but it's also been very freeing and somewhat peaceful.
Kinda odd but I would get very passionate about gender equality and like obviously don’t do misogyny but it 100% came more so from a place that I didn’t want to be treated *equally* to boys, I wanted to be treated *as* a boy,,,,,
I felt like I HAD to choose the girl avatar because if I didn’t pick one that matched how I was perceived I would be found out and get in trouble or something but I always liked the boy avatar better
Id always choose the male characters in Pokémon cause I didn’t identify with the female avatars lol

I also would run around without a shirt on and get angry when my sister would tell me I’d have to put a shirt on cause I was a girl
I used to wear whatever clothes I wanted. Just like putting stuff on never caring about what gender was supposed to wear it.
I chose the female option in Pokémon games because it “gave more customization”. Sure…
same thing except with female characters 

and wishing that was able to wear a dress like my cousins
i used to speak out on how i loved how cute a girl was, their makeup was pretty, loved her dress, and my parents thought i had a crush on her when i didnt..

also because i never felt comfortable with my shirt off not covering my chest area…

im not trans but i want to be.. my parents are transphobic so im waiting till 18 :)
I would play fable 2 as a male character and speed run to the end of the game to drink the permanent gender change potion. I played through fable 2 like 40 times in high school
Only very very subtle hints. Hung out with people of the opposite gender, sudden fixation with my leg hair, growing my hair out long when i was young, that one photo of me wearing a dress and clip-on butterfly wings...
I would always imagine myself as an adult being a woman. I thought this was my “dream woman” nope just my dream self💅
Multiple, though the big stand out looking back was when I was probably 10-11 my friend’s sisters “forced” me to wear girls clothes and I remember saying something like “oh you better not make me wear THOSE shoes” when obviously that would make them inevitably put them on me. 

So obvious looking back, but only time I ever saw any gender nonconformity was on like Jerry Springer or played as a joke in movies (born in 93)
Hahaha I had so many ""warning signs"" and I'm also ftm. Here's some: very tomboy growing up, only chose male characters in games, hated anything that was ""girly""/pink or fem clothing as a kid, kept my hair short my whole childhood, wore my dad and brothers clothes whenever I could, only hung out with boys, did male dominated hobbies, wouldn't get upset when people would say I look like a little boy, when there were times to choose a name in games or nicknames for any reason they were always very masculine names. There are more, including the big one of straight up telling my mom that she ""birthed me wrong"" whenever anything was wrong as a child. My family wasn't very surprised when I came out as trans but that doesn't mean they were supportive either.
Don’t worry, I was in the same train
My friend, Milo told me he was trans and something just clicked in my head and said “holy shit, that’s me isn’t??” 
I was aware of what being trans was and yet it was until he said he was that it just made sense
And so I began my search and I asked my best friend (cis girl) and told her about my dysphoria and she said she’d never felt like that ever
And it was like “I guess I’m a boy now”
I always used to find dresses interesting. I would often hope that I would dream about wearing one since I couldn't do that in real life
I got way too much of a connection to Vi when she came out 10 years ago

Now I understand why I vibe with the steam-punk-rock violent lesbian
Being confused whenever a male character was cursed to be female for whatever magic reason

""Why are they so upset about it? Honestly I wouldn't mind!""
When I was in elementary school, I always wanted to do the ""boy"" things like helping the teacher pick up the chairs bc ""only strong boys can lift them"". I literally convinced my mom to put me in boxing classes because I wanted to be strong enough to be included in boy stuff. It worked because my teachers would always say they needed ""strong boys AND [deadname]"" after this. There were a lot more signs, this one is just the earliest that I can remember.
I always picked male characters. Always made my sim secretly a male. In online chat rooms I would call myself “Jay” usually. No where close to my deadname either lol
For a few years for Halloween I would dress up as male characters, Goliath from Gargoyles, Captain Jack Sparrow, John Cena, Robin Hood. I remember thinking ""it's the one day I can present myself as male,"" since I'm AFAB. I also preferred to wear boys clothes (or my dad's old clothes) until I was told to ""dress more feminine,"" which really bummed me out--form fitting, yuck.
I really liked buttercup from power puff girls and I was absolutely ADAMANT that she was a boy (my tiny adolescent brain did not even make the connection that the title of the show literally included the word ‘girls’ lmao). I was genuinely upset when I found out she wasn’t a boy and I basically headcanoned her as trans before I even had any idea that trans people existed.
I had a similar experience with Club Penguin, actually. I played with a penguin that was simply a penguin. I saw him as a boy but didn't think much of it because I guess it just made sense in my head.
i was a really big book nerd as a kid, and one time i asked my friends if it was weird that if I had a choice I would want to be like Ron from Harry Potter instead of Hermione. I thought maybe they would relate to it but they all thought it was weird and it really confused me 😭
We knew from the get go.  Our host absorbed how our family and society was treating us.  

Iykyk.
I always felt forced to, never considered what would happen if I made female characters
I’m a trans lesbian. I love butts and have always wanted one of my own. I played women in games to watch their butts when they walk 🤷🏻‍♀️ I wish I could watch my butt when I walk
My mom said that if I played with a my dick it would fall off....welp you see how that turned out
A very close friend of mine at a curtain point came out as trans to me and I wasn’t quite mature enough to grasp the concept or find much importance from what they were telling me

Having really long hair as a kid meant I was compared to girls a lot whether by my parents or just people accidentally calling me a girl after seeing me from a distance and so on..

Being told about what trans people were I guess and being questioned on it maybe idk am a stupid little brain.. :P
Mom kept having to stop me from putting play dough peepee’s In my pants
Im MtF, and This is totally what I did before I even knew. Even my DnD characters were (mostly) female
When I was in elementary school, there was a playground game we would play that was separated by boys and girls, I always wanted to be on the girls team, and wished they could turn me into a girl.
I would always pick female character and then also yeah my closest friends were mostly girls that all eventually became lesbians lmao.
I always loved to watch a documentary about trans kids
(MtF) Well for me, I feel like I had warning signs for both. Like, I've always preferred feminine fashion, but I love fight choreography which is usually seen as more masculine. I always loved cute things like stuffed animals, but I collect swords and weapons, so, I always was (and still am) a little confused on how I ended up here
It's funny how I doubted I'm trans for so long even after learning the word.

I'd play with Barbies and girls toys not because I actually cared one way or the other but I knew it was ""for girls"" so I purposely played with them in front of people.

Even younger I asked my dad if I could wear a dress and he said to ask mom and she said no and I cried.

Basically I think I'm trans (starting hrt soon!)
In middle-high school me and my dad went to alot of comic conventions (comiccon wondercon comicaze etc.) and we always wanted to do cosplay, but I could never find a character to do because, “all the male characters are so boring, and I dont wanna genderbend a female character, I just wanna look like the girl character”. And yet, according to my dad:

“There were no signs!”
Always choosing female game characters, pretty much never played with cars, always watched wedding story and baby story when I got the chance.

Probably too late for my true goal
Nah I felt like there was so genuinely wrong with me that I kept all that under high security until I was like 12/13
Does telling my parents I wanted to be a girl multiple times between ages 4 and 7 count?
i went around telling other kids i secretly had a penis and my real name was max… looking back i dont think that’s cisgender child behaviour
They were lot of signs…
1. Only want to pee like my brother
2. Being uncomfortable in only girl spaces
3. Wanting only male toys (anything traditionally masculine)
When I was like 10 I used to sneak into my parents' room to try on my mom's bras with two Mr. Potatoheads on my chest. Really don't know how I missed that one.
Yeah I would always choose female avatars when ever possible. Relatable
Similar to you, I'd go on like Roblox and Moviestarplanet (God that place was a nightmare) and specifically choose male avatars. Also whenever we did class plays and stuff in elementary school or reading aloud in middle school I would always volunteer to read the men's parts. 
Then later it was more like ""I wonder what it would be like to be a boy... to not have periods, that would be cool, not having to shave too... growing a beard, having a flat chest..."" I thought this pretty much every day in middle school and ended up desperately wanting it. Then I realized I was a guy. The more you know.
When I every play a game to select characters gender I picked female because they always had more hours and attention then the males but now I can say that is true but also I don’t like being a male
MtF and I feel this. Always picked femme characters and thought I was just attracted to them. Which I was but there was always this added layer of gender envy. Same for some of my fav characters in TV shows
I only chose female characters. Then I wanted breasts. Then I thought “what if I was born with a vagina/born a girl.” Now I dress like a girl. And want to be one. But also want to be male, so I’m still technically trans, just NB.
To be honest I don’t trust any ‘early warning signs’ because I fear they can just be confirmation bias.
Couple here early in elementry school. (MTF)
   - Felt eurphoria when I snuck into the girls bathroom; I didnt understand it at the time but that is how I would describe the feeling now.
  - Told my Dad when I was about 10 that I wanted to be a girl but didnt understand why. He naturally pushed for an answer so I gave him one that was convient to rationalise away because I felt he would be mad if I didnt. I found out earlier this year, when I came out, that he never told my Mom about it.
  - I always fought wearing boy dress clothes telling my parents that Ididnt like dress pants/shirts because they were ichy. I didn't put that together until a few months after coming out, my Mom mentioned it to me like three weeks ago.
I’m transfem. I always had to try hard to be toxic masculine to override the stigma i got from being my authentic self as a young child. I grew up jealous of my cousins who are cis women when they were going through puberty bc they got to wear lipstick, colorful dresses, nail polish, heels, and makeup and i was stuck with “boy clothes” and even though i have nothing against guy fashion, it really works for sone other men, but i felt like I’ve always felt like i was *living in drag* when I conform to the clothing stereotypes of what i pretended to be for most of my life (a cis het religious guy)
I always played girl characters and after I came out I was replaying KotOR and had a character named Krista, my name, from like 13 years earlier 🙃
Yep
I’ve always worn more masculine stuff when I was younger and Ive always felt uncomfortable when wearing feminine stuff. I’m not as uncomfortable anymore but I still don’t like wearing dresses. But now if I’m playing a game I always choose male or if I want to I choose female but I dress up in masculine clothes.
I always like wearing girls clothes and sneakers but I would take them from the trash for the next door neighbors as a teen. I also want to keep my room pink  when we moved to a small town in SD IN 2007. Imy self did not realize I was trans till 2017.
Edit: my mom would always take then from me but it never really stopped. Also I wore shorts shorts In college mom 2as not to keen. Now I am who I am even if she does not like it
Yeah at like 5 years old I begged my father for a boy pitate costume I saw at the store. I legit remember it like it was yesterday. I put it on as soon as we got to my grandpas house.
I had a childhood friend that I would always tell that he's gay. He would never believe me but would always respond with ""and you're trans"", I never believed him either. A couple years forward he's gay and i'm trans.

Also:

I remember being really sad when I was told I'm no longer allowed to go around shirtless.
I always picked male characters in videogames.
Always had guy friends if any.
Always absolutely despised feminine clothes.
""Pretended to be a boy"" online.
People on discord would always ""mistake"" me for a boy and tell me I sound like one and for some reason (now I know what reason) I would get really happy each time that happened. 
Always took more interest in things my male peers took interest in.
Loved to (still do) play football (⚽️)
All my plushies ""were boys"".
I remember getting very upset when my brother got hotwheels for christmas and I got some lame ass dolls.
Picking boy in pokemon felt illegal but i loved it
When I was really little I would make my best friend and I wear matching tutus when we’d play dress up, and steal my moms heels. I used to only be interested in female characters to idolize, I hated cutting my hair, etc.
Male avatars, and my main ocs were all male or masc.
I only wanted old clothes from my brother and though my sisters tried to give me clothes, I never took them.
same here but im MTF, so femme characters on my end, and also women are hot
I played the hell out of Club Penguin. When I finally got a membership for Christmas, I only got girl clothes from the shop, and pretended to be a girl. If one of my friends found me, I told them I was ""in disguise"" for the Penguin Secret Agency.
I've never been happy with the stereotype that trans people played the other sex in video games. 

I aggressively chose the most masculine character because I wanted to fit in and be the coolest guy I could. Looking back it's because I never felt like I fit in as a guy with my friends at the time. 

Now and just before I cracked I expressed myself through the character creation more.

I think the real take away with video game character creators and transgender people is that we have more of a personal stake in what we choose to represent ourselves as online once we get the chance.
I got called a lesbian once and went home sobbing and extremely upset. I knew what lesbians were and I didn't think being a lesbian was a bad thing. But it really upset me being called one. 

Turns out I like women in a straight way :)
Can you imagine my confusion when I realised (MTF) but I had been picking female characters because, yes, they are nice to look at (also Bi).
Was raised with rocky horror...
I always looked at the guys together with their friends, having fun at my school and thinking that I belong in that group. I am bigender now. (Man and woman)
I drew myself as a girl multiple times for dnd and fursona characters in my early highschool years
Seeing those god awful ""is it a man"" Jerry Springer episodes and being like ""HOLY SHIT THATS AN OPTION?""
The same thing, but i was a female penguim with my name on it. Lol
I usually picked female characters in games if not then long ass hair
Always being jealous of female fashion, crossdressing in private through most of my ten years, and spending an extended period in high school wishing I was born a girl.
I would get ravenously angry at men that wore shorts with hoodies. No idea why and it was just guys- flip flops made it even worse. I'd always turn to whoever I was with at the time and day something like 'what even is the point?! Is only your top half cold?! It just looks stupid!'

So.... Turns out that was gender envy and now I'm all for a pair of cargo shorts with my gender euphoria hoodie 🤷. Hell, I'm all about shorts in general, never used to touch the things.
Not really a ""warning sign"" but my mother got pink clothing because she really really wanted me to be a girl. I guess I was fated from birth...

(all that for her to not accept me as her daughter lol)
I remember back in 3rd grade I convinced my entire school that I was a dude. I used tha boys bathroom for weeks until they found out. And they found out when a boy peeked over the stall and seen that I was a “girl”. He screamed out the bathroom and told the teacher😂
You know those tf videos on YouTube? I watched a absolute fuck ton of them. I never told anyone because a part of me knew that this wasn’t normal but I still enjoyed them all the same.
When I was four I had a female friend and I used to go over, we played princesses and wore princess dresses, I thought it was normal
One of the biggest must have been pretending to give birth to my plushies. My grandma was there helping me. 

Please kill me.
I had this recurring dream when I was like 6 where the entire objective was to try and swap bodies with this girl who looked like what I thought I'd look like when I'm older. The last time I had the dream I succeeded with it and it felt like pure bliss. Then as a little kid I was like ""huh, cool"" and never thought about it until high school.
My sister’s purple tutu that I insisted was mine
I felt weird looking in the mirror a lot of the time. I got Animal Crossing New Leaf when I was a teenager. Even though I played as a girl character, I loved wearing masculine clothes (still do). I loved looking like an anime guy.
My refusal to wear anything but boys character briefs, and insistence in playing the husband in house.
I would always wear hair ties on my wrist because it made me feel more masculine, and I also really wanted a deeper voice
i’m 20 MTF and I used to always get my computer privileges taken away for dressing up as a girl on Club Penguin 😮

other early childhood signs for me were playing dress up at my friends house in princess dresses when I was in preschool, and desperately wanting to play with Bratz and Barbie dolls. Dolls were too girly for my parents to buy for me though I guess, so I had to settle for Littlest Pet Shop, which I loved as a kid.
I never felt like my name fit me, like everyone else got theirs but I didn’t. I also desperately wished I could be a boy, I used to fantasize about it all the time. I always played the brother or father when playing family as a kid.
When I was a child I play hot wheels and skateboarding. Looking back on it right now. The signs is definitely I am trans all over it.
oml i did the same thing

id always pick male avatars/characters in games, act as a male online, get happy when people called me he and ""for some reason"" loved wearing traditionally masculine clothes 

now i know im a nonbinary who goes by they/he
im ftm, and when i learned in 2nd grade what i wouldve been named had i been born male i tried to get my entire class to call me it, and then was genuinely upset when nobody did 😭
somehow managed to be completely oblivious to my transness for the next almost 8 years
Every game that I was allowed to, I’d play as a woman, I’d spend hours on The Sims making the perfect replica of me as a woman, I always seemed to get along with girls in school than with guys, I used to envy girls in school because of their long hair and other feminine things, and then at some point last year it kind of just clicked that “Holy shit… I’m trans aren’t I?” And so for the past year or so I’ve been trying to figure myself out
Besides being a tomboy and extreme dysphoria during puberty:

Dreading formal events because it was the only time I was expected to dress ""proper"". I remember hours and hours of shopping in Macy's with mom for a dress that I might like. Never finding anything that felt right. Always would give up and just choose whatever my mom liked. Probably the most miserable part of growing up female for me.

My school did a lot of dividing by gender and whenever we had our enforced girl time I just felt like I didn't belong. Like the usual girl talk conversations being had just made me feel so alien. I didn't want to talk about boy bands and makeup and crushes. I wanted to wrestle & compete in push-up competitions, and play beyblades. 

I never wanted to be pretty. I wanted to be strong and handsome.

 Always wished I had a dick. I thought God was punishing me because surely he knew I was supposed to be a boy. Or he was playing a joke on me. I told myself that maybe in my next life he'd get it right. 

That's how I made sense of my ""condition"" at 6 years old.
Letting the twins nextdoor give me makeovers multiple times, and dressing as a witch for Halloween.  All around age 6-8.
When I was in 3rd-4th grade I started developing tits, and the moment I started noticing them I kept saying I wanted to get them removed. (I was a DD26 by the time I was in 5-6th grade) I fortunately have not grown up a cup size but these tits are horrible and can’t wait to get them off. I was also a tomboy. I never understood why I hated my boobs or my body. I also always tried to get short boy cuts but was told I couldn’t by my mother. Most of my friends were guys as well. I also hated my dead name ever since I could remember.
Picking the girl characters in games because they ""looked better"" and disliking pretty everything I got from puberty
I couldn't handle how cute the Lisa Frank coloring book animals were.  I've literally never not had multiple stuffed animals.  I crossed my legs well into middle school until I was made fun of for it (and I regret having stopped because I can barely do it now).
i always liked girly things in elementary school and didn’t really enjoy sports 😅
Female characters in games

Dreams where I dressed as a woman or wore heels (a lot)
Oh, I had so many. to the point where when i came out my parents pretty much just said, ""...yeah that explains it."" lol. examples of signs that should have been obvious to me but somehow werent include-

\-only wanting to hang out with boys despite being pushed into friendships with girls because thats apparently how it works (figured out later it wasnt because i liked them, but rather that i wanted to be like them)

\-despising anything feminine and being incredibly confused whenever anyone talked about how much they loved their makeup/skirts/dresses

\-picking the male characters every single time. i tried making a female stardew valley character once and quit that save after barely any time because it didnt feel right.

\-kept looking at guys with neat haircuts (or honestly just any masculine short style) and thinking ""woah how cool would it be if my hair was like that? oh well, too bad im a girl""

\-whenever i drew myself (i was and still am very into art) it was always as a genderless/male character. made my art teachers a bit confused or frustrated whenever we were supposed to do self-portraits lol.
Always picked female characters in games my friends would presure me into making a boy character was so bad at it they just said go ahead and switch back its fine lol never had a issue after that years later I find out I am a girl too go figure  🤣
I had warning signs, a hell of a lot but nothing clicked. This was from the age of 12.

Women's clothing, stockings, shoes etc. were all euphoric but I still never joined the dots till well down the track. 

Back then, there was no Reddit that I was aware of, Uni bulletin-boards in my Country never had a lot of chat about the Trans community. Maybe I just wasn't looking.
_slams dusty, old book looking to be about a couple inches thick onto a nearby table_

oh do I
I always envied being the girl in any relationship than the guy. I could never imagine myself being the ""male"" in a relationship and never was great at playing as a man when I dated that anytime I deviated my girl partner thought it was just abnormal and ""guy-like""
Been doing this over 20 years... Guess what I figured out a few months ago. xD
I have known since I was 4 in 1978. 

I asked how I could become a boy when I was 6. I knew as soon as I developed a personality that I was supposed to be a boy. Never got to do anything about it and have been dealing with the consequences ever since. 

Still hoping to get top surgery in the near future. It's the only thing I need to deal with physically to be comfortable. Hooray for early menapause.
The earliest sign I remember was taking an interest in media that involved ""forced feminization"" and/or mtf gender swaps. Earliest I remember this was high school... I don't remember much of middle school or earlier...

I vaguely remember at some point realizing how much more options girls have in a fashion sense but then I repressed that thought because ""well I'm a boy so it's not like it matters much right""
oh boy

this isn't childhood per se but before the discovery I played dnd and at some point when I realised I could play female characters I just didn't stop playing them and I got very sad/bored playing male characters - there was this huge sense of freedom I got from playing women I couldn't explain. (the most telling is the fact my most recent character is mtf and part of her struggle was for acceptance - I'm a little proud of her backstory but the fact I was so willing to play a character like that before I identified as mtf was insane)

I'd hate wearing shorts as a kid because they'd make my legs look masculine and so I always stuck to pants and long sleeves and people didn't know why 

I wanted very badly to be one of the girls for so long LMAO I'd hang out with women so much more because I just felt more comfortable with them but felt bad and pressured not to and to ""have crushes on them"" instead because I was a ""boy"". I wasn't even straight lol but I got gaslit out of believing that by parents and supposed friends

in middle school I would wear skirts as a joke but end up really fuckign loving the look of myself in them as well as the one time I went for denim shorts and a crop top and loved the way my body looked in them (ok yeah it wasn't the GREATEST mix but holy shit the fact my body worked with them so well and I felt so happy in them was so freeing)

on the topic of fashion I loved jackets and thongs w login sleeves that cover the hands cos they were cute 

I'd keep going on abt ""what if I was born a woman"" and think it through and end up just going ""holy shit every day life would be so much better my god"" and then dismiss it as ""oh you just like women"" 

the female avatars one hits but I'd feel pressured to play male characters but in secret want to just stick to the female ones (even in shit like just dance)

was always told I was a lot more feminine and I'm very very affectionate towards my friends (which I believe everyone SHOULD be) 

if someone assumed I was a girl anywhere I'd get excited as hell and just want to keep going with that because it made me feel so much more comfortable as a person 

I also loved genderbending myself on any apps that would do that for me for hours BC I'd love the look of myself so much more


jesus the fact I just brushed all this off is alarming LOL
ended up identifying way more with female protagonists in books and constantly write my own stories where the main character was female and end up not wanting to stop writing LMAO
Feeling like I was a girl and wishing I could be seen as one when I was 5
One of my earliest trans memories was when I was about 8, choosing a female character in an old pc game. Still took me nearly 30 years worth of female chars to realise I was trans. :P
ehh more so as early teen, I was heavily into roleplay and I had this oc who could ""genderbend"" she was basically genderfluid but I spent most of my time rping as her male part. dunno how that didn't tell me shit
Almost always picked the female character. Sure, I would say it was because the female characters had more customization options (they did) and more aesthetically pleasing, and I'd rather make a badass woman and not yet another guy like 90% of the set game protagonist. But damn if hindsight ain't 20/20
MTF here (probably). In elementary school, I wondered what the stripe thing running from the scrotum to the anus was. Since I'd never seen that part of someone else's body, at least not in detail, I wasn’t even sure if other people had it.

I rationalised this by believing I had been born a girl, but my vulva had been sown shut (hence the stripe) and then I somebow got a penis too.
Tbh.. i went for Fem avatars but mostly because attractive, but now i prefer anything thats manly, men, women, everyone is hot
Yup. Always picked the female characters. Refused to have short hair. Asked for dolls and 'girly' toys.
Looking back I would always want to be more feminine in looks and or how I acted and my family members just told me that's not how I'm supposed to look or act and I needed to be manlier but ig that's part of the reason I like football now other than marching band.
Me who chose Male avatars because of trama then realizing i was trans and finding any excuses to have a female avatar
As a child I drew a comic that was literally the ""little person inside of you thats the real you"" metaphor before I even knew trans was a word for more than vehicle.
I always picked male characters. I used to to the hair in the hat thing all the time. When I got facepaint done I would always get what the ‘boys’ were getting like a tiger and stuff.as a  I used to follow my neighbour around copying everything he did because I wanted to be like him. (He taught me how to skateboard he was great). And there was so so much more did I mention playing the brother when playing house?
Late to the party but posts it anyways I guess.
I remember traveling to Thailand and saw some Ladyboy performing. I was like 10. After learning about the ladyboy is kind of a male I envied them and thought I would be like them someday. 
I immediately suppressed my thought, cause I know if I say it out I will be hang by my father… Props to me knowing such things could happen at the age of 10.
This! I would always volunteer to be the male character when playing house or whatever as a kid. Like, I didn’t think there was anything wrong with not jumping to be the mother. Also, when singing along with love songs, I had the conscious thought that I *should* be replacing “girl” with “boy” to make it more appropriate for my young self… and yet, nah. Like, I shouldn’t be singing about winning a girl’s love because that wasn’t “normal”.

Never feeling “girly” enough. Hating my birth name and wanting it to be something else.
Never liked girly stuff, long time ago i refered to myself as a girl but i dont even remember it
I always thought that I would make a better girl (I’m mtf) and then eventually, I realized I am a girl.
at a birthday party when i was 6 someone gave me a dress and when i unwrapped it i screamed “I AM NOT A GIRL” and threw it across the room in front of everyone. i also would only wear skirts if i was able to wear a tie with it too 🤣

i hated being seen as a girl and shied away from all “girly” things like dolls and just wanted to be treated the same way my brother was.
I was a lil fucker that showed nothing. I was a programmable idiot too. All my life I'd been told I was a girl and what girls are supposed to be so I went along with it. I wore dresses and loved baby dolls and stuffed animals I ""wanted"" to be a princess. But here I am now, loving stuffed animals and baby dolls still, not wearing dresses anymore, and I'd rather be a dumb npc on a farm in a fantasy game.
Permanently fucking up my posture from slouching
I use to pick girls and when asked I would say it’s just nicer to look at Lolol it’s true and it’s slso how I identify as now lol so I’m both ways it’s true
not really a ""warning sign"" but when I was a kid I used to pray to god that 1 day I would wake up as a girl, I didn't think it was anything and basically thought it was normal and eventually it went away, then about 2 or 3 years ago I started thinking about that again and it just snowballed, as well as there being photos of me as a kid in fancy dress in my sisters clothes the signs were kinda always there....
I loved picking the female avatars for games, because they had so pretty cloths they could wear.

As a child i always thought of myself as a monster (not only in a bad way, since monster are usually damn cool) and i was like ""i don't care if i was a girl, my best friends are girls and i love spending time with them""

I had the strange obsession about shapeshifting magic that could turn someone into a girl.


Don't know if that counts, but my first ever moment was like i was isekaid into this body. (One moment i just was in this body. No one ever asked me if i wanted to be in this body and there were pictures of myself of which i had no memories of, so there must have been someone else in that moment. I was so terified at that time, because i thought i accidently killed the previous owner of this body)
Lol I did the avatar thing too but one that I had to notice myself was, as like a littler kid I would always want to ask for a lot of the girly toys but was to worried of judgment so I went to games like minecraft and stuff, another fun one was when my mom picked me up from school and my nails were blue and green. (Mtf)
I wrote a story in primary school about the day every child swapped from being a boy to a girl and vice versa. That turned out to be a large clue lol.
I would always introduce myself as “Alex” or “Alexander” and “pretended” to be a boy in roblox, club penguin and minecraft. Whenever my parents questioned it, I always said it was because I liked them. Didn’t think they understand that I wanted to be the boys
I'm nonbinary and I always chose the ""male"" game of life character or purple when that became an option, my chosen style for years was a pair of kakis, a button up and a tie, always wanted to be the red power ranger, and everyone at school knew I was gay before I knew. Oh and one of my favorites ""yeah, I don't really like boys."" Which I had been saying most of my life even before I knew that not being straight was an option
yeah when i was little i used to make my sisters do my makeup and i was always fem i never like
any of my clothes i always wanted
my sisters stuff and now i’m older i’m a girl and i’m happy the way i am
For me, it was a fascination over clothes and fashion. I know it's not something that is gendered, but my family always made me feel bad because I didn't care how ripple the muscles are on my action figures, just that they were well dressed.
Love thinking of these cuss my dad insists ""there were never any signs while I was growing up"":

-I had a strut. Like a way I would move my hips while I walked and I loved it (despite everyone else calling me queer).
- at different parts of my life when I was less worried about keeping a masculine mask on I could be really flamboyant in general, to the point people would ask me if I was gay quite often
-I loved playing with my sisters princess/fairy toys
- I was a huge drama kid and put way more effort into the dance routines than any of the guys there too.
- I'd watch the hex girls scene from Scooby-Doo do and the witches ghost on repeat.
Throughout middle school avril lavigne was 90% of what I listened to
-for other Canadians out there, ruby gloom was my shit
-for everyone else, I would never had admitted it, but Winx club was also my shit
Oh soo many things now that I look back.
- invariably chose female characters in games
- told everyone online that I was a girl for like, 4 years before fully cracking
- wore feminine clothes in secret since I was like 8
- always hated haircuts, not the process but the result
- preferred ""girls"" shows as a kid. Got made fun of by my family, so I stopped watching tv altogether.
- when I was 10, my friend asked if I would press a button that made me rich but also turned me into a girl, tbf some of my male friends thought about it but said no. I was the only one that said yes.
Crying myself to sleep while telling my mother “I wish I was a girl” at age 3 or 4.
As a child I constantly wore boys clothes. If anyone tried to braid my hair, or put me in a dress I would become violent. I remember I hit a female teacher because she tried to put eye make -up on me.

My father came from Germany to America. He was an army brat and my grandfather served in world war 2 as a drill sergeant. During my father's time growing up he was not exposed early on to different identities in the community until he left Germany in the 80-90's to go to New York City.

Once he got off the boat he was immersed into the culture there and learned a lot about different types of people.

&#x200B;

Early on in my childhood my father always supported me picking my clothes. This would continue to be his outlook until he passed. I always shopped in the mens section because he saw how much pain it would be for me to shop in the women's. My babysitter at the time tired to ""mold"" me to be more feminine. It was the early 2000's no one had any idea about transgenderism. They just called people ""She-males"" or ""Dykes"". My father didn't want me to get bullied, but he also wanted me to express myself. Although I was bullied verbally, they knew better than to mess with me physically. I was much taller and stronger than my classmates and used my fists many times to prove I'm no pushover.

8th grade was where I finally knew I had to change my life for the better. I woke up one day and put a dress on just to see if I could do it. Just to see if it felt right. I wore eyeliner and high heels to school. Once I arrived I got so many compliments and attention from guys and even girls. While they were trying to support what they thought was a blossoming young girl wasn't actually me. I was actually a young man coming to terms with his identity.  In that dress I felt see through, and naked. I felt gross and disgusting. I wanted to peel my skin off and burn it.

&#x200B;

*I knew I was transgender because the thought of living as a woman makes me want to take my own life.*

Not because I view women as the lesser gender/sex. If anything it is clear that in many ways women demonstrate themselves to be better than men. My identity is within myself and my own complexity. I have always felt more comfortable assuming the masculine male roles.

Another way I knew would have to be through the daydreams I would have as a child about the future. In these dreams of the future, I never imagined myself as an adult woman. It was always this well built, charming guy who was confident within himself to live life unadulterated.
one time when I was about eight my mom took me to a haircut and I kept saying I wanted it "" the shortest "" and the lady just gave me a channel. I cried so hard after, just wanted to look like a boy
After that I started getting bullied so hard and made my hair grow again
I had two older brothers and all male cousins, and I always wanted to be just like them. Running around outside and peeing in the woods. I was jealous of them and was excited to grow facial hair when I grew up. I distinctly remember a conversation with my mum when I was maybe 6, telling her I wished I was a boy. Puberty was rough, and I still hate my chest curses with a passion. That said, I've realized I no longer want facial hair (I have sensory issues and the idea of scratchy hair on my face makes me cringe) or a lower voice or any of the things that come with T. I've realized I really fit more somewhere in the middle. Though, not gonna lie, I still get excited anytime someone ""mistakes"" me for a guy, and while I prefer gender neutral terms, anything other than fem terms makes me happy right now. I've always fit in better with the guys. I've never really been into fashion, and I hate wearing makeup. I'll do it for Halloween or theatre sometimes, but I hate the way it makes my face feel. I made a neopets account as a boy because I was tired of people seeing me as a girl and I was desperate to just be one of the guys. Though I'm honestly not sure if that was because I felt like a boy or I just hated the way I was treated as a girl. I'm honestly still questioning myself, but I'm confident I fit somewhere under the nonbinary umbrella. One thing is certain: I have *never* felt comfortable thinking of myself as woman. From the moment I reached an age where people started using that term for me, it just felt wrong.


The weirdest thing: when I was really little, hot pink was my favorite color because I just love bright colors (I'm a visual stimmer) but after I learned that ""pink is a girl's color"" I convinced myself that I *hated* pink because I hated being seen as a girl. I've finally realized at 30 that I never hated pink. I just hated being put in a box based on what I like.
I often pretended to be a girl on games like Animal Jam and Club Penguin lol
I feel this so hard.

Every time I see a hot woman, it's like ""do I want her, or want to *be* her....or both?""

That feeling was one of the primary reasons it took me so long to accept being trans. I negatively identified that desire as ""dirty thoughts"", and repressed the feelings of my own femininity. 

Mad respect for figuring that out :)
Half right and half wrong with the initial assumption

Edit: spelling error
Same, just the other way around. I thought I was a real simp and a sucker until I found out I was just acting out question 5 of the gender hypotheticals; the magic machine that lets you design your ideal body.
Yup. It was constant jealousy for me. I wanted colorful things. Wanted to wear makeup. Wanted to experiment with hair and clothes like the other girls.

I found an outlet in high school when I dated a girl who wanted to paint my nails. YES PLEASE!
But it was always dark green, or dark blue, or black, etc. I wanted Ferrari red nails, just never told anyone or got up the courage.
I was also keen towards wearing female clothes. One time, I almost got caught too wearing them
I wish I could go back and change my main character in destiny to a woman without having to lose the “veteran character” status…
I can very much relate! I remember refusing to swim in just trunks as a kid. I always had to wear a top. So many tiny details from my youth made a lot more sense once my egg cracked 😆♥️🏳️‍⚧️
trans in the other direction here, fancy dress occasions were great  , i dressed up as Dumbledore (i was like 9) for world book day, and in hindsight being an old man gave me gave me gender euphoria. Later when we did the customary signing of tshirts at the end of of primary school, i didn’t let anyone write on my front bc i hated my chest….
i really should’ve realised sooner
I'm jealous that you had the courage to be known that way! I fought for years.. decades, really... just to try to be a ""normal guy"". All because of a terrible fear of confrontation. 

All good though. Now I'm me, and happy as can be. :)
That’s really interesting—and honestly really cool that you still have those old writings!! I love looking at content I created as a child……I reflect on it a lot now as an adult. 

An example: [I found old doodles of mine from before I knew for sure that I was trans (although I was starting to question), where I drew myself as a robot boy….](https://imgur.com/a/oIBOHxn) I remember feeling such delight portraying myself as male, and when I posted these pictures on my blog it was both scary and thrilling because I was committing, to some extent, to wanting others to see and refer to me as a boy. 

Do you have any examples of your writing you’d like to share? :3 thanks for replying
I wanted the power and would have stayed in girl mode forever of course :) that anime has always been such a trigger lol
39, married with children.

Still started my commitment to the process this year.

Check out /r/TransLater , it's never too late :D
It's never late enough to be happier :)
Sending you love and support <3
I just straight up said TRADITION whenever someone asked me why I always played as the Female Character
CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow
Good luck with HRT!! :)
Same. I never played as female characters because I was too self conscious of what my friends and family would think. I’ve started doing it lately though and it’s great
I'm glad someone else feels this way!
Same. Especially playing Final Fantasy 😍
too relatable and sadly i still dont have myself completely figured out
This is exactly how I felt on a the daily and it only took a year or 2 of therapy and self searching to accept myself
You and me both😊😊
Aww I feel that
Eww destiny, (I say with over 5k hours in destiny 2).
idk if im comfortable sharing my old prose or narrative writing, they’re… Very Bad.

i have some painfully mediocre poetry from high school that definitely fits the bill of “Oh That’s A Sign” if you’re interested in that, though!
37, divorced with child.

Still finding out who my new PCP is this year, so I can start navigating US healthcare for HRT. 😊🤞
Exactly. I wasn't aloud to express myself so I wouldn't in my games either.

It's nice to know there's others haha
Same, glad I'm not the only one
Ikr. Honestly fuck destiny, it’s my favorite game. It’s so dogshit. :)
Yeah I’d love to see, if you’re comfortable sharing! :)
sure!!

Oh these are so heartfelt and lovely. Thank you for sharing them. 

Reading these, I actually remembered a poem I wrote when I was 17, right before I “officially” came out and transitioned. It was when I was having a lot of inner turmoil over my gender and my identity. I’d like to share it too, if that’s okay :’)

[untitled poem, written by 17 year old me. timestamped March 6th, 2014 at 12:59am]

i see cold steel and i feel at peace

in wires and static and screens that conceal expression

i feel a touch of wind against my cheek

and a void within my chest, woken by the breeze

pours a longing for years gone by through my veins

i see light reflect against gemstones and i taste their colors on my tongue. my steps crunch against the cold transparency of ice and i feel the pale light of dawn glowing beneath my skin

i look up at the stars

and my heart aches

with homesickness for every glimmering break in the darkness

but when i look in the mirror, grey consumes me

and i feel nothing"	zy88wi	trans	1362	0.98	2022-12-29 15:37:24
I got misgendered at work then corrected by a little girl.	"I work in an *undisclosed* uk supermarket and while on tills I basically get misgendered by every customer. Sometimes even correctly gendered then they go back and misgender me. It hurts but I just try let it go because otherwise it would drive me crazy. 

Last night though I had a couple come in with a little girl and as I was serving them the mum said “give the sweets to the man” and the little girl said “no... that’s a lady”. My week hasn’t been fantastic because of stress and dysphoria but that comment from her really helped, for the rest of the night it kept me going and staying positive. 

Hope this brings a little joy to anyone needing it :3"	"Sometimes kids say the best things
There is a german saying telling that children always tell the truth ❤
This is one of the few things I like about young kids. I find them super obnoxious but they've lived their entire lives in a world where being trans is quickly becoming accepted, so unlike older adults who aren't as used to it being as widely accepted as it is they just go along with it.
Keep celebrating the little things. And kids are also brutally honest in what you see, so I'd take it as a much bigger compliment.

I got told by my partner I look like a lesbian with my earrings in,  which is something at least.
I just want to let you know how brave you are for working at a place where you constantly get misgendered. I don't think I could stay sane in your situation, just remember that your mental health comes first before a supermarket chain ❤
That’s actually adorable
Kids are great. :) they’re funny sometimes, too. I remember one time, I was at a Cracker Barrel, and a blond lady with her, like, 10 year old kid, walked up to me and said “excuse me young lady, do you know where the candy dots are?” I had no name tag, no uniform, nothing, but before I could say anything, the 10 year old looked at her and said “mum, he’s like 12. He doesn’t work here.” I was 16, but it made me smile a bit. The lady just… walked off to the reception, nothing said after that. Dunno what happened, but it made me laugh.
While I was at work a coworker of mine called me an it, my sister is the manager and took her outside and chewed her out then my best friend Joe (her husband) chewed her out even more with her. God I love them
This is a keen reminder that hate is taught.
The kids will save us from boomer nonsense
Kids voice their minds how the world really is. Clearly the ""adults"" are just abiding by social standards while the kid hasn't been corrupted yet.
Kids are the BEST. I saw a friend yesterday that I haven't seen in person in a few months, and the T has really kicked in since then. Her six year old looked at me really hard for a minute and was like, ""why does it look like you have a moustache???"" I said it was because I was growing one on purpose, and that I was taking a special medicine that would help me grow a beard and change me voice. His little eyes kept getting wider and wider and he was like, ""wow! So maybe you're actually a boy then."" It was one of the best conversations I had all week.
Awww kids are the cutest!
And that’s why children and younger ppl are 100% better than adults.
Awww children are great
I got called a fag by a kid because I am trans so I mean they are a double edged sword
Wonderful! Beautiful story. Hugs to you ❤❤❤
Hate is learned not something you are born with. I do hope that is a sign that the future will be less cruel and bigoted. Bless that little girls heart.
You don’t have to pass to be a woman. 

Just keep going!
I honestly hate kids, but I do have a respect for their ability of non-judgement and the ability to really see people without knowing. I think adults and people probably just over 10 tend to see through a very gendered and strict view of life, but with little kids they just see who it is. I think it goes the same with spirits IMO. I don't know if I believe in spirits but I will acknowledge that children have been able to see more than us on occasion. 

Its really nice to be able to know these children who know nothing about gender and the world of gender identity can be accepting. It shows that you don't need to understand something to accept it. Adults really need to learn from kids like this one.
Love it!  🥰🥰  Lilli~
They really do lol
Wondering what it sounds like in German 🤔
I love old German sayings lol❤️
Oh ! We have the same in french ! ""La vérité sort de la bouche des enfants""
Yeah pretty much lol, kids will say what they’re thinking and it can either be too blunt or super affirming like this ^ 

It’s nice to know that this is the new generation :))
I think children just pick up on the vibes of how someone presents themselves a lot more easily, adults look at secondary sex identifiers, children look at clothes, makeup, etc.
This

Children are so annoying but they usually are less judgy than their elders
This. I came out to my kids last week and they were like ""cool. So... da- oops, mom, can we go play roblox now?"" I had prepped for anything, but my partner was totally right, they're just used to this stuff now.
Thankyou, I really appreciate that. Honestly it’s stressful and can really get me down but each day gets a little better because of little moments like this. Also don’t worry haha, my mental health is a priority when it comes to work lol ❤️
That’s honestly so sweet <3 That kid will grow up knowing you as your preferred gender too which is amazing. Glad to know the next generation is based lol
Sorry to hear that, I’ve been called that too but it’s mostly older kids who will do it. I think there’ll always be people like that unfortunately but there’s definitely fewer and fewer every day. 

Anyway keep doing you and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise ❤️
(Not a child story but still made me feel good) there's a gas station that I deliver fuel to and the attendant looked at me with my hair down and she said I looked more fem to her. It was a small compliment but it really did make me feel better about myself. It happened a couple of nights ago so I'm paraphrasing.
Agreed. One time, my baby cousin called me good girl, I don't know why she did but still, euphoria moment
""Kindermund tut Wahrheit kund.""

Literally translates to ""child's mouth declares the truth"". 

And it does ♡.
Thank you you are a nice person I don't see why someone would be nasty to you
Awh that’s really sweet :3 It’s little things that make the biggest impact. We definitely need more people like this, just people being awesome
If you remove the spaces like so many German words do, it looks even cooler...

Partner is TOO supportive	"I’m 35 mtf, pre HRT (but my appointment is this week, so excited!)

I love my wife, and she is completely on board with my transition. The problem is, as soon as we talked and I explained everything (from my past, feelings etc) she decided I was a woman. No this isn’t bad at home, we have a great life. But I have yet to socially transition.

I absolutely encouraged her to talk to her therapist about everything. I would never take that away, that is her safe space to explore her feelings. Likewise, she asked if I would mind her talking to one of her friends IRL. I was totally okay with it and gave her my absolute blessing (I rarely see this friend anyway).

But when we go shopping she has no filter. I’ll be discreetly trying to shop and she’ll just hold something up to me and go “oh my god you have to get that, it’ll look SOO good on you!”

I had a talk with her about it and she felt really bad. Then I felt bad for making her feel bad.

But today, I went to get a full body wax (ouch, but totally worth it, I am sooooooo smooth). And I find out she told the woman who did her eyebrows about me!! Again, I got really angry and explained that it was NOT her information to share. I mean yes, I told my waxer, but that’s my choice. I was essentially outed by her without my permission. 

Now she feels bad again, and I feel bad for making her feel bad. She’s so happy for me, but I’m just not there yet. Does anyone else have this problem? I really don’t know what to do besides keep reigning her in when she gets too excited.

EDIT: I want to thank you all for your heartfelt advice. Having this community to come to makes everything just a little bit easier.

To clarify, my wife has never intentionally made me feel bad. But after 15 years of being married to my best friend, if I ever make her feel bad, I’m going to feel bad. It’s just the way our relationship works. We cry together and get through it…together.

For those who have had the opposite reaction from a spouse, you have my abject sympathy. To be forced to choose between the person you love and your happiness is heartbreaking and you will always have my support.

And about the situation at hand; we had a long talk, very open and honest. She needs to be able to share her joy so I’ve given the go ahead to talk to a few more people she knows well. I’ve also put her on Reddit to join some spouse of trans people subs so she can get extra support from people in her situation.

Again, thank you all so much. I never expected this outpouring of love and support. It just goes to prove that the family we choose is as good or sometimes better than the one we’re given 💖🏳️‍⚧️💖🏳️‍⚧️💖"	"While her behavior is …very sweet(?), I feel like you’re gonna have to continually remind her until it stops. Or have a very serious sit down and express how bad it makes you feel and all of that, because sometimes people take things less seriously if not actually sat down with and made aware that you’re very dead serious.
Don’t feel bad about setting boundaries 🤗
No one should out us without talking to us first.  

That being said, my wife did similar things.  I told her that I forgave her because I will always forgive her.  She did it once or twice more before starting to ask first.  At this point pretty much everyone knows so it’s a non-issue now.

Anyway, in my experience it comes from a place of love and they are trying to be accepting and supportive.  Clearly your wife is bi and wants to stay with you so it’s great that she is supportive.  Honestly though, just forgive her and move on.  Don’t let it bother you long term or get on your nerves.  The coming out process sucks but it’s short compared to the rest of our lives and you have a great life head of you with your wife.
Tell her keeping this secrete is about security.

That will maybe change her view on this 

If she outs you to the wrong person shit can get dangerous
I understand how it is making you uncomfortable and I dont mean to invalidate that, but I kinda wish someone was that excited about my transition. I dont think shes being malicious, I think shes just really excited. Just communicate with her, and make sure she knows how much you appreciate her support.
So I think she is very sweet and excited. But she also needs to understand that outing you to everyone is going to hurt you.
I'm sorry but am I the only one who got a liiiittle giggle from this? 🙂
Maybe approach it as ""It's my transition, let me come out at my speed."" Or to put a slightly more upbeat amused spin on it: ""I'm the one who gets to tell people!""

Depending on your area, you could say it's potentially dangerous for you not knowing who knows but that is likely to make her feel worse.
100%.
My wife is the one that kind of told everyone in our lives. She even told my parents, my siblings, my extended family, her family, our friends, her co-workers.
She did not take the news very well at first and in a way I think she might have been reaching out to her friends and family for support but who knows

I can be mad at her or I can be happy.
I choose to be happy and view it as one less thing I need to do and this was all pre HRT and before growing my hair out sooo that was fun. 

It got the ball rolling much faster and even though she did struggle at first me and her could never be better 😊
It has to be on your timeline, not hers.

I have no doubt she's an absolute sweetheart. This is a huge life change for both of you, and it's going to take a lot of long conversations for both of you to understand this new territory! When I first started evolving into my own, I would often feel ""mad"", but later realized I was actually just feeling very vulnerable.
I would remind her how dangerous it is to out people without their consent, and she can literally be putting you in danger by telling strangers your business. I’m glad she so supportive, but if she wants to be an ally to the trans community, she needs to do better to understand the danger that comes along with it as well
You are so totally blessed. I wish my wife and daughter could have half of her acceptance. If I were in a position to transition, I wouldn’t care if she was so open. Instead, I have a wife and daughter who know my desires and want nothing to do with me in that respect. Try to enjoy your blessings.
You don't need to feel bad for setting boundaries. In fact, if you feel bad for setting boundaries, that's a red flag for toxic relationship and you should think about why.

It is your decision alone when and with whom you share your trans-ness. If you are still passing as your assigned gender, then people who know and you being trans need to switch pronouns/name/anything else depending on context. If you're passing as your actual gender, then they need to be silent about you being trans. You have shared something that makes you vulnerable, and the people you trusted should respect it. 

Like, you shared a secret with your wife, and she just tells everyone? Wtf? Even if she thinks everyone will be okay (sometimes cis people are naive), she still shouldn't share it.

When I came out, my trans then-gf was really excited about the fact that she was now with another trans woman - and shared this with everyone before I even talked to any friends about it, without me knowing about her sharing, and with me having explicitly told her that I don't want to come out (yet). She even told her transphobic parents. I was... Not amused. She somehow made it completely about herself. SHE was now in a t4t relationship. SHE was now in a wlw relationship. SHE was soooo supportive by outing me and getting to talk to other people about me being trans. It was such an exciting time for HER! Ugh. Actually, that was a point where I realised how self-centered she actually was.

I hope your marriage will survive this, and I hope she's not as bad as my ex. But what you described reminds me of my ex, abs I wanted to share.
I tried to come out once (as ftm, though now I'd say I'm NB) and the way people reacted made me so uncomfortable that I actually gave up. Either they tried to be super supportive and immediately told people without asking me, or they cried to me about how it would affect them. When I stopped talking about it, everyone acted as if it never happened. And these were all people who are in general supportive of trans folks. It was such a weird experience.

I know other people experience much worse and prioritize living out of the closet and transitioning over everything else, but I couldn't handle it.
She's got the right spirit she just needs to slow down to your pace. You need to remind her that this is your journey, and it can put you in danger. I can tell she loves you a lot, and I hope you can improve this situation in the long run. But knowing you have her support makes it all the better, once she's settled down per say, I know it will be smooth sailing for everything in your control.
My partner constantly does the same thing, about all aspects of my sexuality and gender. She broadcasts personal details to friends, family, co-workers, and strangers.
I suppose the real issue, for me, is that I constantly feel like the butt of a joke she is telling. Then I argue (within myself) that if I was comfortable with who I want to be/(am?) Then I wouldn't feel discomfort about being put on display.

The honest truth is that we (by we I mean whatever the fuck it is me/myself/I Am) have always felt laughed at. We've always felt like a joke, and we've always attempted to stay in the shadows.

Being thrust out into the open by our partner feels like a betrayal, and we (me/myself/I/The Borg) can't tell the difference between betrayal and Love.)
If I may, my wife is more mildly the same way, she came to accept that I can transition within a few weeks of me even mentioning it might be a desire. I have yet to fully decide but when we go shopping for anything feminine she will just walk right up and put it against me to see how it will look. 

However, it’s a huge blessing in disguise because I’ve been in a depression for 9 months and her consistently being happy for me has slowly improved my self esteem…I would be much better off the other way around.

In fact at the suggestion of my therapist I tried socially transitioning in some ways for the weekend. We dressed up in all fem clothing, put on make up, she made me shave my beard and straightened my hair and then told the ladys at VS and other store we were there to buy for me…I ended up loving the relief from it. Never would have done it without her.

34 mtf in progress, lol. Hope you have a good one and you two will surely find the right boundaries and support for each other!
She loves you; she’s excited about your transition.  Give the woman a chance to get used to the new you
i think you should maybe let go a little bit. she’s so excited for you and needs to talk about it with people, so she’s doing it with randos, and those two specific people she asked for permission. i dunno. the worst thing would be for you to stamp out her excitement for you and make it an awkward or negative topic for both of you. i think you can gently let her know how it makes you feel when she outs you like that though
I totally understand where you’re coming from! That being said, I do think that you need to understand that her feelings are also valid and her trying to be supportive in any way she can is her way of showing her love for you. I understand that you’re not at the level of excitement that she is yet, but you should appreciate that she’s there for you and is trying to support you regardless of circumstances.
My mum does this, shes really nice and supportive she does thus too, im sorry i dont really have any advice for you
She confused but she got the spirit
[deleted]
Your either in or out buttercup, be mindful of those who do this all alone
This isn’t being supportive, this is putting you in danger and crossing your boundaries. she needs to realise how much she puts you at risk doing that, it’s rly not okay. Part why I’m t4t, cis ppl don’t care about how we could get beat up or killed,  they think it’s fun and only want to brag and to feel “woke”
My fiancé would do the same thing. She never noticed but I would get “looks”. I have fully transitioned now so it’s no longer an issue but she never toned it down. Probably something I should have said but never did
I'm in the same boat sorta, but I just started social transition. Feels odd having a partner that is seemingly unbothered by my transition. I feel like it should at least cause a *little* discomfort or something, it is a big change after all. I guess that is my my own problem. and this intense optimism is maybe my partner's way of processing the transition and all.
You definitely need to sit down with her and set some firm boundaries.
I’d just tell her that it’s fine but just ask her to check in with you before telling anybody
boundaries are important, however, i think your wife is truly just trying her best to make you feel comfortable. i don’t believe she has any bad intentions
I was this partner to my ex who is a trans woman. Her transition and journey felt so important to me and it was always so exciting to see her become happier and explore who she was. Something we failed to realize until it was too late for the relationship is that, while her transition does mean that our relationship is changing and growing and that part requires a group effort and support, it is also HER transition, and there are important parts of that process that need to be just for her. 

This was so important to understand, but neither of us realized it and she never had the words to express to me her need to go through parts of this with support that still allows her to experience parts of her life as an individual, not as part of a relationship. Because when we transition, we're learning so much new stuff about ourselves, and applying that to a relationship can be a tricky line that can eclipse the important parts of figuring out who we are transitioning into. 

Turns out, the reason I was so obsessed with her transition is because I'm actually trans myself and I figured this out shortly after things ended. I don't want to scare you with the talk of exes, our situation has some similarities but the differences are pretty intense too, so please don't let my outcome worry you! It sounds like you're able to have decent conversations with your partner, and I'd just keep encouraging you to keep talking. It's probably difficult to understand and may be hurtful to hear, but it's important for her to understand that your transition involves important private experiences that she wont be a part of or should not be sharing with others. Best of luck, friend, and if you ever want to chat about the parallels we may have experienced, my DMs and replies are always open!
Well this is the other extreme to the partner freaking out and leaving you. Realize she has issues also and this is a growing and learning process for the both of you actually between this and her freaking out and leaving you and running her mouth wherever she thinks would do the most damage this is far more workable. At least she doesn't intend to harm you.
It sounds like she might need a relationship therapist or coach who can look at things from her perspective. I’m sensing there’s more about her feelings that she needs help unpacking.
Wow ...I didnt realize there was an opposite end of the spectrum here 😳. Not to make this about me, promise! Just thought Id share the other end, please tell me if you dont appreciate it and I'll delete. My partner is pansexual and doesnt treat her partners any differently regardless of sex, gender, orisntation, race, or anything. So ... I want to be treated more like a woman, and have her encouragement, but she just literally doesnt know what that means or how to operate any different. Its great that she still loves me for me, but I just dont feel any different, or like she sees me any different (because .. Well .. She doesnt). I feel for you though; that sounds very stressful and I hope that you two can reach a good middle ground of understanding 😊
Oof yeah, glad she's supportive but gonna need to sit down with her and tell her to dial it back. On the other note,oooh how smooth? We talking baby's butt? Btw you're gonna be IRRITATED once/if the stubble grows back
Awee I get it. She’s trying to be supportive but it seems like she’s almost overcompensating. Just tell her to take a breather and maybe let you have some more agency over who knows about it ❤️
Not exactly but talking about how open you are about your gender is probably good, readjusting expectations and all, for me at least this communication style helps (a bit with my mother cause she does not really listen but she misgenders me less and knows more what subjects I feel open about this way).
I wonder how often this happens to trans people


I’ve had this issue with my wife for a few years now. She cares about me enough to see me as a woman, but she’s oblivious to the chaos calling me a woman, or even insinuating my femininity, in public can cause. It’s a double-edged sword. Her confidence in me is helping me get my own, but I’m constantly scared of what’ll happen if someone overhears and disagrees with what I identify as. I live in Louisiana, so it’s not exactly an accepting state.


I need her confidence to build my own, I just hope that no one is so transphobic that they hurt her (or me, but I care more for her safety) just for being with me.
Yeah when I came out to my close friend and family they essentially outed me to everyone (friends, family, whoever). Now everyone knows but they don't really take it seriously.
Hiya, my spouse is 28MtF, only out to me etc. Similar to you and your partner, I have been able to tell 2 people for different reasons (one dated a trans woman a couple of years ago, one is my best friend), we haven't even told our children.

ANYWAY. 

I have worried that I am 'too supportive', I want my spouse to discover their own feelings, style, likes and dislikes without influence from me and at the same time I don't want to feel disconnected from the person I love and their experiences. 

When we shop we have a bit of a code, ""do you think I should buy this?"" Basically just means ""hey, do you want this?"" It gets tricky because I am short and they are tall so, for example, it is a little obvious if I ask for long leg jeans and size 11 shoes. To combat this we created an imaginary sister. It makes my spouse more comfortable if we discuss their equally tall sister, who needs to just feel more feminine and is sick of mens shoes etc.

I have no real concerns about my spouse coming out to everyone, I know it won't be easy but sometimes I feel impatient for it to just be done but I have to respect that it makes them anxious, and people won't be reacting to me, they will be reacting to my spouse (positive or negative, it can all be overwhelming as I am sure you know). 

It is so important to do regular little check ins and debriefs. Don't feel any guilt about telling your partner that their actions have made you uncomfortable, holding back could make it seem less sincere.

Before you go anywhere, explain your desired level of visibility, who you do/do not want to know etc 

 After each trip out somewhere, thank her for the things she did that specifically put you at ease, and remind her of your boundaries if she walked the line or crossed them. 

Let her know that you want to take this slightly more bitesize approach so it isn't some big overwhelming conversation that carries more weight than it needs to just to make yourself heard. 

Be gentle with eachother, you are both starting a new chapter in your lives together and things won't always go the way you want/expect. As long as you co tinge to strengthen your mutual respect for eachother it will all be okay
That’s the talk we had today. She was almost in tears realizing how upset I was. Which of course made me feel horrible. But maybe it’ll get better going forward, at least I hope so
I am so sorry. 

And believe me, I understand how insensitive this title may sound, I wish you the best my friend
This. I feel like not respecting your wishes is really just not respecting you. 
""I don't want a party."" ""Hey, for your birthday I invited everyone from your work and extended family, surprise~!"" Then you're the a-hole for being mad haha.
I think OP understands this as she has said that she loves her wife and that she can talk about her feelings to her therapist and friend. 
The problem isn't the excitement in itself or the oversupportiveness but that she is outing OP to people without her consent, and making it public when she's not ready yet.
Obviously this is not the worst case scenario and wife sounds really sweet but she still needs to respect OP's boundaries and wishes.
""Women can't keep a secret either. Benjamin Franklin once said three can keep a secret if 2 are dead""

What the fuck?
Don’t feel horrible or bad! This isn’t your fault, you’re just setting boundaries. That’s a totally normal and okay thing to do. One day she’ll have to set boundaries with you, that’s just how a healthy relationship works.

I hope from here on out then that she is more aware of what she says and to whom.
Do not feel guilty for being honest with her. She clearly wasn’t understanding how fearful and anxiety inducing this whole process can be. 

Being supportive means she helps you go at your pace (not hers) and does not talk about your transition with anyone without your express permission. An insane amount of sensitivity is required, and amount that just doesn’t occur to some people without making it abundantly clear.

But it sounds like she was receptive to your concerns. So that’s good.
Make sure to use positive affirmations, like thanking her when she doesn’t do it, some people react well to those
The most important thing to do is remind her that you're happy she's so excited for you, but that you are only ready to share with very very few people you absolutely trust, which is where the hurt is coming from. Constant communication and reassurance that she's totally good to be excited for you, but to try to reign it in when in public.
I'm gonna tell you something I wish someone had told me. If she makes you feel bad every time she'd upset that's emotional manipulation

Honestly I read this and I felt the happiest I have in a while, I wish I could come out to my parents so they could call me there daughter
Nice
Happy for you!
My mom still hasn't done that. It's been 4 years. But she has used my new name lately which is nice. Tho I feel like she does that more for appearances around other people than for me.
thats great congrats
That’s wonderful!  I’m so happy to hear this.
That is so lovely...one of the most beautiful moments in a girls life
AWWW OH MY GOSH I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!! CHEERS, MADEMOISELLE
My mom just called my by my chosen name for the first time ever!
Technically she corrected herself after using my deadname, but she did and I felt so incredibly happy!!!
Nice

Mine won't do it and it's been 2 months soon
Sounds amazing🎉😍
It always makes me happy to hear people make progress, it makes me happy for them and it makes me feel not alone. I've been out for around 4 and a half years and I have loving parents but I doubt I'll be anything else. I went off on a rant sorry, happy 4 u!!!!!
I love this ❤. How validating and heartwarming.
Omg that's so great.. so happy for u ❤️🥰
That's really sweet. congrats.
Congratulations - once you are accepted, you are really accepted, you are really on your way.
I wish you all the luck . it wasn't easy for me so i hope it can be for you
Sometimes I feel that way too although I also worry its just my anxiety
I gave my mom time as i understand I was her son up until I came out to her and she tries this was just the first time she actually said it she still accidentally calls me son or my dead name but i see growth and attempt
I want this kind of mom

I'll be completely honest, if I saw you pass by on the street, I'd have no idea you're trans. You're more than just a pass- you look more male than most of my cis male friends xD keep rockin it, King.
Looking hella dapper my guy, never went to my prom but glad yours went great ;D
Lookin good brother
Awesome! wish I coulda gone to mine lmao
Congrats cutie
You are so incredibly handsome, my dude!!! Your confidence is clearly visible and it makes me look extra forward to my senior social coming up this May. Personally, I haven’t medically transitioned yet, but I conform in all other ways—and may I just say that your outfit is so absolutely stunning that it’s giving me a clear idea of what I’m going to wear when the day comes? Utterly flattering, brother!!! - Elliott <3
I love the black on black with a pink tie. You look great!
My girlfriend told me she has never been to a prom, so this weekend I'm surprising her with an invitation and making our own prom at her place.
So proud of you!
If you hadn't said anything, I would have assumed you were a cis guy! Looking nice.
If you mind me saying, you are quite handsome
great look !
Looking like an absolute king ngl
Ewwww you actually went to prom I didn't because ew people jk mate looking sharp in that tux

Today is my first birthday being Transgender 🎂	"Today is my first birthday after coming out as transgender (MtF). None of my family 'knows' I'm Trans so I would really like it if i can have some birthday wishes for all of you supportive handsome and beautiful people.

Edit: Got my first hate message. Oh well. Nothing is putting me down today, this my day and everyone else's day too. Stay strong all you lovely people, remember that you are who you want to be 😊🏳️‍⚧️

Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who told me Happy Birthday and sent me wishes. I tried my best to respond to every single happy birthday I got, I incredibly undestimated how many of you kind handsome and beautiful people that are willing to stop by and send your wishes. But it's the end of the day now and my bday will be over and I have school tomorrow so like always all good things must come to end. But atleast thus will be one of the best experiences I've ever had and even though it's over atleast I can be happy that it happened anyway. I won't be responding to anymore birthday wishes but even so I will see them and will feel joy from reading them. Thank you everyone and have a great night <3"	"Happy birthday, sister!

Let's take a moment to think about each trans and nonbinary life that was taken since the last Trans day of remembrance in the US. I have a list of their names below	"This is no longer just the US, but I've added people worldwide who've died from homicide and suicide and I am willing to add more anyone else finds. I apologize that I cannot change my title to reflect it is worldwide, but...

To each of you brave souls who came out and lived your true self despite the risks involved, you will not be forgotten 💙💗🤍💗💙

The following are homicide victims, known from the Human Rights Campaign from the United States, links below.

Martina Caldera, Tiffany Banks, Semaj Billingslea, Acey Morrison, Mya Allen, Dede Ricks, Maddie Hofmann, Aaron Lynch, Kandii Reed, Hayden Davis, Marisela Castro, Cherry Bush, Keshia Chanel Geter, Martasia Richmond, Kitty Monroe, Shawmaynè Giselle Marie, Brazil Johnson, Sasha Mason, Chanelika Y'Ella Dior Hemingway, Nedra Sequence Morris, Ray Muscat, Fern Feather, Ariyanna Mitchell, Miia Love Parker, Kenyatta ‘Kesha” Webster, Kathryn “Katie” Newhouse, Tatiana Labelle, Paloma Vazquez, Naomie Skinner, Cypress Ramos, Duval Princess, Amariey Lej

&#x200B;

The following homicide victims are known from Trans Respect and are names of trans people killed worldwide, including a few from the USA that were missed from the HRC(I didn't include any duplicates which both HRC and Trans Respect found, as they are above and were in my original post, but their names are otherwise in order of how they appear in the Trans Respect pdf, over the past year)

These lists may be incomplete and if anyone knows of any others, I would love to respect their life as well and add them on. I do apologize that this may be an incomplete list.

Another redditor pointed out that suicide victims should be remembered as well, and I totally agreed. It is sad to see these people no longer with us, but here is, what is most likely, an incomplete worldwide list of trans suicide victims from this past year and I thought they deserve to be remembered as well.

Chocolatito Anzorra, Serena Brenneman, Alex Bastien, Luise Fernandes Cazé, Ingram Gordon, Monicalorenzi Lorenzi, Valis Ortiz, Taylor, Cloe Bianco, Sasha, Rexy Que, Alice Litman, Danna Nunes, Maddie Dickens, Sherin Celine Mathew, Ruby Taverner, Asher Garcia, Kenna Leigh Gillock, Felis Joy, Amani Frieden, Ezra Amos, Marcela Gomes Fonseca, Mirza-Hélène Deneuve (“Julles”). Kai Khan, Quinn Mowrer Gustin, Celene Gabriela Colantino (“Nati”), Paulo Vaz (“Popo Vaz”), Milo Winslow, Gwenn Agathe Linski, Adrien Baptiste Luckas, Iggy Rose, Destinee Lashaee, Shay Patten Walker, Nicoly, Hanar, Zirve Soylu, Babalu Vendraminy, Emma Boland, Gael Pandino, Kauê Vestemberg, Blair Envy, Amelia Furniss Leonhart, Haley Gabriella Feldman, Joey Spencer(“JoJo”), Tal Pitterbraut-Merx, Tayda Lebón, Zehava, Karol Souza, as well as 6 unidentified victims

Found homicide victims through [hrc.org](https://hrc.org) and [transrespect.org](https://transrespect.org)(thanks to u/JustHere2RuinUrDay). Suicide victims found through [wildhunt.org](https://wildhunt.org). Links below

# Edits: Added in source to trans murder victims worldwide, their names, and changes to my post to reflect the worldwide victims. Latest edit to add in trans suicide victims"	"[deleted]
Came to post this. Thank you bb. May they rest in power. So much collective grief to process.
It's so miserable that our rights are still violated and mistreated
>working on naming them in this post too

I can help you with that. It's too many to fit into a post though

Disclaimer: For some of them we don't know their names, but we know their story and you can read that when you download the list. Also 

>These numbers are just a small glimpse into the reality on the ground. The majority of the data came from countries with a strong network of trans and LGBTIQ organisations that conduct the monitoring. Most cases continue to go unreported and, when reported, receive very little attention.

Thank you to the TGEU for doing this research

Thats too many names...
Thank you, I did this last year but didn't have the motivation to this year
Well, and those outside of the US. Please?

https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-update-tdor-2022/
I don't know if that's a good idea or anything, but could you find a list with people who suicided because of transphobia? I think those people deserve to be remembered as well
May these people rest in peace, and my greatest love goes to their families and friends, the pain these people go though is unimaginable to me. They shall not be forgotten
My ex is on that list there was a tdor event in my city and I didn't go because I knew it would ruin my week. I'm happy I can say goodbye to her and all the other victims of transphobia around the world.
I love you mofos. If anyone needs to talk hmu.
I went to a vigil for tdor yesterday. The ammount of names from the us that were read was pretty insane...
I met a trans woman from the us there too. She recently arrived here (portugal) under asylum from what she went through...
no
https://tegram.click/UUAWmBRvISM3ZWFk
Where did this take place? I can’t find anything online ??
Where did this take place I can’t find anything online
I know I’m late to comment here, but dang… this just saddens me
Even if there was just one name on this list, it’d be too many 😔🏳️‍⚧️
Same. But also resolve to fight for our rights, not just for myself but for everyone like me. No trans kid should feel unloved. No person should feel alone and scared. No one should face discrimination or hatred for how they were born or living their authentic life. I'm going to have a cry and then go on living life to the fullest and fighting to honor those who were not as fortunate. Our comrades shall not be forgotten, and the world will continue moving in the right direction. I will force it to, if needed. This horror will not continue.
That just means the weights on our shoulders to keep progressing.
Thank you again! I wish I'd have read your comment first, but I ended up working on compiling all the names from the Trans Respect source too and kinda didn't read any of my reddit notifications until I just finished 🤦‍♀️  


I do wish I had put further time into looking for a list for worldwide victims before I made the initial post, and I seriously thank you for having found this and put them all into a list too! ❤️

There really are too many people being killed. As I had been spending bits of my free time today researching a bit more about a few here and there, then remembering how many anti-trans laws are getting passed worldwide, it just.. really hits you just how much trans lives are not recognized by so many bigots out there. It's really difficult to deal with, and I've been crying off and on today to be honest. It's just making me feel like I'm glad to have left the state I used to live in that is full of transphobes. I don't think I'm going to ever be comfortable in any extremely regressive and religious area or any place with far right people in it. They just are totally ignorant, don't give a shit about trans lives, or actively are the perpetrators of hate-based crimes against us. Why can't people just leave people alone and let us just live how we want to live?
Yeah, it's a lot and in my country at least, our biggest lgbt org estimates an 80 to 90% dark figure on queerphobic violence.
Thank you!! I was struggling to find a name list worldwide, so I apologize my post was US-centric. I'll edit it and credit you for finding this if you're okay with that :)
I think it's a good idea, thanks for suggesting it. I am working on a list now. I found the below source which has worldwide trans deaths from homicide and suicide for the day of remembrance, which their cause of death is listed to the right. Looks like quite a few are listed suicide so it's just a matter of I'll grab those names with suicide as the cause of death and compile them.  


[https://wildhunt.org/2022/11/transgender-day-of-remembrance-2022.html](https://wildhunt.org/2022/11/transgender-day-of-remembrance-2022.html)  


It may be a half hour-1 hour before I finish because I'll keep looking for other sources on trans suicide for the past year, but I suspect because of suicide generally not being criminalized or even probably not reported on as much as homicides are, I worry many will not be known. I'll comment again if you'd like to see a list of the suicide victims in my post too(will edit it to add them in as well)
I managed to be able to edit my post! I had added a list of suicide victims as well
I am unsure precisely what you're asking, but the people I found were from the linked website in my post, Human Rights Campaign. They also mention where each person was killed if that's what you're asking? Searching each individual name in a search engine will also bring up news stories, should you be interested in reading more about each individual murder victim.
Of course it is! But we have to keep on fighting and supporting each other until the battle is won to make a beautiful would to live freely
Thx <3

Edit: I'm sorry, I should not have assumed a lack of consideration
My first idea was to say ""Hey great!"" but that's not the right words, but thank you for compiling that list though."	z0ed0e	trans	617	0.98	2022-11-20 20:29:05
Weeping tears of joy	My daughter asked me today if she could call me mom permanently. She tried it out before but wasn’t sure how I felt about it. We had a good talk, a good cry, and she asked if I could just be mom from now on. There is definite hope for the future, I’m still basically weeping in joy 💖🏳️‍⚧️	"Congratulations momma!!
That is soo sweet, I'm delighted for you :)
That's so sweet, my heart hurts from all these wholesome vibes. Congrats on officially being mom. 😎🖤
Love this for you!
Omg im so happy for you!!!
You are all way too sweet. I can’t believe I spent 27 years in the closet afraid. Don’t ever doubt that this community changes lives
Awww that's beautiful, I am happy for you 😊
That’s wonderful!  I am so happy for you and your daughter.
this is so sweeetttt T_T I'm so happy for you!!
Well that's so awesome I'm so happy for you ! Congratulations mom ☺️
How nice.
congrats mum! ❤️❤️
Congrats!!^^🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Congratulation! 🥺🥺
Thank you!!! I’m still in shock 😱"	rdpao4	trans	513	1.0	2021-12-11 02:25:54
My new therapist said she could tell I was a girl just from talking to me.	"Yesterday I had my first appointment at a new therapist. I was in boymode for the visit, and didn't bring up being trans until a few minutes into the visit. When I did, my therapist said she could already tell I was a woman and sensed ""how feminine you are"". I'm over the moon, I've never had anyone tell me that before. I feel so affirmed by this girl aura I apparently give off. Just wanted to share some joy.

Edit: a word"	"Good therapist. Super happy for you!!
That’s amazing!! I’m so happy for you!
😁That must feel very validating 😁❤️
Good for you queen. I hope it gets even better from here
Yey, celebration for feeling good. Glad you felt safe and validated.
Awesome x
She's just buttering you up for the CBT and hard work she'll be putting you through lol

Best of luck!
""Girl aura"" I love that phrase! Also, Congrats! We need more Euphoria for everyone!!! 🎉🎉🎉
yesss
That's awesome!"	y31hzr	trans	405	0.99	2022-10-13 15:23:48
how do ya'll feel when you see other trans people with your deadname?	Personally, I LOVE it. Like, I hated this name and it made me feel terrible but seeing other people choose it and love it like I never could brings me so much joy.	"I have met many trans men and none of them have chosen my deadname. I can't blame them, I never liked it 🤣
can't say I've met any, but take it, I'm not using it. it's not a bad name, it just didn't work for me.
I haven't met a trans person named Joseph yet, but when I do it'll be really cool! It's like our crossover point as we each head to our final forms!
Like trading Pokémon cards
Also love it, mostly, but a very famous, very unkind trans woman chose my given name and I have mixed feelings on sharing an ID with her until I can get my legal changed lol. (Even then, nbd).

Everyone else? Hell yeah.
I personally don't think I've met a trans person with my deadname, but while I certainly would be happy for them finding a name they like, I know it would feel weird. Currently my deadname is very popular, so even tho I'm not out, I hear it more often being said to someone else than to me. And still it always feels so wrong just hearing the name at all
If you pick mine then I have a question for you: why? There are so many boy names that are way better.
I always felt kinda detached from my deadname and when I was like seven I would straight up forget what I was called and now that I've gone by my real name for a while I'm kind of back to that and I have to go 'oh right that's my deadname' when I get a letter or a bill from the government so other people with my deadname I don't really have any particular feelings towards.

It's a terribly common name anyway there would always be multiple guys with that name in my class when I went to school.
Hearing or reading my deadname or any variation of it cause me chills on my tummy, I really don't feel any good, but try to be ok
Haven't met one, AFAIK, but know a handful of cis people with my deadname... And one of them I just call by his online handle most of the time (which doesn't include it), so it causes me to take 1d4 psychic damage any time I remember.
I have a coworker who's cis, but he's got my deadname. I think he gives it a good rep.
I don't like it because I hate hearing that name, but there's nothing I can really do about it. I can't just tell them not to go by their name.
never saw someone with it :(
I would feel positively about it (I've never seen another trans person with my birth name). I like the name, I'd be glad others are getting good gender affirming use out of it.
Personally never found anyone who took the name Zander yet but I love my new name
I don’t even blink at my deadname, it’s not me so if someone else likes it go for it
My deadname is rather uncommon so I’ve barely ever met any CIS men with it, much less any trans ones - I think if I do though, it would be super cool and I would love to see it happen!
I have never met any trans person with my deadname...I've only ever seen this random first grader with it back when I was in elementary school.

To be fair, it isn't super common so-
I love seeing it. I’ve even suggested it to a transmasc gentleman I know
i cant stand anyone who has my deadname
I’ve never seen anyone else with my deadname, ever. But I have seen it once on here as a suggestion for someone looking for a name, it does pop up in a semi-popular TV show, which I imagine is where they got it from. If you vibe with my deadname, for all means use it, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it more than I ever did.
never met another person with my exact name in my life unfortunately. closest was the same spelling but the first letter was a J. i can imagine if i met a girl with my birthname i would either be very uncomfortable because there are people in my school who knew me in elementary or middle school that know it and could be like ""hehe kris she has ur deadname"" or i would be very insitent on being her friend. or just secretly kinda giddy. like ""hehe...she found my name beautiful enough to make it hers too :]""

never had a trans girl for a friend and I'd love to because there are so many ftms around me it's just annoying now. ftm btw
i grew up knowing people second handed with my deadname (ex a friends mom, a friends friend etc) and i never liked my deadname in the first place and honestly i only cared about my name, never cared too much for other peoples name (expect their prefer one ofc)
I wouldn't know
I think it has an ugly sound, but if it makes you happy, cool. I'm actually surprised it's not more common, considering I used to share a name with a super famous actress.
I haven’t seen it before but if I did it wouldn’t bother me
It doesn't click that it was my name at first
TBH I see more women with fem versions of my old name.

It's a little weird and awkward and it might be a bigger thing if I was friends with someone IRL who had such a name but its not a big deal or anything.

Just a huh sort of thing.
I hope it brings them more happiness than it brought me, but...than I am reminded of my school years where there was always several people with my first and middle names and at least one with my last. Honestly 4th grade was the worst because there were 2 others with my first, 3 others with my middle, and 1 with my last. I never knew if someone was talking to me or not and hope they don't have to deal with that kind of situation.
I’ve never met anyone like this, but I mean hey, if it makes them happy, go for it. It’s not like I’m using it anymore anyway, lol
Don't think any will pick my deadname. I tell people what my deadname was and they don't believe me because it's so boring
There are sooooo many people named Jennifer, if someone that's trans likes that name, I'd encourage them to use it.
My deadname is really old fashioned but hell if you like it more than I do feel more than free to use it
I never disliked that name and I'm glad they're getting good use out of it. It might feel a little weird about it tho
I'm a trans guy with a deadname that has no English version, it's a pretty old name originated in my country and it means Moonrise, I actually loved it but it did feel off, like it was not my name or not a name at all even pre egg crack. I would LOVE to meet someone with my deadname tho, bet they would be amazing
I had a pretty common dead name so I tried to put a positive spin on seeing it around. I’m glad that something I didn’t feel comfortable with can help someone else be who they truly are. One persons trash is another ones treasure after all!
Personally while I’m glad that it’s a name that is comfortable for them, I still hate seeing it. It’s not their faults of course, but still I can’t stand the sight of it. Even just hearing it makes me cringe badly. So while I obviously would respect any other trans person that happens to have this name I would still be a little uncomfortable from the sheer fact that they have my deadname.
I love it… mainly because I got my name from a trans woman.. me and my cousin are both trans and she needed a new and so did I… so we decided to switch names and now every time I see her, instead of a feeling of dread from hearing the name, I get extremely happy because I know shes happy with her name
I haven’t met one yet, but I think I’d feel good that it’s not my name anymore, it’s theirs now
Yeah, can't say that I saw any trans men with my deadname. It's a slavic name and slavic names aren't very popular.
My deadname is actually a very common name for trans men to pick for some reason. When I first went to my endocrinologist, she assumed I was a trans man and that I'd written my legal and preferred names in the wrong boxes because she'd met so many trans men with this name
When I (20ftm) got top surgery I was talking to a trans womens mom while she was in surgery and her deadname is my chosen name
Well my deadname is common in my generation. No one know it bcs i didnt use it since idk 2000. So yea and often person call me by my second name wich is 100% not connected to my deadname. Even a friend of mine thought i had a sex affair with a friend of my deathname bcs i have an old school shorth with it on it.

Now when i hear or call the name its not mine im not that person.
No one think i'm this name. Bcs i was it never.
Ash is such an awesome name! Really cool wish my name was ash
It’s a good girls name it’s kinda basic but I went with Finn so I’m not judging. It’s also hella common so I’m used to hearing it for other people
I like my dead name I wish it was more neutral i like willow though I feel it fits me better.
I’m actually pretty okay with my deadname, and If anyone knows another Rigel, I’d be very interested to hear about it.
My deadname is incredibly rare. I would find it intriguing. Lol
I mean I feel like I should feel something about my zombiename (deadname that lives on because unisex) but as it's Alex I'm just ... Torn/indifferent 😐 don't like it as a guy but  love it as a girl's name. So silver linings eh I guess😏?.
Idk am I over thinking this?

P.s. trying to make zombiename a thing for unisex names so can y'all just act like it's a thing? Kthxbye ❤️
I've met a non-binary person who has taken the English version of my deadname as their temporary name before they find a better one while I've taken their deadname
Never going to happen. No one has my birth name. It was genuinely unique
I don’t see many people with my name but I’ve thought about it before and I feel like having a new face/person to associate the name to would be a good idea.
It’s okay. I feel happy that they love the name that was never mine to begin with.
I have one of the most common English male dead names ever so I have accepted that other will have it and if a transmasc wants it go for it. It ain’t mine to gatekeep
I'll be honest, I've only met one other trans guy- never really knew him besides from his dead name. Weren't friends or anything, more like we would sometimes exchange greetings.

Though if I met a trans girl with my dead name I'd be surprised, I found my dead name rather lame to be honest. Though main reason I hated it was because my mom based it off of her favorite rappers daughter -.-
Glad it works for them, but since I haven't legally changed my name yet, it still stings a bit.

Even hearing about celebs with my dead name is a bit aggravating.

I hope someday I can get over this.
its a weird feeling, thats for sure

i once met a trans guy who's prefname was my deadname, and my prefname was his deadname, it was a bit awkward ngl
It reminds me of when I didn't know about being transgender, I hate it.
This is just the name in general, it's just when I hear it regardless of context.
Honestly, I wouldn’t mind, trans or cis people having my deadname allows me to dettach that name from me and I wouldn’t associate my deadname with me no more
My deadname is far too generic for anyone to choose it
Good choice. It is a fine name, just not mine.
My deadname is non-English and extremely uncommon; I've never even met a cis person with my name, let alone another trans person 💀
A lot of trans-women have my youngest child's deadname while I've seen zero trans-men with my deadname

As my youngest has stated: So long as they give it a good home and lots of love, we're cool with it
Haven't met a transfem named Leyna yet but like understandable it kinda sucks lol
I’ve never heard of or met a trans person with my dead name so I’ll tell you when I find one
""It was mine, but now it is yours. Give it the lease on life I could never, I wish you all the best"" is how I basically think of it
never met one :/
im not sure how i'd feel, i've met many cis people with it and i've gotten to a point where hearing it doesn't bother me anymore
Philosophy Tube can take it, glad it makes her happy
not really my deadname but the name i chose to keep when i started transitioning, seeing Dylan Mulvaney be so popular on TikTok makes me so happy.
Yeah I straight up HATED my dead name until I saw someone on Reddit using it and it just sounded so pretty for them
It's definitely an out of body experience and slightly uncomfortable but you know what, as long as they're happy with the name, it doesnt concern me
""my deadname. Free to a better home.""
my deadname is the name of a very popular guilty gear character. i’m glad that the name that’s hurting me can help loads of other trans people.
A friend of mine picked my dead name cause she finds it cute. I even got it tattooed on my wrist (before I knew I'm trans) cause it was a bd present from my father. I like the name, thought I feel so disconnected to it
I actually like my deadname. Not for me but if others use it I am happy. I want to keep it as my second name once I change my name. It’s still a part of me imo
I've never met any person with my deadname before in 23 years, not even a cis person. It isn't a common name either though.
If only they could use my tits in the same way 🥴
I love it! I've personally donated my deadname to at least two men who needed one.
I’ve never experienced this and idk, I feel like I’d hate it just as much as I hate it when a cis person has it. I just don’t like it and would gladly never hear it again. I get no joy from the fact other people have that name
Literally happening in my life as a manager for the company I work for who has been an out trans man for quite some time just announced a couple of weeks ago that he's now going by a new name, and that name just so happens to be my deadname. I feel the same way about being happy he's getting use out of it, and since he knew me as my deadname when I started working there, I've joked with him that he owes me royalties. :p

Honestly the weirdest part has been correcting other people, saying stuff like ""actually it's <name> now"" when I used to have to do the opposite back when I had just started using my current name. Almost makes me dysphoric tbh but I know that's just my brain being weird. The name suits him better than it did me, so I'm happy for him!
Anyone with my dead name, trans or otherwise

I hate it so much- like it feels somehow like PTSD if that makes senss
For me it’s the same as another normal person with my deadname
Surprisingly I have seen one trans girl with my deadname, exact spelling and stuff and it was so interesting and cool.
Not the same thing but someone where I work has my dead name and they page him over the intercom at times and every single time my stomach lurches, Fun times
I really don't care, its their name not mine
I mean I’m not trans but if and when I change my name. I’ll definitely meet a lot of people with my old name. Cuz my name is Ethan which is literally the most common name and I’m probably gonna change it to Robyn
I'm iffy on it. To the point where I've stopped watching series or movies if a character has my deadname. I don't know anyone irl with my deadname, but for my drama gcse we're doing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. My deadname just so happens to be in that. So I'm gonna have to put up with that for a year.
I always flinch a little whenever I hear my deadname but I’d still be happy because that person was able to find a name they like!
i love it. i love seeing my name bring so much happiness after mine brought me so much pain. it was also so pretty, i love it
i find it interesting. my deadname wasn't right for me, but that doesn't mean it's not right for anyone else. best part is that it helps me stop associating the name with myself and start associating it with other people
My deadname isn't very common so I don't see any trans or cis people with it. Though it is a little basic at the same time...
I hate it
Mine was after a great author and a great musician, so I don’t much mind it I just associate it with the singers and the writer
My dead name isn't super common, so whenever I see it on someone else I feel a little weird but mostly just relieved that it's not being used for me anymore. I also have a lot of internalized stereotypes about the name that are hard to shake, that definitely affect my first impression of anyone who ""chooses"" to go by that name. It's a beautiful name, I just hated living with it for 20 years.
They suit it more than me so they can have it
Personally it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I could never call someone my dead name, I hate saying it. It's unfortunate because one of my trans friends chose that name 🙃
I hate my old name. I hate hearing it. I'm tired of having to be polite when I meet other people who have it.
I don't really mind it, I mean I hate my deadname but I can't control if other people have it
Idk. I’ve never met one.
I don't hate my deadname actually. I kinda did the cliche where I picked a new name that's pretty similar. If someone else likes it, good for them
Weirded out tbh
Can't do it. Although I've never met a transwoman with my exact deadname, I have met someone with a version of it and was like, ""I'm sorry my deadname is in your name and it's weird to refer to you.""
My dead name's really uncommon, and I'd probably get confused if I hear their friend call for them and both of us would look up at them cuz some assholes at school still use my dead name and I can't kick myself into not acknowledging them when they use it
nah my deadname is really ugly i don't think any self-respecting transfem would pick it
I dont mind, I dont even have any negative feelings to my dead name bc it aint my name
My deadname was used to abuse me for most of my life and almost everyone I've met who has it has been a god awful terrible person for some reason, so honestly it would probably make me feel a little uncomfortable interacting with someone with that name because it feels like I'm insulting them everytime I say it, but I'd try my best to just focus on the part that they've found something that feels right for them, and try my best not to let my negative feelings associated with that name overshadow anything.

Also my deadname is a name people type as ""slutty"" and things along that line so that would also make me feel uncomfortable calling someone the name but I don't know, if it were to make someone happy to have that name I'd be glad at least someone out there can have it by positive choice instead of as a constant reminder of lost body autonomy. :/
My deadname is very unique so I haven't met anyone with it yet. My research showed that the closest names to it were middle eastern (not intended by my parents) and even then not that common.  


I have no idea how I'd react to this situation. Buut I expect to feel uncomfortable, and probably upset if that person was named like this in full knowledge that it's my deadname
Can't tell you never seen one with mine but im happy they feel comfortable with the name i have hated being called for so long
Same
“Here use my name because I won’t”
Lol we started with the same name so are we just parallel lives although I chose Jessica not Josephine cause people would make fun of me by calling me that or Josephina which just mildly annoyed me so i separated myself as much as I could from with with Jessica
Fyi shouldn’t say ur deadname gives ppl a way to deadname u on here in ur dms
Is that trans woman Caitlyn Jenner?
Yeah, I get this. My dead name is somewhat biblical, so I’ve never met a trans person with it but do encounter others with it (including a Skyrim character). Always been weird.  But I think a trans person choosing it would feel like someone picked up, like, my copy of the name after I put it on the market. Idk. It’d be different & nicer. 

Also if anyone guesses the name given my two hints, I will confirm
I have been in multiple scenarios where there were 2 or more people with the same name and one had to go by a nickname
Jessica's a very pretty name! I was going to go with Emily, the name my mom would have chosen had I been born a girl, but then fell in love with Josie/Josephine!
Jarl Balgruf?
Yeah I get it I like Josie its such a beautiful name too but I’m glad you fell in love with your name like I did mine
Lmao I wish!
Yep that's the important thing, that we've found a name we're happy to use as our own!"	xgai9a	trans	389	0.99	2022-09-17 02:43:16
Son wanting girls things	"I have a 5 year old autistic son who is my pride and joy. He’s always been interested in stereotypical girls toys such as baby dolls, dolls house etc. he has some girls Hey Duggee pyjamas and chose himself 2 play suits to wear during the summer. I allow him to be his free self. 

The other day he told me he doesn’t want to be a boy, and didn’t want to be a boy when he was little. I told him it’s fine to feel that way, and just because he’s a boy, it doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy girls things. He likes to occasionally wear make up and get his nails done with me. 

I’m now just wondering if I should change my approach. Should I begin actively taking interest in “girl” things with him? Or should I continue to wait until he requests such things? 

I have no issue if he is gay/trans/undecided. As long as he is healthy and happy and a decent person.

Edit: this should really be titled something else because its not really about him wanting “girls things” but more on how to support his choices. Also for anyone who may not like the way I may word somethings, please remember I am talking to a 5 year old autistic child who needs language simplified. I have told him he can play with whatever toys he wants, wear what clothes he wants (I’m going to take him shopping and let him choose all his own things). Thank you for the comments so far."	"Consider also r/cisparenttranskid.  Just support them for now and take their lead. If they're trans then great and no permanent decision will be made for a long time. If he's just feminine that's great too. They'll figure themselves out in time. Just give them the space to explore. Side note: I think trans people are more likely to be nuerodivergant but I don't recall the percentage increase
Trans people are much more likely to be autistic or neurodivergent than the general population. It doesn't mean that they are trans, but they are asserting a gender identity really hard at a young age. Some kids just know and I think your child does. The big thing here is freedom and acceptance and I think you're doing a good job with that.

It is pretty dismissive for them to tell you that they don't want to be a boy and for you to respond with boys can do girly things too. Liking girly things and being a girl are two different things. I would ask your child whether they want to be referred to as a girl or boy and respect their wishes. They might change their mind in the future, but that would be perfectly fine!

I think you should engage with your kid and do things that interest them or that you think will interest them. It doesn't have to be intensely gendered. But, yeah, do girly things with them as well as not girly things.
You never made them feel like they couldn't do certain things as a boy, so if they say they want to be a girl, it's probably not just about them liking girly things.  


You should at the very least teach them that trans people exist and that you'd be okay with them being trans.  


And it's okay if they think they're trans but they're not. Let them explore, there is nothing inherently harmful about it, while taking away their agency on the matter is inherently harmful even if the person making decisions in their place were right. Autistic people often struggle with people taking away their agency, so this is doubly important
if they tell you they don’t want to be a boy and have never wanted to be a boy, responding by telling them they’re a boy is invalidating and dismissive, even if it’s in the context of telling them they can be whatever kind of boy they want. you’re still mandating their gender even if you’re not policing it’s expression.
I suggest you check out Gender Spectrum, an organization with resources specifically for families with children like yours. https://genderspectrum.org/

One thing I've heard is that a trans child will be ""persistent, insistent and consistent"" in expressing their identity. If that describes your child's interest in being a girl, it might be worthwhile to let them experiment with living as one. Keep in mind that names, pronouns, and wardrobe changes are easy, low-risk and require no long-term commitment. It's not like your child is getting any irreversible changes done.
Well my advise is to try and see a therapist specialised in trans healthcare so you can support your kid to the fullest if he does turn out to be a trans girl. If he doesnt then theres no harm done.

Thank you for being an amazing parent, not too many people ask for help from trans peeps regarding trans stuff and the fact that youre trying already means the world
Im autistic and also knew when I was very young, probably 7 or 8 for sure. I didn't start medically/socially transitioning until I was 24, and I was in denial for my entire teenage years. I can say that if I had supportive family as a kid, and had the freedom to just *be* a girl at that age, my childhood would've been so much more fulfilling and less traumatizing. 

I try really hard to focus on the positives, that I can live happily as a girl now. But I, and most trans people I know, feel like they missed out on a full childhood. I also have permanent changes from puberty that could've been halted.  

It seems like you take your child seriously, which is awesome to see. I don't think it's too early to have the conversation about whether they want to be a boy or girl, or neither, and treat that seriously. However, my advice is, I think it's important for you to create an environment where gender and expression can be playful and fun too. Part of what held me back for so long was the idea that gender and sexuality were a fire and brimstone topic (southern baptist yeehaw). Good luck!
I think some people in this thread are jumping the gun in deciding that your kids is trans. Just let your kid do their thing and be supportive of whatever their interests and choices are, there's no need to make major life decisions at this age
Usually you shouldn’t assume someone is trans because they like stuff that’s stereotyped to be liked by the other gender, but if they say they don’t want to be the gender assigned to them at birth, then it’s safe to assume they’re trans
Honestly it sounds like you're doing great. Kids, especially neuro-divergent kids, need to come to things on their own. The best thing you can do is not to be an obstacle, and you're doing a great job at that from the sound of it.

If your child wants to do ""girly"" activities, participate, but I'm not sure initiating is the best thing here. I've worked with a few neuro-divergent kids (I'm neuro-divergent myself) and it's always a challenge to figure out the best way to communicate with them.

It sounds like you love your child and that they know that in their own way. And they get that you support however they choose to express themselves in positive ways.
Hello my lovely 💛 you sound like a lovely parent and I'm so glad your child has you. I think it's best to just follow their lead, if they want to do something girly then encourage it and support it but sometimes they might want to do something that is typically a boy thing. Dont overthink it too much they will find themselve and grow up happy if you support them. Also I would suggest if they are saying they don't want to be a boy, instead of saying you can do girl things maybe try saying they can be a girl you want 😊 it's small but I think it will help them feel safe and free to be who they are if their gender is a choice rather than what gender norms they do. I hope this help💛
Probably let them know that being a girl is a thing that they can do.

I am also autistic and had those signs but I wasn't really told I was allowed to be a girl, and all the culture thrown on top of little boys is the whole ""boys rule, girls drool"" stuff which can caused me to hide my dysphoria until my life dissolved in front of my eyes.

Tbh, just be glad they are telling you this. A full childhood of dysphoria can cause a ton of damage to someone psyche.
Just want to say you sound like a supportive parent regardless of your child's path and wish there were more parents like you out there!  

I think just letting them figure out themselves at their own pace and giving them that space and support to do so is amazing, like you are doing.  If they are interested and want to share, I think they always appreciate that encouragement 😊
Just wanted to say that i love seeing posts like these, it makes me so happy to see good, supportive parents out there :)

My advise is let your kid experiment! Ask them what feels right and definitely ask about pronouns! If you keep an open mind and lead with love you’ll do great ☺️
You do just that, support him. Get him kids books about different genders, sexualities, books about two same gendered parents etc and see what happens. He very likely lacks better words, as would many children that age. Or maybe hes just drawn to the color scheme of toys marketed for girls. Who knows!? Just keep listening, letting him lead, and believing him no matter what.

I have a 4yo who loves girls things but is 100% sure her p3nis is in the mail and she does NOT want a period ever but shes going to make babies one day. Idk what that means in her mind right now and i dont really care. Shes 4. Im just creating a safe space for her to keep this conversation going.
(Trans Guy) the best thing you can do is let them explore their identity. Ask them if they want to be called a girl and if they say yes then start doing so until your kid is around 12-13-14 then ask them if they still feel like a girl and want to go on puberty blockers which are 100% reversible if they decide that's not them. If They do go on puberty blockers and still know they are a girl then at 16 you can do hormone therapy. But for now just support your child since there aren't many parents that do.
I don't know? I'd just let him decide on what toys and stuff he wants to do. Though I will say it's a little odd for him to be exploring his ""gender""(?) this early. But he's probably just being a kid and I wouldn't think too much into it. There's no real way he understands gender at this point in his life. If he's trans he more than likely won't know and won't come out until he reaches his tweens/teens. The most important thing to remember is that being gay/trans isn't a choice and nothing you do can really stop it from happening. Also remember that gender and sexuality aren't connected, he could end up being a trans woman that likes women. Just remember to be supportive of him and do not keep from doing ""girl things"" if that's what he wants to do. Though as I said he's probably just being a kid and doesn't really think anything of it or understands the concept of gender yet. 

Also you could do some research into having a trans child just in case it comes around. There's is a term in the trans community called an ""egg"" that he would fall under if he was trans. Just remember also if he does turn out to be trans and mentions wanting to start hormones (and ultimately this is your choice) it is far easier to transition during actually puberty. I regret and somewhat resent my parents every day for not letting me start hormone replacement therapy at 13 when I wanted to because now daily I have to shave facial hair and body hair every week or so.
Sounds like your child is trans. You should take them seriously, listen to them, and make this an open point of conversation.

Also maybe refer to them in neutral or feminine ways if they've expressed that they're not a boy.
(Second paragraph): this really triggered me, too
It's wonderful your supportive of your trans kid.

Watch that video. It might help.
Encourage exploration? Try feminine and masculine things together.
just have a conversation about it, ask them these things, I would also ask if they would like to try new pronouns and/ or name
So this is actually something that can be hard to place. A number of trans people are autistic (myself included) and a number of autistic people may question their gender, but are not trans. It is all very complicated and I don't understand it all myself but what I do know is I and others precieve gender differently, and while there is a link to that and being trans, it is not necessarily the case either. I am not a parent but I do know that things would have been a lot easier for me if I had a parent who supported my interest in toys of the other gender, and talked to me about gender expression and the idea of being trans. I can't tell you if your kid will grow up to transition one day, maybe even in the next year, but I do know that he will always break the mold when it comes to gender stereotypes, and that is something that should be supported. I don't know if that helps, and I think you are already doing that to some degree or another, but I think support, education and letting him chose what he will is the best way to go, and let him give you signals of his needs and preferences.
Going against the grain here, but I do not think you need to/should ask you child to decide whether they want to be a boy or a girl, then based on their response, make commitments to that ( e.g. refering to them as a girl thereafter) particularly without them asking for that thenselves. especially at such an early age. I think you don't need to ask your child searching questions about these things in general and can just accept them and follow their own lead as they explore their own identity, while offering an accepting environment for them. I think these are huge questions to ask a very young child while they are still exploring gender and its essentially like forcing someone out of the closet e.g. asking your child if they are gay or straight. I think that continuing to accept and support whatever interests your child has and giving totally neutral and accepting responses to comments about the child's own gender is more helpful e.g. child ""I want to be a girl"" adult: ""OK :)"". You can just create a generally accepting environment by making comments such as ""you can be whatever you want to be"" and ""I will always love you whatever happens"". I think you can treat the feminine interests as you would any ither interests in a childs life, you dont need to prticualaly encourage or doscourage them, just show accepting appreciation and enthusiasm. I also don't think you should be worried that telling him he is a boy was wrong or harmful. Obviously I don't know your child or how aware he is of gender yet, but I can only imagine its very basic as he's only 5. many autistic 5 yos haven't yet or have only very recently began to actually understand/recognise gender in its most basic sense yet, and even typically developing children normally develop typical use of pronouns he/she/him/her/his around 4. Its relevant for many typically developing children to explain and help label boy/girl/man/woman just for them to get the basic idea that gender exists before they can even understand their own gender identity based off that.
Sounds like you're on the right track.   Just love and support him no matter what and make sure you always listen to what he says, not what you want to hear or think he means.
Support him. If he turns out to be cis, cool! Trans? Also cool! Maybe go to someone specialized with that kinda stuff.

The best thing to do is to acknowledge your child's identity early on. I was like him when I was younger (though I wanted to be the opposite of a girl) but I didn't have the same support you give your kid, and that caused a bit of issues with figuring out my identity. Just give your kid unconditional love!
The medical/biological reasons why remain mysterious, but there does seem to be a significant correlation between being on the spectrum and being gender non-conforming: Lots of autistic people are trans, and lots of trans people are somewhere on the spectrum. So that's something to be aware of.

But yeah, I'd changing your wording if I were you. It's not about ""it's ok to like girl things even if you're a boy"". Because honestly, you don't *know* if he's a boy. All you know is that he has a body that has a masculine configuration. But you can't read his mind. You can't look in there and determine what his gender identity is. He's the only one with access to his own thoughts and feelings. He's the only one who can observe his own inner sense of gender.

And he seems to be telling you that ""boy"" ain't it.

Obviously, approach with caution: don't rush into anything, given the language challenges your kid faces, make sure you understand what he actually means by what he's telling you. But ultimately, this is about respecting your kid's authority about his/her/their own identity.

And make sure that both you and your kid know that there's a difference between how your body is configured and what gender you actually feel like. For most people they match, sure, but for trans people they don't. That's the core of being trans.

There may be language challenges, but your kid is probably not dumb, right? So I think if you can educate them about the difference between gender identity (internal; only self-observable) and gender expression (external, visible to all), that you can trust them to think about that and accurately report to you whether these two aspects of themselves match (cis) or don't match (trans).
Your child reminds me of myself when I was around his age. We said and wanted similar things. Also, I’m autistic
Part of the problem with our society is that people feel like they have to ""pick a side!""  Why can't boys who like girl things and girls who like girl things just be and act and dress as they please, at a young age or as adults?  Women wear stereotypical male clothing all the time and have been doing so for a century (in this country anyway).  Hopefully, sooner rather than later, it won't matter what a guy wears in public any more than it does for a woman.  Feel like a dress, wear a dress, feel like stockings and heels, wear em to work or to the club.  Clothing and toys and games do not have gender and we harm our children by shoving them in the artificial boxes which society dictates.

I applaud your openness in supporting your child.  My advice would be simple to support them and love them no matter what they eventually determine is their path.
I don't know how to help but I want to say you are an amazing mom and the fact that you want the best for your child no matter who they are or want to be is an inspiration for any other parent wanting to do best by their child
Stop treating toys and activities and clothes like they're gendered and just let your kid do what they wanna do. Let them know that they don't have to be a boy *or* a girl, but they can be if they want to be, it doesn't matter. Don't choose things based on gender but just on if they sound like they could be fun.

Is it likely your kid is trans? Yeah, it's pretty likely from the sounds of things. Does that mean you should be pushing them in the direction of *any* gender roles? No, that's all stuff for your kid to work out for themselves. You just have to be open and supportive, and you need to be more open to the notion that gender isn't really as important as we often grow up believing.
It's amazing that you are supporting your child, no matter what they want to be. You could attempt going up to your child and offering to do one of these activities (e.g. nail painting, playing with dolls).
When they say they want to be a girl, your response is just to assume that they want to do girly things. It’s rarely that simple and often goes much deeper than that. Do they feel discomfort at the thought of being a boy? Have you asked why they want to be a girl? The best thing you can do is attempt to understand and in turn help them understand their own feelings. It’s also important to keep in mind that sexuality≠gender identity and gender identity is a separate concept from gender expression!
Neurodivergent people are 6-10 times more likely to be transgender, and about 10-15 times more likely to be LGBTQ+
This, absolutely this! Was actually wondering about the link between neurodivergence and genderissues too as I've come across quite some people with ADHD in other genderrelated groups.
Yeah, I would add irt the language used being dismissive, I'm autistic and I even now would not be sure exactly how to respond to just being told it's ok to like doing girly things. If I were you, op, I would now, after the fact, follow up and communicate explicit affirmation, as Lilly said here
⬆️ This!! 


I think 5 is a bit too young to even worry about whether a child is trans or not. I’d be supportive and let them choose their own path within reason. 
You are a great parent 😊
It’s not at all odd for him to be exploring his gender at 5. Many trans people have vivid memories of doing so at that age and being aware there is something “off” 
even younger. I myself remember being 3/4 learning to keep my curiosity and confusion to myself because it was condemned by my Christian family. I’m glad kids today can live in a more supportive world.
(Second paragraph about calling the child a Boy): this really triggered me, too

Sorry I meant this as a comment to what Iamcalledlilly wrote.
Ewww go somewhere else
yeah, didn't one study show that 1/4 of trans people are autistic?
Source?
can you gimme a source so i can send it to my parents
>[https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq)

That study says

""autistic adults and adolescents are approximately eight times more likely to identify as asexual and ‘other’ sexuality than their non-autistic peers. And there were sex differences in sexual orientation: autistic males are 3.5 times more likely to identify as bisexual than non-autistic males, whereas autistic females are three times more likely to identify as homosexual than non-autistic females.""

Didn't see anything about trans folks in that study summary, but I will keep digging.

edit: here we go -- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770077/
Can confirm as an autistic transgender individual
But wasn’t it also stated that neurodivergent people are more likely to look into those things, especially earlier on, than their neurotypical counterparts? Simply because we’re less likely to just go along with something when it doesn’t feel right.
Honestly I don’t think it’s that trans people are more likely to be neurodivergent but that neurodivergent people are more likely to come out as trans. There’s already a degree of separation from “normalcy” for a lot of neurodivergent people so we’re a lot more likely to consider we may be different from most people in other ways too
1st year psych dropout so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

my hypothesis is that a lot of people on the autism spectrum do not see the normal, in-built societal norms. things like making eye contact, body language, certain behaviours, etc. and i think gender tends to be one of those. instead of it just being ""this is how it is for everyone"" autistic folks will go ""why though?"" 

again, i'm not doctor, speaking purely from anecdotal/my own experience as an autistic trans woman.
Oh.
lol
“Our group of people has a high suicide rate. The increase in social acceptance has increased our suicide rate. Your identity is a construction. You should encourage parents to construct their children’s identity around our group. Who cares if encouraging that will cause suicidal ideation”

You are advocating for a parent to treat their child poorly. The child is 5 years old. 

Think about what you are actually advocating
I think its 1/4 of trans folks are on the spectrum including things like ADD/ADHD.
I think so. It’s been over a year, and I read numerous studies.
Multiple studies including news media. I forget how I started down that path, but I believe there a study that is either Danish or Dutch that would be a place to start.
[https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq)

There are plenty of Google results alongside this one article
Yeah, I read something in the neighborhood of 10-20 different articles a little over a year ago to come up with my numbers. Sounds like I need to up them again, maybe.
They’ve done neurology studies that show gay brains function differently than straight brains. Trans brains function in line with gender identity, not sex assigned at birth. Age of exposure is irrelevant to the subject. Neurodivergent people are more likely to be LGBTQ+.
Yeah,this. NDs are more likely to be queer. 

It's thought that since we don't follow social rules as much it could be due to being able to come out/accept ourselves easier, but that part is t fact, just one theory.
I’m ND myself and came to similar conclusions some time ago.  ND folks are just used to being different and tend to accept the idea of being different in other ways more readily.  I don’t think that there being a higher percentage of ND folks is just true for identifying as trans but for any divergence from social norms on gender and sexuality.  We’re more habituated to being different.

I have seen higher than average ND rates among the local trans, ace, queer (in the broader sense), kink and polyamorous communities.  When you start overlapping those groups, the ND rate soars.  Among the trans folks in the kink community around here, at least half are ND and they’re almost always queer and poly too.  It’s like at some point we just come to terms with not following the social norm and are more willing to just try to explore the non-traditional.  Being ND doesn’t make us divergent on sex and gender but it definitely makes us more self-accepting if we are and thus more visible and out about it.

Our social awkwardness can actually insulate us from social pressures that neurotypical folks seem to experience (e.g. I have trouble noticing a disapproving look at my presentation from a stranger or understanding why I should care much even if I do notice it - as long as the people who are important to me are accepting, I’m good).  I don’t feel shame about being different.  I just am different and I am pretty okay with that.  

My neurotypical friends often seem to think I am courageous for being so openly different but I don’t think I am.  I think I just don’t internalize pressure to conform like they do so I never have to overcome the challenges they are projecting onto me based on their experiences and thinking.  It’s the ""marching to the beat of my own drummer"" thing, not bravery.
mad? i'm transitioning and happy, you're definitely bitchless
Thanks, I’m not doubting, it’s just a pretty staggering stat and I was curious where you saw it.

Sharing some trans joy positivity!	Hey everyone! I'm a 19 year old transgender guy. I was thinking about my life, then I suddenly realized.. I'm actually living the life I've always dreamed of! When I look into the mirror I love the person I see, I see ME! I'm in a space in my life where I genuinely love myself! I always have felt like a man deep within my core, and actually seeing my outside reflect my inside makes me so happy! The way I look is exactly how I've always saw myself. But.. it isn't only about how I look, I stopped caring long ago about others perception of me, I'm a guy no matter what anybody says. That's how I started to love myself! If you're a trans person struggling, I want to tell you to keep going! Things WILL get better for you! I'm living my best life and SO WILL YOU! :D I believe in my trans Brothers, Sisters, and siblings!	"Still  half-dreaming but positive outlook keeps me going. Love it!
Brosters and Sisthers.... Why do I like mixing binary genders together same with hir and hem.

Also thx. And am happy that you are happy

Also also HAPPY OLD YEAR!

I know from talking with a number of young people that there is so much power—and empowerment—in seeing the ""before"" as well as the luminous ""after"" pics. To see after without before doesn't give the context of how far one has come.

Confronted a coworker yesterday [Joy Trigger Warning 🥰]	"We have a couple burly black guys who do security and hang out near the front of our building, which means you see them basically every day routinely. Well one of them always says something like ""Hey bro,"" or ""Whats up dude"" and i just kind of say hi quietly  or nod my head because I've been too intimidated to say anything about it really. 

But yesterday after work I found the courage to ask him to stop calling me bro. And omg this guy who is always so monotone and to the point (like never really had a conversation with them) just completely was like ""oh shit I am *so* sorry Saige (didn't even know he knew my name). I swear I didn't mean it like that, I just kind of call everyone that."" I told him its okay and its not that big of a deal (which was a lie and I was low key fighting back tears of happiness by how much he seemed sorry) and he was like ""no it is and im going to do better."" 

The funniest part was he also said something like im also black, we call everyone brother 😅 which to be fair is part of why I hadn't called him out. But its hard to tell someone's intention when its all they say to you everyday haha. But yeah, thought I'd share a happy experience for everyone on this nice Sunday morning 😊"	"There ain't no euphoria like when you had to have an awkward conversation and everybody was way more supporting than you expected.
this is the sweetest thing!!

I got called Sir for the first time on Friday!!	"A little background info, I'm pre-everything, 17 years old, but can pass relatively well when binding and when I don't talk. I went to a McDonalds drive through with a friend; no binder, just a biiiig hoodie, wore a baseball hat for the first time and I'm pretty sure my mask was on so in all honesty, the guy at the window couldn't really ""tell"" per say.... BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER BEEN CALLED SIR AND I WAS SO TAKEN ABACK- Like often times people assume I'm a woman due to my voice or they just won't use gendered terms. But there was ZERO hesitation when he said ""alright sir that will be 15 something for today."" I turned to my friend and just started BEAMING.

Intentional misgendering
[removed]
biology is so much more diverse than just male and female. intersex people exist as well. It's not all XX and XY. Science is not based on opinion, its logic and facts as well as theory. Your idea of ""basic biology"" proves your biology teacher didn't do their job very well. Respect is welcome here, questions are welcome here, comments like yours are not.
Are you an idiot?
Now what if - this a wild theory but hear me out - the whole point of this subreddit was for people to express themselves as a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth? And if you seriously have to ask why it would be frowned upon, then maybe you just dont have a high enough iq to understand the concept of transgender.
i love it when people label gender as basic biology, despite the fact that it's straight up not biology at all its a socio-psych concept

In Defense of UWU culture, or How I learned to stop worrying and embraced the NYA	" 

(trigger warning, for serious discussion of transphobia and transphobic language as well as some language) 

I have noticed on many trans online spaces, some serious scoldy criticism against anime style catgirl/uwu culture that many internet transfemmes treasure and post regularly. I understand the criticisms are obvious and intuitive to many, that a lot of anime culture is problematic and overly sexualised in an often creepy way. However, something within the spirit of uwu, yet lights the hearts of countless trans with a feeling like hope. A feeling not explained in words, and I wish to do my best to serve the catgirl nation, to find those words, to defend the subculture that has proven such a balm to my jaded broken heart. 

I want to start my argument with historical western culture. I want to start with an anecdote referencing trans youtuber May’s amazing video essay on the western 80’s slasher, Sleepaway Camp. The TLDR version, is that it is a profoundly transphobic film, where the final line at the end of the movie, is the “horrific” reveal that the female presenting slasher, has male genitalia, shouting “SHEs a DUDE!” even within the safe context of a trans video essay, this scene was painful to watch. 

The interesting take on this movie, is not pointing out all the many, many ways this movie is offensive, but in the strange way that May, and I as her audience, took strange inspiration from the movie. May projects an interpretation where a kind, innocent and really cute trans girl gets epic violent revenge on “victims” who for the most part, are really abusive and mean to her. It is likely a symptom of how microscopic popular trans representation is, and how DESPERATE us trans are, to find something inspiring in any image that vaguely reminds us of ourselves. Even if the movie is made to be awful to us, May is so jaded, she just wants to find some joy in a cute looking trans character getting revenge on assholes. I relate to that level of cynicism and emotional exhaustion.

Of course, popular western culture has progressed since the 80’s, the president can say “trans rights” and a good looking enough tran can give those particular kind of “inspiring” speeches that suburban white people in auditoriums like. It appears like we might be getting a lick, a slight hint at possible full social acceptance, and with that, comes the temptation to try to fit in with popular society. But, and this is a big but, where is the “positive” trans representation in western culture right now? What TV character embodies someone that a young transfemme today, feels is inspiring and relatable, or dare I even suggest, sexy or cool? 

This is my own anecdotal experience, but the last trans representation I saw in western TV was a chick who got murdered on a cop show, and some family drama where an ugly tran was kind of a bitch (not in a cool way) and caused problems for the main cast. Oh yea, and during Halloween I saw Leprechaun in the Hood where a trans character was brutally murdered as well for laughs. Then there are characters like Nia Nal in supergirl, who are explicit pander characters who make me cringe in a way deeper and grosser than anime ever has. Such characters are examples of pure astroturfing. (for the young uns, astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.) 

Which finally brings me to the main subject of this little manifesto. Anime. anime has a lot of trans representation (compared to the popular west.) Whether its the adventurer girl in “that time I got turned into a spider” or Tanya in “The story of Tanya the Evil” or that noble knight in “Magical Girl Raising Project.” They are written naturally into the stories not to make a political statement, but because the authors, many of which are cis male, felt that such characters served the story they wanted to tell. Sometimes those representations are problematic, often they are overly sexualised. But there IS representation, lots of it, evil characters, good characters, tragic and comedic, from “Stop!! Hibari Kun!” to serious discussion of self harm and suicide in “JJ Macfield and the Ilsand of Memories” (which is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned.) 

In Anime, trans poeple are not just “valid”, or “inspiring” but are as full people as the rest of the cast, and you can find them as heroes villains and everything in  between, you can find them modest or as total uwu sex fiends. As a young tran, you can choose from an actual diverse menu of characters to relate to, something not easily said elsewhere. Hell, here in the west contemporary trans are motivated to stan for the fucking sleepaway camp slasher because representation is literally that scarce and shitty. 

Which takes me back to Sleepaway camp. A lot of people in popular culture, especially outside the circles of well to do proggressive types, cringe at the existence of trans people, even today. Many cis poeple find us disgusting, strange, dangerous, the subjects of horror movies. I want to draw a connection, between the way many of those same bigots turn their noses with disgust and contempt towards overly sexualised anime women, is literally the same reaction they give to depictions of ANY kind of trans women. Because they see trans women as devient sex objects. Please consider how a trans femme might see Felix Argyle, or that anime about the tran who lives in boy mode, but puts on a skirt and makeup when they activate their magic “save the world” smartphone app (and looks cute doing it.) Consider how much their projection is amplified 10 fold when their bullies and political enemies cringe the same way at their fictional heroes as they do against them personally.

Consider the art style itself, how the abstraction and lack of detail in anime faces obscures many of the details that trans feel super inescure about, and that when a tran appears in anime, even problematic representations, like the waitress from Persona or whatever, *they get to look hot*, they get to be attractive and normal looking compared to other girls in anime. Think about how much we trans WANT that. We dont just want to be accepted, but most of us, dont want to rock the stubble and adams apple forever, we want to be conventionally attractive, those anime boobs are #transition goals, and that is both true, deeply emotionally intimate, and not a socially acceptable thing that your #trans ally joe biden can say out loud. 

Which brings me back to western culture, and the nature of our progressive “allies.” Yes, we have allies, and trans rights have improved, but for popular hegemonic society, I think any well lived tran understands how *conditional* that societal acceptance is. The proggressive caucus will accept certain kinds of de-sexualised, de-radicalised politically narrow representation of trans in a way that does not challenge capitalism,gender, or even our place in the society they are willing to give us some seat at the table for. Even then, acceptance and integration in such a culture often means implicitly selling out many of our sisters who are poor, indiginous, neurodivergent, or politically extreme. Popular progressive culture is a place we can survive, as long as we know our place, but it is not a place where we can feel safe.

For so many trans who spend all day, living in the most “presentable” way possible, trying their best to not get fired, or evicted, or be the subject of a cringe youtube clip used as a pretext by bigots to say horrible things to us (AKA Gamestop tran freakout.) So many of us want to a space to stop living in fear, to express our hidden emotions, our hidden desires, the things we feel and think that your mom wouldn't feel comfortable liking on a facebook post. 

Anime culture is a place for social outcasts. For better and for worse, all sorts of people who don't fit in, whether its neo nazis on 4 chan, and yes, young trans femmes, find something relatable in the depiction of an artistic culture that glorifies being an outsider. I think thats important, I think its essential that we have that kind of outsider culture amongst ourselves, at least within the internet for christs sake. 

A tran well versed in our history, must understand the role that Camp has played in queer culture. For those less well read, the camp movement is the ongoing artistic trend in dressing in intentionally gaudy and off putting old looking clothing and over the top makeup in order to challenge society and draw attention to standing out as an individual opposed to what normally looks “good” and “fashionable.” Most of what is recognizable in modern drag culture is derivative of Camp. The point is, that in the darkest most transphobic days of our history, Trans found each other, and inspiration and hope and solidarity in artistic movement of intentionally standing out and causing the normies to cringe. There is a reason that many of us find something inspiring in the famous Babs Johnson clip, “Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat Shit!!!Filth is my politics! Filth is my life! !”

There is something noble in giving a finger to the society which has scorned us to make a point about their hypocrisy. That is important, sacred, meaningful. To me it means, “I will not live or judge myself by your rules fuckers” That kind of subversive inclusivity needs to be a part of our sub culture, or a bunch of atomsied trans are going to spend a lot of time living in terror of never being accepted outside of successfully “passing” not even just as a cis female, but as a socially normative kind of tran. 

Therefore, the fact that uwu culture makes many respectable types cringe, is an essential feature of why it is popular. If we were to as a community, replace it, it must be with a cultural language equally or even more offensive to the same sort of people. We must not become whitewashed. Because lets be absolutely clear that this is the de facto effect of appeals to cut down on the catgirl shit. The racial politics behind such appeals. In lieu of eastern anime style art as a uniter, the popular trans culture will not become inundated with diverse art styles and references to artistics movements from africa or south America. The anime replacement art will be overwhelmingly western, and overwhelmingly white. They may often depict dark skinned characters, but they will overwhelmingly be the proggressive western white persons idea of what a POC trans “should” look like, there will be less sexual creepiness, but there will be a lot less diversity of any kind at all. We all all become fucking Nia from supergirl, who writes Joe Biden speeches and thinks the CIA is cool. That's what such a conversion would ask of us to become. Who relates to that? The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything  but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less “used” by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria. 

Which brings us finally, to the horny shit. To the deeply problematic way that a lot of anime tends to sexualize a certain kind of innocence that comes across as offesnively pedophillic or just plain infantilising to women in general. This accusation cannot be in wholesale denied, after all, Anime is an entire genre of art with  diverse depictions, many of which are just plain indefensibly awful and bad. But it would be a bad faith claim, to say that even the specific parts of anime culture that trans culture has idealised, like Astolfo or Felix Argyle, do not exemplify a certain kind of veneration of cutesy innocence.

Yet, I still would ask this of many western critics. “What is wrong in YOUR culture, where innocense and being cute, is tied so closely and exclusively to concepts of pedophilia or children. Why do western women have to put so much effort into masculinizing themselves and de sexualising themselves to be taken seriously as adults in male dominated fields?” As Natalie Wynn puts it, why do so many college girls take weird pride in dressing modestly, yet still going for a “sexy in a stacy kind of way?” What parts of yourself has your patriarchal culture asked you to suppress to be taken seriously? 

Do we not all want to be cute sometimes? To feel innocent sometimes? To feel sexy sometimes too, to go back and forth, to be both at once? Are not those part of the feminine experience and mood? Yes, I can be serious, and grim, and professional, and androgynous, but must I be such things all of the time? Cant I be a slut if I want? Cant I also be a church girl sometimes without being catcalled or judged? Cant I just be a complete fucking person who feels the full spectrum of human emotions in different contexts times and places? Are you not asking us to lobotomise half our souls, to cut off half the sky of our experience? Cant trans women just at least, suffer and embarass ourselves riding the razor edge of the madona/whore social complex half of cis women have to balance between? Cant the artistic representation of that have cat ears? A creature whose name has become culturally synonymous in the west with female anatomy? Why must trans women always be serious, mature and sexless? I am jaded, I am cynical, I am always presenting in the kind of business casual attire and attitude requested from post grad students. Cant I just give a soft uwu on the internet in a mournful hopeful contemplation of the lost girlhood I never got to experience? Why do I need to keep up the fucking business casual mindset even on the godamm internet? 

Im weird. A neurodivergent communist queer, I dont fit in to most places, but I like fitting in with the culture of people who say uwu to celebrate that they dont fit in the same way. I think its cool anime has some many non gender comforming characters, I like that the characters are cute, I want to look like that kind of, not just a little bit because comparing myself to real life cis women hurts in a way that it doesnt to compare myself to the abstracted drawings.

I think its heroic how the internet catgirls know they cause people to cringe, but are fearless in being seen and heard anywhere, I think its heroic they way they challenge social expectation, I think its heroic that they dare to express their desires to be cute, I think its heroic the way they provide a light beacon for other people who fit in, not even just trans, but other queers and non queer good hearted weirdos as well. I admire the catgirls, at their cringiest, at their most pathetic 100 times more than I can ever admire fucking Nia from Supergirl. And to really draw the ultimatum, those really are the only two options, the only two options with the cultural clout to compete for trans subculture hegemony for whatever that's worth. So I ask all you trans, especially the femmes, to look in your hearts and ask what your feelings are inspired by, what you want and what you want to be. Communist catgirl who makes people uncomfortable, or neoliberal sockpuppet who can speak in public, but can't be seen kissing anyone on TV. 

This is my final point, my takeaways from my lengthy pro catgirl manifesto about television, anime politics and gender. Coming out was hard, I was so ashamed of coming out and being seen as an “ugly girl.” Finding the catgirl shit online, was the moment I realised, “fuck, im not the only one, Im not alone.” I ask you this, without the catgirl shit, in our current culture and moment in 2021, what could you show that sad tran in boy mode to inspire her to be brave enough to be cringe? Not enough to “uwu” un public, but to transition to their friends and family, to show her that causing other people to be uncomfortable with you isn't the end of the world? To show her that being weird and wanting to be cute yet sexy is okay? If we were to vote Tabby the catgirl off our island, who would take her place? Uwu."	"You wrote a whole uwu essay, uwu

Seriously, I'm saving this. This essay is beautiful and absolutely on point. We should be *proud* of living free from the standards of a society which ostracized and painted us as *The Other****^(TM)*** us for so long. You want to see other? We'll give you other alright.

Ty for this gem, comrade. Do I have your permission to share this? If I copy paste it, do I credit you as your user or do you have a preferred name? 

Keep spinning. Uwu.
Honestly, as a neuro divergent technically bi, MtF politically unaffiliated, liberal progressive humanist that's obsessed with cuteness and loves cat girls, fox girls, and those cringy bits in anime that makes those people mad, I fully agree with this post, even though some of it did go over my head, I get the gist of it. Honestly uwu and nya culture is adorable and memetacular XD. There's a lot of people who identify with these characters and some even put on similar personas, and in some cases, fursonas. Honestly anime was my doorway into self discovery since my mom was one of the most over protective and controlling people I knew at the time. I didn't even know LGBTQ was a thing before I turned 14 and thought anime was cartoons like Danny phantom. I was such a lame ignorant normie back then doing my best to blend in cause I didn't know what was wrong with me or how best to describe it. Had LGBTQ people had more and better representation in western media I'd have learned what that feeling was far sooner. I had asked my friend if he ever wanted to be a girl and he looked at me taken aback with a surprised what? And I looked away nervous and said nvm it was nothing and left it well alone. I was 10 at the time and still had no clue what it was or why I felt the way I did. And anime helped guide me towards my answers indirectly, took me looking up some crossdressing anime characters and finding theories as to why they are the way they are, as well as anime like kamfer to find myself and discover what transgender was. Though it's a shame it took so long for me to figure things out. Then what lead me to learn about lesbians was Yuri anime and my god is that one of my favorites. Which honestly lead me to at first think I was a trans lesbian.  But I couldn't shake something for a while and I didn't really know how else to explain it. I wasn't attracted to men in any way shape or form, yet I found myself attracted to characters like astolfo, asuramaru, and Felix. Characters whom as you so bluntly stated was basically chicks with dicks.  I honestly have no idea how to describe it without it sounding like a fetish because I'm still very ignorant. 
I don't even know how to make sense of it. It wasn't until I learned of the identity Gynosexual/gynoromantic and another version which is similar that I recently learned of, neptunic. Both of which from my simple understanding are simply an attraction to femininity in general. Which I think more or less fits me. Though is that valid? I have no idea. Honestly to me it just kinda feels like bi with extra steps. Am I just lesbian? Or bi with a strong feminine preference? My journey started thanks to anime, helping me as a guide, and I've been figuring stuff out since then.
Damn... Just got linked here from another post, but... Damn... I want so bad to valiantly embrace my cringiest but most comfortable side of myself as you say here... Just for the sake of feel the most true to myself, even at expenses of other people's opinion... 

I need this, not only written, but put in practice by me...

Fucking 🔥🔥🔥
I didn’t know anyone ever thought of cat girl stuff or “uwu” speak that highly. I just thought it was some crap creepy people use. Or what extremely childish people use.
Just wanna say I’m another person that got linked to this several months later and my god thank you for putting this into words so goddamn well, I may not feel exactly the same but this makes me feel extremely seen

Also tho I wanted to share that almost immediately after reading this I scrolled down and saw this post (but crossposted to r/gaysoundsshitposts): https://reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/tzp0sl/anime_irl/

And it immediately made me think back to your essay and like, does this comic feel extremely offensive problematic and out of touch? Yes absolutely, but does the person in it also look incredibly cute and absolutely rock that maid dress and make me wish I looked like that? Also yes absolutely
in the words of max0r, i may be cringe, but that makes me free
I'm not transfem, but live some of the boyness I've never had through strong, cute, honest shonen anime (and video game) characters. And I'm crying as I read this.
UwU is a need on this hostile world. Especially for non-normative folks like us neurodivergent, racialized trans and enbies.
i literally do not have the ability to read all of this

i am so fuxkibgw aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
>astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.

Small point to the overall essay, but this doesn't seem like a very good definition of astroturfing. It's kind of the opposite actually. The point of astroturfing is to make it seem like it's coming from the general public. Astroturfing would be if the subversive movement, coming from the government or marketing itself, pretended that their position was public consensus in the first place. Co-opting a subversive movement, by definition, would be counterproductive because that would mean it's not public consensus. Similarly, if a point of view is being pushed by a show it is by definition not astroturfing because it isn't trying to appear like it's coming from the general public.
i feel so seen i am glad that i am not the only one who wants to be an adorable cat girl >w<. i'm going to keep uwuing and blushing because i love being cute so much >\\\\<
Same here, the way it is all said, puts perfectly into words a lot of thoughts I could never describe
Thank you kindly
Yes please do as you please. I don’t really care about credit but my username is fine.
Thank you. I applaud your bravery and confidence
cat girl supremacy :3
Bingo. I agree, very insensitive. But I also agree that the heart of the comic, the soul of the thing is promoting and idea of acceptance of gender non conformity.
I may be cringe, but that makes me free.

I need help from strangers: my husband is transitioning	"I’ve known my husband since we were 14. We dated when we were 17-18 and parted ways amicably as life led us apart. Years later about 28 years old we started dating, and becoming a family with my daughter. We found out we were pregnant in 2019 and quickly got married. I have never doubted that he is my human and I am his. Together we have grown into a family of four with a two year old son and a now 10 year old daughter. 

My husband and I have been very open about our sexuality and supported one another. He is my own true love, other half, made for each other. As I discovered I was more pansexual and non binary he was uncovering repressed memories of wanting to be a woman. We did a few make overs and the pure joy he has felt was indescribable  to watch. It was purely beautiful. 

But the reality is hitting of what this means for our future. My visions are changing from husband to wife. I feel I am losing him as he becomes her. Wrecked by imagine dragons is a good description of how I’m falling apart inside. My best friend has stepped up to be our rock and I would be absolutely lost if not for her. 

I am scared. I am absolutely terrified of life ahead. I want to be her rock. But I am falling apart at the seams. If anyone has advice or resources I would be overwhelmingly grateful. Someone to tell me it’s going to be ok.

Please help me."	"Whatever happens, it is going to be okay. Your wife isn't changing at her core. She is just shedding a persona that was forced upon her, and allowing her true self to shine through.

It is okay to experience all manner of emotions as you both go through this. If you feel like you are really struggling with it all, I highly recommend that you talk to a therapist, preferably one with experience in transitions. Having a neutral third party to talk to may be really helpful.

edit: also there are some support groups specifically for your situation, such as /r/mypartneristrans/
It's going to be ok.

Your wife is the same person on the inside, and the packaging on the outside doesn't change that.

I (FTM) transitioned in my 20s after being with my husband for many years and there were some bumps in the road, but 3 years into my transition our relationship is fine and actually better than ever.
Reneereyes.com she has a a section on her web page you may find helpful. 

Please remember this you are not losing the person you are so solidly proclaiming to be your other half.
I don’t have any real advice, but I did want to say that it’s just as hard for your wife as it is for you. Their vision of the future is also changing, and they may go through moments of depersonalization (i.e. feeling like she’s losing herself). 

It’s tough, but I hope y’all get through it and love each other very much after the rough patches :)
Thank you beautiful strangers. This pulled me out of a mental spiral. I love her so much. We’ll keep fighting forward together
She's herself, that's what matters. You might notice a slight personality change, simply because she can express the parts of herself had to hide for so long, she might be more stressed out, but overall the main change will be how much happier she is. When I came out, and started transitioning, my parents freaked out, because suddenly I talked so much more, and didn't hide in my room constantly. They thought this was bad for some reason, and still resent me for it. But I'm happy, that's what matters.
Might help to break down what you feel you are losing and explore the validity of those feelings.  Is it physical appearance? A gender role? Masculinity?  Maybe those things matter, maybe they don’t.
Firstly, unless she has told you she's okay with you referring to her in this way, I'd recommend not calling her your ""husband"" or ""he"", even if she's not around to see/hear you say it. Its important for you to at some point have a conversation with her about how she wants you to refer to her past self. I personally call my past self by my deadname and he/him pronouns, but a lot of people aren't comfortable with that. 
I just really needed to say that first since it didn't seem like many other people had mentioned that. 

I went through something very similar with my fiancee, although we hadn't been together nearly as long as you two have when I came out. It was really hard on her because she also felt like the ""man"" she loved was slipping away, and in a certain sense it's true. I am not the same person I was back then, at my core I am very similar, but not the same. 

Something that really helped her accept what was going on and deal with the grief of losing her ""boyfriend"" was to hold a funeral. It's a chance to say one last goodbye to your ""husband"" and a first hello to your wife. 

This is a scary and uncertain time for you both, and it's okay to be worry, to cry, and to grieve, but if you let it, it can also be an amazing time. For my fiancee and I, it felt almost like getting to know each other for the very first time again, but without the awkward small talk. We had a passion and excitement in our relationship even greater than when we actually first met. It's clear that you and your wife love each other very much, and have been through a lot together. I have no doubt then once you're both ready, you will fall madly in love with her all over again.
Talk as much as you can and tell your partner about what you are scared about and not comfortable with, because it will come out at some point and doesn't need to be something really bad.
Set some boundaries for now and see where they go and if things need to move later.
You and your partner don't yet know what type of woman she will be, so try to stay away from predicting the future right now.
It's also completely okay not to be comfortable with stuff or even feel the same way.  Keep talking
It sounds to me like you are mourning your husband. And that's okay to feel. Just take it in and take your time. It's fine to cry and to feel a loss. It's perfectly normal and I think many many of us have gone through this. Yet at the same time remember that there's this other person emerging. Something is lost, yet so much is earned. And you need to be open and flexible and you will go through a lot. But if you feel this is worthed...just hang in there. The end of this trip might just be wonderful ☺
With the love you have so dearly nurtured and cultivated, I suspect you and she, with no small amount of effort, mind you, will find your way forward. The only way out is through and the people you will be on the other side have a solid chance of being nothing short of beautiful. 

You are each blessed by the other to have each other and I hope nothing but the best for you.
Kudos for supporting your partner in this. Transitioning can create a wild mix of emotions for everyone involved. My wife was incredibly supportive and we still had some struggles to work out. 

I'm not sure how universal it is but I was in a very rough state mentally for the first few years of my transition. It was especially hard on her to see me on bad dysphoria days and be unable to do anything about it.

It was definitely a rough road at times, but things have improved so much now.
If anything she's becoming even more of the person youve fallen in love with. There's nothing to be afraid of as long as you two love and support each other.

Another resource you can look into is your local PFLAG chapter. PFLAG.org
So as someone who is new to the game and still has yet to fully transition, but only occasionally gets to be herself, you're doing great! The fact that you want to support her and you can see how happy she is is tremendous. Mistakes are going to be made, some hilarious, some awkward, some maybe hurtful in the moment but forgiven if made innocently. Shit's gonna be a little topsy turvey for a while, they're opening all new doors in their life that were barred to them, and you're going to discover a whole new side to the person you love that even they didn't know. This can be a blessing, as it'll be discovered together. Expect lots of questions. Also expect total ignorance and mistakes from her too.

Styles are going to be picked up and discarded, lots of terrible make-up will be applied, and she's going to have some really confusing times with spaghetti straps. This is the same person you've always loved, the same character you've always kept in the party throughout your game. Just a reskin. Underneath is all identical, except they may be a bit more colorful than you remember. Definitely much happier. Patience is going to be a necessity for you both, but if you're already wanting her to be happy it's a solid start. No need to mourn the loss of a husband, this is the birth of the true expression of your soulmate's identity. And you'll be lucky enough to see that happen not once, but twice.

Also, if you enjoy shopping, you're going to find your partner a much more involved and honest participant! It's done wonders for my best friend and I hahaha.
it’s the misgendering for me.
Lots of other people have said that your spouse is the same person. This piece of art is one that circulates often in trans circles, it has brought some understanding to both trans people and their partners before - [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/l5jwun/because_you_loved_my_previous_post_3_cammielgbtart/)

(and for people other than OP, the artist has created FtM & NB versions too)
A great book that helped my wife when I first started transition is Love Lives Here by Amanda Knox. Wonderful book that talks about transition (both for her wife and their daughter) and the effect of those life events on marriage and family.
I was 3 years into my relationship when I transitioned (FTM), pretty much the same situation as my partner was experimenting with his pansexuality, and we've been together 6 years now. And it was obviously more daunting to be in a long term gay relationship with a visibly trans person than being in a straight passing relationship and we had to talk through those feelings together and as long as you always keep those lines of communication open you'll be okay.

If I can give you any advice she would probably love to be validated as your wife and to have your relationship validated as lesbian/sapphic/queer. Ask her what pronouns she wants you to use. ask if There are certain social circles she'll be comfortable coming out in right away and some where she wants to wait a bit and code switch accordingly. If she wants to be completely out or stay closeted until she's more secure support that too. Be sure to correct others when they misgender or deadname her because it can be hard to speak up for yourself

You might find that your relationship is more harshly scrutinized by loved ones and if you complain about unrelated relationship struggles that all couples have you might find people blaming it on her being trans so don't let that get to you because you know your relationship better than that.

And you might notice when you lose your straight passing privilege and it might come as a shock but just be mindful of your own and your wife's safety. You might notice small micro aggressions like noticing people refer to your wife as your ""friend"" and its okay to correct them and its okay not to correct them.
Your wife loves you, just be there for her. Help her through this journey. This journey will be very hard on your wife, just stick by her side and help her along. Once she is herself and happier, she will not forget how her partnee was there for her all along. She will love you more, you will love each other more. I know things like this are tough, but if you just try your best to be strong, when its over.. You two will be the strongest couple out there.
i’ve read some of your comments and they’ve convinced me that you’re more than capable of going through this. you love your wife so much and while this might be scary, it’s going to help her grow so so much happier as a person. and you’ll notice the difference and then it’s gonna hit you - it’ll get easier, believe me. i wish you both the best!
You feel in love with the inside, not the shell. You love the person. Let him become her and give her all the loves 💕
She’s going to need that love that you have for her. She’s going to be going through a lot, and having your love and support is going to help her during the good times and the bad, just as I’m sure you both vowed to be there for. Talk with her, reassure her, be there for her. You got this OP. I wish you and your family nothing but the best for the journey ahead. ❤️
Why are you falling apart?  What do you feel like you're losing?
If you could fall in love with her over only her being slightly of who she is, you will be amazed at when she can be herself fully and if you fell in love with the beta, imagine the full package
My wife has watched as I have gone thru the starting phases of a transition. 
She has really struggled too 
She has also had female friends of hers to sound off to. And a female friend here locally for close support. 
We are much older and no children at home. 
I am sure you each could offer support to one another.
I know it's normally the person who is transitioning that we tell that they should look at therapy. 
But it's also a great idea for when those of us transitioning who are married with kids to look at family therapy as well. It helps get all the issues out in front to be worked on instead of repressed
I am sorry that you are having such difficulty with your situation. Please don’t bash me for MY OPINION OR CHOICES I’VE MADE. We are all different and view things differently. 

Here’s my story: I get home from a trip and discover a pair of pantyhose-not mine. I ask and am told “I like to wear women’s clothes”. Cross-dressing was the beginning. Bring in the therapist whose diagnosis is “you are transgender “. The diagnosis at first threw him/her for a loop. It about killed me. In the last 3 years he/she has embraced it. I also discovered infidelity occurred at some point before I found out about him/her.  
Unfortunately, I can’t handle it at all. For 2 years I was just a shell. Thank goodness for my friends. I have 2 confidants who have been there for me when I couldn’t be there for myself! I finally have really started to find myself again and have made some decisions. I have filed for divorce, am looking for a home and am ready to move on. I have also come to realize that this is not all about me (as I thought for 2 years). It has to be difficult for him/her - feeling the need to change, no support from me, wondering what life will bring along with some big family issues that need to be dealt with. 
We are older (late 60’s), have been together for 30 years, married for almost 28. I am very religious and that is a big influence in my life. I didn’t make my choices lightly - I cried a lot, prayed a lot and cried some more. I’m ready just to move on, let him/her do the same and hope for the best for both of us!
Support them, even if they don't get you going in bed, my father always tells me the story behind his transphobia to try to change my mind and it's something like his co-worker was trans mtf and her wife divorced her, and her children didn't know to call her mom and dad, and she's ashamed because her whole family disowned her.

Even if you can't support what they're doing, support them for who they are.
You are going through a bereavement, because  somehow you are loosing your husband and it's normal.
Hopefully you are pansexual and there's hope of a new beginning with your soul mate as a wife.
It's going to be right with plenitud at the end.
I've told my story often in the last few months so forgive me if you've read it already.

I met the love if my life in 1987 and confessed to her my desire to be a woman.  We continued to date and with some agreed on compromises married 10 months later. Those compromises continued to get smaller and smaller as time moved on and disappeared altogether when our children were born. Soon after that my depression flared and for 12 years my wife and kids would always ask me why I was mad. It wasn't that I was abusive or vocal about anything it was just the opposite. I would shutdown for weeks at a time and just do the bare minimum. Finally I had a crisis and had to play off what I knew to be the truth to psychiatrist so that my wife wouldn't find out the truth. Without the compromises I was internalizing so much turmoil that I had to escape. I managed to pull my crap together for a brief period before the SSRI's started complicating things. 

There's volumes of stories I can tell you

That love of my life passed away from cancer 9 months ago. 33 years of marriage that took lot of hard work to keep together with several rough patches. I did for her what she couldn't do for me. I gave up everything to be with her. 

Now at 58 I'm starting my transition and I haven't been happier at any point in my life.


If you truly love this person then you have to be willing to evolve with her as she discovers who she is or be honest with yourself now and don't put each other through a lifetime of regrets.
You can try the subreddit r/mypartneristrans. You may find it helpful to discuss your experiences with people who have been through a similar situation.
First of all, I think it's really great that you're so supportive and helping her on this way now.

There's gonna be tough times ahead for both of you. Hormones will take their toll on both of you, so make sure you attend a therapy together to learn to cope with that. 

There's a lot of things your wife has missed out on that most people do in their teenage years. She might at one point want to catch on that.

Not everyone will react kindly. It will affect all of you, including your children. Be prepared and get all the help you need in time.

Wherever the path will lead you all, as long as you communicate and are honest with each other, y'all gonna be fine, no matter the outcome.
Change, especially a huge change like this is always a scary thing, but I'm sure you'll adapt to it. You're not losing your husband as she becomes your wife, she is the same person she's always been, although her body may be changing to reflect how she feels inside. 
I promise it'll be okay. It's probably terrifying for both of you at first, but once you get used to this change you'll be happy again. :) 
I wish you both the best of luck you seem like a lovely couple ❤️
I wanted to post an update. This all unraveled so quickly and I feel (with all of your insight) that I’m finding my bearings. 

I think it’s important that I move back and follow their lead. Whether pronouns are changing or clothing or makeup or wigs or hormones or surgery or whatever this path is going to take, I have to work on giving up that control and following and supporting. I will continue to work on this. 

The initial shock was the hardest. It went from one night of dressing up as a woman, and the very next night we were putting on makeup and a wig and it was REAL. She was REAL in front of me and in front of her. (Apologies on pronoun changing they have not decided yet and I feel all over the place. I do not mean to trigger or offend)

When I say shock, I don’t mean it negatively. It was a foundation shift. It was a dynamic shift. Going from husband and wife to wife and wife upended my need to plan and control because of my own anxiety disorder. But as I’m processing, learning and reading and listening with you all. 

My ring on my finger doesn’t represent man and wife. It represents that as two humans we came together to be one and love each other wholly while we navigate the world and our journeys in life as both individuals and a partnership. It’s a new and beautiful dynamic and at the core we are the same. 

I’m still scared to navigate the worlds reaction, family members, kids, everyone a part of our life is going to have their own experience as we move through this. But that’s ok. We are all entitled to feeling. And the ones who come back to offer love and support - awesome and welcome. Those that don’t feel they can - probably for the best. 

Please keep responding, I am reading every post and taking it to heart as fully as I can. I cannot say THANK YOU all enough ❤️❤️❤️
When someone becomes trans, most of the time they aren't changing their personality more of their identity as a person
Hey I’ve followed this story and I have to say I feel exceptionally moved by your efforts to gain insight.  Apologies if this is a little disorganised, it’s extremely late here or early, take your pick!

When I came out to my first wife almost two decades ago… I felt like I had been suppressing my darkest secret for my whole life… I was around 30 ish… 7-8 years into marriage, with young daughters and finally I felt stable enough to share with my most trusted friend and love , the real me.  Because of the society that I grew up in, I knew completely that being trans was not going to be accepted by many and because of that I had very carefully lived with it as part of my hidden identity since I could remember… I knew when I was about 4 or 5… I stepped into my mum’s heels and knew I wasn’t  like the boys and would always be a girl in my heart.  Years of secrecy and suppression meant that I really learned to craft my concealment… I was completely expert at hiding the girl in me that had been there all my life.  I finally saw a chink of light a tiny chance to open up, my wife was initially receptive and we dressed and fooled around as girls, then she decided it wasn’t for her….

I was devastated… my life was trashed… I had just once allowed someone to know my secret and tried to share with my absolute best friend, soulmate and the person I had promised to be with, who I genuinely thought I would grow old with.  It broke me , I went fully back into the closet… 7 years of animosity ensued, separate bedrooms, perpetual arguments as I tried desperately to keep it together for the kids but also for me.  I hadn’t changed much at all.  She simply knew something about me that she didn’t before… my sexuality was the same, everything was , apart from I was more open and honest than ever.  Ultimately we fell apart… ten more years alone ensued, me mostly in the closet… like fuck was I telling anyone about me again… I had failed to be a good husband, failed at marriage, failed my children and I very desperately knew I couldn’t be me…I paid a huge financial penalty also… it felt raw and massively unfair, like I was being punished for something I couldn’t help being… something I still can scarcely understand why it’s such a big deal, it just who I am and I’d really tried to rid myself of it…later over the years I came out to a couple of women who got close enough…. Again my worst fears were realised, I was dropped like a stone, I was called a pervert, fetishist… whatever… I hit the bottle, drugs… it didn’t matter, I couldn’t be me… and would have rather died than go on… on few occasions I very nearly did.

I nearly died… unbelievably fucked up and alone… I could talk to nobody …. So I sell destructed… I was drunk maybe 2/3 of a litre of vodka and 1-2 bottles of wine… everyday without fail….

One day, when I hadn’t expected to wake up, I woke up.  I chose life as myself… the alternative was to not be around anymore.

I dated as a woman, all the online apps…. It was creepy and awful… and then someone popped up on tinder… a really cool girl… she knew all about me, I was dating as myself…in fact she only knew me as Katie.  She didn’t give a damn, she encouraged me and made me feel so much more confident and my much less scared of being rejected and alone…. Long story short, we married last weekend ….  I was saved and I wish I had been able to do this earlier…. I was unbelievably scared to… society and relationships had taught me that I can’t be me… but my new wife tells me I can be whoever I want….

You are being wonderful by giving her a chance, offering the support which I didn’t have until I was almost 50!! That’s incredible…. You as being awesome and that is incredibly unusual.  She will be nervous , very scared of the consequences and I know you are apprehensive .

I never changed who I was inside, I understand why you might feel that way but you aren’t losing the person at all… you are going to witness how grateful we trans women are to have someone to love, someone who cares and we can love in return.  She’s going to be scared and insecure, her secret is out and I hope you two can be there for each other in her hour of need….I wish you the best of luck and your wife is going to be so unbelievably grateful having felt incredibly supported by you that’s a great thing!!
Love her. Cherish her. Hold onto her and support her. This isn’t going to be easy. And if she loses you I promise her entire world will fall apart. From personal experience I can guarantee she will digress and not be open to anything. You are the person that she trust and she has placed a lot on you but I promise it’s worth it. She will always love you and look out for you and provide for you regardless of her gender. Just love her and keep her close because she is not someone you want to lose. Please. Don’t give up on her. The journey is not easy but it’s worth it.

Edit: I feel that it needs to be said that I came out to my wife (who a few days later came out as a lesbian) and she has entirely abandoned me. To the point that she feels I came out to ensure that she never leaves. We are separated now. Living under the same roof just different rooms. She is doing her own thing and she has stated that regardless of what happens she wants nothing to do with me. I support her. Regardless of how I feel, because I love her. We have a beautiful little girl together and amazing young man, both of which I know are destined for great things. But because I know that I feel that I want to retreat and repress who I want to become. I have begun exploring my own way, dressing up and buying clothes I like, but a part of me just wants to shut it all away and keep living in this suit until my last days. I felt comfort and now I feel guilt and shame. Just understand that the body changes but the soul and the love doesn’t.

How can you afford hormone therapy and raise two children. Good for you
Everything will be okay, don't worry!
Thank you! I added that one to my list. I see a regular team (therapist/psych) three times a month so this will be the topic of conversation on my next appointment
Thank you. I am so impressed by your journey. Just thank you for responding so fast
And honestly, what's on the outside doesn't realy change all *that* much, either.
Thank you
Oh it’s so much harder. Watching her watch me is the worst. I just want to get it together for her
Aww.. Goodluck, Im sending wishes your way. :)
This is a very good comment, your partner is still the same person you fell in love with and had children with. She may be changing her appearance but shes just going to be happier and things will get better. 

If you feel like things are falling apart or you’re losing her, it’s a good time to assess why you feel that way and recognise that you’re not
This is all an amazing perspective and I appreciate you sharing so openly ❤️
Yes exactly. I find myself oscillating uncontrollably between pain and mourning, then happiness and joy and excitement. I’m a bit of a mess!
Checking it out! Thank you!
You made me and her feel much better ❤️
Just ordered it, thank you! I’m a book worm 🤓
Oh wow that makes my heart full - thank you!
Everyone’s journey is so unique. Life without my human is not even a thought in my mind, but I respect what you went through and had to do for YOU. Both parties are important ❤️
Forever and always. We married as two humans. I didn’t marry lightly (although quickly!) and I know a life without my partner is not a life I ever want to live
Thanks for the update. My wife was also shocked when I came out to her, despite the fact that I was very open about being gender non-conforming for the entire time she knew me. But honestly, my transitioning as has brought us much closer together, and I hope you and your wife can find that same shared experience.
Separation from my human is not an option. There’s no way I can go back to a world without them.
Lol I’m the only one who works due to a work injury but thankfully my career has taken off so whatever she needs we’ll make it happen!
It's true. If anything we are more then before. I know I have become a lot better of a person after transitioning. Not to mention the crushing depression and eternal sadness that I masked is gone .. it's a shitty way to live.
I should also mention I’m a recovering alcoholic with over three years of sobriety under my belt. I’m smoking again to deal with the stress and make sure I don’t turn back to wine. My alcoholism quite literally wanted to kill me and I am very scared that it is going to resurface
Agreed. 

I look like a male identical twin of my old self.
Can confirm. I look like the older sister of my past self.
she is the same person, just better, more complete
The fact that you’re working with her is awesome, though. Don’t beat yourself up. No one can keep it together 100% of the time.
Not misgendering her would be a good start then
I know 🤗
It will get better.
Wonderful! I was hoping I had helped even a little bit.
no problem! i believe in you:)
This is the thing right here. Now I’m not depressed and torturing myself anymore. 

Another thing is that coming out (to anyone, even ourselves sometimes) requires us to be EXTREMELY brave. Typically we come out stronger and more courageous than before…

Just some of my thoughts here, but I’m so much more confident now.
Hey, congrats! I'm also almost four years sober. If you aren't already, you should also try CBD. Cannabis is great and all, but it can also create paranoia and anxiety as well, so I find CBD really helpful to de-stress.
Recovery is so hard. I’ve been there before, and just wanted to say make sure to take time for yourself to process this. A space for you to feel whatever you feel, scream, vent—process this, without alcohol.
This is 4 days fresh - working to know what they want still and getting lost in the details
Yes my partner has horrible nerve pain and back spasms from a bad car accident on the job so we’ve been exploring a variety of cannabis type treatments. Thankful we’re in Oregon and it’s legal with experts to help with it. Completely a game changer for their quality of life and helpful for my anxiety
Same. It helps me relax and feel even, but doesn’t give me the anxiety of THC.
you will mess up and that is okay. i can see that you care a lot about her because you reached out for help. happy you came here, i hope you will find support and comfort. four days is so fresh, your feelings are so fresh and strong- they will calm down eventually and you will not break apart. i promise. I wish you all the best.
r/delta8 ❤ 

Changed my life for real.
That’s very sweet and very much appreciated
Messing up isn’t typing an entire post with the wrong pronouns lol
 I do understand why you think it is hurtful and I agree that it is. I remember being very hurt by getting misgendered by my grandma a lot. it still happens sometimes but she is the only person from my whole family who still loves me for who i am. i appreciate her trying to make the effort. i appreciate everyone trying to make an effort. it does not mean i am not allowed to be hurt by mistakes. both can be true. i just feel no ill intentions from OP that’s why i wrote that.
I apologize for the impact of my misgendering. Please know it was not intentional but you have every right to the way you are feeling. My husband hasn’t decided yet on pronouns, so it’s still a grey area. Once it’s decided I will do my best to stick to it
Fair enough, best wishes to you both🥰"	scljrh	trans	288	0.94	2022-01-25 19:20:11
the joys of ✨️changing your name✨️		"Lmao yes this is fucking annoying.  Not like this is my legal name or anything!
This annoys me to my core! I’ve suffered with my family because of this. It’s been over a decade and they act like it’s too hard to comprehend.
One of the most hurtful things someone can do Is call someone a different name than what they want to be called.
To me it is mind boggling.  I don’t understand what is so fucking difficult.  A name is merely a referential tool.  What is so hard about respecting someone saying “please call me ____”"	vjx7fj	trans	278	0.99	2022-06-24 20:08:10
The pure joy of living correctly and the unconditional love of my children. These are the greatest gifts of all to me. Happy Holidays my friends. Love, Diane. (M2F, age 55)		"Merry Christmas, so glad  that they accept you. I just love seeing your posts, always gives me hope and encouragement.

Is this dysphoria?	"When I was 13 (am 20 now) I once told my mother I'd prefer to be a girl, she said that many men felt like that. I was kind of in shock but didn't get why and felt embarrassed. At the time I was aware that trans people existed. I had watched documentaries but didn't feel like I could really relate, because I didn't have early signs and didn't feel in the wrong body. 

I never opened up about it again. 

Recently because I finished school I have been feeling like utter shit. I kind of always brushed of the thought that I was trans and it was easier when I was busy with school and hobbies. I told myself that even if I was trans there was now way I would pass. Now it's hard to not think of it all day and I feel like joy from the things I like is becoming less and less. 

Looking back I used to have some phases were i feel down but I could get them to go away again. 

Is this dysphoria? Was I just repressing?"	"Yeah, it sounds like dysphoria.  

Also, ""many men"" do not want to be girls. Very few men do, in fact. Ask any of your guy friends if they would want to be a girl. I bet they all immediately tell you they don't.
Probably is. It’s normal to have shitty thought but come back up and then back down. It’s a shitty cycle.
Nobody can give you a definite answer, but it certainly sounds like dysphoria. There are a couple sources you might want to read for perspective from others:

The [Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi)

[Gender Desire vs. Gender Identity](https://medium.com/@kemenatan/gender-desire-vs-gender-identity-a334cb4eeec5) \- This really helped me with the ""didn't feel like the wrong body"" aspect.
I would not be surprised if that's dysphoria. I had lots of times where I'd think similar things. I'd get down on myself then get busy with life and suppress it again. Difference is you're figuring this out at 20 and it took me till 38 to do the same.
Yes, I felt very much the same as a child/teen and it took me a bit longer to accept that aspect of myself, I'd say maybe start by dressing up and see how it feels?
I have early signs(like from 3 yrs old) and wished to be a girl all of my childhood(I wasn't think too much about it, but I was praying to God and believed that he can help me🥲, also this was my birthday wish sometimes). I watched documentaries about trans too, and I wasn't thinking that I am trans too for a long time, I was trying to ignore it.
Heyy! Definitely sounds similair to what i went through. I felt sad for a long time before finally telling my mom that i felt like i might be trans. She took me on a trip somewhere and basically let me do all kinds of more feminine stuff (doing my nails, make-up, clothes, etc.! This really helped me see if what i thought was true, because it made me really happy!

I am 15, almost 16 and i am starting with female hormones in about a month, and i feel like that trip helped me alot in the start, so maybe consider something like that. Best of luck, DMs are open!
I can totally relate. This is definitely dysphoria. If you're anything like me, once you come out you'll feel like a huge weight is lifted (but of course there are other challenges which will arise, but overall I had no idea what I was missing)
I'm used to it now, but I don't really know how I look. I know I present as feminine but I don't feel this way all of the time. I thought everyone was going through this so I never really talked about it with anyone. It's hard for me to comprehend not questioning your gender as opposed to questioning it every single day. I feel strange wearing dresses and forget I have a period often. 

I wish they would educate on trans people and trans feelings bc now that I know, I'm not so confused anymore. I have people who understand me and my state of being. Before I understood I was really different from cis people, I just felt alone. 

Thank you for posting. This is really relatable to me and I appreciate the opportunity to type stuff like this out.
Repression is a helluva drug! That's why I kept going back to it everytime I was on the verge of epiphany. I'm glad you had the big realization years before me and many others of us older gals, because the longer you repress, the stronger the pain becomes.

If it's an accessible option, I'd suggest meeting with a gender specialist right away. Peer support groups are also a highly recommended thing!
I feel like it’s a bit of both tbh 

Since you’ve been busy you’ve been able to put aside thoughts that you were trans off to the side. That build up within you ignoring your trans probably made think about it even more. That affect you enjoying things in life less frequently. And it’s til the point where you force to confront you being trans. :)
I have very conservative parents, when I was a teen I used to tell myself “everyone wants to be a girl” to cope with the dysphoria. When I learned, in-fact, that many cismen do *not* feel this way, kinda woke me up
Thank you. 

Yeah I realised that that is not true. I think she tried to be helpful in an uneducated way. But I think it might have been a big factor in why I might have been repressing.
Off topic and unrelated but Hi Chloe! I’ve seen you commenting things in multiple posts and you just seem so genuine and helpful and loving! I wanna be like you when I grow up. That is all.
Thank you. 

But also fuuuuuuck....
Well thank you, I'll check it out.
I've read the bible now and well, I guess that's me.... 

I have seen some of the signs but just dismissed them before.
I am beginning to think that is what I did. Thank you for the answer.
It's kinda hard because I live with my parents. I dressed up once for something like spirit week and enjoyed it. At the same time it felt a bit bad because I'm tall and broad shouldered, so that the dress didn't really fit.

I guess I'll try properly if I can find a time frame to do it in private.
Even when  realized who I am, I needed around 6 months to just accept it and start transition, I think it's because of my internal transphobia, and because I live in a transphobic country. But today I don't care, every change on hrt is me, I never ever want to lose them.
Well fuck, I did the birthday wish too.... or once when I saw a shooting star. 
Now that I have accepted the possibility I'm starting to see so many things that I used to ignore. It's scary.
That does sound nice
I also feel like I can't really tell what I look like. I often feel like compliments about my looks are out of kindness, eventhough they're maybe not....
Thanks for sharing.
Hey, yeah I've had some moments were I was like, huh I am trans and then just pushed them sooooo far back.... I finally broke though and told a friend leading to this post. I can imagine I might've continued repressing if I had something like school to take my mind of things. 

I don't think I will being going to a specialist in a while, as my dad is a chief psychiatrist in the biggest youth clinic around and I fear they might tell (allthough I guess that's irrational). I don't think I would be able to get it past my parents because of insurance and so on. I also live with them. So I'll have to come out first. 

Anyways thank you for the answer and suggestions, I have a bunch of queer friends who I plan on talking to in the near future.
Was just scrolling back down my notifications. I didn't see your comment at the time, but I think you may have hit the nail on the hat. I'm still dealing with denial. I haven't really progressed much, though. I do feel a lot better in general, probably because I'm busy again, though.
Funny thing is that I have known this for a while, I just... I don't know ignored my own feelings or told myself that this is not what I was actually feeling....
We've all had some sort of experience like that. When I was 15, a friend told me that guys don't want to be girls. But girls often want to be guys. That's what I believed for the next however many years.
My mom thinks this too. And yeah i already knew it wasnt true when she said it. I think there are alot of people like my mom who just doesent know what being trans means but they still think they know the exact experience.
Hiiii! That's very sweet of you!  

I love helping people, which is why I comment so much. I'm glad it's coming through! 💖💖
Fuck indeed my friend, fuck indeed. 

I’m always avail in PMs if you need to chat.
I was in that same spot for a while. It's easy to not realize what it means when you only have your only lived experience to go by.
Have you seen the gender dysphoria Bible? Might be something that's helpful at this stage.

https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
Do you think they'd be supportive?
Hey! Same here Hun! If you want to try dresses and stuff I highly recommend tanktop dresses! They're fem, and have a bit of spin to them, and it super helps with feeling dysphoria from having dresses and shirts that are tight on my shoulders like that. got some off Amazon, and they were pretty cheap, so as long as your parents dont check your mail it's a nice discreet way to get some good stuff to try! Good luck in your journey no matter what you ultimately choose or how you feel ^ v ^
it scares me too, I’m usually upset about why I didn’t understand before, I have such obvious signals.
Sounds like a plan! 🙌🫂😇
: | that sucks.
Yeah it's annoying, my parents try to be politically correct when talking about trans people but call trans women men who want to live as females.
Thank you, I might take you up on that offer at some point, kinda don't know what to do at the moment.
I read it now and it's pretty accurate to my experience.
It has been recommended in another comment, but I haven't looked yet
Well they have said they wouldn't care about my sexual identity and are friendly to my transmasc friend. 

But at the same time my dad works as a psychiatrist and has recently told me that when dealing with trans youth that didn't show signs in early childhood that it could likely be for attention. Not that I agree but that struck me as awfull and rather rare if not nonexistent.

My mom's family also has an amab person who wanted to live as a woman, but because insurance didn't pay they live as male nowadays. My mom said something along the lines of them possibly being mentally ill because they haven't worked in their lives instead profiting of German state money.... 

I don't think they'd cut me off but I fear they might not take me seriously or scrutinise my every word.
Thanks!
I feel like it's a trans thing when those thought starts to feel normal. Like if any cis man were to think about being a girl they'd be like ""oh wow that was a crazy dream"" kinda thing. Where as us trans people normalize it. We just go about our day figuring that deep down everyone else feels the same thing as us and just don't say it either.
No problem! I’ve been in this situation many of times lol.
Good, I'm glad you're getting things straightened out. I remember the first time I read the GDB I just kept on saying ""Oh! So that was part of the dysphoria too?!?""
It sounds like they're just a little ignorant not necessarily phobic, I think if they saw you were happier as a woman they'd be happier for you. If insurance will cover it I'd say go for transitioning. I'm happy that I finally started at 26 and wish I started a few years ago tbh
I think that describes it. 
It's scary stuff, I've only been admitting this to myself for a few days so far. 
I don't think insurance is the problem, but rather that over here you have to go through a court ruling with two therapists approving to get approved.
I have known this for years as I am very cis.... 

I don't think I'm at that stage yet, I'll first have to be more honest with myself. 

Thanks for the advice, everyone here is making me feel more confident about my feelings.
Of course hun, I wish you luck on your journey

Finding calmness in this time of uncertainty is hard. What are the small joys in your day you appreciate now, but you were not able to recognise before? Also I call this look “Zoom Call Casual”		"First of all your hair is beautiful! Second of all Zoom has become a great joy in my life, because it allows me to attend NA meetings when all the halls around me are closed! FB messenger is also a small joy in my life!
Love your hair. And the blouse. Where did you find it
If nothing else... your hair....goals for me.
You are so beautiful!! How are you doing? ☺️
This photo is remarkably stunning. Absolutely radiant. Cheers!
Very pretty young lady
Some of the positives of these weird times includes seeing my partner more regularly now that we are both working from home. Even if we’re both busy, it’s nice to be close together. I’ve also used this time to clean up the house a bit and improve our living space. I’ve also have been cooking at home more which I really enjoy, but often don’t make time for. 

You’re gorgeous. Hope you’re well!
Second on that top, it's fantastic
Well thank you and you?

I’m good thank you! I just walked my dog before the rain hit. What are you doing? :)"	g9ywla	trans	214	1.0	2020-04-29 00:07:46
Should I leave Drama Club?	"The cast list came out and I'm really pissed. I got cast as ""girl"". The one thing I do not want to be in any way shape or form. I do not look like a girl, at all. I bind daily, I wear makeup to make me look masculine, I've got extremely short hair. And she casted me as ""girl"". This role requires me to give birth on stage... In front of the entire high school, middle school, and every person who sees the show. I want to lay down and cry when I think about it. Its so dehumanizing and dysphoric. I don't know what to do, Ive been in the drama club for Four years, 8 shows, and a literal arts camp deticated for theater and performing. She clearly refuses to cast me as a guy, in fact we had a boy say, ""If I dont get cast as what I'm going for, I don't want in the show"".And the next day my director LITERALLY BEGGED HIM TO COME BACK BECAUSE ""we neeeeed hiiimmm"". 
It doesn't matter if they cant act, or remember lines, they will 100% always be cast. It doesn't matter that I'm good at acting, and easily pass like a boy more than I do as a girl, It doesn't matter how many years I've been in drama club or how many shows I've done. She did this to my friend too. She is a trans girl and every show without fail my director cast her as a guy. It doesn't help that people in our school use this as a defence for their transphobia. 
The part is a large part, even though its just ""girl"" but there isn't a single part of me that is okay with playing it on stage. I dont know what to do, should I just quit this thing that has previously brought me so much joy, and ive deticated so much time and money to?

Edit: Alot of you have been saying to report it to the district or hugher-ups, however this is unrealistic because my school district is very homophobic and doesn't listen when students have issues with anything related to lgbtq+. Also, my friend moved schools at the beginning of the year due to racism and transphobia, she's doing great at her new school.

Update:
I talked to her today, I said I was uncomfortable and she went alright, ""I didn't cast you as girl to make you uncomfortable, I did it because I ran out of people to give hefty roles to. I'll look at it to see what I can do and  I'll get back later."" Today is the first rehersal, and we'll see how it goes.

FINAL UPDATE:
She had me and another switch roles, so I am now the thing I swore to destroy, a fishing country boy."	"I would most likely say to try and get into contact with your districts administrator and see what they can do about it.
Cuz that is a blatant violation of your wishes and if theyre not willing to listen, the higherups are the next best thing to make them listen. If they still insist on their casting for you, id quit.
Cuz in that case, it just shows that the director doesnt care about you and what you two want for yourselves.
Talk to your teacher, if she wont change it, quit and go to the principal because with all of these examples shes clearly being a bigot. She can change or she gets no show. Stand up for yourself, respect yourself. You dont deserve their shit. I 100% promise you. I was switched from womens to mens choir after i fought for it. If you want change and progress you gotta keep chasing it man.
Yeah if your drama teacher insists on misgendering your roles, it's a thing you've discussed and they won't budge, you definitely shouldn't participate if it makes you uncomfortable. It's not like you're turning down a Broadway role or something. And it's not the end of your acting career either. You can likely find a community theater group that will accept you for who you are!
I wouldn’t take the role, but other then that do what works for you. If you’re someone who wants to change things for the better you can try to fight the bigotry, but there is also no shame in leaving drama club and finding an accepting community theatre
Teachers like this are secretly queerphobes and transphobes in particular... they think doing this will somehow groom you into being a woman. 

It's disgusting and I am sorry you have to go through this.
Def don’t take the role! It sounds like it would be terrible for your mental health. The teacher is clearly very transphobic and it’s fucked up that she keeps casting trans folks only as their AGAB as opposed to their actual gender. I would consider talking to the principle or a school counselor but I would also understand if you’d prefer to just quit and find a more supportive community perhaps do some theatre outside of school? So sorry you have to put up with this!
This is one of those situations where, as they say, people don't quit jobs, they quit bad managers. I absolutely think you should tell your drama teacher why you are quitting them. 

It sounds like you've been doing Drama a long time. Go explore some other interests with mentors who actually respect you.
As an actor myself, I think this is really important to point out:

You, as an actor, do not ever need to put yourself in ANY position onstage on which you don't feel explicitly comfortable. That is stage consent 101, and any theatre instructor worth their socks should know that.

Go to your teacher and tell her you are simply not comfortable playing that role (you can include as much or as little about your gender and the specifics of the role as you like, but ""I am not comfortable"" is a full sentence.) If she is not willing to find another role for you, I highly recommend against putting yourself in a position where you will be facing both ignorance and disphoria on the daily. If that means not doing this show, that really really sucks and my heart goes out to you, but I promise you one show is not worth that turmoil. If that's really not okay with you, then I agree with the other commenters about getting higher-ups in the school involved, because this is bordering on blatant discrimination.

But also, if you find you are not comfortable working with this directpr going forward, maybe there are other theatre groups in your community outside of school that might be a little more open minded?

Best of luck dude, I hope it works out for you
I really think you should refuse to participate with a part like that. That’s clear and active transphobia and it sounds like it would really hurt you.
Fuck that man, that's messed up. It sounds like that teacher and club are just toxic, and I'm certain you can find better spaces for your acting skills! Personally, I had too much anxiety to get into drama in high school, but found a love of acting through ttrpgs. Trust me, you can find something way better, you should definitely get the fuck away from thay group and teacher- and take your friend with you!!
Agre to do the show. 


Then don't turn up on the day.
If I were in your shoes, I would:  
  
a) try switching with your friend that was also misgendered in that way  
  
Or  
  
b) Malicious Compliance; play that role while looking the most manly as possible (facial hair, guy clothes, short hair, deep voice, whatever possible). I don't know if you're on T or not, so some of those may be a little bit difficult.  
  
But that's just me.
If the club is doing this and is causing you any type of distress then leave and say, screw this. You should be casted as who/what you want to be, especially the gender of the role.
I would quit immediately or just stop showing up.
Please talk to the schools office about this teacher… it sounds like she’s intentionally being transphobic, especially how you mentioned she did this to a trans girl as well. 🫂 I hope it gets better brother. You deserve better
I'd just go along with it and not show up to preform
I wouldnt take the role but if i did i would be very petty, fill in eyebrows to make them as bushy as possible, on stage talk in your deepest voice, contour an adams apple and make your face look as masculine as possible, bind, heck make a very oversized packer
But since this is just them being transphobic absolutely dont take this role, its messed up to assign you a role literally called girl
Local trans masc drama kid here as well. Here’s my take:

I can sorta see the logic behind what the Director is doing. Depending on where you are located, you could be in a very conservative area where it may not be safe for you or others on stage to openly depict queerness (and based on your comments about the transphobic students… that might b e the case). This was an issue for one of our recent performances as well. And while I know for a fact my director is fully supportive, we also had to acknowledge our audience and what is the best for our cast mates and their home lives.

However, that doesn’t give her a right to disrespect your wishes. The minimum she could do is give you a gender neutral role where it doesn’t outright say “ima boy” or “ima girl” (which is another thing I’ve personally had to work around, being a trans actor). But considering the nature of your role… it certainly won’t be that simple. So! I suggest two things!

1. Find someone you can switch roles with. You said it was a big role, so I can imagine that will certainly peak somebody’s interest. Then talk to your director. 
2. If the director is unwilling to cooperate, you now have two witnesses (the cast mate willing to switch, and your trans friend) who can help back you up. Take the issue with the principal or constant the school board via email. If your area is quite conservative, then try pulling a “forcing me to do an explicit scene when I am not comfortable” rather than a “she is disregarding my gender identity”. Unfortunately… I have a feeling they may respond better to that.

Stay safe my guy, I’m rooting for you! Break a leg! ❤️
I wouldnt take the role but if i did i would be very petty, fill in eyebrows to make them as bushy as possible, on stage talk in your deepest voice, contour an adams apple and make your face look as masculine as possible, bind, heck make a very oversized packer
But since this is just them being transphobic absolutely dont take this role, its messed up to assign you a role literally called girl.
if this is a reoccurring issue, like you mentioned it has been with both yourself and your friend, my honest opinion is: this teacher knows you are uncomfortable, and she likely gave you THE most uncomfortable role a dysphoric transmasc person could play intentionally. this is, unfortunately, something both myself & my partner have experienced.

what she did is both petty and disrespectful. she does not have the right to humiliate her students. ultimately, you are her student, and this is inappropriate of her. what can you learn from being viciously disrespected, except that she is a disrespectful person and not a good teacher? 

if you feel you can bring it up to her, please do—if not, or if she is disagreeable, (maybe speak to her regardless so she can’t claim she “didn’t know”) you have other options **if** you don’t want to quit: is there a GSA at your school? an accepting teacher or counselor you can go to? maybe even a local LGBT youth org you can ask for mediation and/or support from? are your fellow drama club members people you could point this out to, and would they back you up going to any of these authorities? 

i’m sorry she did this, it really sucks, and you deserve to be able to participate in things you’re passionate about. the world is changing for trans and/or nonbinary actors, albeit slowly, so moving forward i hope the successes of individuals like emma d’arcy and bella ramsey encourage a decrease in these attitudes. please be kind to yourself, and remember that this has nothing to do with your capability as an actor.
No take in all the experiences you can.
This is appalling. You need to talk to some adults who support you for help. If you can't find anyone, find an LGBT support group in your area and call them
Yes.
Lmao just quit, last time I checked, club activities aren’t mandatory for most public schools. If it’s private though, you might have a spot more trouble.
You need to report that teacher to administration for harassment. Her casting you in a role that requires BIRTH after you SPECIFICALLY requested not to be far as a female is abuse. It’s an act of bullying, of public shaming. You shouldn’t have to put up with this.
That was my first thought, act but either grow out your beard or glue fake stubble onto your face, also pack during visibly and chest bind
My second thought though Is that lots of actors play roles that are not who they are in any way shape or form, with different sexuality and gender, ect. It'd be good practice... if it were not literally every time, I'd go to the school counselor or the people in charge, the teacher should be fired.
those actors are okay with being cast in those roles, though. OP clearly is not comfortable with it, and I don't think he should do it, especially not if the teacher did it because she's transphobic.
Y'aint gotta downvote, it's just a thought, obviously if you don't wanna do it, don't do it."	10dgsa1	trans	207	0.96	2023-01-16 15:05:02
I came out as transfemme to my wife yesterday	"So a short time ago, I happened to stumble upon the button question.  You know the one...  

    If you were presented with a button, a button that if you press it, while keeping everything else the same (friends, family, work, husband/wife, status, etc...) would immediately, as-if from birth, change you into the gender identity you wish...  However, pressing this button is PERMANENT.  It is impossible to switch back by any means once you press it. 
    
    Do you press the button?


Well, my answer was yes, without any hesitation or second thought.  I'd 110% be a woman.


I thought this was an ""oh haha funny stuff guys want boobies"" until it got me thinking.  One thing led to another, thought about how I used to dress up as a princess a lot as a young child, I would frequently *as a prank bro* wear girl clothes to school in highschool, in a very politically backwards and close-minded area.  I maybe enjoyed doing this a bit more than what I let myself or anyone think.  I've always been openly bisexual, and always a bit more feminine than what I ""should be"" as a cis male.  In fact, frequently throughout my life I would imagine what it would be like to be a woman, with all the bits & boobs to go with it.  


I learned through various supprt sites & trans subs, including (almost especially r/egg_irl), that perhaps this is not the typical behaviour of a cis-male.  I read that trans bible thing (albeit not in full, but enough).  One thing that took the cake for me was that I started actually imagining myself as a woman.  With cute outfits and pretty dresses, being a pretty lady, hell maybe a sexy lady even.  I didn't really understand ""trans euphoria"" until then.  Just by imagining this, the feeling deep down into my heart of hearts, a hot warmth of vibrationy joy and content... The only thing I can really compare it to is the love I have for my wife, but different and more personal.


I quick realized yeah, ya boi is also ya gurl.


It took me awhile to get the courage to say something to my wife.  It's actually quite scary having to come out.  I've never really had to come out before because I've always been out.  But this was like, real, and it mattered much more than just being bisexual.  I was nervous, and being the awkward autistic egg, didn't quite know how to bring it up.  And frankly also felt a bit guilty for not being able to, because I don't keep things from my wife - we tell each other everything.  So yesterday, I sent my wife a text, or more, a wall of one, explaining everything that I realized and discovered.  As soon as my 7-book series just to say ""I'm trans"" was written, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and pressed send.


A few moments later (she's a fast reader I guess), my wife came to me and asked if I wanted to talk in the bedroom or right here.  My heart was racing.  We got to the bedroom, and she told me she loved me, and nothing I could ever do could change that.  And she supports me and will do whatever she can to help, and that she's very proud of me.  Honestly, she said a lot of things that I can't really remember because as soon as she started, I was crying.  She told me she wasn't really surprised considering who I am, and since she herself is bi, it's a win-win for her.  Immediately after the emotions and talking about everything from HRT & surgery to pronouns and names, she was doing up my measurements so I can buy myself some new clothes, and was getting really excited about going shopping together! In fact I bought some new clothes online yesterday evening and in the mean time she's letting me borrow her bras, dresses, leggings & any makeup I might need until I get my own!  She told me she hasn't seen me so outwardly happy before, and just oh my god.  She is perfect.  I am a very lucky *wom-man*.  I honestly don't know what I was so worried about.  Obviously my amazing also gay wife would be totally cool with me being trans.  I told her it was fine to tell her friends and we're all gonna be going shopping soon!  Life is gonna be even better now.


tl;dr: I came out as transfemme to my wife and both are both excited about el booba."	"Congrats! Glad to hear it went well. Supportive spouses are the best. ❤

You guys sounds right for each other, no matter who has booba or who doesn't, which will more than likely be both of you soon!
I'm so happy for you and so jealous!
Thank you <3 I am so grateful to have such an amazing & supportive wife, and I'm really happy to finally be myself.  I can't even begin to describe how good I feel!

Much love to you as well! Life is great <33

Coming out to yourself	"It's a truth you can't look at directly or you'll panic. You don't know what will happen if you face it, you just know that when you do, the consequences will be terrible.

For years, maybe decades, you hadn't even realised it was there with you, a creature that you were so accustomed to ignoring that you just assumed it to be a normal part of life. Nobody else acknowledges this thing, but it's there for them too... surely.

And then one day you realise, the creature is yours. It only knows you and you're the only person capable of knowing it's there.

How could you have not realised before? A Thing the size of an elephant, hanging out with you every day and for so long you had hardly noticed.

Now you know it's there.

Now you're terrified.

You take time, trying to address the threat out of the corner of your eye. You must. Not. Look at it. If you look at it, you'll die.

But the anxiety and the fear is all consuming. And the curiosity.

What is this Thing that nobody else seems to know is there. What does it want?

And one day it's too much.

You can't go on like this.

If you don't face this Thing you'll wither away and die anyway.

Doomed if you do, doomed if you don't.

So you turn, eyes closed, take a breath and open them.

And it's not what you thought.

The kindness, and the sadness, of the eyes that look back at you strike you in the heart. They flow into a void you didn't know was there and the creature smiles, and starts to cry.

And you cry too.

It wasn't a thing of anguish and pain, or some terrible threatening monster. The creature is pure life, and peace, and colour, and joy, and it's been so, so lonely without you.

Nobody could see it but you, and you pretended you couldn't.

You feel so much regret, but it forgives you, and embraces you, and for the first time in your life the weight is lifted.

You feel whole.

Reunited."	"I had tears reading this, thanks for putting words to some of my most difficult emotions!
I'm gonna actually cry I'm just coming out to myself for real this week and I can't believe it took me this long to see her 😭
That's really amazing.

Beautiful writing.

 I had the same blender of emotions. 2 weeks of emotional whiplash, and now after six weeks, I’m finally feeling sorted again. I’m in the best emotional place I’ve ever been in my whole life. Peace and tranquility doesn’t even start to describe it.
Absolutely accurate to my heart. <3
Thank you so much for sharing! I wasn't expecting it, but it made me tear a little lol
Wow ...
I am saveing this, it perfectly summarizes everything I had struggled with for so long that I wish to have this framed.
By the time I finished reading this I had so many tears in my eyes the words were blurry and I could barely see. This described my experience to the T. Thank you.
Thank you for this. I'm balancing on the edge between who I have been and who I think I'm meant to be. I'm not there just yet but I'm certain there is happiness waiting for me.
My emotions are a mystery to me but this definitely hit something. Thanks I loved it.
You should write a fucking book damn
Well im crying now lol. This was beautiful
That was extraordinary beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing this. This was the moment when I needed to see this.

Being t4t just rocks	I'm trans and I wish I could meet more trans people (besides my lovely friend, shoutout to him) or even date one. Like, trans girls???? So cute and pretty???? Please kiss me. What is your secret to being the sweetest mfs. Trans guys??? You guys exude masculinity in such an awesome way please hug me. Am I desperately longing for affection? Yes. Does it matter if my partner is cis or trans? Well no but something about t4t love is so beautiful because we share struggles and understand eachother and it is the biggest middle finger you can give to transphobes and terfs. Wow. Trans and queer joy gives me so much hope and seeing trans people happy in their skin or in happy relationships makes me so happy.	"Fuck this hits hard.

Need a trans girl who can be soft and beautiful and understand me
I feel this. In a T4T relationship and it’s killer as fuck
Lay on my lap and tell me your troubles, fellow trans peeps, because I love you and I’m attracted to most all of you (as long as you’re in my age range because I’m not a creep)
Ahhh!!! I Love You! Please be my friend!!! :D
You rock for this post.
You said it. Being in a relationship with my transmasc partner has made me so happy in so many ways! We understand each other at such a fundamental level, we're helping to heal each other from the damage cishet society has afflicted on us, and our dynamic is so affirming for both of us because we see each other for who we really are~

Trans people are extra sexy and awesome, highly recommend the t4t way <3
Yes! I agree! I want to love and cherish and cuddle and spend the rest of my life with a cute fem trans girl like me 🥺
ahh I definitely feel this. hope I can meet more trans people in the future
Was in a T4T relationship before, while we eventually decided that we weren't really meant for each other, it was nice never having to explain things like dysphoria and whatnot. There was just so much mutual understanding.
Awwe this is a cute af post lol 😶
I really feel this. Im ftm trans-masc, my boyfriends a trans guy, and my girlfriend is mtf trans-femme. Queer love hits different.
girls,, spft,,,
I can do half?
Yeah it goes without saying that we're talking about our own age ranges

but brb gonna go cry from wholesome overload
Well I certainly don't mind!!!
Awww thanks! You rock for existing, methinks!
That's beautiful
Don’t go cry, you can cry on my shoulder
I agree with everything! I'm also in the Midwest and having trouble finding people :/ lol
THE MIDWEST, that’s me:)

Wow! One week from now I will be taken into the OR and the biggest source of my gender dysphoria will be gone! I’m pretty sure I’ll be shedding some major tears of joy when I see my new body for the first time. 😊💕		"If you're this happy now,  I can only imagine you jumping for joy (figuratively) in a month or so... look forward to seeing your smile then! (I hate autocorrect)
Sister you look beautiful. Cute dress
Well best of luck next week and happy thanksgiving!
You so remind me Amy Poehler in her role as Leslie Knope.

Is it wrong to buy Hogwarts Legacy?	"Hi there
Please consider English is not my main language, I'm not a very well-spoken person and I only fairly recently started questioning my gender so some things I say might be completely wrong and in that case, I encourage anyone to correct me :)

My opinions come from my personal experience and beliefs as an artist myself.

I believe that once I consume any type of art, let it be a book, a game or a drawing, the emotions I'll feel are mine and only mine, not of the artist anymore. When I draw something and I publish it, in a way it does become at least emotionally property of whoever sees it. It's yours to interpret. Whatever you feel when you see it it's the valid and right way to see it. I encourage you to have a different interpretation from my original idea if it reflects more your personal experience.
That's why it comes very easy for me to separate the art from the artist. When I think of Harry Potter, Rowling doesn't exist, but I remember instead the good times I had while reading the books and watching the films and how they made me feel part of something.

Harry Potter and ""the Marauders"" had a HUGE impact on my life as a child and even now that I'm an adult. Especially now that I'm exploring more the fandom side with fanfictions that are truly extraordinary and fix all the details that in Rowling's story are a little off. I deeply relate to a few of the characters, for reasons that are not very happy, but still reading about them still brings me so much joy that I really need at the moment. 

Hogwarts Legacy is the kind of game that I've been waiting for since I was a child at this point. It's exactly what I wanted and being able to play it would make me incredibly happy. Would it be selfish to want to buy it? The only problem with pirating is that it would take a bit to find and especially early on it might be a bit broken. While it might be an alternative I'd like to own a copy myself so I can play it as soon as possible without worrying about viruses and different issues when eventually they release patches, new versions and mods (like the problems I sometimes have with a specific version of Skyrim working only with a specific version of a mod I want to use)

I'll bring another example. I recently bought 2 Harry Potter themed pillows because only now that I have my own money I can treat myself with these things. Every time I see those pillows they make me happy and almost make me feel like I'm there, at Hogwarts in the common room or something. But technically I supported her by giving her a portion of the money I spent because of the logo. Does that make me awful? Does it mean that I shouldn't have bought them even if they make me happy and the pillow on its own doesn't have anything transphobic? But because I indirectly supported economically an awful person who is already extremely rich?

Me having issues with my own gender identity I should be mad. And I am don't get me wrong. I feel quite conflicted or I wouldn't have made this post. But I find it extremely exhausting to keep being angry. The franchise makes me happy and it will continue to do so. Is it so wrong?

Edit: thank you all so much for all the insights that I really needed. I wasn't aware of the plotline about stopping a slave revolt so before making any decision I'm definitely gonna wait until the game comes out to properly understand how it plays out. At this point making my own game sounds a lot less stressful

Edit 2: Okay since this post is gaining traction outside of the community if I see any comment that is in any way attacking ""the lgbt community (which I am part of btw) for being dramatic"" you will be blocked. You are not going to use MY post were I'm expressing my conflict to share hate and attack a group I'm literally part of thank you very much."	"Yes.

Death of the author isn't a thing when the author still profits off the material and uses that money to spread hate.
The issue is, that Big-Terf earns money, that she can use to fight trans people. As soon as she is dead, this might change, but as long as she is living, she can put the money you give her into the fight against us.
I was a big fan of Harry Potter when I was a young kid but now I can’t even look at it the same knowing the creator is hateful to something I cannot control. Ugh oh well…
I'd say yes, it is wrong to buy it, but not just for the obvious problems with J.K. Rowling. The game itself has an awful plotline where the protagonist literally stops a slave revolt (the goblins, which to make it even worse are antisemitic stereotypes).
Yes. You show support with your purchases. Buying her material is supporting her, which in turn allows her to continue to be a POS human.
i would wait a bit after the release and then try to pirate it
JKR tweeted yesterday that anyone who supports trans rights is completely “incompatible” with owning ANY of her intellectual property whether it was bought 20 years ago or today… she doesn’t want us as fans. she doesn’t even care about our money anymore she’s so prejudiced.
besides her indirectly being a terf the game is directly antisemitic and pro authoritarianism so like ya giving a terf money isn’t great but i feel like the issues with the game itself are more repulsive
People shouldn't buy anything that contributes to giving Rowling money or a platform. 

I won't condemn people and tell them they're horrible people because they did something that's bad though.
Yea it’s wrong. Just stop interacting with the Harry Potter IP until it is no longer culturally relavent she has power to kill trans people. And she has. So yeah it’s bad after Joanne terf queen dies then we can talk about Harry Potter agian
I hate JK Rowling as much as anybody else on here, but I also loved the Harry Potter universe as a child and I’m looking forward to playing the game. I play on PC so getting a second hand physical copy is out of the question, and the game will probably incorporate Denuvo DRM so a crack is also very unlikely to come out anytime soon, if ever.

If you purchase the game from steam for $60, 30% of that money goes to Valve, leaving exactly $42 for WB.
Development costs, marketing budget, and the company’s profits will all take a substantial cut from that money. How much do you think Rowling will get? I bet it’s less than a dollar per copy sold.

If you want to get the game, then I recommend making a donation to a trans rights organization, that should do more net good than not buying the game and not making the donation.

This is just my take, and I understand if you disagree. I loved Harry Potter growing up and seeing the author actively try to jeopardize the safety and well-being of my community is really sad. I wish that my existence would stop being a political issue and that my identity would be the last thing that people would think about, but it is what it is.
Do what you want, I’m not here to police the things that make people happy. But yeah, I wouldn’t buy the game. Sure, she won’t suffer financially. But as long as people keep buying her stuff, WB will continue to give her massive deals and continue allowing her to spread her hate.

Imagine if HP stopped being such a cultural staple and we *could* ignore JK Rowling. It would be nice, but as it stands she holds a lot of cultural power. As long as her words are being used in anti-trans legislation worldwide, we really shouldn’t be supporting her works
Yes, you’re giving money to the TERF queen to keep propagating her filth
People have strong opinions, and while I certainly wouldn’t choose to buy anything she would profit off, it doesn’t make *you* awful. It’s kind of similar to voting, as other people have already said. Your individual contribution doesn’t mean a lot, but if everyone makes the same choice we start seeing consequences.

I don’t think anyone here is going to ease your conscious about this, unfortunately. It really is up to you whether you think a bit of support for a known transphobe is worth enjoying something you grew up with.
I will never give that woman a cent of my money.
Honestly, I'd say just buy GoW 2018. Better story, relatively same price, Kratos VA actually supports LGBTQ+ people, and also big swords go brrt.
I will not support JK Rowlings transphobia.

**She will not get a dime from me.**
Joanne K Rowling will use your own money to make your existence as close to illegal as it can be if you're trans in any way.

Will make other people's existence as close to illegal as possible if you're not.

For the only reason that she decided to hate them out of the blue.
Giving her money ! I thought the game looked great and absolutely joked for half a second about getting it and hiding it but no... just friggin no ... does she need to have a swastika tattoo and blood dripping fangs for one to grasp the seriousness of her reach and the damages done by her supporters... defund bigotry , defend each other,  define equality  . ✌
[deleted]
English isn't your main language, which means I would assume your birthplace is not in England or the United States. 

I am saying this for a VERY specific reason. I will answer your question with a question from me. You can answer it for yourself. 

Wherever you were born in, let's say I said ""(Place you were born in) is horrible. I will now actively exclude them from the rights they deserve."" I would never say that IRL, but this is a hypothetical. Let's say I also have a famous book series that has video games and so many merchandise and everything a fan could want and more. So much so that this is even called a world. I am not dead. I am very much alive and EVERY item sold under my company's name leads me to getting a portion of the money sold from EVERYTHING with it's name on it. 

Knowing I am an active member in excluding you from your deserved rights, would you say it's okay for your friend to support me? They say that art can be separated from the artist while asking you if it is okay to line the pockets of hate. Your friend also KNOWS I said what I said and knows that I made it a point to make things worse and worse by going more and more against the people who grew up where you did (including you). 

Would you say yes? 

Remember: as I am alive, a yes means allowing your friend to support me financially, giving me more power to hate.

Also, side note: I don't hate based on location. I don't hate based on anything but morality. This situation is all hypothetical.
If you really want to play it you should probably pirate it. Jk Rowling doesn’t deserve any of your money.
I’d wait for the reviews, because the game may be a mess at launch. It doesn’t include quidditch or any real side mini games. Seems like a pretty tailored Action adventure game rather than immersive RPG. In regards to whether supporting JK Rowling if you purchase the game, it’s up to you. Her views are trash and she is clearly led by bigotry about gender, but remember she had no real input in the game. Also, though she may receive a considerable royalty from the sales of the game, the intention of developers were to make the game for every fan not the ones she says deserves it. The main majority of sales will go to Warner Bros anyway.
its a game about antisemitism by a racist and white power writer who uses her money to directly fund alt right bullshit, it is extremely not okay to purchase this game, ignoring the trans side entierly, its STILL bad and evil to purchase and THEN ON TOP shes also a transphobe
Yes, and from what I've heard, it's not very good.

Apparently the story is about putting down a slave rebellion.
Well… it’s complicated. Firstly, yes it’s kinda wrong. Obviously, no one should JK anymore by buying anything from here. And I would say it’s best to boycott the game. 

Here’s the problem though. Harry Potter has already become such a huge part of our cultural zeitgeist over the past decades, that this fictional world and the characters have been with some of us for the entirety of our lives, and are likely very important to a lot of people. I know that’s at least for me the case, and most people my age (and above) in my country. It’s not that easy to just delete that kind of attachment from one’s cultural identity. So I get it when it is important for some people to still entertain that, especially in an RPG video game, which is what a lot of fans have been waiting for for years.

Here’s my take for someone who feels this attached to Harry Potter: hold off on buying, just until the reviews and sales numbers of the first couple weeks are released. If it is not good or an unfinished mess (which, let’s face it, is very possible with modern AAA games), then don’t buy it. You will not have lost anything worth playing. If the sales are middling and a lot of people are also boycotting it, I also wouldn’t buy it, as your contribution would make a difference. If, however, it is the best thing since sliced bread, and millions of people have bought it within the first month, then well… I won’t judge you for buying it. If it is that important to you, it’ll give you a whole lot and (in the grand scheme) your contribution won’t have made a big difference for an already successful game.
I just get why people just can't wait and buy them second hand. Triple A games are so expensive these days anyway.
Yeah, just pirate it if you wanna play it. r/piracy subreddit has a whole megathread of places to pirate from which is pretty simple. Plus, they update the download links for a game with the new patches and stuff up on the sites too.

The game's story is just gonna be a jackshit plot full of anti-Semitism and racism. So you're not missing out on much, but I understand the appeal of just fucking around and interacting with an open world HP game.

Personally, I'll probably pirate it if the game offers up subplots, side quests and other shit that might be decent. If not, the game just isn't worth anyone's time
As people are saying, buying this game puts money in the pocket of TERF, but you don’t exactly have to *buy* it
Yes it’s wrong
Yes it is wrong. I don’t care about your personal art philosophy. You’re giving money to an individual who WILL use it to harm others as well as the corporation who is willing to work with her, and you’re financially supporting a product that directly and indirectly supports harm to others. I’m really sorry that this is the franchise that makes you so happy, but I don’t think the joy you feel from looking at a pillow offsets the fact that you’re financially supporting people who at the very least don’t care about a group of people’s human rights, and at worst are actively working to oppress them. JK and her cronies take every purchase of Harry Potter related shit as support for their politics.

EDIT: for the record, this is coming from someone who was such a fan of HP he had to get a new set of the books because his old set was falling apart due to re-reading them so much. I LOVED the series dearly and it made me very happy. This does not change the fact that the harm its creators do (and the shitty elements in the actual material) exist and are much more serious than my fond memories.
If you have to play it pirate it.

Your money is going towards JK Rowling who is actively making trans people's lives harder and is a terf.
She just today sent hate towards a youtuber called Jessie Gender.

Buy Harry potter merch second hand, or from Etsy, where there's no money going towards JK if you want to get new merch.
Keep your old merch if you want to, but don't give any more money to JK Rowling, she's actively hurting trans people's lives.
Enough with the piracy bullshit. Don't interact with this franchise. Seriously, how hard is that for people?
Yes, the funds go to a woman who actively engages in hate including writing self insert terf books under a pseudonym that comes from an equally horrible man, but pirating I can't say is too bad...
I feel like, despite many different opinions here, buying this game does not mean you support her. Yes, it may support Rowling, but that doesnt mean you support her. I dont think its inherently wrong to get this if you really want it. I wont buy it because i dont want to give her any money, but i will not condemn others or look down upon others if they choose differently from me. i do understand Rowling is an awful piece of shit, but i also understand Harry Potter has had a massive effect of people. Do as you wish
I refer you to Jessie Gender's tweet on the matter. 

Tl;dr: it's ok to still enjoy the things you already own but buying new stuff from Joanne is funding her continued efforts to genocide us.
People are blowing this JKR thing and the plot line WAY out of proportion. Like it’s a video game!!! It’s not transphobic nor antisemitic. Get off of social media and touch grass, please. God I’m Gen Z and even I have to admit my generation is so soft. Always the virtue signaling. Always with the “woe is me” attitude. Seek mental help and grow up.
The author in question is already rich, her making more money on the game won't do anything. And most people will buy it regardless, so a handful of missed sales from conscientious objectors won't accomplish anything

Pick your battles, this isn't something that ultimately matters
The saddest part of all of this is that I could easily write an essay talking about how trans friendly Harry Potter is, with one huge theme of the books being to accept and love people for who they are rather than who society thinks they are. Then the author had to go and ruin that.
Yes.
It kinda hurts seeing some of these reapplies- because Harry Potter was literally everything to me as a kid- and while I try to avoid things that are t fandom made or whatever to not support Rowling I do agree that pirating the stuff might be the right way to go as I feel bad having some of my old Harry Potter stuff out on display from when I was younger I wouldn’t risk viruses or breaking your device for it- do what makes you happy- tho my advice would be to be aware and try to support these ppl as little as possible without sacrificing your happiness like try to buy fandom made stuff instead of officially licensed merch where possible but if this game is something you really want I’d say go for it if there’s no other safe way to get it idk
it is wrong, no question about it. the story is said to justify the slavery in the books/films, she profits directly from the sales, the game devs have already earned all they will off of it so buying it doesnt support any decent artists.
Yes is the simple answer.

I won't fault anyone for enjoying Hogwarts Legacy as a game, art is art, you like what you like. But if you buy Hogwarts Legacy you are funnelling money into the pockets of Joanme Rowling. She has made it explicitly clear that she takes anyone paying for her merch as an endorsement of her ideals and she will use that money to hurt trans people.

No one is saying you can't enjoy Harry Potter. It was a big part of a lot of people's childhoods and it would be unreasonable to expect everyone to jettison it wholesale. However if you continue to buy licensed merchandise in whatever form, you are contributing to her ability to further marginalise trans people.

If you want to play the game, I would suggest pirating it. If you pay for it, you are in essence saying that your entertainment is more important than the safety of trans people.

Unfortunately the concept of death of the author can only be realised when the author is actually dead. There is no separating art from the artist when the artist is still around and using that art to hurt people.
I also love Harry Potter for similar reasons but the way I go about it is I buy from small businesses. This way JKR isn’t profiting and I’m also supporting small business people and I get what I want in the end
Yes, yes it is, you know better than to financially help transphobic people/companies/entities
Now be good girl and don't buy any Harry Potter products and any other products that make that transphobic author any money ok hun. We of course still love you very much and continue to be here for you. You are a good girl. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
I’m going to be honest I didn’t read all this because the only answer is Its Wrong! Buying it directly puts money in Jks pockets and she views everyone who financially supports her as a supporter of her beliefs. There is no justifying it.
It is wrong no matter how you put it when you're giving money to a TERF.

Just pirate it.
Yes. End of. 

Supporting HP in any light at this point is support for JK.
Everybody on this thread mad holier than thou, but there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Every single thing you buy for fun or are forced to buy came at the cost of the suffering of others. Don't deprive yourself of something you enjoy because you don't want to make a millionaire 75c richer. And If you're going to, don't do it because you're letting people on reddit judge your morals, do it because you think it's the right thing to do.
Honestly your happiness is more important than the moral battle because at the end of the day J. K. Rowling is making a trans person happy 💜 also I bet if she knew it would really piss her off XD

One thing that would be really fantastic is if we started a trend where people were making stories and art about the all Harry Potter characters being trans and tagged her social media in the posts. It’s not possible for us to stop her from making money but we can twist her creation into some thing that she would hate 💜 and honestly I feel like a lot of other people could get behind that too
Support in all forms to the artist is an act of treason upon those that the author ""hates"". You are also complicit in their hate by buying their products. There are other games, there are other movies, there will be other authors. The only way you discourage hate in a capitalistic society is by voting with your wallet. You pay them money you vote for them. You withhold money from them you vote against the hate they stand for. What's worth more? Their hate? Your ""need"" to buy a silly game from them? Or, standing up against that hate by taking away the one thing they want more than anything in the world. Your money and your approval of them by receiving that money from you. Do the right thing. Do what your heart says is right. Hate the haters. I am intolerant of intolerance. ;)
Piracy > founding the deaths of trans people.  It shouldn't be hard choice. Sometimes I feel mega corporations brainwashed the minds of consumers,  for some piracy seme.to be worse than murder lol. When in reality whichever is good of bad depends a lot in the context. Don't let megacorporation and billiomaries root your brain.
I agree it is a bad a thing to give Rowling money, however I have the same dilemma. As a queer person, there's very VERY few things from my childhood that make me feel true happiness, and one of them was Harry Potter. It seems stupid but I went through real grieve when the whole Rowling transphobia thing came out cuz I felt like this last thing I had left from my childhood had also been taken away from me. With time, my personal decision has been to keep enjoying in, privately, and only speak about it with close friends, so at least I don't give it more publicity or whatever, but I'm not willing to give away one of the few things that make me feel joy. If you feel a similar way, tbh I believe it's just fine to go and enjoy the game. The transphobe is fuckin rich already anyway, torturing ourselves into not enjoying one of the few things we like isn't gonna change it.
What's so wrong with waiting a couple weeks and pirating it?
Yes.
Yes
If they like something masculine, (sports, wood carving, etc) I recommend giving a gift like that
Yes
For legal reasons, I can’t advise you to pirate it.
ive been told that rowling’s already been given all that the game devs are going to give her. so any profits go straight to the company, not rowling. so i dont think its wrong
PIRATE IT.
Yes.  


no nice way to put it.
No it’s not wrong!  Just do what you want don’t worry about what other people “disapprove” of!  And I know this post is gonna get downvoted but I don’t care!! Don’t give up on things you love just because other people tell you to!
I’ll start with the short answer and give my reasoning behind it. Is it wrong to buy the game? No, not at all. Yes JK Rowling has some horrendously disgusting views and is putting her billion dollar net worth towards some truly awful organizations, but Rowling has had no hand in the making of this game - asides from crafting the world twenty or so years ago. The devs of the game have been fighting to ensure that there are trans inclusive options (for example you don’t choose the characters gender, rather you choose their gender identity at the final screen and it has no bearing on your characters visual appearance) and characters, and I think it really shows. My recommendation is to decide whether or not you want to buy this game based solely on whether you would enjoy it - it’s not going to make JK’s pockets any deeper than they already are, but it will help to support the developers who want to make this series a safe place for all of us again
No. JK Rowling will have tons of money to spend on her hateful causes either way, whether or not you purchase this game is not gonna have an effect on her finances. It's not a very good game from what I hear, so that might be worth considering, but there's not really much of a moral dilemma. If you can play the game without it being ruined for you by the thought of what an asshole JK Rowling is, it's fine to buy it and play it.
I would just say wait a bit and buy it second hand. At least that way you are putting money into someone else’s pocket instead of directly into Rowling’s pocket.
Yes.

You don't have to be angry forever, but you could also choose to move on. Identifying so strongly with a media franchise isn't healthy.

You also don't have to give money to an antisemitic game in a setting made by a neoliberal transphobe.
It's a bad game made by a bad person. Don't even pirate it. There is better shit out there.
It isn't wrong at all, if you like it then you get to like it. I personally dislike Rowling for her actions, but it's not my choice to make other people not buy Harry Potter stuff. it's if they want to buy it.
Def pirate it if you can safely tho.
Just download the pirate game
I think it’s ultimately up to the individual. I think it’s fine, even though I won’t buy it, because avalanche studios is an independent, massive game company with dozens of workers and creators who made this game independent of Rowling. Unless she was directly involved (which she isn’t) or the creators also share really problematic beliefs, there’s enough of a gap between what she’s done and the creation of this game. That’s why I don’t support the books or the new movies as they were written by Rowling, but I support the parks and the original movies. 

I also think that she already makes so much money, that boycotting this game, even if no copies were sold, she would still be completely untouched. That’s also just hurting the creators of the game itself
I'm quite conflicted on this topic... 
I really like the harry Potter franchise and I started loving it before I knew Rowling was transphobic.

If there was a way to buy Harry Potter related things without financing Rowling I would love to do that. 
I have the same issue with FNaF products. The creator gave money to politicians that I don't agree with, but now the game has an amazing community who also creates games and stories. But that's kinda different because the creator retired so idk... 

I don't think the Harry Potter franchise is evil because the person who wrote the books is evil, but if when I buy something related to the franchise the money go to Rowling I don't think I would. 

Anyways it's kind of your choice, it's a delicate topic and you should do what you think is ok 🤷‍♂️
Buy it used, you get the game and don’t fund J K.
I'm probably getting it. The development team seems very against rowlings actions and they are working to rid the game of her hate. She doesn't have much influence at all in the development either and probably won't profit as much as people think. Even if she did she's already rich so it's not going to change her influence finance wise
just pirate it lmaoa pm if you want a link to a site where it will be on on launch day
it is morally wrong, but it’s not like you can’t buy it. i’ll probably buy it anyway
I've preordered it. It was completely sold out for the PS4 so I got it for my switch. One less sale wouldn't make any difference when lots of money had already been made from it. I might have considered not buying it if other people were doing the same, but that is clearly not the case so I'm not going to deprive myself of joy when other people are happy playing it 🤷‍♂️
Just fucking buy it you couldnt care less about anything related to JKR being a TERF anyways. I swear Im tired of those people tryna seem like good people for brownie points. Just be an actual ally and shut up.
I wouldn’t call it morally wrong, personally I don’t think ethics come into it strongly. Like, yeah you’re giving to this franchise…but like big whoop. Like, you’re just a single person, and your influence on this is zero, and you shouldn’t feel bad for the decision of the companies who made this. Because like Warner Brothers could’ve decided to stop making things in this franchise, but they didn’t, because they don’t care about what Rowling says or does. What they want to do is pass on that question to you, they want you to feel bad because you see a video game that you think sounds fun, and want to play it. Because if the question becomes a personal question, that insulates them from criticism. 

The fact is this, you have zero impact on this, whether you play it or not money will be made, and if you decide not to play it the only person that impacts is you, and the only thing it does is reinforce this toxic mentality that these corporations have created which is that you should feel bad for their unethical choices. 

Basically do whatever you want, if you decide not to play it because of JKR that’s fair enough, and even though I criticized the mentality of making the choice a reflection of your own ethics…I also understand entirely, because I often have a hard time doing similar things where I know I have no impact, and it doesn’t matter my choice, but I still make myself feel bad, I totally understand that choice. But if you decide to buy it, do so, and don’t feel bad about the unethical decisions of other entities who legitimately had an ethical question/decision to answer here.
I don’t think that liking Harry Potter is wrong and I don’t think that the author of Harry Potter is distraught about the trans community not buying her books. I think that you buying a couple books is not going to help some tyrannical dictator nor will it spread hate more than it already has. The author of Harry Potter does not need money to spread hate. If Harry Potter books are fulfilling to you I say go getem
no, buy the game if you want
however you feel about it honestly

death of the author exists but know that jkr gets her paycheck when the deal is signed.  *she already has all the money she’ll get for this.*  does buying this won’t give her money but it will signal to companies that 1 more person is interested in harry potter stuff.  no shame for supporting it and no shame for not supporting it.  do whatever you think is ok
Enjoy what u wamt to enjoy. Its ur life
Not at all. She’ll still make plenty of money with or without your purchase, nothing will change for her if you do or do not buy any Harry Potter related merchandise. The only thing that changes is you and your enjoyment of life. Do whatever makes you happy, we only have 1 life. It’s not worth it to make yourself miserable over this when absolutely nothing will change if you do or do not buy the game.
Well maybe I will get in trouble for saying this but fuck it, in cases like this piracy is an option, just wait a bit and it will eventually be cracked. You can also buy a second hand of a physical copy of the game, this way you will legitimately obtain the game while not giving any money to the author or studio
Absolutely not in my opinion. Rowling had nothing to do with the development of the game. It's the same thinking as pirating AAA games because they are cooperate giants instead of indie developers. But those indie developers aspire to be in a cooperate giant role. I doubt she will make much money off of the game since all she had to do with it is the story. You are giving money to people you don't agree with every single day without knowing who they are so I don't see why this is different.
Do what makes you happy.
Just because she's a jerk doesn't mean you can't enjoy Harry Potter I hate the jerk but I still like Harry Potter
Try and find a way to pirate it. if that doesn't work then like tbh its so inconsequential that you literally might as well buy it. the amount that you would lose from not getting to play the game that's really important to you is probably more than what JK rowling would gain from you buying it so like...
Steal it if you can. I’d recommend this about any digital formatted material. Most of us are poor. Take what you can, because those that are rich steal everything not nailed down using tax laws and any other laws they can hide behind. Fuk them. And especially fuk JK. She’s a troll and a POS… BTW, I’m really old. I loved the Harry Potter books and movies. Own the books own the movies. I love them and I agree with what you said about owning the personal feelings from enjoying the material. However, going forward, I wouldn’t spent one red fukn cent on anything from that cunt.
just pirate it
Yes.
Steal it lol
Join the dark side...
Yep
yes it is.
Yes. Simply yes.
The topic is a grey area, but remember, pirating is morally okay in some situations.  Either that or, like a lot of WB games, it will either come to gamepass or playstation plus at some point. You can download it without paying for it yourself. But if you are on switch or PC? Yar har fiddle dee dee, being a pirate is alright with me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: More specifically, a big corporation isn't going to ACTUALLY be hurting just because you pirate a game. The developers have already been paid. And the publisher is already deciding whether to cut them loose or keep them on for the next project. Our purchase really means nothing to them for the thousands that are going to purchase it. Probably just to spite us. Piracy is not okay when it is a small indie developer trying to share a passion project, or make their mark in the industry. WB is a big corporation making millions off of tax write offs, shady business deals, and merch sales alone for various projects. WB is a company that is morally okay to pirate from. So go nuts.
When they manage to make the game not antisemitic and you can play a trans charakter I will buy it. I dont really think I will though 😸.
Personally I don't like to support bad people unless I'm extremely passionate about that thing, even then I tend to make less purchases when I discover that they aren't supportive or whatever the bad thing might be.
Never buy anything with that name on it. It goes right into her pocket. If you REALLY want to play it that badly, pirate it, i'm sure it will be really easy to do once its released. And if you're scared of prating it, buy it secondhand.
It’s also wrong because there is no online gaming in higwarts legacy
I heard the reasons why people dislike the game... so I pre-odered the game for 2 consoles and pre-ordered the game as a Christmas present to a friend.
It's a game.
Rowlings involvement is the basic fantasy world around it. She rich.
The actual people involved are the programmers and designers that create it.... Those include people of different background, culture and sexual orientation.
Those are the people whose job, future and family might depend on the success of the game. Those are the people you punish by boycotting it.... Not Rowling....
I honestly can't stand this destruction aggressive behaviour of the LGBQT crybabies....
It's mere attention seeking, nothing more..... On the cost of others... 
Stop your whining and grow a pair (of any genitals of your sexual preference, because you are the same as anyone else and you should be allowed to express yourself the way you want. But I honestly don't care more about your whining for attention seeking as I care about that of any cis person -> absolutely zero. And in this way, any LGBTQ person has the same value to me as a cis person)
I know this is an old post so I’m hoping I’ll avoid the downvote mobs. 

It’s not wrong. It’s your $$ do what you want. 

It’s honestly more WRONG for other people to say what can and can’t do with YOUR OWN $$. 

You can separate the art from the artists. Don’t listen to other people.

JK is irreverent twat, and Harry Potter is much bigger than she ever will be.

Personally I pre ordered it. People fail to realize.. JK was PAID for the IP already… WAY before any of her dumb tweets.. and the money she got from that deal is more that any royalties she’s getting from game sales.. so it’s moot point. 

You’re not contributing much if anything to her terf shit.. she’s already a fucking billionaire.. and will do what she wants. 

Also the terf shit she is funding.. isn’t actually effect anyone in their day to day life.. people like to get mad for the sake of getting mad. 

So do what you want, buy the game, play the game, make videos on the game steam the game. 

Don’t over think it and enjoy your life, don’t let other people tell you what you can and cannot do with your own cash
First world problems.
This. If you can pirate it, fine, whatever. If you bought it already before you learned, well, the money’s spent, may as well enjoy it if you still want to. But spending more money in ways that enrich aggressive bigots who actively fund hate groups in trying to get bigoted laws passed is actively contributing to that bigoted effort whether that’s your motive or not. 

Put it this way, if someone were selling chocolate as a fundraiser to build a puppy-kicking machine, being very open about their desire to kick puppies more efficiently and make sure no puppy remains unkicked, would it be ok to buy their fundraiser chocolate just because you like chocolate a bunch?

Find another form of entertainment. There’s plenty of chocolate that doesn’t fund a puppy-kicking machine.
Probably not even after she dies to be honest. A lot of big money people set up foundations and the sale from their art form after their death goes to the foundation that will then use that in whatever way the person wanted. I can't honestly see her not doing this. She's in the process right now of setting up a women's thing (I can't remember what it was for) and its for cis women only.
I wish people would talk about this aspect more. It’s not only giving her your money, but also choosing to ignore all of the other racism, antisemitism and more within the books and this game. Her world is not fun despite her being transphobic, it’s poorly written with bigotry in every chapter.

Edited to add: I just think it shows people have no backbone to support their own supposed morals. Sure a single person purchasing the game wont do much, but everyone claiming that THEY are the exception and it isn’t a big deal means a shitton of people are excusing themselves cuz “they’re just one person”. So a shitton of people are purchasing the game giving this woman money.
This is a bit of a misconception, and an assumption.

We don't know what the character is going to do with the goblin rebellion, and we don't know how it'll play out. We don't know if the main character will start out with the typical anti-human sentiments that were likely common at the time, but they then transition into being sympathetic to the goblin cause. We don't know if the goblins will be attacking students and civilians, requiring the main character to respond in defense, rather than to suppress the revolt.

Not to mention there are similar concepts in plenty of other IP. Skyrim, for one. Do you fight for the stormcloaks that discriminate against elves? Or do you fight for the Empire, which is falling apart from within?

Second, the claims that the portrayal of goblins is anti-Semitic has been disproven a few times.

Goblins in Harry Potter are portrayed pretty well in line with European fairy tales about Goblins, which predate anti-Semitic tropes. The similarities are coincidental, rather than intentional.

Suffice it to say, we don't know how the goblin revolts will play out, and the claims of anti-Semitism have been disproven.
There’s a pretty good thread about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/x0n0fn/even_if_the_transphobia_doesnt_bother_you_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from r/WitchesVsPatriarchy
We don’t know anything about the plot besides the tagline “possible goblin rebellion” and that the major mystery will be ancient magic. It’s too early to know exactly what route the story will follow
I thought the house elves were slaves and the goblins were she who shall not be named's beliefs in Nazi propaganda of Jewish bankers made in the Wizarding world?

Either way she's absolutely disgusting so I guess it doesn't matter.
Yet we kill countless innocent people in games and don't blink an eye.. Lol
It's fiction, the goblins are not stand ins for Jewish people, it's in the Wizarding World, so it's from the perspective of fictional magic people in a fictional world, also we gotta remember that this is just stuff that is established in the Wizarding universe, it's no different than any other horrible thing established in any other universe.
Yes! STEAL IT!!!
Be gay. Do crime.
This is the best answer lol
So basically you do seperate the art from the artist. But you just want to steal. If you pirate you have the same views as her. Because it is a world made from her ip so indirectly from her mind. So you do agree with her than
Wow, what a moronic bitch. Even the actors themselves (and almost all fans) disagree with her, and it’s honestly just as much of not more theirs than hers. Fuck her. It’s not even her call to make on who is “allowed” to enjoy the HP universe and story. Egotistical as fuck.
indirectly? she literally just tweeted “merry terfmas” and has been VERY clear that she has transphobic beliefs *and is proud of it.* iirc she’s also donated to anti-trans organizations. i’d say she’s a terf very directly

sorry if this comes off as aggressive, i promise it’s not targeted at you. jkr just makes me so mad and it sucks cuz i really like harry potter
Directly anti-Semitic and pro-authoritarian?

First the claims that the portrayal of goblins is anti-Semetic have been disproven. Second we have no idea how the story line will play out with the goblin revolt. We know there will be choices in-game related to the plot. It's very possible the player character is able to develop sympathy for the goblins and doesn't take part in any sort of suppression.

Even if they do, who cares? It's art. There are portrayals of slaves in media all the time.
Absolutely agree with you there. Boycotting sounds good and all, but it doesn’t actually help people who are actively struggling. It certainly won’t stop religious organizations in the US from funding anti-LGBTQ politicians and their rhetoric
This thread makes me sad because there's a lot of judgment being thrown at anyone that would consider buying this game. Like it sucks that money is going to someone like Joanne, but placing individual responsibility on any single person isn't fair or realistic. No ethical consumption under capitalism, y'know? Should people be shamed for buying factory farmed meat? Produce from farms that exploit undocumented workers? Cars that add to pollution? Consumable items with plastic packaging? Getting services at a for-profit hospital or clinic? All of these things are bad but it's not any one consumer's fault. And if you're not going to flame someone for all these other things but you would for buying this game, where's the morality in that? Transphobia is fucking awful but it's a hard sell that it's any more worth starting fights over than pollution, animal cruelty, labor exploitation, healthcare inequality, etc. And it wouldn't be worth being a toxic asshole to people over indirectly supporting those things either, because they individually have no power over those things, just as we have no power over Joanne's transphobia.
Exactly this. There is such a thing as separating the art from the artist. Unfortunately that has had to happen alot lately. The story itself has all been about love and accepting people for who they are. It does suck that she is going to profit from the game due to her owning the IP. Though thankfully had no involvement on the story itself outside of keeping the lore intact... Dont want another cursed child incident. Truthfully I agree it should be a choice. And whether or not you play the game shouldnt decide whether or not your a transphob that some people may claim you to be..   


I know some trans people that are excited for the game and obviously despise and are hurt over JK for her words against the trans community. Hopefully the recent talks from WB is true and they plan on trying to get her to sell it completely to them. Because they want to make new movies... but not with her in the picture.
PIRATE TIME BA-BY
You cant blame people for liking the franchise, i have friends who are going to buy it and i dont chastise them for it. We all know the creator is trash but im not going to let that drive a wedge between me and my friends that support me. This is where piracy works perfectly less money goes to the terf and people get to enjoy the content. 

It’s a crappy situation but we should try and make the best of it. At the end of the day every sane person knows is trash. The only thing we accomplish by trying to force our friends away from the franchise is making ourselves seem overbearing.
[deleted]
Lmfao literally
This is silly. Of couse there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. But its also important to do things that don't directly have an affect on you as a person. Morals vs ethics.
Thank you!!! Can’t believe I had to scroll this far to find a reasonable take lol
i think you’re a little naive, she would not be pissed that harry potter made a trans person happy, she’s be laughing knowing that she’s getting money from a trans person. money that will go straight into the pockets of other people trying to kill trans people.
What a sweet answer and I agree!
Treason is going a bit far, that kind if rhetoric only alienates people that are on the fence. Also this isnt some random brand its pretty ingrained in alot of peoples childhood. 

I know it sucks that the author of a prolific franchise hates us, but if every trans person got into arguments with their friends about this we would all seem pretty unhinged. Everyone knows the creator is trash and honestly I don’t know if trans people are even a big enough group to make a dent in the revenue.
[deleted]
once that thing people love starts directly harming me or other people i hold dearly, i think i have a legitimate right to be peeved about it and try and stop them from doing it.
Agreeeeeeeeeeed :3
Joanne wasn't even involved in the making of this game lmao.
the whole mentality of ""it's just one sale"" is bullshit. once everyone starts thinking that it's not just one sale is it?

you framed it in a way that makes it seem not that bad, that means more people are probably gonna buy it just because ""it's only one sale"".
Okay but...they only keep making it because it make money. If it doesn't make enough money because people stop buying it, especially if they have a cited reason of ""Rowling's hate speech"" then yeah, they might question the ethics of working with her.
I think that’s something you have to decide.   Personally I will not buy it.  I used to love Harry Potter and still do.  I haven’t seen, bought, or even viewed any HP on tv which was hard because I used to always watch it.  That’s just me though.   I know she had little say over this project but she still gets paid because it’s her IP.   We all have to personally decide where the line is.
JK’s net worth is in the billions. Whether or not this game sells will have no perceived impact on her financially. Pirating the game would only hurt the development team who have been fighting add trans inclusive options such as in the character development. I understand where you’re coming from, but let’s be honest she probably makes more in a day from the deal with universal studios amusement park than this game will generate in a 5 year span
What if someone back in the day with a huge pile of money set up a foundation to spread pro slavery propaganda or something else that is unethical? Would we still see campaigns of pro slavery today from it or would there have been interventions? Assuming the money doesn't run out.
Well, we know the villain is a goblin named Ranrok that incited a goblin rebellion in Harry Potter history. Even if the conflict isn't blatantly ""stopping a slave revolt,"" they still have the antisemitic caricature as the main antagonist.
Crimes are ok if they are against people you don't like?
i most definitely do not share her views or agree with her- i have no interest in the game and have no idea what the game is about other than harry potter. the truth is people want the game. for whatever reason that may be; it could be playing with a friend, nostalgic attachment to harry potter, general interest in video games i have no idea. i’ve never pirated a game before- but if you have such a strong desire to get a game despite it being made by someone who has terrible views, then pirating is pretty much the best way to do that as it doesn’t directly/financially support the creator. otherwise i mean- just don’t get the game, right?
""almost all fans""  
Hmmmm, not really. Actually those who hate JK Rowling are a tiny minority. Hogwarts Legacy isn't even out yet and it's the best selling game on Steam in a long time.
no lol i worded that very poorly. she is a HUGE terf, it’s just that her terfiness isn’t directly manifested in the game, and purchasing and playing the game only indirectly validates it, vs engaging with the game itself validating her antisemitism
Yeah, she seems pretty unrepentant and proud of her shitty views. Also she pals around with other TERFs who pal around with fascists (neo-nazis, white identitarians, christian fascists, etc.) and has shown support for these views which are not only anti-trans, but are also anti-queer in general, and also misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, and antisemitic. Basically if you support any human rights cause JKR should raise an eyebrow for the company she keeps.

And before anyone comes at me and says you aren't responsible for who your friends and associates associate with, do you have any friends who are close buddies with avowed fascists? I'm gonna guess not cause it's a pretty hard lapse in judgement to look past.
I feel like which artists we choose to support is a different conundrum than many of the other examples you mention. We all have to eat and all affordable food comes with baggage. And yea, we all need entertainment, but if we’re going to use our money and voice and time to enjoy an artist’s work I don’t think it’s so bad to prefer an artist who is enjoyable rather than one who wants us dead. There’s tons of authors and game makers. Tons of less awful people that would love to have 1% of notorious terf Jk rowlings influence and appreciation. Anyway yeah I don’t try to shame anyone either but I do try to avoid giving help and support to the most outspoken of transphobic voices
I have beef with the way OP came here just to gaslight us how Hogwarts Legacy situation isnt that bad. IN A TRANS SUB. When the author uses her power to belittle us.

That being said i agree with you. Its like the ""brush your teeth with a cup of water"" to save the planet. Effective step but then you have factories doing more damage in a hour than your whole lifetime. Who gives a shit someone pays 50$ for her game when actors could have made a statement by refusing to participate in her movies or studios not working with her on behalf of her transphobia. 

The sad truth is little can affect her. Shes rich, she has influence, she could get 0 money till her death and still live well.
Thank you for being the only sane person on this
I don't have to imagine it. Harry Potter was the driving force behind me not only learning to read but developing a love for fantasy. That's the hobby I'll be continuing.
you seem to forget that just about every trans person more than likely spent their entire childhood (and often more) as a gender different from how we identify now. part of transitioning is leaving that behind. 

“I’m invested in this” is not an excuse to continue supporting someone who is actively working to kill us. i do not understand how anybody would want to uplift a franchise that a) is already extremely problematic in itself, being riddled with antisemitism & classism, and b) was created by an awful trans-hating cunt.
Actually it is pretty easy to cut off childhood media franchises. You can just find something else. Attaching yourself to media that way is unhealthy and uncritical.

The thing is that most hobbies aren't harmful. Nobody who knits is going to be told they should stop because of moral complications.

But stories? There are millions of stories. If a story sucks, you can just find a new one.
I'm a black disabled queer trans person. There is no item I could buy that wouldn't directly victimize me or someone else. There is no item anyone could buy. Why do you only care about morals when the group you belong to is involved? You gonna stop eating bananas because Chiquita uses slave labor or nah? Also, I'm poor. Telling people their morals aren't in tact for buying things that hurt people when I can't afford to buy things that don't hurt people means I should just.. die? This isn't about just a game it's about everything. Imma stay silly, thanks.
Look at the end of the day the terf is never going to be successfully boycotted and she has more money than she knows what to do with(800 mil). The only thing I could see getting her deplatformed is if she went all kanye and attacked jewish people.

If harry potter merch makes OP happy then thats what matters most. The worst thing we can do as a community is drive a wedge between trans Harry Potter fans and the rest of the community. We are already a somewhat isolated group and I don’t want to see people get more isolated just because they like Harry Potter.
well it's turning your back on them is I guess what I wanted to say. it was a flow of consciousness and the correct word failed me at that moment and I unfortunately used one that has a trigger effect for many. Was a bit harsh. For this I do apologize. I don't edit, I should. Every penny counts ask any accountant. Can't have a dollar without a penny. Use the money for good, contribute it to fight the hate instead of fueling the demons of hate. Do you really need more stuff? Can't you borrow it from someone or buy a used one in a few months off ebay? Steal it? Boycotts work if you work them. Get supporters on board. Go make yourself heard like it's Stonewall. I don't like nor care for the whole genre, so no love lost here for JK to begin with, but I get people have a sentimental attachment to it and that is hard to let go of. That's the part that hurts. Like lost innocence.
If a horrible person writes a book, I don't buy it. If Hitler wrote a book say, and called it ""My Struggle"" about how he had to struggle to survive as a educated white person in a educated white person dominated world, and he put the blame on his failures on poc, the disabled, lgbtqia and any other marginalized communities that are easy to make scapegoats, and encouraged others to denigrate and belittle those communities, I'd be not at all willing to pay money to read it. I can't help it if joe corporate cheats on his wife and is mean to dogs. So I might buy his brand of shoe. Totally different things here. Apples meet oranges.
It's different when it's a cultural product that reflects the worldview of the creator. Utility products don't have that kind of baggage.

For example, if I heard a movie director was racist, I would indeed stop watching their movies.
Well it’s not about you!  You’re free to boycott something you’re against but it’s not fair for you to make someone else stop.  And it’s not directly harming you.  If ANYTHING, it’s indirect.
I agree it's not a great mentality but when a majority of people are thinking like this, it's kind of impossible to do anything about it.
I'm sure there's even some people buying this game who aren't even aware of how shitty JK Rowling is. They're just there to play the game and that's it. I doubt any reasonable consumer genuinely wants to support someone like JK. 

I think about this mentality from time to time and it can be applied to alot of things. For example, recycling. It's pretty good for the environment.
If I do my part, that's great. But recycling only really seems effective when everyone takes part. Is everyone taking part in it? No. But I'm not going to use that as my reasoning to NOT recycle.

I know comparing a game to something like recycling may seem silly but they are similar mentalities
You’re not wrong, but like…that’s never going to happen. Because like even if people decide to take a principled stance against this, which is fair enough there are still countless who either don’t know, or either are actively onboard with JKR. And that is fundamentally the issue at play here. Even if OP doesn’t buy the game they will be outweighed (most likely) by those who do, because it doesn’t matter what JKR says or does to them. Therefore, they will never face that ethical question, because either it won’t get to that point or if it does they may still disregard that, and argue that it is a fluke. My point fundamentally is that companies have no ethics, they will fuck over anybody and everybody for a dollar, and when they do they will foot the blame to the consumer such as OP.
If people are asking for opinions on whether or not it’s ok to buy it, I’m gonna give mine. I can’t actually prevent you from buying a game just because I think it’s morally wrong to do so.
That's not how development works. The developers have been paid what they are going to be paid. They do not get extra money based on sales numbers.

And by the way, the lead designer on Hogwarts Legacy is a massive misogynist and vocal supporter of gamer gate, the social movement that has bullied more than one female developer to suicide.
What on earth are you talking about, get out of here with that disingenuous nonsense.
The only intervention that happens in that case is when the thing being supported becomes illegal. A pro Slavery campaign would cease because Slavery is illegal. Places like the UK and America can't even seem to legislate hate crimes against black people or women to be illegal (or at least enforceably so) so the chances that discrimination against trans people because illegal enough that her estate can't support it anymore is very unlikely. By the time it happens, HP will be a distant memory.
That's not what I was saying, but I'll play your game.
Then the people who feed more money into this person by buying their products would be funding even more people to get hurt than would have if people stop funding this moron. It may stop eventually but the collateral damage of people who are hurt by this rhetoric will be higher.

What I was saying was referencing the the previous comment or saying it would be ok to buy her crap once she's dead because then she can't continue her tirade against trans people. She absolutely can continue her tirade if she sets up a foundation to do so.
I believe the goblins in the series are based off the folklore creatures from the Middle Ages mixed with dwarves from fantasy series like the Lord of the Rings, rather than the antisemitic caricature made to compare Jews to monsters and demons. Truly is disgusting what depths people have gone and will go to harm others
I don’t condone people buying the game, but I have to say I don’t think the majority of those buyers necessarily like her or support her views. They’re supporting her monetarily, which as I said I don’t condone, but I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that the game sales is indicative of people who love or respect JK. I’ve been in the HP fandom and spaces for years and transphobia seems pretty staunchly opposite to what the majority of them like and stand for, a lot of them even being LGBT themselves, like myself. But I understand I’ve only seen a tiny fraction. I think what you’ll see a lot of people saying is that they don’t feel like buying the game is directly supporting her, and more so supporting the game studio, etc. Or that there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism, or they don’t feel like them specifically refraining from doing something they’ll enjoy (playing a long awaited game) is going to have much of an affect on an already FILTHY RICH terf. I still don’t agree with buying it, but I think that’s what most people might say when you ask why they’ll buy a game that’s connected to someone so hateful.
Right, it's not a perfect 1:1. But still, the overall point remains the same, that people can be super needlessly toxic about this kind of stuff. People are acting like anyone that buys the game is a traitor who hates trans people and that $60 is a game-changer in spreading or stopping transphobia. I don't plan on buying the game and spending money on things tied to explicitly bigoted people doesn't sit right with me either, but all the in-fighting and ""no true Scotsman"" bullshit has got to go.
I'm so sorry if it came out that way. I definetly think it's a big deal or I wouldn't have asked. I know first hand how damaging her influence is. I thought this was the right sub since I wanted an opinion from people who are trans and not from some random people who are not affected by it. Could you please quote where it seems that way so I can edit it? Again I'm so sorry I really didn't mean to and if I sounded disrespectful in any way I would like to know
They probably don’t mean to gaslight, and are feeling conflicted about liking something created by a controversial author. That’s why they bothered making this post.

A lot of people who like Harry Potter don’t connect it with the author at all. I prefer fanfiction, so it’s easy for me to not support her while still enjoying it. But she still has the rights to it, so official products fund her on some level and I try to avoid that. My point is, the world of Harry Potter is almost completely separated from the author. You can appreciate it without supporting her. Actors in the movies disavow her, and substantial parts of the fandom does too. 

OP is struggling to decide how they feel and how they want to approach this, and are telling us how they’ve self-justified it. That’s not really gaslighting. 

And I think boycotting her product can have an affect. If everything related to her barely sells, her reputation suffers, and she’ll struggle to find companies to partner with. It’s obviously not perfect, but it does something.
You’re using the term “gaslight” incorrectly. What you’re calling gaslighting is someone presenting a view different than yours, that you find offensive. 

Gaslighting is when one person directly attempts to alter another person’s perception of truth or reality, with intention, on purpose. 

You can 100% disagree with their take, but this is not gaslighting.

Give me a break. That's reaching. You're equating life to just not support a video game because it's creator is a transphobe. The multitudes in which those two things are diffent are HUGE.
this is the worst mindset to have. “it’ll never happen so why not keep supporting her” is exactly the reason it will never happen
>Well it’s not about you! 

no, it's not about me, it's about the fact you and others are content with supporting a terf just to play a game. i know everyone's willing to abandon their morals for convenience or fun every now and then, but this is still annoying and i have a right to be annoyed. 

sure, it's not directly harming me, but that support given is still a bad thing that can and most likely will impact people whether you like it or not. just because something isn't impacting me specifically, doesn't mean i can't be mad about it.

and even then, indirect harm is STILL HARM.
>I know comparing a game to something like recycling may seem silly but they are similar mentalities

no i absolutely understand it

i just wish i could *make* people be better with this sorta stuff. it can be so infuriating
But at the same time, companies don't want most of the money, they're only Happy if they get ALL of the money. If a game doesn't meet expected targets, either from slightly less sales, reviews, etc then they'll be less inclined to produce more. It's already happened to their mobile games. The HP franchise is a behemoth on weak legs; it's creator is controversial, it's newest properties have been very weak and underperforming, and people are starting to see the commercialization of it the way star wars got when Disney took over. This game doesn't need to fail, it just needs to not succeed flawlessly for it to be a big hit against Rowling and WB. Companies aren't unstoppable. Voting with your wallet does work. Especially in the gaming sphere.
You didn’t . Whatsoever . You asked a question. Anyone who makes you feel bad is the problem NOT YOU . AT ALL
Laugh it off honestly
You’re not gaslighting anyone, you’ve been respectful and asked a genuine question. Don’t fret over it
yeah but also looking at hp from a contemporary lens it’s… fucking awful. it’s incredibly fatphobic and antisemitic, the transphobic snipes about rita skeeter are thinly veiled, and hermione was laughed at for trying to abolish elf slavery (which of course, they *liked*). plus harry sees all this shit happen with the ministry of magic and decides to be a cop anyway. like… i’m sorry, op & commenter. i really am. i am nonbinary and have a hp tattoo (that i now despise) from before the terf shit came out. but knowing what we know now i don’t understand how some of y’all feel okay with continuing to engage with this fandom. read another book! try rick riordan!
Who said anything about easy? Doing the right thing only when it doesn't impact you is easy. Interacting with this franchise directly contributes to JK's social, political, and yes monetary power. People are being asked to look critically at their contribution to that. And for many, that's too much to ask. Arguments like this, may make that more palatable, but no less problematic. At the end of the day, folks will do as their conscience dictates.
I'm saying my opinion applies to both situations. This convo is no longer about video games, apparently now its about ethical/moral consumption. I've shared my opinion and if you don't like it that's okay. If you haven't already, You will probably never have to experience something that would force that opinion upon you and I'm grateful for that. But I hope you stick to your own morals and stop shopping at every company that does business with/supports chik-fil-a. It's a long list. If you truly believe this, you'll Google it and make a long list of all the places you can't shop. If you believe in your own opinion that is.
I mean personally i dont buy any harry potter merch, but im not going to bash someone who enjoys it. Also J. K. Rowling is 57 years old lets say she lives till 90 god forbid, her net worth is currently 800 million dollars. She could blow 24 million dollars a year for the next 33 years. So yeah she is set for life at this point even if harry potter died off today. So yes boycotting at this point is pointless. 

And the most important thing we can do is stand together and support each other as a community. If we let stupid shit like who likes Harry Potter divide us then that’s only hurting us. There are literally people in the thread saying anyone who buys Harry Potter merch is a traitor. That’s not OK, that’s the opposite of supporting each other.
“Voting with your wallet” is meaningless nonsense. Either you will be outvoted, or you will end up voting for someone who’s a more covert evil than the original evil. The effect of one individual or even 1000 individuals is overall in the grand scheme of things irrelevant.
That's a lot of speculation on your part.
the opposite of supporting each other is giving money to the people trying to kill us, not saying “hey it’s okay that you’re giving money to people trying to kill us”
People like you are the reason we end up with shitty politicians because instead of using your vote you just whine and say ""whaaaa, voting doesn't matter!"" 
Quit being a pessimist. In this case ""voting"" Is literally ""do nothing"". Maybe OP can take a lesson in that from you.
And not enough on yours. You've only considered yourself. Maybe you should step into someone else's shoes for a moment and research/think about how hard it actually is to live in a way that *you* think is moral. Have a good day ☆
So you really just want to be mad at something even if it’s at the cost of some trans people. The world isnt black and white, there are gray areas. 

There is literally nothing you or anyone can possibly do to stop J. K. Rowling from donating to those shitty groups. She already has hundreds of millions of dollars. That fight is lost, it sucks but that’s life, Life sucks sometimes. 

If you want to not give J. K. Rowling your money that’s fine. But don’t give other people shit for enjoying Harry Potter. Because half the clothes in your closet were probably made by underage sweatshop workers that you supported. Fast food, thats made by criminally underpaid workers desperately trying to make rent. Bottled water is produced by companies who are stealing water from communities. You can’t throw a stone in this world without hitting A company or a person that takes advantage of people or has shitty beliefs. 

The one thing we can do, and it’s by far the most important thing, is stop the trying to make our fellow trans people feel bad about buying something as simple as a Harry Potter pillow.
Ok serious question for you…what sparked this change in topic? Like, nothing we previously were talking had to do with actual voting, like why pivot the conversation? As to the other things you say you’re correct, I believe that voting doesn’t matter. I fundamentally don’t believe that change can come from the ballot box, I don’t see that as being pessimistic though, I do believe change can and will come as that it is the eventual nature of things (although it’s not so linear as things just automatically change for the better, you have to work for that) I am optimistic in this belief. 

But again this comes back to the fundamental debate that exists within this conversation, your belief that the actions of an individual whether that’s OP buying Hogwarts Legacy, or my opposition to voting, has a fundamental impact, which is contrast to my belief that neither OP buying the game or me not voting has a fundamental impact because there are structures that exist outside of the action or inaction of the individual that impair that action from having any real impact. Fundamentally speaking, I have no impact on what politicians are elected or what policies they pursue, because I could vote in every single election for a candidate who best reflects my beliefs, but one of the following will occur: A. Not win because of money which stands in opposition to their election (I.e. Jeremy Corbyn is the best example I can think of), B. Win but not have the power to make any change because of the structures which exist outside of themselves, C. Win and become part of the structure they may have wished to change, and thus wish to maintain that structure (B&C is any so called “progressive” or “democratic socialist” within like the US), D. Win and then be removed by that structure outside of themselves (I.e. Salvador Allende).
Lol what do i have to research or think about? I'm literally talking about making a personal decision not to support someone who has a hatred for who i am/most people are here. Talking about the ethics of living in capitalism is a larger issue. That's not the conversation we are having here. 

I am all for debating/talking about that and i understand it's difficult to make decisions when you're not financially equipped to do so. I do. I've lived my whole life that way. But honestly there's no connection between what you're talking about here. Moral and ethical aren't the same thing.
your viewpoint is so twisted. nobody is going to die if they can’t buy Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy. buying Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy, however, can *and will* aid in the harm of trans people. Yes, i absolutely will give shit to any person, trans or not, for giving money to people who are a direct danger to the trans community. 

not everything is black & white, but this subject absolutely is. i have no interest in responding to you further as you clearly care more about your precious little harry potter than the lives and wellbeing of the people in this community.
Don’t waste your time on that child
This right here is literally the wedge driving I was talking about. I don’t even own anything Harry Potter related. 

The only thing I care about is not alienating other trans people. I’m not gonna get mad at a trans person for buying the stupid game. Because when you do that you’re the one causing the problem with that one person. You’re pushing them away because of something stupid. And now they have one less friend or community member to lean on. All because you want to be self righteous.
Just because it’s black and white to you doesn’t make the situation any less nuanced. Universal Studios has an entire section of a theme park for the Harry Potter IP, which likely generates more revenue in a day than this game could possible hope to make in 5 years. There isn’t an ethical way to consume in today’s capitalistic climate, so my recommendation to all is that if they must purchase or engage in said media, then match their money or time and direct it to organizations that support the communities that would be hurt"	zp0rci	trans	136	0.85	2022-12-18 15:12:58

Came here because there was nowhere else to go	"I'll admit I'm someone who can be easily shaken, which makes me a target, and I know that Reddit has a rather nasty reputation almost like a bleached version of 4chan, but I have nowhere else to go. Someone accused me of being a ""tucute"" (something I don't believe in, but for the sake of this I'll go along with it) because I'm not radical on my ""rules for trans people"". Because in all honesty, I don't care how others express themselves, it's none of my business and I was raised to be understanding.

I'm FTM and yes I have gotten backlash/threats of violence before but for some reason when other trans people are the ones doing it, it hurts way worse than anything. I'm not a public figure. I'm not an activist. I'm like the least offensive person on earth. I even present as masculine as possible, but it's still not good enough for them. It's never good enough until you want to vomit at the sight of yourself. And honestly, I do, but that shouldn't matter to other trans people online.

I'm sick of having to perform for other more strict trans people, I just want to breathe. I force myself to do everything I can, I work out, I'm searching for a job to fund my own surgery, I stay out of the way, and it's still not enough for them. I've spent so many years hating myself, feeling like I was some kind of sick monster up until I found out about the transgender community at age 11. And I finally felt at home. But even that breath of fresh air is being taken from me.

I know nowadays ""Trans cringe comps"" aren't as popular but I'm still even weary to go outside without the biggest possible coat on even though it's 80 degrees on the coldest day. Because I live in constant shame and hatred. I don't feel guilt, because I know I'm not ""faking"" my feelings. Despite it being expensive I do have a therapist, I do take accountability for the things in my life that don't include me being trans, and I do everything I've been told by professionals. But no, it's never enough.

I'm not taking deals for Disney movies, I'm not getting paid for this, and I don't get ""clout"" for being trans. Someone offered to donate to me and I can't even fucking take it because suddenly I'm no longer ""valid"" enough for any of you?. I don't give a damn about truscum, I don't give a fuck about any of this online bullshit, and I don't have any agenda to push. I'm just some guy. That's all I am. Some random nobody. But no, it's not the active anti-trans laws being put into place, it's not the fault of the people snatching trans kids away from their families, not the ""gay panic"" excuse that makes it fine and dandy to harm people you though ""tricked you"" or the police never doing shit about the lost lives of black trans people. Apparently, it's the fault of other trans people now. Because now you're ""one of the good ones"" you don't need to support your community. Now you pass enough for them so you don't give a fuck about our rights. You sold out, not me.

I get sick and tired of the narrative of transgender men are just ""uwu soft boy"" loving women that are trying to trick gay men somehow. I've had partners, and none of them have ever been disgusted with me or have had a problem with me being trans. I haven't even ever been rejected for being trans, and even if I were in the future I wouldn't give a damn. Because I don't want someone who doesn't love me to date me. That's like the common opinion so I'm not sure where this ""trans people forcing others to date them"" narrative is coming from.

Like I think it's funny how people treat less masculine trans guys like objects of desire to be gocked at and fetishized yet it's my fault for what?, just looking the way I do?. I'm not sure what the fuck it is you want from me but unless you're going to pay for me to be sent out to a camp in the woods where I bang rocks together and eat raw meat naked you're not getting much out of me anytime soon.

I like to work out sometimes, most times I wear attire that might be considered traditionally masculine, and I like to keep my hair cut short (even though lots of cis men have long hair, but let's be honest, you think they care how cis men present?). But sometimes, I like to have fun.

Part of me finds joy in Decora Kei, for for the uninformed:

***Decora (デコラ) is a Japanese aesthetic and fashion that revolves around an excessive amount of accessories, the primary focus being plastic hair accessories and bracelets.***

&#x200B;

[\(Examples of how this kind of fashion looks\)](https://preview.redd.it/shuwke3kt3e91.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f7500de765e50f3072a9f5a83b043c45633f1cb)

For some people, the idea that a trans guy could be interested in things like this sounds preposterous. But it doesn't to me, and that's what fucking matters. I'm both transgender and black and so the standards of how I'm allowed to present are narrow as hell. And I just want to express myself. Just one damn moment of peace.

The people in my life accept me, and my boyfriend enjoys my company, I was even starting to feel better since I felt I was getting way closer to my goals for my transition. But my own fucking community can't stand to see my happiness. It's like the second I stopped completely hating myself I'm not good enough for these people anymore.

So basically what I'm saying is, genuinely: What the hell am I supposed to do about like?, like how am I supposed to solve this.

Because it's eating me up inside."	"First off, \*hugs\*.  It has been my experience that there is a subsection of the population who derive their validation through unquestioned conformity of others.  Basically, anything that differs from what they perceive as the ""correct"" way to be is perceived as a direct assault/challenge to them and their belief.  ""live and let live"" does not make sense to them as they cannot get beyond their own insecurity. 

This subsection can be found across all demographics, gatekeeping who is and isn't part of their demographic, as they see it.  Worse is when they get actual power (management, owner, parent, politician, etc.)  

Next, it is a form of selection bias to perceive a whole community as sharing these individual's views.  These individuals vocalize their discomfort, whereas the rest have no real issue so see no need to say anything.  Worse, the ""live and let live"" philosophy discourages even calling out such behavior.  

I do not have a solution to your problem other than to suggest that the scope is smaller than it seems.  I still haven't found a way to ""reach"" such people so that they can understand what they are doing to others.  Empathy seems to be lacking from such people, but that could also be an oversimplification.

I hope things get better for you.
I feel you. The pressure to conform to the gender binary is strong even when you reject the basic rationale behind it. 

You're not obligated to please anyone but yourself. It might take years to fully accept and believe that, especially when everyone around you says otherwise. But with time, it will get easier. In the meantime, take whatever validation you can from trans-accepting spaces. 

I'm new to reddit myself and I know the reputation but there's some good spots here that seem to be reasonably well-moderated.
Unfortunately, there are always toxic people in every community. And I’m so sorry you have to deal with that, but just know that everyone else here supports you and I’m sure you’re so handsome.
Anybody who calls you a ""tucute"" probably isn't worth your time.
It's so annoying that we still have to deal with this BS.  Why can't people just understand that:

1. Other people's transitions are none of your damn business.
2. Rules about what hobbies/clothes/etc. counts as masc & what counts as femme are arbitrary social conventions.  Some men like one or more of the things society has decided are femme.  Some of those men are cis, some of them are trans.

If you're easily bothered by truscum stuff, I'd advise you to just steer clear of the parts of the internet where you're likely to encounter it.  I know that, in principle, silo-ing & information bubbles aren't great, but at some point you have to just prioritize your own mental health & avoid stimuli that are harmful.
I don’t know of anything that I could say to help, except that if you ever need a sympathetic ear, my dms are open.
I’m sorry that you are going through this kinda crap bro. I kinda get it. My interests aren’t super manly, and I’m ok with that. If you like decora kei, do it as much as you want! Be a bright pastel rainbow! F the weirdos who are trying to control your “man experience”. Everyone is different. You are valid.

May I suggest: r/ftmfemininity
I see and know what you're talking about, tho' I have a tendency to keep online communities at a.. idk, mental arm's length?   
I don't want to sound like I'm giving stereotypical platitudes, either; but quite honestly not giving too much a fuck what others think of you is my way of handling these things. It's not easy to do, of course, esp if you need that connection and community bc you don't have it around you IRL. But I know there's people in this world I won't ever get through to, they don't *want* to listen, so I have to just accept that and be done with them, and that part is my descision. There are other communities around, it can just be trial and error to find where it's most comfy for you.  
But like, *you know who you are* better than damn well anyone else. They can't tell you who you are, nor if you're 'enough', nor if you're 'valid'. Please don't allow them to, even if it's just in your own mind. A lot of people project their own shit onto others, and that's not your responsibility to deal with.  
I hope things can get better for you. You don't owe anyone else how you choose to express yourself. Isn't the point of transition to be true to yourself and work for that happiness? I think that's what some hyper critical people miss.
Reddit you can mostly filter out the shit, unlike 4chan. I'm mostly here for cute cat and dog pictures.
“True victory is self-victory”
-not my quote btw
To elaborate ones anguishes are naive in the sense that we think they are only our ideas it seems. On this bountiful blue rock with each possible hue of color possible it is up to you to define your own “fate” as it seems we have always had the tools to do so maybe we just need to open our eyes to see ya know!
Best
TMl
God that sucks, if it makes you feel any better I’m ftm and I like decora too.
i do not have the time to read all of this, but from what i’ve gathered: you do not have to conform to whatever “norms” trans people set up. although i am mtf, i’ve suffered from the same problem (although not to this extent) and i think i understand what you’re going through. you need to find people who will support you for who you are. you may never be good enough for the entire trans community and thats ok. keep being you, and find people who will support you for that. if they don’t, they don’t deserve you. stay strong man!!
The biggest issues we as progressives (in general, not just lgbtqi+) is that we can't help from attacking ourselves. It's why we struggle against the conservatives so much because they don't really infight and generally stand unified despite there being many many more of us than them.
Not sure what I could offer other than what I did; drop everyone and focus on you. (And by everyone I dont mean your supportive friends and family). Just... disregard them all. Idk if it's because I'm 33 but something like 10 years ago I decided that no one can be pleased and you're always going to be pissing someone off. I'm trans female, but I don't identify as trans female, I consider myself just a queer girl. My partner is trans male and he openly identifies as trans male. He calls me his wife and I call him my husband. THIS ALONE is enough to piss off like 3 different groups in 3 different letters in the rainbow. I've been hated on for ""perpetuating heteronormativity"" just for not being openly trans and having what looks like a ""straight relationship.""  Or that I'm dismantling queerness by calling my queer partner my husband rather than just the gender neutral ""partner"".

Tbh if I were you, I wouldn't want to be friends with people who are that focused on queer perfectionism. It might feel like you're missing out on some big party or belonging to a community but honestly they are stressing themselves out being so tightly wound about things that can ultimately be deemed redundant. Its crazy because it's been weird to watch the community shift like this, we went from being about love and acceptance to criticizing our own kind for not being (x) enough. 

When you think about it, we are becoming the same thing we fought against in the first place xD. 

""You cant do that! That's for girls!""
""You can't do that! If you do that you're not really a trans guy!'

Both sound literally the same to me. Wtf happened?

This is easier said than done but try to ignore it, focus on the people who support you for who you are entirely.
That sucks. There's a lot of useful advice in here. Whole reading your post I just thought of a study that I read.

It concluded that people who had insufficient care and attention from parental figures in childhood (including me, yay!) will have a higher degree of seeking validation from external sources in adulthood, rather than the healthier alternative, which is internal validation.

Now how to get there, I'm not really sure. Personally I try to accept that my opinion is also that of a person and my opinion of me is valid.
Thank you for understanding and acknowledging where I'm coming from. It's been a long night and I've had to take multiple painkillers to soothe my headache and get to bed. It's nice to have someone really listen. I don't think I'm all that special but I know that there's a chance I'll be put in a trans cringe forum for being soo upset about this. But all I really want is to feel comfortable with myself.
Well said. I'm glad you wrote this out so well.
It just gets soo stressful constantly trying to please people who are purely for binary people only. Some part of me wants to understand why these people feel the way they do, but at this point, it's at the expense of my own self-love and happiness. Like I'm being open-minded but at what cost
Aw, thank you for the support. It's greatly appreciated
What is a “tucute”? I’m not really familiar with the term. From context, it sounds like the opposite of a transmedicalist?
I didn't even think people were still on this, I thought we all left it in 2017
I try to, and I don't actively go looking for it. I have someone who helps me with my transition and such but people online don't know that. They're basically asking me to air out all my personal business regarding all that I'm doing to transition because THEY believe what they've assumed I am in their own minds. None of these people know me and it shouldn't matter to me but it still hurts for some reason.
Thank you
Thank you! I really needed that after yesterday. Really rough on my physche.
Thank you, I'm really trying to stay in the right spaces but it's really hard to stay away from ""those"" places.
I'm mostly here on accident, I was just on Google looking at pride flags for research, and one picture linked to a...let's say, less than pretty, subreddit, I ended up in a very dark rabbithole.
Whenever I meet someone with similar interests, it's a pleasure
It just doesn't make sense to me, there are real threats out there yet people like this only want to find the most nonproblem ""problems"" to blame. It feels like there's nothing I can do to combat this, I grew out of this self-hating phase myself but I'm not equipped to teach others. I'm not a debate guy, I'm an artist. I don't know what they expect from me or people like me.
> From context, it sounds like the opposite of a transmedicalist

You nailed it.
I see ""tucute"" as meant to demonize rational and empathetic trans people for being rational and empathetic towards other trans people.
The only thing you are is ""TooCute"" don't worry about it we love you
Yeah I'm similar, not so much with truscum stuff, more with vanilla transphobia from cis people. I basically don't go near the Opinions section in the Guardian anymore, because even seeing a headline about how my existence is the cause of abortion bans & I'm a rape threat to cis lesbians spoils my mood for the whole day (even without actually reading the article).
One day a few years ago my cousin showed me r/IdiotsInCars and here I am now lol.
Lol, I assumed there _had_ to be more than that. Of course it doesn’t mean anything beyond “you aren’t working hard enough to exclude people from the trans community, and that’s a problem for me!” 🙄

Y’all I just took off my bandages to change them for the first time after my top surgery and… 😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭	That’s all. I just wanted to share that joy. Pics to come when I’m all healed up!	"Congratulations! This might sound weird but I recommend eating lots of pineapple/or drinking pineapple juice as well as eating tomato soup. Both help reduce swelling and the tomato soup especially for me was a life saver.
Congratulations dude!! I'm so happy for you. My surgery is on the 14th and I'm really looking forward to being where you are now. I hope the rest of your recovery is smooth!
You can now fit between bars so you dont have to walk around fences at restaurants
Congrats!!
Congrats!!! I know how it feels!!!! Good for you 🎉🎉🎉
I’m so happy for you!!!! <33
Ooo good to know!! Thank you
Best of luck! Even with the pain of recovery (which is nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be) I feel amazing!
😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks :)
Thanks! It’s AWESOME
Thank you :)"	r7q4di	trans	121	1.0	2021-12-03 04:13:04
I took my daughter to her first gender affirming haircut yesterday!	"And it was amazing!  The stylist was amazing, she just about cried when she found out this was her ""first haircut"".  My daughter is just glowing now with joy.  She got face framing layers and a deep conditioning treatment and all sorts of great beauty supplies for her hair, as well as some pink dye I'm going to apply for her.  

I'm so so SO pleased and wanted to share with people who would understand and be supportive.  I'm not sharing photos because I don't think she'd be comfortable with it.  She's having so much unhappiness about her body and how she looks and to see her happy and pampered was the best."	"So great to hear, you are a great mom!
Good parent!
This is wholesome
You are one of the best mothers out there, I assure you! You’re doing the best thing you can possibly do for your daughter and it makes me really happy to know that there are parents out there who help their transgender kids. Thank you. :)
You're amazing. I'm looking forward to my ""first"" haircut, but I'm also super nervous because I've been growing my hair ouyr for a very long time and don't want to end up with something that I don't like and ruin it. I know it's hair, but I never said it was a rational fear. Good for your daughter! I'm glad she's happy 😁.
I am so so happy for the both of you! Keep being an awesome parent! :D
Thank you for sharing, this was a heartwarming story. Happy for both of you, stay strong and beautiful both of you ❤
Awesome support.  So many here are left on their own.
All the compliments are so sweet, but goodness I wish supporting our trans kids was the *norm*.
We were very clear with the hairdresser we wanted to keep her length and requested that she show us some photos first.  I wanted to make sure she didn't run into that problem, so we didn't do bangs, and went to a hair stylist who was recommended.

I did end up spending over $100 to go to someone good but my partner helped cover the cost which really helped. 

I hope your ""first"" cut is wonderful!  And let them know you're nervous!  ❤️
Thanks! That's really encouraging. Bangs are what I'm most nervous about. I think you've convinced me to go with something safe at first and maybe when I'm feeling more confident about it, get bangs (if that's what I end up wanting). After all, I've got a ~few~ more haircuts left in my lifetime.
Bangs are Commitment.  You have to keep up with them, and if you don't like them you have to go through growing them out.   I HATED growing out bangs (it can be done though, hairclips are your friend!

The face framing layers she cut in are super cute, and will grow out ok if you don't like them, or don't get cuts every 8-12 weeks.  I'd suggest asking about that, or even looking that term up to see if you like it (I just learned this yesterday, lol!  I get my looooong hair trimmed straight across at a cheap place every few years, this is new territory for me too!)."	k10ivq	trans	121	0.98	2020-11-25 20:46:50

My AMAB wife came out recently and I’m struggling to know what to do	"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My long term partner recently came out and I’ve definitely not handled it the way I ever thought I would. It really sucks feeling like I’ve not been able to support in the way I’ve always talked about that I would if it was the case. In short, I accept her as she is. I don’t want to end our marriage. I have no desire to convince her otherwise. 

I’ve always tried to be supportive of trans friends and I’m definitely not perfect. But this time I feel so strongly. I’ve been breaking down in tears whenever I’m alone, I’ve been experiencing the worst depression symptoms of my life and I don’t want to say anything to her because she’s already going through so much, coming to terms with this within herself. And I don’t want to take away from that. I love her with all my heart and I want her to experience joy in who she is as she deserves. 

I suppose I’m here because I want I to hear about situations of other trans people who’ve been able to stay with their long term partners and how they and their partners handled things early on. Maybe to help me feel a little less horrible of a person, but also maybe to help me realise I need a lot more therapy to understand what I’m experiencing here."	"Coming out saved my marriage.

At the time, my wife and I had been together for 15 years and married for 8. We were highschool sweethearts and all that adorable stuff.

I was a miserable shell of a human. I was deeply depressed, emotionally stunted, easily angered, and so withdrawn from the world around me that I'm honestly surprised that I wasn't suicidal. I was finally coming to terms with the reality of my life and something needed to be done before my entire world imploded. It took me three days of intense personal effort to finally be able to come out to my wife. I was a complete wreck. 

But it went well. My wife, who at the time was working on understanding her own sexuality (thank god she's not straight), was immediately accepting. She truly knows be better than I know myself and wasn't entirely surprised. Her primary goals were to get me/us in to therapy and form a long term plan and to make sure that I was ok. I was not ok, but we worked on that. We spent countless nights up far too late just talking. I began the long and arduous process of tearing down all of the walls I had built to shield myself for decades. I worked hard to be open and honest with myself, my wife, and an ever-increasing group of friends and family who know me for who I really am. 

I came out to her in December 2019. Since then we've grown immensely as two individuals and as a couple. This is a process that will be neverending, but at this point I can say with certainty that my wife, as always, is my rock and we are stronger than we've ever been before. She pushes me when I need it and always reminds me to strive to be the best person I can. I made her a promise nearly two decades ago that I would love her forever. Three years ago I promised her I would be a better wife than I ever was as a husband. Those are two promises I intend to keep.
Check out r/mypartneristrans ! Most of us are on the other side of the table here, but they'll do right by you. From my side: if you can, do small things to support her. Dont stress about your initial reaction too much. t's a big thing for both of you! & good luck :)
I came out to my wife in March 2021 (We'd been together since 2016 and married since 2020) and we are still together and are going strong. We are actually expecting our first baby in May. But we definitely had a lot of work to do to get to where we are.

I think my biggest advice to you right now would be to validate that your feelings, pain, and experiences matter too. It is great that you are being mindful of her but our partners often get overlooked or can feel cornered or labeled as ""unsupportive"" if they do anything other than fully cheer us on. It's okay if you aren't there yet. It's okay if there is a part of you that wishes things could go back to ""normal"". Those are valid feelings to have. I think one of the most valuable things early on for us was that my wife found people and places where she could work through these feelings and not feel judged or bad for having them. Ultimately she ended up in a place where she realized it was entirely her choice and what she wanted for her life and she decided that she was happier with me than without me.

Also one specific problem we faced was what we've deemed ""trans overload"" now. I was learning and exploring and so excited early on and naturally wanted to share that with her. I'd want to talk about videos I'd seen or memes I found on reddit or other things about being trans. It was a lot for her while she was still working through things on her end and we had to have a talk and I outsourced some of that to a friend for a bit to give her some space. You two could be in very different emotional and mental spaces for a bit and that is okay.

Ultimately I think it comes down to clear, consistent, and careful communication. Fundamentally working through this isn't that different than any other issues you've worked through as a couple. 

Happy to share more if that is helpful to you.

Also I'll second r/mypartneristrans
Sounds to me that you haven't been able to fully comprehend and adjust to the sudden news.
 
That's understandable, The person at their core has not changed, how they present themselves and their overall temperament and mood will change hopefully for the positive.
 
 I suggest seeking therapy, sometimes it's better to have a third party professional help work things out and to reach an understanding.

I think this is overall good for both of you, a home is meant to be a place that you can be comfortable being yourselves, and now that your partner has come out they feel comfortable being themselves around you. 

What they need to do now is give you some space so you can adjust, while also attending therapy together. 

I know you can do this, most people do not go onto a trans subreddit or look for information on transgender-based sites if they're troubled with the situation and are thinking of bailing. 
 
 Clearly you're a very strong-minded person, who wants to keep what they have going strong. Despite the fact that life has its hiccups, you got this. 

Keep on keeping on.
I think any big change can cause grief, anxiety, uncertainty, even if you're also excited and happy and supportive.  

It sounds like you have amazing communication and trust if you've talked about this being a possibility for a long time.  And being supportive, still attracted, and still in love also bode really well for you I would think.

Let yourself have whatever emotions you're feeling. Feel them. Own them.  There's no ""right"" way to feel.  There are better and worse ways to act, and things to say, but you feel how you feel.  If you feel like some aspect of it would feel unsupportive to your wife, then process that part with your therapist.
I'm one that got kicked to the curb and lost everything. I just admire you for staying with her and doing your best to support her and your union. Much respect to you both.
I just came out to my wife in the past year, and it’s been an adjustment. It takes time. In my case we’ve been together a little over 15 years, and it feels like she’s losing the person she fell in love with. She knows this isn’t true, but convincing her heart has been difficult for her. She’s been nothing but supportive, but I can tell she’s sad some times even if she still loves me with all her heart. I think it will just take time, over all to truly accept it.
My wife and I have been together for over 24 years, married almost 18 years ago. I came out to her a little over 2 years ago.

Realizing I was trans, that I was really a woman was a huge surprise to me. It was very deeply suppressed, and when it broke free, my coping mechanisms shattered completely.

I made it 10 sleepless nights until I told her. She could tell something was wrong, and I could only blame work stress so long (which was true, we own a small business together).

I was stunned by her reaction. She told me that it was unexpected, that it was surprising and kinda exciting!

Turns out, she's pan, and she's just gotten more and more attracted to me. Physically, she misses ""him"", but she really loves and is attracted to me. Mentally, emotionally, we are much closer and stronger. We were pretty stable and good before this anyway.

We both got therapists. After about a year, my wife stopped going to hers, she realized she was talking more about her work stress than my transition. I'm still seeing mine about once a month, more to keep the record going incase I need any referral letters or any medical thing like that.

Transitioning has been tough for us both in a lot of ways, but its been good in a lot of ways as well. We both mourned 'his' death, and that first year of transition until I came out publicly was tough. We both broke down crying a number of times. But, I feel like our love has deepened.

I hope you're able to find happiness in yourself and your partner!
My cousin came out to her wife and family, and while I’m sure it was difficult at first, they have gone from strength to strength, and I’d say they are all much happier now. 

Here’s her story as told to the local news:

https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/14099214.as-a-man-he-was-angry-but-he-turned-into-a-happy-mum/

I’m delighted for my cousin, she is so much more comfortable in her skin, so much more settled and just… herself. Her wife also seems to be more confident and if anything more in love with her than ever. I really think this was the thing that they didn’t know was missing, but it all fell into place when they became aware, and when they got to grips with exactly what it meant for them. 

I’m sure it was a period of real uncertainty as they wondered and worried what else might not be as they’d expected, and that led to questions about their relationship. For them it appears to me like it settled any questions of compatibility as their relationship was proven as so much deeper than they realised. 

Good luck. Whatever happens, being true to yourselves is the most important thing, everything else you can weather.
This is so hard, to be honest, talk to a therapist not Reddit.
Don't call her your ""AMAB wife"" for a start. AGAB language is just a fancy way of misgendering people.

Also the sub someone linked you is OK sometime, but it really focus on the lived experience of cis partners, often by demeaning their trans partner. It's common on that sub to have people come and just misgender and trash their partner and expect support.

I don't really understand your problem in your message, since you also said you were pan so attraction wouldn't be a problem, but if you're looking for trans people experience and words, r\mypartneristrans is not the best place at all.
When I discovered myself, I knew I had to tell my wife right away. Despite having a conversation a few years back where she said she would probably leave me if I came out as trans. I just couldn't live with myself anymore just pretending to be someone I'm not.

She doesn't remember that conversation, and thinks that I'm remembering it incorrectly. Her reasoning is she still absolutely loves me and adores me, and being trans doesn't change that.

That said...there have been hurdles.

We had a discussion about sexuality. I declared myself as a lesbian, but she still identifies as straight. How does that work? I'm her ""exception"". Love that defies gender and sexuality.

There was also the freshly hatched euphoria bender. I wanted to do all the things right away. New clothes, makeup, prosthetics, name change...everything. I was a massive pain to deal with. A kid in a candy shop just bouncing from one thing to the next. We had to have a conversation about my excitement and to set realistic expectations.

There was also the matter of me coming out to the world at large. I wanted everyone to know, but at the same time I was scared shitless of telling anyone. She stood by my side and helped me through it, one person at a time. Except in the case of my parents, where I had such a severe panic attack that she offered and did come out to them on my behalf.

We both ended up getting personal therapy and couples therapy. I had to calm my tits and realize that my trans-ness wasn't the only thing in my life, and my wife had to realize that I needed time to rediscover and explore myself before I settled into a something more predictable. We came up with safe words and tokens for when one of us was being unreasonable or needed to chill out. We also devised mental health safety plans.

These days I'm still pretty excited to be trans. I'm discovering new things all the time, and my wife gets excited with me when I show off. ""Hey look! I went up a cup size!"" Or ""Check it out! I've gotten good enough with makeup you can't even tell I'm covering a beard shadow!""

My wife, without flinching or hesitating, will casually mention her wife to other people. She doesn't give a shit if they assume she's gay. She has my full permission to explain if needed. I'm out to the world.

Our sex life did suffer for a time. A combination of my dysphoria and HRT drained any urge I had for a while. But then my wife decided to move a bit out of her comfort zone and try some new things (nothing wild). Her act of validating our new reality and acceptance that I won't do certain things anymore (at least, not without a lot of alcohol) actually revitalized our sex life to a state that is more active than it ever was. 

She helps me out, mentors me in things I wasn't able to pick up on while pretending to be a man, and shows that while this is uncharted territory, she's willing to explore it together with me.

All in all, the best advice I can offer is to remember that you're not losing your husband. You've always been married to a woman, but now that mask has fallen away. She's still her, but now she's free to grow as a person rather than waste away.

Her gender does not dictate your sexuality. You are not a bad person for being confused and scared of this new reality.

Love will get you through these feelings. Just give yourself time to adapt.

Also, check out /r/mypartneristrans , my wife says that sub helped her out a fair bit.
I don't think I really understand the issue? 

UNLESS . . . did she identify or "" present "" as male when you two were together and you're just not attracted to women?

Or is that not the issue?
It sounds like you are going through grief for your relationship, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. You have been in a relationship with a man for an extended period of time, and have adjusted accordingly to that dynamic. Now the dynamic has changed, and you are still processing that. It is completely natural to grieve for what was, while still embracing what will be. Even though your partner is going through her own stuff, don’t be afraid to talk with her about what is going on with you too. She is probably very worried about you and how you are coping with the changes, and she is probably scared that you are pulling away from her (even though you feel like you are trying to protect her from your feelings). This is the best time to come together with your communication with each other and get a better understanding of each other.

When I finally realised that I was not a man, I struggled with the same issues, and my wife went through the grieving process as well. But we kept talking and leaning on each other for support, and we have grown closer to each other because of that. One day she realised that even though she was now in a queer relationship, that we were still US and not something that she needed to worry about. It took her some time to accept, but she got there and we are stronger now than ever before.
Be gentle with yourself as well as each other. She has had to work through a lot of the things you are, in a way. She also knew first and went through a decision making process. You sound amazing, as does your marriage. Just don’t endeavor to be perfect. Follow her example and be genuine. Your attitude and commitment, as well as her trust in you, is moving.
Hey, try not to judge yourself for your emotional response. This is a huge mental shift that you haven’t had a whole lot of time to process yet. It’s okay that your emotional state is in “adjustment mode” & prone to processing the chemicals that come along with those emotions through tears. 

You aren’t secretly a bad person because you need some time to get caught up. It sounds like you are a loving & supportive partner.
Sometimes coming out helps a marriage sometimes it just can't continue. Some people just aren't attracted to their partners true gender/ or different look. And that's okay too, but it's probably worth a try to work through it together. 

It's important for both of you to take the time you need.
It can be really shocking to learn you partner was always different from what you thought.
And after you take the time to let yourself get to terms with it support her as a partner if you can or as a friend.

I've seen transitions while having a partner work out best if both parties are involved in the transitioning process and (so the SO sees how happy the transition makes their partner). And if both of you take it slow. So the SO, especially if they aren't originally attracted to the new gender expression, can have some time to adjust.
I think, as someone who is trans myself and has had friends, family, and partners come out to me, it’s understandable to have a wide range of emotions towards a loved one’s transition. It’s new, it’s scary, and a lot of times, it’s really hard to retrain your brain to see this person you love for who they see themself as. Especially if you aren’t trans yourself, it can seem like a sudden change, whereas, perhaps for your partner, they’ve struggled with these thoughts for a long time, and have lived with it. Sudden change is scary, and sometimes you come to mourn who that person was to you. That’s okay! You still love and accept this person, while still having to learn who this person now is (maybe that doesn’t make sense, lol).

I think it’s very brave and mature of you to consider therapy; I’d get your partner included! Couple’s therapy is a great resource— especially if you can find someone who specializes in these types of situations, should such a specialist exist! Having someone who you and your partner can talk to about all of these changes is a really good idea in my opinion.
One thing that really stood out to me when my partner came out, is that I have always loved her feminine qualities even before we knew she was a woman. Your wife is still the same person you fell in love with. At the same time, obviously you’re going through a lot of emotions rights now and need to give yourself space to process. I don’t know if she is ready to come out to others, but you could ask her about you speaking to a trusted friend to process your feelings, or find a therapist. Good luck!
I came out to my wife and started transitioning about 6 months ago. Roughly 2 weeks before our 13th anniversary. In our relationship, we've had our struggles over the years and started putting a lot of effort into ensuring good communication. So when I came out to her, we sat down and just had a conversation about it. Emotions were high, obviously, and we both sat on the couch crying together but she just asked me what I wanted. If I wanted to start using preferred pronouns and name immediately, assuming I had a name picked out, or if I wanted her to continue as is while I adjusted and came to terms with myself. She is the only person who knows so I opted to continue with my given name as to not have slip ups near friends/family until I'm ready to have that conversation with them and we use more gender neutral terms for now. All she had to do and all I wanted her to do was talk to me about it and accept me. You don't need to do anything, grandiose. Just make sure she knows you're a shoulder to lean on when anything starts to weigh on her.

Tldr: All you really need to do is be there for her and make sure to keep good communication going. Just make sure she knows it even if it feels a little awkward to out of nowhere say, ""Hey babe, just to let you know I'm always here if you need to talk about anything.""
Hey friend...Nothing changed...You still love her.  The only thing that change is that she's happier now...You just continue to support her.  And there's nothing wrong with understanding you need therapy to process your emotions
I came out as non-binary to my straight boyfriend 5 years into our relationship. Living openly as me, having open conversations about my identity only helped strengthen my relationship, and helped my partner consider their own identity. One year later my partner now identifies as queer and agender.

We still get things wrong sometimes, sometimes we slip up on each other's pronouns or labels (we're human and we're both still learning as we go). Although we make mistakes, we still love each other and are each other's biggest advocates.
with my girlfriend and i, i know a big thing for her when i came out was she was stuck on ‘mourning’ who i was, when in fact that didn’t change at all. she was thinking that i would change as a person and she was only focusing on the changes that transitioning would bring. it was a hard time, and a hard topic for us to speak about, but she eventually realized that me transitioning didn’t change anything about me… it just made me more me
I came out to my wife about a month ago after putting it off for 10 years… just from knowing her for so long I knew that she wasn’t “open-minded” and can be rather judgmental sometimes. 

I finally got to the point where I said to myself “I need to tell her, I can’t keep hiding this secret anymore and I need to be myself and she needs to know who I am.” I built it up so much in my head and was VERY nervous to say the least. I honestly thought it was going to end in divorce when I told her, but people surprised you…

Her response at first was along the lines of “you don’t like men, right?” As she wanted to make sure I would stay with her no matter what, you could have knocked me over with a feather! I kept the first conversation short and told her if she wants to talk about it or has any questions that I promise to be 100% open and honest with her. She was in some initial shock, but 3 days later I brought it up again by saying to her “thank you for accepting me and still being with me”. Her response was “We’ve been together for 10 years, I know you better than anybody and I already figured it out, I’ve just been waiting for you to tell me.”

Honesty I wish I would have told her years before, she is more than accepting and has started calling me her wife (which I really like). She has been loving and accepting, our marriage has never been stronger. I think if you love someone enough, you can make it through anything and come out stronger in the end.
My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. The first 3.5 years I was not out and not pursuing a transition. It worked for us because he’s bisexual with a preference for men (I’m a trans man). There was definitely some confusion on boundaries, comfort levels, and the effects of hormones. I had him attend my HRT appointments in the beginning so we could be educated at the same time by a professional. This helped with any of his concerns (he was worried about the potential negative side effects of T such as liver or heart issues prior). He really let me take the lead for a while in creating a “new normal” for us. We’ve truly never been happier or closer. Sexual boundaries were confusing for a while as I went from allowing him to touch my chest to some days not being able to take my binder off in front of him. As corny as it sounds I do feel like real, genuine love and understanding is enough to get you through this transitory period. 

We aren’t married yet, but planning it in the next few years (we wanna wait until we’re out of undergrad so it’s less stressful to coordinate). He sees me as I am and I feel so fortunate to have such an amazing partner. 

I will say, if you’re not attracted to women, it probably will not work out great & it would be best to have an honest and fully open conversation with your wife. You sound really caring and I truly hope the best for you and your wife.
One thing I've heard is people can go through a mini geriving process since the person is changing. Not everyone does. 
But it's awesome your supportive of her, not everyone is 😊
Came out to my spouse a few months ago took him a minute to grasp what was going on but he’s on the other side now and supportive of me. I think it’s made our marriage stronger and I think it will get even stronger because now I’m not lying about who I am and I can feel completely vulnerable with him and I know he feels that. I say get some books do some research go slow get curious about her and what she’s going through. Her seeing you put this effort in will make her feel seen. Take it slow it’s a journey and it can be beautiful to see and understand your spouse in their authentic self.
Thank you for your story. And I’m so happy to know your marriage is stronger than ever now. 

I hope you’re in a better place mentally as well.
Wow, that is almost my same story. Just had our 20th wedding anniversary and this November will be 30 years together. We got together at 15. 

We were heading for divorce because I could not live being male anymore but figured she would not have me as a wife as she never questioned her sexually and only has been attracted to men. So I tried to bail. After she would not let me go I came out to her and we have never been closer and happy. She supports me now more than I ever supported her. Life is better.
Almost the same story for me and my wife, similar time frame too but I cracked in 2021. It's made our marriage so much stronger and happier. I'm happy for you and your wife. 💕
Thank you so much! I certainly will hop over there!
Thank you so much for talking through this. And congratulations on the soon to be new family member! They are going to be so lucky growing in a family full of love. 

I really appreciate the validation. It’s been so hard to feel like I am allowed to feel this way, because the logical side of me knows nothing about our situation has to change. We’re staying together, our love for each other hasn’t changed and all that. But I’m still feeling so many things and not all of them good and it sucks! She’s so special, and I don’t want to hurt her with thoughts that I know I don’t truly believe (like that she’s one step away from leaving me). 

I think I might be experiencing a bit of the trans overload. I definitely have no issue with helping her buy new clothes, helping with body hair, or advice with things like electrolysis or make up. But perhaps that’s confronting me with my own thoughts about my femininity. Guess that’s another topic to raise with my therapist next time!
Thanks for your reply! I think you’re right. We’ve talked about the idea of it the entire relationship but the shift from a concept to reality is definitely hard. 

Fortunately I’ve been seeing a therapist for a while and she’s already in on the situation. We’re looking for another referral to a couples therapist as well, since I think having that third party to be able to hear and read into what we’re saying will benefit us a lot. We’ve talked about that and we think it’s a good idea. 

I definitely have no intention of leaving my wife. She is my world, and I would absolutely do anything in my power to help her be her best self. More therapy for me, included! 

I really appreciate the words, seriously. Thank you ❤️
Thank you so much. I think I really needed to read something like this.
I am so sorry that was your experience. You didn’t deserve that for wanting to be your authentic self. I hope you’re in a better place, and that you are surrounding yourself with people who love you as you are, not just what they expect you to be.
Thank you for your reply. This is close to what I’ve been struggling with too. I’ve been trying really hard to be patient with myself since it’s a change for my life too, but I just wish I could bypass that feeling of grief and mourning. 

I know, as I’m sure your partner does too, that a joy of this is that we get to now learn about and get to know this wonderful person thats been locked up inside for far too long. And that is exciting in itself.
This is really nice to read. Thank you. And I’m so happy to see so many cases of peoples relationships deepening, but reading about you both breaking down and crying a number of times is probably what t relating to best right now. Knowing you both had that experience, but you’re stronger together now, is really reassuring to me.
I mean I am also talking to a therapist. But I feel there’s value in hearing anecdotal stories from other people as well.
I only used it as a way to make it clear that my wife is the person who is trans here, not me. I’ve never referred to her as anything but my wife, etc. in any other instance. 

Other replies here have been absolutely wonderful and I’ve appreciated the lives experiences to help me process my own. Perhaps my main point is just that I want to know that other relationships that have gone through this, weren’t just perfect in understanding and processing. And I’ve seen that in spades, which has been an absolute pleasure.
She had been presenting as male for our entire relationship. We also have a young child together. I’m also pan so attraction isn’t an issue. 

It’s more just… wanting to hear from people I think, to feel less anxious about my reaction. The other comment about the other subreddit was awesome, for example! I didn’t find that myself!
It’s very true, she is working through a lot too. She’s been reading heaps, struggling with the idea of being “allowed” to do this and everything else that I’m sure you’re well aware. 

Thank you, I definitely need to stop trying to be perfect. I want to be there in whatever way she needs, and I know sometimes she has a hard time articulating what that is.
Thank you. I’m definitely a heart on my sleeve type of person. I feel my emotions really strongly and that can be hard for my wife. 

Thank you for your kind words too, it means a lot to me.
That’s beautiful of you both. It sounds familiar as well, my wife has been working through deciding what she wants with pronouns etc. 

Thankfully we have good communication. But it’s definitely hard to keep having such strong negative emotions over something I know I fully support. But we’ll keep working.
Yeah, the logical side of my knows all that is true. But the emotional reaction has been rough. I usually try to learn more about the situation, when I have things like this, and this has been such a delightful journey. All these responses have given me a lot of hope.
There have definitely been some major hiccups along the way, but I am *undeniably* in a better place now
Thanks! 💜

The femininty thing is real. My wife still finds it a little odd from time to time that I tend to skew more femme than her on average now. But it can be kind of fun too once you get used to it.

I also let me wife know to keep an eye out for your other post so she might be able to share some views from the other side of things with you there.

I think you are doing an awful, awful lot right so honestly just keep doing what you are doing and I truly believe your best days are ahead of your family.
Femininity is a weird thing. It's different for absolutely everyone! It's really a good thing you're having to assess your own because absolutely every person should put in a bit of effort to understand their entire being. It makes us better, stronger people.

My own femininity is definitely out of the ordinary. I feel more feminine pulling a welding helmet over a ponytail than any other time. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that!
Thank you for that :)

I get along with my ex and will always love her for our beautiful children. I love her and her new husband together now. I think they're great together. I found peace in solitude, as much as can be found anyways. My ex always knew I was female inside and she's supportive as much as she can be now. I admire your heart and your love for your lady. I hope you two find what works. This can't be easy for either of you.
Thank you so much. I’d love to hear from her too. But truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

I believe that too. She will be able to finally share the beautiful person I’ve been able to watch grow over the years, with the world. And I’ll get to know even more of who they are and who they want to be. And our child will know that their true self is all we ever want them to be. Just as yours no doubt will as well 💖"	11z2cha	trans	110	0.94	2023-03-23 00:19:35
My dad finally began to accept me as a daughter ♥	"MtF, six months into HRT. These past six months have held more joy and meaning for me than the past entire twelve years of my life combined, and my previous depressed, neurotic, constantly-anxious demeanor is almost nowhere to be seen. Whenever I get dressed, I care about what I'm wearing now. When I see my face in the mirror, even with its fair share of dysphoric facial stubble that I can't ever get fully rid of, my heart sings and I think I look cute instead of repulsive. I even got my legal name changed to Akari and I literally have never felt happier.

Thoughout all this, Dad has been considerably less enthused. He's always claimed ""all he wants is for me to be happy"", but it had always seemed tired and half-hearted. His response to seeing me in my black mesh and frills was ""hope it's everything you wanted"". His response to my name change was ""I'm glad you finished your task you set out to do"". My elation at my progress seemed entirely irrelevant to him up to now.

But last night is when I felt like that's starting to change. He came into my room last night and said something that made me kinda start to cry-- he said that he's ""noticed how much happier and more lively I've been these past few months, and that he's genuinely relieved and grateful to see that"".

He added that he ""still doesn't understand why I would transition, or what I hope to gain out of it, but that he's glad I went through with it since it's been such a positive thing"".

And he referred to me as Akari!! It is the first encounter we have thus far had where he hasn't forgotten not to deadname or misgender me.

I was so shocked and touched by that that I got up and went ""here you get another one"" (I had hugged him previously when he came home from work that night) and just squeezed him as hard as I could while tearing up

I told him I love him and am grateful to have him \>\/\/\<

Another thing he said was that ""all his life that he's been a kid, and a teenager, and an adult, there have only been two genders in his world view and the world view of everyone around him"" (he actually did reference native-American two-spirits as well as Thailand's kathoeys as examples that this has been around longer than he has, and acknowledges it-- my dad is extremely scholarly \^\^), and that for him this isn't a five-foot step away from before, it is more like a leap across an entire city, but that he's getting there and starting to see that it's something to value.

I really love my dad. Even my mom, who has been even less kind about it (the line ""god gave me a son, not a daughter"" will always stick in my head-- my dad is very anti-religious so his was really just more pragmatism). Even if the whole rest of the world would accept and validate me, it wouldn't mean nearly as much if my parents never would. So I \*needed\* this. I'm so happy. It finally feels like my dad has my back through this, even if he doesn't completely ""get it"". And I'm more than happy to talk with him and help him understand further.

For everyone still struggling to be accepted by their families here: stick with it. Talk to them, be open, as much as you feel comfortable. Do what you can to meet them halfway, with patience in your heart. Obviously everyone's situations differ, but I truly believe Love Conquers All in the end if we allow love into our lives and interactions, despite generational world view differences."	"Thanks, Akari!! This is such an uplifting story. I’m having some similarities difficulties with my extended family and your story gives me a bit of hope.
This is wonderful, Akari. I hope your mom sees how happy you are as yourself as well
You're never alone.
Well unfortunately she thinks most forms of happiness are just sinful temptation and thus anti-god, which I'm sure applies to gender euphoria as well >_>

Her hatred no longer holds power over me, though
Thanks."	ovd50y	trans	104	0.99	2021-07-31 19:15:19
Today I took a picture and for the first time in almost two years I felt joy. I cried some of the happiest tears in a very long time! 🥲❤️		"Happy tears are the best. Since coming out I’ve been surprised by how much stronger emotions feel. This is before HRT so when I start that in a month or so I’ll probably be a complete emotional mess. Can’t wait 😂😂😂

You look beautiful btw ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🌈
very nice
beautiful 💕
This is a really beautiful photo. So much feeling in your eyes, made me tear up
You look like a targaryen. 
Please do post a pic if you ever decide to cosplay for game of thrones.
You look magnificent.
Thank you so much! Also congrats on the upcoming HRT. You’re going to do amazing! 💕

To the woman at work today who complimented my eyeliner…	You don’t know it but you brought me more joy than I’ve felt in a week with the four simple words “I love your eyeliner” you made me smile from ear to ear and I had to walk away quickly after thanking you because I was about to cry. You made me feel seen. it’s been hard for me recently, I have not been kind to myself the last few days. However laying in bed at 11:53 you’ve made me feel a bit of hope remembering your kindness, so thank you it meant more than you may possibly ever know.	"I remember a few months back in work being told one of the women in work said my makeup skills were better than hers and that really made
My whole week 🥰🙌
now your making me cry 🥺
I’m so happy that you had that experience. It reminded me of a time a few years ago when I was in such a bad place. I went into a coffee shop and a young man commented on how he loved my nails. I wasn’t even presenting at the time but it felt so amazing.

I know that this is so cliché but things do get better now. I’m much happier now living full time as my authentic self. Since coming out, I have experienced that same sort of gender affirming interactions on a weekly basis. It helps SO much. It amazes me just how important gender affirmation is.

My son came out to me as trans today!	"First let me say I am so happy he felt comfortable enough to tell me! Honestly one of my proudest moments as a father. I almost cried just out of sheer joy that he felt safe enough to tell me. 

I also still don't know exactly how I feel about it. I know I am happy for him. I am happy he knows what he wants and how he feels. I am happy he told me. On the other hand, I am terrified for him, also for myself. This is a tough world for anyone, but even moreso for the LGBTQ+ community. Parenting is hard, I barely know what I'm doing with my kids now, how the hell are my wife and I going to navigate as parents of a kids transitioning? He hasn't told my wife yet, but they will both be at home together this weekend while my other child and I are on a daddy-daughter camp out, and he plans on telling her by then. 

Also, if I am being 100% honest I am a little disappointed. I know it's selfish, and I am only disappointed for selfish reasons. My fantasy of the man my son would grow to be has now been altered drastically. I am still excited to see the person he will be. 

Help, I need help. I need advice. I need insight. I need to be the best parent for my kid, whoever he or she turns out to be. 

TL/DR: My son came out as trans and I need help/advice."	"From your post it sounds like you might have a daughter? Non-binary child? I’m going to refer to them as your son because that’s how you have so far but I’ll switch if you do too. Did your son say they were trans and that they’re a girl? Did they say? I’m just wondering mainly because as tricky as it is, it can help to try as soon as possible to start using their pronouns and referring to them as the gender they’ve told you, and don’t get too hung up on slipping and ‘getting it wrong’. It’s a massive deal and a big thing to get your head around as a parent and it takes time. Especially as your child has likely understood this about them for much longer than you have so you’re sort of automatically ‘behind’ and it can feel like you have a lot of catching up to do.

Congratulations and I’m glad you’re supportive, you sound like a lovely dad. 

If you’ve got Netflix, have a look for a documentary called ‘Disclosure’ - lots of parents I’ve spoken with have found it quite helpful in some way, it’s different for everyone, but it could be worth a try.
First of all- hi! Welcome. It's ridiculously sweet of you to reach out and try to learn and seek support.

Please note that I say/ask this with no rancor- am I correct to understand that your child wants to transition to present as female, to match her gender identity? If so, may I gently correct you to say that your \_daughter\_ came out as trans?

In any case, the only thing you really need to do is love your child and support them through this process. Try to learn as much as you can, and \_communicate\_ and \_respect\_ them. If they ask you to use a certain name or pronoun, do your best to do that. If you slip up, it's OK; we all make mistakes. Just apologize and do better.
Okay so lets get a few things sorted out here. Its clear your heart is in the right place, but its going to take you time to figure this out. Just as much as they are changing so will you, and it is going to take time. And as you see them change im sure your envisionments for the future will slowly change too. Its overwhelming but keep in mind how much more overwhelming this must have been for your child. 

But for now the best thing you can do immediately is stop misgendering them. If they were your son and they came out to you as trans that means they are now your daughter. So stop referring to them as a he. They are a she. Its going to take time for you to adjust, but respecting her wishes for her name and pronouns means a lot to us trans folks. It shows acceptance and helps us feel like our selves. Also don't refer to her past as being a guy/your son. They always were a girl, they just didn't necessarily know it, didn't feel conformable enough to correct you, etc. 

As things progress you should check in on her and make sure you know what she needs from you or if you are doing anything that upsets her. Communication is super key here and it can be hard for trans people to always come to others about it. They were comfortable coming out to you today, but that doesn't mean they always will feel 100% confident in the future, so be sure to remind them its safe. 

Overall just try to be a wonderful human being, beyond the role of a parent, and you should be fine 🙂
Make sure you don’t keep misgendering her because even tho your heart is in the right place, it’s still hurtful. 
Anyway, welcome! ♥️
Just as a heads up, I know you are new, and seeking advice, but you should start referring to her as your daughter now.  It will take some getting used to, but it shows you are really trying.  Don't get upset if you make a mistake, just correct yourself and move on.

It is totally understandable to be going through a little bit of grief about this.  My advice is don't tell her that.  I'm dealing with this now as my child is working through non-binary, demigirl, trans.  I have no idea what that future will look like, but I'll be damned if I let people treat my kid they did when I grew up.

As for navigating all of it.  Love them.  Roll with the punches, and remember the only way out is through.  It won't always be easy, but letting her be herself will be the greatest gift anyone can give their kiddo.
I really love how proud you are of her❤️ you’re a great father :)
Just be supportive, from what it sounds like your son is a trans girl. Be respectful and above all else do your research. Learn about the struggles of trans people, maybe lurk on this subreddit for a bit. 
Your child has probably known about this for a few months at the minimum, and have probably put a lot of thought into it.
In the future they may want to start HRT, otherwise known as Hormone Replacement Theropy. Include that into your research as well.
Also, you sound like a nice dad, stay that way. The world has enough asshole fathers in it.
I think you are an incredible father! Give yourself some space. I also think it would be good to be honest with her about what you are going through in a loving way. Just the fact that she could be so open is a testament to your great relationship. Way to go, dad!
Just keep trying and be the loving father you obviously are. Respect their pronouns and just be there for them.  Assuming since your child is AMAB (assigned male at birth) and being trans you might want to start educating yourself on the medical side and finding a good gender counselor for them.  Be careful, some will not be supportive and create roadblocks, so do your research well.  I would avoid religious ones if your family leans that direction.  Again, remember your support and love will go a long way.  Hugs do as well.
I’m another parent of a trans child here (my AFAB teen came out to us as trans last year). I’ve spent a lot of time reading, including a lot of subreddits like this one.

When we weren’t sure yet, I used the gender neutral “Elder Spawn,” and still do occasionally when we’re around people he’s not out to yet. Those are getting fewer.

There will be some challenges in the family if it’s anything like mine. While all the surviving grandmothers are trying their best to use new  pronouns and name, the surviving grandfathers refuse to try. Not to discourage or gain sympathy, just giving an example of some things you may face.

If you want to talk, feel free to DM me. Not that I have any special insight, or anything, just a friendly ear.
Just try and be there to listen for them, they are going to need it
Just being respectful, loving, and accepting already puts you ahead of 90% of parents out there. I understand it's hard to absorb the changes, but give yourself time, you WILL get accustomed. There are many resources out there for parents now, a therapist specialized in gender would probably be a lot of help for you and your wife, as is also YouTube (I presume). 

Thank you for being kind with her, it's more than a lot of us can hope from our parents.
Being trans is hard. Suicide rates are 42% which is the highest for any minority i believe.
Take good care of them and let them know you are always there for them. Also ask for pronouns since i believe you misgendered them quite alot here x)
1 respect your child. Respect how they want to appear and be named. In this entire post you're misgendering them, which for many trans folk, is one of the worst ways to bring on depression. Assuming they are transitioning to female, you need to get used to saying she and her and daughter. 

2 be prepared to defend your child. Yes they can defend themselves but as a parent you need to show them.you are a rock in their corner. Trans people need way more stability than cis folk on account of this is new and not widely accepted.

3 keep all that selfish talk away from them.
 This would be like dropping a nuke on their personality and probably the fastest route to them not transitioning and being set up for failure and/or suicide. The last thing a trans person needs to hear or know is that their transition has let someone down!

There's tons more but that's all i have time for right now
Thank you! Thank you for replying. He (as of right now) hasn't told me quite what to call him yet. We haven't gotten that far in the conversation. Just that he is trans. He hasn't always had the easiest time talking about himself and his feelings. He probably gets it from me, I'm a feeling bottler. I just want him to be happy, and more so I want him to be happy with himself.

I'll definitely check out Disclosure with my wife once he talks to her. Thank you for the kind words and advice.
Thank you and you are correct. She would like to present as female as far as I know. We haven't had a deep talk about it yet, but plan to.
I want to specifically address your disappointment, which I think is natural and totally understandable. We all make plans and have dreams for the future, and sometimes we're surprised and dismayed to discover that those plans and dreams go away. A lot of parents experience real, actual grief in a situation like this.

I think a lot about grief- my own father died when I was very young. For me, the only thing I truly grieve is the loss of \_his\_ dreams and his future. I don't grieve for the man I knew, because he'll always be there in my memories.

When a child transitions, *I think* there is nothing to grieve, because there is still a future and still dreams to be fulfilled. Indeed, there's something to celebrate! If your child is trans, it means they've spent their whole life until now uncomfortable in the world, and in their body, and they are fulfilling a lifelong dream to transition into a body that matches the inner person they've always actually been.
Thank you. This really helps. I know I have a lot of learning to do and I appreciate candid advice.
Thank you. Our family unit is not religious but the rest of our family is and we live in TX so I know we have a long difficult road ahead of us. Thank you for your advice, it really does mean a lot to me.
Thank you for that. There is a good possibility I'll take you up on that DM offer. Until such time do you have any good research resources you would recommend?
Thank you. It really is encouraging having the amount of support from this community already.
Makes sense, and I read your other replies and totally understand why you started with male pronouns.

I'll reiterate that the two things that really matter are communication and respect.

And, you need to start dreaming about the woman your daughter will grow up to be, now that she's free to do that. =D
I'm also a parent of a trans kid and this is absolutely spot on. At the time she came out to me I went through a moment or two of what felt like grief but now looking back from two years on it was more like a realignment of my assumptions, and a lesson that her hopes and dreams are hers, not mine, and my job as her mum is to support and love her no matter what.
Im sure you will do great! You are off to a better start than most parents honestly. Some take years just to accept their kids or stop thinking its some phase for attention. Take everything one step at a time and remember this community is always here to answer your questions! 😄
Mostly I just wanted the cultural understanding that reading this, and other related subs, provide. The little things, like etiquette around pronouns, terminology, things that bother or support.

I also started to look for binders based on recommendations here and some standard google searches.

My home church also is quite liberal and the priest was suggesting youth camps and gatherings designed to support queer youth, so that’s another possible avenue.

As for transitioning, that’s such a regional thing. My province has some resources, and I have a good friend who is an indigenous two spirit auntie to my kids. She has been a big support as well. My doctor is also queer, and was almost excited that our eldest is transitioning. Though she has helped others with their transition before, she has never been with a patient through the entire transition before.
Thank you. While we haven't talked a whole lot about the subject the one thing I keep reiterating is that I want to be there and I want to respect who he or she is. I've asked about pronouns and he isn't quite sure yet himself/herself so for now we are not changing anything, also my wife doesn't know yet. Again thank you for taking time to reply, thank you for supporting me while I try to be as supportive as I can for my child.
For sure. I think he (*he*, since he hasn't asked you to change yet) is lucky to have a parent as supportive as you.

If you want to more understand what he's going through, something like [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) might help. (It helped *me* immensely, but I'm trans and so I identify and resonate with an enormous amount of what's in there. I don't know how much it lands for someone cis trying to understand the trans experience.)
Thank you I will take all the help I can get, especially if it can help me understand his experience better. Truly, thank you!"	qm6ju5	trans	97	0.96	2021-11-03 22:53:39

Friendly reminder to all of Us.	"Gender and personality are 2 separate things. You can like/do/be anything regardless of Your identified gender. Just because 1 thing is typically ""male"" or ""female"" You can (and should if You like it) always be imterested in what brings You the most joy."	"Thank you! Needed that. It's strange, I mostly relate to mtf tomboys but I don't now how to feel feminine with boy clothes as I'm pre everything. So I started wearing skirts which bring me joy somehow and now I'm even more confused xD.
This is really important for people to remember.

This is something that conflicted me when I first came out and was part of the reason it took me as long as I did.
I'm mtf and style wise I love being feminine, but outside of that my hobbies are violent video games and masculine underground rap music. 
For while it made me feel like an imposter untill I remembered there are cis women who love those things to, and we don't think twice about it.
I think these thoughts stem from the stigma around us, I felt compelled to reject things that don't align with my gender out of fear others will think im not genuine about my identity.
Yes! I've been noticeably trans since I was kid, and even when I started learning to sew it was a ""man"" task in my head because I was doing it. I've been sewing for almost a decade now with no plans of stopping, hell I'm picking up knitting and crocheting on top of it. I get so much enjoyment out of fixing clothes and making blankets and puppets that it doesn't matter to me that's it's a ""feminine"" thing. Hell the most hardcore thing I did in highschool was walk around sewing patches onto my jacket in class, just sticking the needle into a spot when I had to switch classes. I've gotten so many compliments on that jacket and my sewing skills that people give me bags of clothes with holes in them for me to fix.
So annoying seeing the classic ""Is skating for women too"" question. Of course it is! Anyone can do whatever the heck they want, as long as it's not maliciously hurting other people.
Yep, im a trans woman and i still fucking love monkeys lmao
Yes! As long as it's not harming You and/or others, You can do whatever You like. : D"	ukdihe	trans	97	1.0	2022-05-07 13:39:29

What does euphoria feel like to you?	I've seen lots of descriptions of joy and excitement, but I think for me it's always been more... comfort? Or maybe relief is better. Like taking off your work clothes after a long day.	"That's valid and i feel like that sometimes too : ) but sometimes i also have those moments of extreme Joy and i can't stop to smile. Sadly it's also like this the other way around : /
For me its just being less stressed, although sometimes i just start vibing for no reason other than euphoria(and also get a urge to hug EVERYONE, and no im not on hrt yet ;~; gotta wait a few years)
I've had different euphoria responses. I've had times where it is a mix of happiness and anxiety, to the point where it was almost manic panic. That was when I was more unsure about being trans. Because I was happy, but also fighting through layers of repression. Every now and then I euphoria that is a little spark, or a flutter in my heart, like when ever I'm out and the waitress says ""ladies"", especially if I am not trying hard or if I am feeling particularly unlady that day. But in general, it is a sense of comfort. Wearing the clothes that feel right, living how I want to live, it just makes me feel more at peace.
It feels like realising you’ve been wearing wrong fitting clothes your whole life and you finally found something that fits
Girl euphoria: A bubbly feeling from my heart to my stomach, the sense of ""This is real, I can do this, this feels good.""

Boy euphoria: Relaxation, protected, the sense of ""I'm safe, everything's still where it has been, I haven't lost any part of myself.""
Peace/excitement, it depends on the situation.
Looking in the mirror and seeing a cute girl, smiling and feeling good with my image, instead of looking in the mirror and feeling my face melt like a wax model. I guess euphoria feels like jigsaw puzzle pieces snapping together correctly after several hours of trying and trying and failing
I'm a programmer and it does feel like finally solving a bug or issue after trying for long and losing all hope. It's like that... relief, happiness, and even a sense of accomplishment.

Sometimes I get so much euphoria I feel like I want to cry.
I believe I can’t really feel such a thing, possibly because I’m still suffering and recovering from a accidentally self made disconnect from most of my emotions, if I were to feel such, it would probably fix such a disconnect from the rest of my emotional states.  But it would most likely need to be very powerful to do such.
Guess the most common feeling of euphoria is the absence of dysphoria. Just feeling normal
I think it's the same for me; if it's in a public setting or I'm out with friends and something happens to give me euphoria, it's a sort of comfort or quiet happiness - in the way that it also eases me slightly since I'm always sorta anxious going out in public 

and then sometimes when I'm alone and i get euphoric i can't stop smiling, can't sit still and get a bubbly feeling in my stomach :)
Euphoria for me feels like when you wake up on the morning and your in like the perfect spot in bed where your at optimal comfort, but then if I get euphoria from like looking at myself in the mirror in a nice outfit it’s more like feeling hypnotized or
Mesmerized, like the way that I see myself now may be fleeting and addictive so I gotta soak in this situation as much as possible
To me it feels like a rush of happiness and a general state of serenity

Sadly it usually never lasts long enough to have an actual impact
Sometimes it's squealing and hopping around because you're just so excited you can't sit still. Like when I first got my binder, I biked home as fast as I could and put on my favourite dress shirt and tie and I couldn't stop bouncing around and smiling. But sometimes it's like that quiet smile when you're in awe of something, like the first time I passed to a group of kids. And sometimes it's even quieter than that, just total peace, when you realise how much happier you are now and how freaking good you look in that shirt.
(Insert old grizzled cowboy voice)......euphoria?.... euphoria for me is like a warm hug from your mother on a cold winter day. It's like you're in a dark mine and see a candle off in the distance. It's sharing that special dance with your partner. Euphoria is life and if you aren't experiencing it, you aint livin' it.
Definitely comfort for me. My friends even just calling me by my preferred pronouns is so euphoric to me
Comfort in my body & peace of mind
Most of my day I feel numb and struggle with an inner voice that’s calling me crazy and stupid and a fake. When I shave, put fem clothes and makeup on, and look in the mirror it all fades away like I’m looking at who I’m supposed to be. I get what you mean by a feeling of comfort.
Like a drug. Great as soon as you get it but afterwords it makes you feel empty as you go through your day. As soon as you get it you need it to be happy.
Freedom.

I feel free. I don't feel like I need to hide anything. I feel relieved, and free.
It took me awhile to narrow down what euphoria was for me...because I eventually realized euphoria is never just one thing, even for just one person!

I get euphoria when a little tingle runs up my spine after rubbing my smooth skin

I get euphoria when I look at myself in a new makeup look or a new piece of clothing and can't suppress a smile

I get euphoria when someone calls me ma'am, sis, lady, etc and I feel like a feather for hours

I got euphoria today talking to the nurse at my endo appointment when she praised how absolutely girly I look and that she can't even see the masc features in my face even when she looks really hard, that euphoria came in the form of me bawling in the chair.

I got euphoria in the car later when I looked down and saw black spots on my jeans and realized it was my first eye makeup cry

I get euphoria when >!I see myself fully dressed up and get really horny and realize its because of how GIRL I look!<

.

Its such a range of reactions, going from a small internal happiness to an outward gush of emotion or intense feelings of attraction.

If you think about it like this, I think you'll find you experience euphoria a lot more than you realize
Euphoria feels like something coming up from my stomach/ chest to my throat and out my mouth. I feel lighter and I will flap my hands. That’s a weird description but that’s what it feels like for me.
[removed]
To me, it feels right. It feels like I understand something that’s been plaguing me, and I can address it and it brings me a sense of comfort.
I haven’t experienced much euphoria recently
The happy feels of getting fem clothing, products, etc
I put on a dress and it was like being stuck on an puzle because you lost the last piece then finding it again. I have finally smiled for no other reason than that I’m happy. And looking back all the memories of wanting to be a girl that I had repressed due to bullying(my parents where always supportive, but The other kids bullied me for my name and once when I whore polka dot leggings to school) came flooding back and it all made sense.
I was going to say relief too before I even got to the word in your post. I don't feel euphoria as much as relief. i'm on the waiting list for top surgery and even just getting directed that way was such a relief.
Uncontrollable happiness. Can’t help but smile dumbly and feel good
When I was first gendered correctly it was joy and very much excitement. now its just neutral ""like yeah this is WHAT is supposed to happen"".
It feels like a dream come true. Like, I can wear a skirt and nobody judges me. Best feeling in the world.
It feels like how I imagine the colour yellow to feel. I know that sounds weird but it starts in my chest then spreads through out my body and then I’m just.. happy. It feels like I’m glowing the colour yellow, and it’s my favourite feeling
I think i just experienced it on accident; everyone you know reacting with love, your wife/partner waking you up cuz she went shopping for you, finding that *one* outfit, being en femme for days... i;ve never experienced it before and have never felt so elated.
Euphoria for me was I felt a huge explosion of happiness, satisfaction, relaxation, and more all at the same time. It's a great feeling, hell one of the best of my life, something I just can't describe in words though.
Like I could take on the world.
for me its sort  of like the feeling of rightness if that makes sence, this is imposible to exsplain
Feels like being in love with my true self
Relief for sure. Kinda like you go all day with people slightly mis-pronouncing your name, no matter how much you try to correct them or avoid it. Then bam, someone pronounces your name correctly. Not only does it feel right to you, but you have the relief at not trying to correct them, avoid the mistake, or just accept the constant mistakes people are making about your name/who you are. 

It's different for euphoria by yourself, but that's the analogy I use for when it comes to interacting with other people.
A strong feeling of self? It feels like there is a spark inside of me and it makes me feel alive in a good way?
It feels like a warm, buzzing feeling throughout my body as a replacement for the itchy, cold pain that dysphoria makes me feel
Content, comfortable, and at peace for some cases, but extremely overjoyed (so much that it lasts a week) in other cases.
An uncontrollable smile and desire to squeal at first, but then yeah just a bit more confidence as that kinda tapers off
I don’t do hard drugs. Too old, no interest, too afraid, and I’ve watched enough TV to know that it ends badly. Im not able or brave enough to transition to full time (socially or physically). That being said, when I achieve euphoria from expressing myself as a woman, I can literally stay up until 5am. And on a “normal” night, I’m yawning at 9pm. The problem for me is that I only have the opportunity to achieve “euphoria” once or twice a year, max. So when it happens, it’s like what I imagine a binge of hard drugs to be like. I know it’s not healthy but that’s my experience.
The uncontrollable smile is it for me
i usually have dance parties in my room when i put a skirt on. Didnt think that was euphoria before. Might have been?

I think that's what people generally mean when they say it in this context. Finally being seen as who you are must be so euphoria-inducing. I grew up in a place and time when being trans was still not even considered a thing (except as a deeply fringe thing that was looked down on) so maybe it's generational thing too. younger people probably trend towards having less internalized transphobia too since there's actual support now.
I once wore a bra and got so happy by the way it looked and my mom straight up asked me if I smoked weed hahaha

What an incredible look!!!"	lxzcfx	trans	81	0.98	2021-03-05 00:14:29
Finally felt cute for the first time!	"Hi! I just wanted to gush about my day. For context: I've been on HRT at 29 years for about 7 months? Levels aren't perfect yet though.

 I got out of the shower and was brushing my hair, and all I saw in the mirror was a cute ass girl. Not stunning or magical, just like kinda workable? I think I actually jumped for joy. I was thiiiisss close to actually taking a selfie. I actually looked at myself with the camera and didn't physically cringe at my own face. Just not ready to show my face to the world. 

Honestly though, it was an amazing experience. I don't think I really knew what the whole euphoria thing was about until today. A year ago I didn't even think I would ever reasonably pass, but I'm very excited for my future. I'll need some serious makeup skills though :P"	"Omg this gives me such hope to read. I just started HRT last week. I’m in my mid-to-late 30s and was scared and sad cuz I thought that maybe it wouldn’t work but whenever I read something like this, it fills me with joy.
I feel ya there, hun. When I got my hair dyed and my knee high socks and sleeves came in, I felt sooooo much better. Still not on HRT, but I'm hoping I'll get the same feeling you got. I actually did manage to take a mirror selfie of myself recently, but I still cringe at how I look like. Anyways, I'm rambling xDD I'm happy for you :))) ❤❤❤
Yeeeessss! HRT isn't magic, but it makes me feel magical. I'm so excited for you! Lmk if you have any questions, you're gonna be gorgeous.
Oh! What color did you dye your hair? Also what do you mean by sleeves? They sound like something I want lolol
Thank you so much!!!! I needed to hear this today. I did have one question: I’ve been on it for going on 3 months and can swear I’m getting boobs. I actually noticed ina couple of small ways: looking from the side in the mirror, and when I jumped the other day my chest bounced a little more than I seem to remember it doing. Also i think my chest looks more femme when I wear more femme or low cut shirts. Is it possible that this is happening this soon do you think?
I dyed my hair purple, and it looks so cute :)) needs to be redyed soon though. 

And this is what I'm talking about by sleeves:

https://dl.wish.com/yFkqD 

I ordered some and they're amazing! So cute and comfortable, but I wouldn't order off wish unless you're fine with a 2-3 month delivery. It comes from China.
By about 3 months I was starting to get very sore in my chest. I don't know if any growth occurs before that, but you WILL notice when it happens. Your nipples will be extremely sensitive (not in a fun way, in an ouch way), but the length of time will vary per person I think. It's also possible you may never have any soreness at all. I know some cis women that had 0 sensitivity and pain through puberty, so it's always anecdotal.
Oh those are cute! I have some mono-colored knitted ones that make me very happy. Your hair sounds cute too! I actually bought some stuff off of wish (that toooootally doesn't fit me yet) and their entire...everything is so hit or miss. Thank you for sharing with me, I love talking to new people.
love talking to new people too :))  I love Wish, but yeah, it's pretty hit or miss."	m3blv3	trans	80	1.0	2021-03-12 06:21:28
Thoughts on how our society views being trans, have they created a new box or us?	"Anyone else feeling like there is a lot of pressure these days to justify why you want to transition? That there are a lot of roadblocks that have been intentionally created to discourage you from transitioning? Now that I'm accepting myself for who I am, I feel like I've been lied to in so many ways by our society. 

Just wanted to post up some thoughts I've been thinking about recently and see what others think as well:

1. It feels like society is so scared of the imminent destruction of the gender binary they have constructed a narrative that there must be something ""wrong"" with you that requires you to transition. They've also been out there using this word ""detransition"" to signify some sort of failure and trying to scare people away from exploring themselves. What if people want to transition because they think there would be great joy in the experience, not that they're trying to escape something? What if people want to transition multiple times in their life? What if being in one box for your entire lifetime isn't really a great fit for people? Are cis people so threatened by the fact that a lot of our society might actually want to try transitioning if there weren't so many aspects that were looked down on? 
2. I'm starting to think that the body I was given at birth is beautiful, when I was never able to feel that way before. I still have a lot of dysphoria around my masculine features (MtF AMAB) but I'm realizing that society might also be putting a lot of pressure on me that intensifies this dysphoria. The fact that people won't accept that I'm a woman unless I follow certain medical procedures, act, and dress a certain way is constant weight in my mind. The stress of having to perform femininity to justify myself as trans is almost as exhausting as it was when I was previously performing masculinity. What if there is nothing wrong with my body? What if society can't handle redefining what it means to be a woman and just wants me to conform to the box that already exists? It feels like there is another narrative being constructed that I won't ever be perceived as a woman and somehow that's **my** problem to fix not **theirs.** Fuck that, why do I have to fix your unrealistic expectations? Let me live me life and accept me for who I say I am.  


Needed to get this out as I process all this, would be curious to hear if other people are experiences similar things as well. Love to you all, we are special and beautiful in each one of our unique experiences 🏳️‍⚧️❤️"	"I’m not transitioning for society or “them”, I’m doing it for me.  It doesn’t matter what other people think.  Sure I want to be seen as a woman and not harassed for being trans but I am trans.  I can’t change it and I won’t stop transitioning just to make my life easier.  I wouldn’t have started HRT in the first place if that were the case.
I'm really feeling #2 here. I spent my entire adolescence assuming I couldn't be trans because I wasn't in constant abject misery.
 
As an adult I'm closeted at my job of nine years. My friends are mystified by this. They say it's absolutely obvious that I'm trans, and they have no idea how my coworkers haven't picked up on it. But in my experience it's really easy, because unless you out and out say something, most cis people will just assume you're just ""eccentric"". 

The only real downside is that I'm occasionally mercilessly hit on by older butch customers, and it's real difficult to tell them they're barking up a masculine tree. Or in one instance I got... pretty substantially catcalled by a cishet woman while bending over, and the nametag with my deadname threw her for the largest loop of her life.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like a lot of people see me for what they want to see, and that trying to convey ""the truth"" feels almost moot.
I think transition and trans identity should not become a box that cis society can trap you in. It’s a tool created by our trans elders and passed-down through the generations. Use it as a hammer to reforge yourself and become stronger. Use it as a rope to create bonds and hold your community together. Use it as a weapon to dismantle the harmful aspects of gendered society.
2 makes sense to me. Sure it looks decent-but not for me.
Social construct in my opinion is changing but we still have a long ways to go. Society still sees us as mentally ill and corrupting those around us, but this is changing as well. The lgbt community is becoming more accepted and open. The process and rules we have to follow just to affirm our identity seem restrictive, but I'd like to believe that they're hurdles that help to protect people going through transition. 

Most if not all of the procedures we go through, surgeries, hrt, or even just coming out can have serious permanent effects on an individual. If not handled with caution we can do serious damage to our lives both socially and physically. By having all of the gender affirming hurdles we do,  they can (in my opinion) prevent us from making a decision without fully thinking through all aspects of that decision. The worst thing someone could do is rush into a procedure just to realize they didn't think it through and now regret their actions.

>I feel like a lot of people see me for what they want to see, and that trying to convey ""the truth"" feels almost moot.

Ugh yes, it would be nice to be accepted for how you see yourself, but sometimes that just becomes so much work. People don't want to accept the truth and outside perspectives
Wow thank you, I needed to hear this!
>corrupting those around us

Yes, THIS   


I don't think medical procedures should not be taken lightly, but I also don't think it's good to actively try to discourage people from transitioning with/without procedures. I guess I'm more frustrated with general sentiment in society right now where they say ""think of how bad this could turn out"". Rather than ""your life has other options than how you live it now"".
Totally!! In some ways it's chipping away at the economic power that countries have. Dwindling populations aren't great for higher GDP. In addition, being able to set clear gender roles makes it easier to dictate people's role in helping build countries, governments, and economies."	skiu2n	trans	75	0.95	2022-02-04 17:19:52
Mom always wanted a girl	"Nearly my whole life, my mom has told me about how happy she was when she found out I was going to be a girl. She said she thought she was only going to have boys and was in tears of joy when she heard the news.
This used to seem so sweet but now I know I’m not her little girl and it hurts. I am afraid that if I come out to her she will feel like she’s losing her little girl that she wanted so much. I know this isn’t about her but it doesn’t stop me from feeling like I’m going to disappoint her."	"it's not about her and if she doesn't like it, that's her problem
Can't really do much about that unfortuntely. I feel like the best you can do is hope that if she is disapointed she at least gets over it, some parents take a while to adjust, some take years and some pretty much never will.
Ugh. She decided to create a child, not you. 

By deciding that, she accepts all outcomes, inconveniences and struggles that come with it.

And if she fails to love unconditionally, she fails her duty as a parent.
My whole life my mom complained about my sister who never dressed cute, who didn’t like spa days, who hated shopping, who didn’t care about her appearance. My whole life my mom complained that she wished she had a daughter who was feminine and enjoyed the things she does. She even complained that my sister would never give her grandkids. She even joked at times that she wished I had been AFAB. She often said if she went blind I would be the only person she’d trust to ensure she looked appropriate and was dressed well. 

Well turns out she does have a daughter like that. I own more dresses than my younger sister and two half sisters combined. I am always trying new makeup. I love to shop and always have. Spa days sound delightful. I love my daughters and they enjoy having two moms. I’m incredibly feminine (and cuter than my sister by far) and would love mother daughter days. 

Turns out, it didn’t matter. It sucked realizing that she’d never see me the way I wanted. That said, I am happier. Yes I don’t have a relationship with my mom and that hurts. I do however have a better relationship with my daughters, better friendships, a much better relationship than my marriage, and I’m a much happier and loving person. I don’t regret my choice. Regardless of other people, you have to decide what you need for you. Does loss hurt? Like hell it does. Are you strong enough to one day be yourself? Yes. Yes you are. 

My dad, who always wanted a masc son (which I never was haha), now has four girls. Oh well. It’s not my problem because as a good parent, I know it’s best that I encourage my kids to be themselves and support them fully. You can be you and be happy. I promise. Some people might surprise you in a good way.
She HAD a girl for a period of time, but you always have yourself.
I hope that everything will end up going well but you have to be urself. You will only be unhappy if not.
If she is so bothered she doesn’t have a girl she can have another kid or adopt a girl. You don’t have to live up to your parents head cannons
i had this too. in my experience when i told her i was scared she wouldnt want to lose her only girl she said that she just wanted me to be happy and thats all that matters. hope it goes well for you OP.
I relate to this so much lol. My parents wanted a girl and a boy, and that’s what they got… or so they thought. I’m also a trans boy and have come out to them. They’re still hung up on me being their “baby girl” but I’ve come to realize that my feelings about myself matter more. Your parents might do the same thing my mom does, which is to say that “I’m your parent, so I don’t have to call you [preferred name/pronouns].” Please don’t make the mistake I did by staying silent. If they say this, tell them how important this is to you.

I’m not saying to come out now. Wait until your comfortable enough to do so. Trust me, coming out before you’re actually ready sucks, so make sure you really are comfortable to do it. Good luck and I hope your parents are accepting of you!
I know how you feel. I’m very fortunate that my mother is accepting of me (trans male) but I figure she must miss her little girl. 

Given my experience, I think it’s important to be understanding.  It’s a bit difficult for me personally to instantly say “well, she can just deal with it!! You didn’t ask to be born a girl!!!” just because I’m very empathetic with my mother, especially with this particular topic.  But everyone has different relationships to their parents and themselves and their childhood experiences growing up as their AGAB.

Edit:  she may be upset, and remember that you can’t expect her to make the shift so quickly, learning that what she always wanted and knew is not what she got.  You can be upset at her for this, but I think the healthier thing is to communicate with her your feelings and concerns—if she’s understanding, she’ll learn to be happy with her son.
Whereas I'm preparing to ask my Mum to accept me as her (only) daughter.

I know you don't want to disappoint your Mum but you've got to live your life for you."	10bp1gt	trans	72	0.98	2023-01-14 13:58:06
If you are trans, you are loved, and things will get better	"I am fortunate enough to have a family that eventually came around to accept me after many years, and a community and peer circle that is extremely supportive. I know this isn't the case for so many trans youth and adults and it breaks my heart.

Vent incoming, but I was searching Reddit for the name of a specific surgeon who I was looking to schedule a top surgery consultation with. The most recent post was only one month ago, which is surprising since I am from a very small state, and I felt like it was fate that I found someone else FTM that lived that close to me and was seeing the same surgeon. I went to his page. The very last post, from only a day ago, was that he had purchased the tools and was going to end his life that day.

I felt like a piece of me shattered. I have attempted in the past before as well, but fortunately I survived and things have gotten so much better for me. I've started HRT, I am engaged to an incredible woman who also happens to be trans and who understands me better than anyone else has before, and I can finally envision a future in which I am fulfilled and content. If you're reading this, you will experience this one day too. Trans joy is something all of us deserve, and I am praying that we all find it. Please stay strong."	Thank you needed to read this, most days it doesn't feel like I'm loved but my ex wife told me she would be there every step of the way holding my hand on my journey.	te2r1b	trans	70	0.97	2022-03-14 17:24:00

I'm sitting in my car and crying	"It's midnight. In 35 days I will be 25. A mile stone. Oddly, it's less important to me than what will happen in 3 days prior. In 32 days will be my 1 year mark on HRT. I've already passed the 1 year being out.

A year ago, I was with a girl that loved the idea of me more than she loved the reality, and I had to make some tough choices about our relationship. I haven't spoken to her since Christmas day.

A year ago, I thought this might make my mother and I closer and fix our broken relationship. Instead I have a restraining order against her and a new scar on my forearm. Today, as far as my parents are concerned, I'm an orphan.

A year ago, I was scared that I would have to go through this journey alone, or with friends too busy to spend time with me, or too far away. I thought that dating would be difficult. The truth is that the weak weed themselves out (or so I told myself), and I drew the lottery and found the perfect person for me, and she and I have since become engaged and had a private handfasting.

A year ago I struggles with clothes and makeup. Today I put one makeup with ease and all of my clothes make me SO happy.

A year ago I legitimately questioned my ability to survive. Now I do not. I know how resilient I am.

A year ago I couldn't look in the mirror without tearing myself apart, without seeing someone who was absolutely ugly. Now I can look in the mirror and point out all of my favorite parts of me. Sure, I still wish some things would change, and perhaps some of them will. But when I look in the mirror I see someone beautiful, I can finally see ME. 

Anyone who read this, if you have been frightened or scared, or anxious... I promise, it gets so much better. I'm in my car right now crying because I am SO over filled with joy."

Went to Seattle Pride for the first time and realized how beautiful it was. I have nothing but cis straight friends and now I want a new circle.	"I'm a 21 year old trans woman and I've been on HRT for nearly two years, but I work a blue-collar job and retained my friends from high school. Both groups have nothing but cis straight males and me, and I thought nothing of it till today. My partner took me to pride insisting that it'd be good for me, and although I hesitated (being autistic and easily overstimulated) I put on a cute outfit and made my way out.

It was singlehandedly one of the best experiences I've had. Seeing the parade gave me so much joy and excitement, I was relieved that there were so many others like me, and being in a crowd of my allies and peers gave me a sense of liberation I haven't felt in years. 

Problem is I have social anxiety and I'm shy, I couldn't bring myself to talk to anybody besides my partner, I desperately wanted too but I couldn't. This trans women walked by me and I gave her a soft smile and I swear the smile she gave back just wanted to make me scream 'be my friend' but I couldn't, and she walked away and now the opportunity is lost.

I'm just sad I live in such a conservative bubble, they're nice but I feel like I could use friends who are more like me, I feel like it'd give me something I've never experienced before."	"Oh my god, this post cheered me up massively. I'm so glad you managed to have a good pride!!!  


Ok maybe this girl got away, but it sounds like she was really positively impacted by your interaction. You could have been the difference between a crappy day and an amazing day, go you! And next time it might be a little easier to break the ice.   


I would recommend hunting out some queer/trans/lgbt groups. if you're close to the population centre (I have no idea what seattle is like) then theirs almost always activist groups, sport clubs (especially bouldering), board game meets, club nights and whatever the cis do but better. I just takes a few people to alter your social landscape. Hope you have successs x
this is so sweet <3 besides the anxiety part!!! and i feel that 100000%. i’d say you could start by following more queer and trans people on instagram (maybe even in your larger geographical vicinity! who knows!!) and also join queer/trans facebook groups!
I need more trans girlfriends if you ever wanna hang out! I live in Everett but work in Seattle ☺️
I hope you get some nice queer friends soon
yeah that sounds great, message me :)

FIRST DAY ON T!!!!!!!	"SO i’m 16 and i did my very first t injection today!! i did with my dad, he was so supportive and excited with me. i think i’ll treasure the memory i made with him today forever. on the other hand … there’s my mom lol. she wasn’t there with me. of course i’m so happy doing it with my dad, but ya know.. it’s my mom. it still hurts. 
this is what happened later after the injection:

i asked her if she wanted to see where i did the injection
*gives me weird look*

“no i just wanted to show you, but if you don’t want to see it i won’t show you.”
her:

i just wanted to share because i don’t see a lot of stories where just one parent is unsupportive. hopefully this makes someone feel less alone haha. and also wanted to share the joy of starting my journey 😁"	"I can feel the happy. In my head you shouted the whole post ;-)

T4T is amazing	"My girlfriend and I have successfully uhauled! We have a cozy apartment for us and our cat. I met her a year after I started my transition. She makes me happy and is the most thoughtful and communicative person I know. I'm looking forward to our life together.

I wore a dress for the first time tonight :)	I'm so happy! I've been shaving my whole body the last few days and tonight my super supportive partner made us dinner and I snuck into my room and put on this cute dress she bought me. Felt so cute and loved and just hfjjnhg happy. Ever since I came out I've felt this intense joy and it just feels right and I'm so excited to really fully transition (pre-everything)	"There's no substance to this I just love my gf

I just got called Ma'am on the phone by one of the my work's suppliers	"I just jumped up and down for joy, it was great. I love that my natural voice is so close to passing. If only the rest of me was. 

So happy had to share! <3"	"It’s the best feeling!
I have the exact opposite problem. I was stopped at a red light and a semi-cute boy was yelling out catcalls like ""Hey sexy"" and ""What's ya number?"" and just nope, I ain't opening this mouth. I cannot sound convincing without a thick American accent and I've never left Australia 
I like getting gendered correctly.... but I hate the sound of that honorific, ma'am. Can I get like a miss or a cutie, even a madam, just not ma'am? It makes me feel like an old southern woman with a fetish for respect.

Awesome!
Miss would have been nice but it would be pretty unprofessional to be called cutie by a supplier 😂 
I was thinking the exact same thing.  I would personally prefer miss , but right now, my fem voice needs serious attention.  Pretty sure it wouldn't pass it all right now."	8jxjz9	trans	62	1.0	2018-05-16 19:03:41
Ask stupid questions...	"I came out just over a year ago. My dad and I have this game where he pretends I'm not trans, and I pretend that his outright rejection doesn't bother me. A year ago, when I first asked him to use my correct pronouns, he just replied, ""no."" I politely reminded him of my pronouns once, a few months later. This time he said, ""how about I just don't refer to you at all."" 

I've made peace with that. Being myself has brought me so much joy, and his disapproval is just a small disappointment. But it seems like he's under the misconception that if he's passive aggressive enough, I'll stop being trans. Asking my sister why she doesn't call me ""she."" Asking me why my friends don't call me by my birth name. 

And today when we were shopping and he saw me coming out of the bathroom. ""Why were you in the men's room?"" he asked. 

""The usual reason."" I had to pee. 

His response, predictably, was to sigh and walk away. Maybe one day he'll realize that his lame attempts at confrontation aren't going to change anything. 

Not today, sadly."	"Wow he sounds like such a prick. You're super strong for how you're handling it and recognizing that the joy you get from being yourself outweighs the pain that his behavior brings ☺️

I came out to my girlfriend of two years last night	"She’s known that I wear women’s clothes since 2 weeks into our relationship and she’s known how feminine I’ve always been, but I was always too afraid to tell her the full truth of everything. She just saw it as my weird hobby that makes me happy and that she was supportive of most, but not all, of the time.

But last night, I felt everything change. She let me wear mascara for the first time and suddenly I didn’t hate the person I saw in the mirror. I felt beautiful. But seeing me wearing makeup had an emotional response with her as well, and it wasn’t so great. Suddenly, this hobby of mine, that was cute on its own, was becoming too real. That it was becoming too much like drag. So we got into a small argument about it and long story short, I told her everything. I told her about the first time I wanted to be a girl as a kid. I told her about my first childhood friend who was also trans. I told her that I feel like an imposter while pretending to be a man. That I get excited when my hair is in a bun and I get called ma’am by mistake. I told her who I was finally.

And she accepted me. She sat and cried with me and said how everything finally made sense. She understood why I was so hesitant to marry her. She understood why I got so hurt when she would set boundaries on my “hobby.” She said it was like all of the pieces of the puzzle fell in place. We are still undecided on how to proceed from here, but she’s told me that no matter what, we’ll be in each other’s lives. I was expecting hate and a feeling of betrayal, but instead was met with kindness and love. For the first time in my life, I’ve got this feeling of unequivocal joy. I slept better last night than I have in a long time."	"What a beautiful story! I wish you both all the best as you explore!
Congraaaaaaaaaats!!!!!!!
That's amazing! Good luck! :) <3
[deleted]
That’s really adorable and nice, I wish both of you the best!
Thank you! The world feels hopeful again all of a sudden and I’m excited to see what the future holds
Thanks!
Thanks! I’m super excited and a bit terrified still so it’s a bit of a double edged sword, but definitely leaning more toward excited.
That definitely makes it a little harder, so I wish you the best, but the easiest way I found is with my story. People tend to respond better to stories than they do with hard facts. It gives more insight into the why you’ve come to this decision, it shows that this isn’t a new thing but that it’s something you’ve been dealing with for a long time, and helps her understand you a little more. I’m obviously not an expert because I waited until now to do it too, but that’s what I did and it worked for me. I’ve got a lot more of it to do with my friends and family, so we’ll see how well this advice holds up, but I’m more confident now that it won’t be anywhere near as bad as I am expecting. Your family loves you, your friends love you, and your girlfriend loves you. They will all need time to process so don’t take anything they say in anger to heart. If they don’t accept you immediately, give them time to understand and to heal.
I came out to my wife after 15 years together. There were some things that made her concerned over the years, but I always had such tall emotional walls that I couldn't fix things. But then I told her. I had no choice. And it's been wonderful! Not every partner is supportive, unfortunately. But so many are, even if it means having a friendship instead of a romantic relationship. Don't stress too much, and good luck!
Thanks, it means a lot!
❤️

Thanks, that’s kind of what I’m hoping for. I love her but I understand if she needs to have us just be friends. We will see what the future holds!

I just found out about it on YouTube. I suggest checking out the channel transvoicelessons on youtube, they helped me alot in knowing how to get started.

Umm okay, sure, *maybe* I just took these pictures while dressed in my girlfriends clothes and felt like really overwhelmed with joy at looking at myself, but also, am I really trans? /s		"Thats a difficult question to answer in all honisty the way i could answer it, is to look back to what you did when you were younger as far back as you can remember. From there if what you did as a child and from on fits your defeition of what a trans person is (dont forget every defenition is diffrent) then yes you may be trans thats how i figured it out in my case if you have any questions dont be afraid to dm me i can answer anything to the best of my knowledge
You look cute
Also by the way your you look grear
Holy moly you are gorgeous, especially in the second picture
is your gf a lesbian?
I’ve been struggling with it all for over a year, and I finally accepted that I probably am trans a few days ago. Since then I’ve identified what I believe is dysphoria, which I’ve never felt prior, and felt a great amount of joy when imagining my life transitioned. The only thing keeping me in doubt still is the difficulty it’ll add to my life when I come out to my parents.
My childhood isn’t the greatest to compare for me, since I can’t remember most of it. All I have is my teen years and now
Thanks!!
Thanks! ❤️
Tysm!
She’s bi and very supportive of my journey.
I will add though that you don’t have to have those obvious childhood signs to be trans. Your perception and articulation of gender changes overtime so although some people are more 
obviously trans it’s not at all a requirement.
You're welcome sweetie 🥺
Then it's perfect!
I have a few memories that I can look back on and think “oh yeah that may have been a sign” but I always just thought it was normal, like pretending I was a girl hanging out with other girls when I was in the bath at a young age. It’s very muddled and filled with a lot of anxiety that I can’t place so I try not to think about it. 
I still feel like an imposter, not actually trans but just fetishizing the idea or worrying it’s just a phase and I’ll be back to feeling how I used to in a month. Idk lots of worries
I do whole heartledly agree 👍
Ofcourse, A lot of us feel like that. It’s kindof just another form of dysphoria."	uy4wge	trans	46	0.94	2022-05-26 10:53:56
Pandora's box	"I was worried.
It seemed like my egg was a pandora's box, trans people can suffer so much.
But I looked at myself, at my past, and found all that stuff was already there, It was always there.

It seems like I forgot the most important part of the myth, All the pain and suffering was already released, And the only thing left inside was Hope, and in my case Joy.

Hi, I'm Joy.
It's nice to meet you."	"Hello Joy! Nice to meet you too!
I see what you did there. Cute. Nice to meet you Joy!

I looked through an former BF’s social media and seeing how far he’s come with his transition made me cry	"Hi, CIS Male here. Apologies in advance for formatting issues, I am a mobile user.

Years back, in 2016-2017, I used to date a Trans man (we’ll call him Tobias). He lived all the way in Australia, I live in the US. We ended up breaking up after awhile, and steadily lost contact, though I still followed him on IG, and would periodically check his account to see how he’s doing

A few hours ago, I was checking IG and decided to check his account to see how he’s been, and he’s changed so much since then. He looks amazing, he has facial hair and body hair! You wouldn’t realize he was trans at all if you saw him. And then I noticed a saved story album he had in his bio that I clicked on.

It was a series of clips of him recording his voice to show how it changed, starting from when he started taking testosterone in 2019, to roughly 15 months ago. I saw Tobias in real time change physically. I heard his voice get deeper and more masculine. And seeing how far he’s come from when I dated him made me break down into tears. Tears of joy. Just typing it out has me struggling to keep myself from gross sobbing again. I’m so fucking happy for him. I’m glad he’s become the man he’s always wanted to be. And I’m so fucking happy that he’s living a happy life."	"Thanks for sharing. It's always good to hear some successful ftm transition stories. Often feels like we're invisible and it's difficult to see examples of transition in all stages when it would really help those who are just starting out or considering starting.

Got gendered correctly by a stranger for the first time	"And it felt really good, better than I thought it would honestly. 

I was dropping my car off for an oil change and was in line behind a woman who was pretty flustered about needing to show proof of insurance to get a loaner car. She had to call her insurance or something, but told the person behind the counter I'll step out into the waiting area so you can help her. And the her she was referring to was me. 😁

I guess it seems like such a big deal because without thinking twice she gendered me correctly, like her natural first thought was to use her which was super affirming. 

Anyways just wanted to share so trans joy! 🥰"	"go team you!

I'm scared of myself and don't know if I'll ever be able to change it	"TW: Suicide

Hi. Sorry if this is a bit too much, I just need to vent. It also ended up being longer than I expected.

In September I started exploring my gender identity. I realized that I'm trans and the reason I hate myself isn't just growing up. It took me a while to come to terms with it, but when shit got really bad in October I came out accidentally to my friends, which turned out to be the best decision I could make. They were very supportive and encouraged me to come out to my parents when I'm ready. I did so in January. It didn't go as I planned. Before I got to the point, I ended up breaking down with parents asking me to tell them what's wrong. I had the worst panic attack yet and I felt like my life was about to get ruined. I ended up only telling them I have problems figuring out my gender identity, even though I knew perfectly well who I was at the time. They kept telling me it's normal, that everyone has these thoughts while growing up and that it's super common for kids to feel like this these days. They did let me see a therapist, though. I met her once so far, I'm seeing her again next week. Turns out she's a wonderful person that genuinely tries to help me. She did say she isn't very exerienced with the trans stuff though, so after the next meeting I'll be changing the therapist to someone she recommended who could not only understand me better, but also actually help. Everything seems great, doesn't it? Well, here's when everything goes to shit. I was going with my parents on a two week trip. Which means I lost contact with my only accepting friends for two whole weeks. I was worried it'd take a toll on me, and it did. After whole days of constant misgendering, talking to my friends was the only thing that could bring me joy. And since it was gone, it fucked me up pretty quickly. I started self harming. I didn't want to cut myself, because my parents would find out. So I started burning myself with a dryer, as that was easier to hide and explain. And then, when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I won some fucking competition. And it wasn't just a random school thing, it was a very big competition I didn't think I would win. But I wasn't happy. In a few months I'll be going to a trip abroad with my teacher to receive some award. He also told me I could be contacted by media of all things. So now I'm the center of attention for my family, school, and classmates, but I don't want that. I just want to be left alone, especially since I'm not publically out yet. So instead of being happy, I'm suicidal because everybody keeps congratulating me what a talented boy I am. And you know what's the worst? My parents keep telling me how proud they are of me, and yet they can't respect the only thing I asked them. They keep telling me how handsome I am, despite me telling them I hate that. They keep trying to get me some more manly clothes, despite me telling them I want to dress in a more feminine way. It's like they only care about my achievements, but don't respect me as a person. They also keep insisting it's just a phase and I would be happier if I ate better, as if my eating disorders weren't caused by my self image. And I just can't take it anymore. My parents keep trying to make me someone I'm not, and they don't even try to understand why that's an issue. Every day I keep thinking of ending myself, but I can't because I know how much it'd hurt my friends and my family. So I just keep self harming, both physically and mentally by asking people to insult me online. Why? Why do I keep doing shit that only makes me feel worse? Why instead of trying to be happy, I keep making myself more and more miserable? I can function perfectly well and nobody suspects anything is wrong, but I just don't want to be alive. Why is that happening? I'm tired of hating myself, I want to be normal, but it isn't possible because I was born in a wrong body. And it's so unfair, whatever I do feels wrong, I can't even look at my arms without feeling hatred towards myself. I hardly ever speak as I can't listen to myself. And I can't even change that without exposing myself to extreme hatred in a pretty conservative area. I don't know what to do anymore, it's like I'm stuck in a never ending loop of self hatred, punishment and guilt for being a wreck. I just wish there was someone to hug me and actually listen to me."	"Hi you beautiful girl. It makes me sad that your parents are trying to force you to be someone that you are not. I want you to know that they are the ones who are wrong here, you are right. Being true to yourself is always the best thing you can do. You don't owe them anything. I am a mom and reading about your parents makes my blood boil! I'm trying not to go on a rant here, but bad words keep coming up in my mind right now!

It also makes me sad that you are hurting yourself and have all this dark thoughts in your mind. Please talk to your therapist about this, my brave girl. If you don't want to do that, there is this really good organisation focused on LGTB+ people you can contact 24/7!

You are of course welcome to contact me also, but I'm just a mom that want every kid and young person to be safe and loved for how they are, not an expert on what you are going through. But if you need mom support I'm here for you.
[removed]
Baby girl you are beautiful and if they can't see that then it's their loss. If you're parents aren't supportive then you're just going to have to fake it till you make it. I understand where you're coming from and from my experience all the self destructive behavior that I had before coming out as trans and publicly presenting have all disappeared. Like you I couldn't stop and it felt like an addiction but as soon as I started presenting those urges went away and now I'm thankful that I survived or didn't get arrested. You will be 18 soon and legally an adult capable of making your own decisions in the mean time set yourself the goal of making a future for yourself. Get a job, save every penny you can, start applying for scholarships if collage or technical trad schools are in your future. Make a plan for moving out and be prepared for any support you are receiving from family to disappear. You will have to adopt the mindset of your going to have to do this alone. You won't be alone, you will get friends who will support you emotionally at least if not financially. There is light at the end of the tunnel your in just keep moving.
I love you and want you to keep fighting for who you are.  DM me if you ever want to talk.

🥰❤
you should flat out tell your parents what you need from them thats the only way to have change also you are a wonderful person who deserves the best, i have gone down the self harm rabbit hole it doesnt end well and its not worth it.
Oh gosh. I can relate a lot to this. I came out the same way to my parents - I had a panic attack before I was ready to tell them and they took it very poorly. They truly think I have ""confusion"" and think its linked to me having Autism Spectrum Disorder (which for some inexplicable reason they didn't tell me until a few weeks ago. I'm 21 mind you and never had this diagnosed or treated). I'm going to see therapy now and meeting with two separate therapists this week who are experienced in this kind of stuff. I'm in college on the other side of the country and all my friends here know and are ultra supportive of me.

&#x200B;

I am going home for a week in March and I'm extremely nervous about it. My parents actively refuse my pronouns (they/them) and I'm worried about how they will take things going forward. I'm going to a third therapist when I get home at my parent's request, this is my mom's therapist. She is not experienced in queer issues and my mom brought me up to her and she told her that I was just confused and that my gender questioning is due to me having ASD. She doesn't know me so maybe getting to talk to her one on one will change her perspective. 

&#x200B;

Stick with it, we're in this together. You are awesome and just know that your achievements and your gender are not linked. Be proud of yourself. I can relate to this too because I'm an engineering major with a high GPA currently looking to grad school, so my parents keep telling me how proud they are of me and I am the center of attention to a lot of my family when I kind of wish my parents would be a little more hands off sometimes. One thing I'd totally recommend is after your next couple therapy sessions have your therapist talk to your parents so they can get an outside and professional perspective. They think they know you better than you know yourself. A therapist is an outside and unbiased source so they are able to read you, and as such, your parents might be willing to take it from them. 

&#x200B;

Enjoy your trip, you deserve it. And we're all right here if you need someone to talk to or vent to. Also go on the Discord for this subreddit if you ever need someone to vent to in real time.
Thank you! I might've been too hard on my parents, though. I really love them and they love me, they just don't understand. They are trying to support me, but at the same time it feels like they don't want to see me for who I am. In their eyes I'm their son who's confused by puberty. And I can't really blame them, nobody would want their child to be trans. I just wish they didn't insist I'm in the wrong so much.
Thanks. Don't worry about me, I'm careful. I really wish I could help myself, but whenever I tell myself I'd stop I do it later anyway. It feels like an addiciton, but it doesn't even make me feel good. I really don't understand it
Thank you. My parents don't believe me, but they really want to help. It's just that I can't explain it to them, because they always act like they know better and I'm just confused. They mean well, but they aren't exactly the best at it. I hope they'll change their mind one day, I really don't want to cut ties with them
I know I should, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I'm scared I might panic again and only worsen the situation. Just like before, I couldn't even argue with them because I didn't want to talk in the first place. I'm waiting for my second therapist appointment next week, maybe that will help somehow, but I really don't know anymore.

start slow then one thing at a time like trying not to self harm its hard to stop but feels good when you do
I don't know. The first time I came out to them I couldn't even speak properly. Maybe they would accept me, but I'm scared of what will happen if they don't. As it is now it sucks, but at least they're trying to help, even if they don't understand
Are you sure? I don't want to be a burden
I really wish I could, but it feels impossible. I can convince myself that's wrong, but later I'll do it anyway.

i suggest a timer time how many days you can go without self harming it helped me self harm less, its a good system

Joy #452 of Being a Trans Woman	"getting random friend requests from random middle aged white dudes who would probably vote to genocide you, but want to connect so you can be their dirty little secret.

Bonus: latest one was from a cop.  ACAB"	"If they’re in a relationship, see if you can send a screenshot of it to their spouse/partner
And their profiles. So many pictures of bigoted alcoholics holding fish or sitting in the driver's seat of their lifted truck - always with the same sunglasses.

I’ve still not had this joy, I’m keeping my fingers crossed so I can truly be in the club

So I had a dream and I woke up to the nightmare	"Alot of my friends are bringing home babies. I stay up a little late excited for them, commenting on their new adorable munchkins. I doze off.

*I get home with my baby. She starts to cry and I figure she's hungry. We get inside and I go to feed her. I nurse her and she dozes off happy..... She is happy... I am happy*

Wait..... I *am happy*? I'm *not allowed to feel happy*. I'm not allowed to *feel* anything.

I wake up in the darkness. It's probably like 2 am. I'm trans and I'll never mother a child. I *feel* this *there but not there* awareness/pain in every cell of my chest. My body reminds me that such joy is not meant for me. I'm nearly overcome by my despair. I cannot cry out. I cannot be loud. I don't want to have to explain why in the morning why I am a broken mess right now.

No one understands. Not even my closest friends understand and I don't want to cause a greater rift by trying to explain. I throw my feelings back into the void. I throw on a smile in the morning I don't feel. Sometimes if I try hard enough I forget for a little while that I'm empty like a used wrapper, if I put enough work into pretending I'm happy I can fool even myself. I *shouldn't feel pain over never getting to be a 'mommy'*.

Everything is OK. There are no other options. I wonder if it is OK to dream happy knowing I'll always wake up to a nightmare.

I've never seriously considered hurting myself. I know that others, the few that feel how I shouldn't, have. I kinda wish I could even entertain such thoughts. I can't. Something in me won't. The painful numbness just goes on and so do I."	"Not every cis women can be a mother. There are other options like adoption there are children who need a wonderful mother’s.
Most women that can't have children are not called freaks if they despair over not being able to carry a child. They are allowed, even encouraged, to mourn. They are allowed to *feel* sad. 
Our very existence repulses some. Many...even those that try to be tolerant, don't understand. Most western cultures see motherhood as sacred. We are seen by them, and taught by them that we are profane. Even when we try to get past that....the instinct is still there. The instinct that I will never be worthy of being a mother, that I am repulsive to suggest such a thing.

Internalized trans phobia is something I wonder if anyone ever truly overcomes. After fighting awhile I always wonder if I'm right to even try to fight against my own self loathing.
It is ok to feel bad about thing. I have told people I am trans but not about wanting to be a mother I sometimes yearn to be a mother. But then I think about if I should be a parent. There are way outside of giving birth to be a parent. If there are people I you life who think you don’t deserve to be a parent because you are trans those people don’t truly love you. They only care about preserving the hierarchy of gender roles that damage our lives so.
What is you're idea of a mother? This is not a challenge btw but depending on your view of motherhood what I say wont help you at all or it could help you a lot.

 You could be a mother even without being cis right? Cis women are still seen as inconveniences for not being able to reproduce. They aren't given time to mourn or grieve and get reminded often about their infertility; especially in religious groups. Many kill themselves due to the pressure. And many trans women can relate to you in this to the point of absolute despair as well. Even better then a cis women could obviously. Unfortunately many trans sisters haven't made it to see the advancements we are trying to make just for them or the information that's available to them to show them that they CAN be a mother. Hopefully I can give you hope or something with what I know off the top of my head.

You could be a mother regardless of birth. Fun fact you can still breastfeed. Afab and amab humans can do so and have done so for many years before we both were born. It was common for both to breastfeed a child and raise that child within the community as old school as that is. Also pregnancy doesn't cause lactation its a myth like how its a myth amab people cant breastfeed. Breastfeeding is such an intimate thing for a mother and child and is a good say to bond with your child. So you could do more socially preconceived maternal tasks if you decide to have a child.

That being said would you still love a child if it wasn't blood related to you? Then adopting or surrogacy could be good for you and hopefully within the years it'll be an easier process for single parents and lgbtq folks to adopt. Many afab people have the want to give birth or be pregnant but not want to keep the child (its a biological thing way more then some think its psychological). 

There are also trying really hard to make womb transplanting a thing in the future not just for cis women who cant conceive bit for transwomen too. Some of which is transmasc to transfem transplanting of a womb. So someday maybe you could give birth and have your own kid either by growing the tissue from YOUR OWN FLESH in a lab, getting the transplat from a willing cis women donor, or a transman dying to not only donate but to go along with their own transition goals.

In order to be a good mother though you need to take care of yourself and ask yourself ***why*** you'd like to be a mother. Sort out within yourself what about motherhood makes you yearn to have a child in your life. Also are you in a spot where you feel you're ready to have a child? Get to that spot. Their will be options for you when you are ready I promise this. (If you were ready now id offer up surrogacy myself lol).

I'm sorry for whatever emotions may come up or anyway this may be taken in the wrong way  I will say my intention is just to help you self-reflect and know theres other options if you're willing to compromise on some stuff.

I'm sorry you're going through this. I truly am. I may not relate but I hope someday you can be happy. I hope things get better quicker in the world and that you can find decent people in your life to be a support system for you in what you are feeling. Please be easy on yourself and I wish you the best

ps: sorry for any typos i wanted to get as much out as i could and i have reading problems
I hear you. In your shoes, to me I'd say the same thing. I rationally *get it*. I'm also, in my soul, one of the ones that sees such feelings, in myself, as *unhallowed* and *unwholesome*. I can't even properly feel bad about not being able to carry a child without feeling worse about feeling at all.
I appreciate your response and time. I realize, having had a 'surrogate mother' as an adult that motherhood can take many forms. I know it's limiting to only consider motherhood to 'carrying a child'. I'm not attempting to limit it for others, but emotionally, it's hard to not consider my own limitations physically. If I was cis, in the next few years I would be approaching 'advanced maternal age' myself. Even if we had such a breakthrough in the next 5 years and I kept my excellent health, I would not be a candidate. I'm a healthcare worker and child of a transplant recipient. I know the types of algorithms that go into these types of decisions.

Even breastfeeding a child that I had adopted would be personally, viscerally fulfilling to my instincts to be a mother. That said, given the direction my own life is and has been taking, I probably would have the most success as an informal 'surrogate mother' myself to a young adult. It's not really the same thing in alot of ways, but realistically, it's the best I have with my current life trajectory and age.
That is understandable it is ok to not feel anything at all what you feel or don’t feel is valued talking about is the way we cope with our feelings or lack there of.
At least you are weigh you're options yknow? Hey. Whatever happens in your life- I hope it's a good one. I hope someday you'll be able to be less hard on yourself though, I cant imagine what you are going through but you aren't a freak. Unless you choose to eat pickles and mentos. Dumb joke though I digress.

Internalized Transphobia can be a nightmare to work through and hyper self criticism is a bitch! But hey knowing where you are age wise I mean... It's never too late to be a parent. I was raised by a person I respect a lot who was in her late 40s when she first took me in. She had a lot of wisdom and was loving and caring and it didn't really matter how old she was except it did make me a little more gentle as a kid (i was 6 so very energetic). And even though a big situation made us split up I still remember a ton of the care she showed. So late 30's or 40's or even just 30 something and aging too fast for you're own liking, someones gonna love you.

It rarely matters to the kid how old you are. They hardly remember their own age unless they have a milestone to get to. You might've missed out on the advancements and might be choosing to go past the adopting and stuff... But regardless a kid at any age including well... 20 something not to give anything away... will appreciate someone looking out for them.

I'm starting to feel a little out of the box for talking? There's a lot of people younger than me in this subreddit so like kinda nervous now just talking about this to someone older because like damn how can I give support now? I'm a bit of a cynic too so I'm like ""what if they know better than what you have to suggest or offer as solice?""  But I try to be hopeful. I personally believe there is hope in this though whichever way you go rn with what you're considering in options. Sorry if I'm speaking out of turn, Miss. And I'm sorry you're having a hard time. I would totally make you some comfort food if I could get it to you.
You're a good kiddo. Have a nice evening. Try not to let folks' fatalism get you down."	tp02in	trans	49	0.97	2022-03-26 18:48:02

I’m a gardener for one client so it’s not even a business structure like that, which I think is probably why I felt safe coming out to there but not my other job which is much more traditional.

Pirate's Post OP Trans Girl Tips #1	"I'm now on my second week Post OP for a zero-depth vaginoplasty, and here's some of what I've learned so far.

1: Wingless pads are your friend and angel. Everything is swollen to shit, and those wings WILL find where to chafe you.

2: When you're experiencing surgery emotions and concerning regret, just stick your hand between your legs where your old genitalia would have been. That feeling of nothing brings me joy, it may for you too.

3: Ice Packs and Tylenol are doing more for me than Oxycodone, emphasis on the ice packs. 

4: Walking is easier than it feels, you have a damn good range of motion available, and the pain is from standing: If you stand, move. 

5: Everything is swollen, so showering is hard, but make sure to wash EVERYWHERE. The blood alone makes ya feel nasty if you don't.

6: it's going to feel like they took your old genitals and just tucked them, they didn't, but the sensation of the tip of your urethra being near your ass or your scrotum being in three places at once takes time to get overwritten. (Clarified in comments)

7: Pooping is going to be terrifying. You might feel like you're going to pop a stitch, and you might rip something, but you have to poop. A stitch popped isn't as big a deal as not pooping for an extended period of time.

8: Peeing is going to be weird, and your stream is gonna go to weird places. Remember that everything is swollen and much of it works itself out (Mine shot up my ass crack yesterday, and today it's way right). Also pee regularly, you're gonna feel it more after the catheter and with a shorter urethra it's harder to hold it.

9: Remember that you're recovering from surgery. With low pain you're gonna feel like super woman. You aren't. You're a piece of glass that thinks it's bulletproof, don't put that to the test. Get bed rest and drink lots of water and cranberry juice.

10: Aye, the pain is gonna piece through you sometimes. Just cause you thought you made the wrong choice while in pain doesn't mean you're right. Post OP emotions are wild, and sometimes you need to ride them out. Having someone nearby to help you will be useful.

11: Akin to what I said earlier, everything is swollen. Nothing looks like it will in the future, it looked different two days ago to today. Give it time, and wait to assess the final product for a while until it's settled into your body.

12: The unnatural feeling like there's plastic wrap down there will fade. It comes from the area your touching not being where you expect. Akin to phantom pain, except this will fade as you re-align your senses to the new anatomy.

That's all I've got for now!! I'm keeping a detailed journal like the librarian I am so I can try and help some others through whatever I go through. I'll post another one of these in a while when I have more!

-Pirate"	"🎉🎉Girl congratulations 🎉🎉  thank you for posting this im still aways out but im honestly im looking farward to the day i can pee up my own ass too. And get well soon and please keep updating us.
Can you please elaborate on number six as much as possible? Is that actually how it's arranged or does it just feel like that? Thank you for this list.
This is excellent to know. Still on the fence about bottom surgery, but this is reassuring. Thanks, Captain
Thank you!!! I wish you luck in getting here! And recovery sure is an adventure, what with peeing up asses and all 🤣
Clarification of tip #6

--I tried to use anatomical terms throughout for comfort--

Of course! So the jist of the surgery is they take the old genitals to make new ones, that results in some parts of the old genitals feeling like they're in strange places. After all, our bodies aren't too great about immediately adjusting to change. So since what's happening is that the penis is being reformed to be in the labia, and lots of the tissue from both the shaft and scrotum are placed around to form everything, the sensation at first is akin to being tucked; ie, a penis being squished and laid flat along the groin and perineum. Of course this isn't what has happened, so as the different parts of the new genitals are touched and the nerves stimulated and healed, the mind recognizes that they're not simply in different places, but serving different purposes and are cemented where they are, and the sensation adjusts as so (I found ice packs to help a lot, as the Colling and warming effects everything.). Personally, I can tell about 50% of that feeling has disappeared by week two, it's starting to feel like feminine genitalia vs male genitalia already. Think of it like this: The tip of the penis is used to create a clitoris. This results in a feeling like the tip of a penis being ""glued down"" for lack of a better word. After it's interacted with a bit, cooling, showers, underwear, etc., The mind recognizes 'Oh, that's not what it used to be', and adjusts accordingly. Now I don't have a glued down tip, but a clitoris.

Tl;Dr: Since pieces of the old genitalia are used to create the new one; the body for a short time still recognizes them as a part of old genitalia. This results in a weird feeling of the old genitalia being bent and taped down. This feeling fades as the nerves heal and are interacted with.

Edit: Ah, and I've edited the tip, but before it was referring to particularly the urethra being moved down.

I hope this helped!! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
I'm glad I could be of even a slight of help!!
Thank you, I'm very excited for mine. At my first appointment I was told that tucking while you wait for surgery helps you get better results i guess due to stretching things out, not that it's going to be in that exact position which is what confused me for a minute.
That makes total sense!!! I'm so happy for you that you're about to have yours!!"	z3a49v	trans	43	0.91	2022-11-24 04:22:18
Now it’s official	"I emailed my doctor to tell them that after nearly 20 years of being his patient that there was something I had been holding back from telling him. I told him that I wanted to talk about gender dysphoria and what options were available. I told him that I understood if he wasn’t comfortable talking to me about this and was happy to be referred elsewhere. 

He replied just telling me to make an appointment. 

So I sat with him, told him about how this was something that I’d been living with since I was a teenager. It’s easily 25 years that I’ve carried this around and hidden it. How in the last year I couldn’t hold it in any more. That this body I walk around in doesn’t feel like mine but that I’ve managed to find some joy in small things, changing how I dress it, groom it. Told him that I was searching for a specialist to talk about HRT. He just sat and listened. 

When I was finished he told me he doesn’t have any experience helping someone with this, but he wanted to learn. That he was excited for me, and proud of me for finding ways to live more authentically and was looking forward to me teaching him what it was like. 

He asked that when I find a specialist that he would get to share in the care for me. And then he turned to his computer and pulled up my file and asked me to choose which gender I wanted listed. Two clicks. Done. He turned to me an said “now it’s official”."	"I wish I had this much courage Congratulations

I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this	"Recently my mom started calling me ""girl"" more often than usual, as in following literally anything she says to me with that word (I'm FtM). It's clearly obvious that she wants me to detransify (if that's how you call it?) and it's also obvious (to me at least) that if she keeps this up I'll ""maybe have the impression that I have the identity that she chose for me"" or something.

I'm so damn tired of this. So. Much. If I try to speak to her about it she'll throw transphobic nonsense at me, such as ""you're just playing a theatre role but your acting is awful"" and everytime it happens I get sh thoughts and instantly throw aside everything good in life.

My parents have no idea how badly I want to move out. I only have 2 and a half years until I'm legally allowed to move out and I really don't want to look back and remember all the things that hurt and sting instead of literally anything that brings me joy, ESPECIALLY from my family.

I don't want to feel alone in this world. Not now. Not never..."	"I'm so sorry your mother is being such an incredible jerk to you, that really sucks.

I wish more parents accepted their kids for who they are, instead of wanting to force them to be little ""mini-mes"" they control.

2 more years of her being awful is so fucling hard, I'm so sorry. Hopefully you can move out sooner, and find better people, a better family, a found family that actually supports you and loves you for who you are.
You are not alone,we are here,if your family doesn't accept you,then,we'll ne your new family ! Frick these transphobe,they can go burn in hell.if only people could understand their child become who they want at a certain age.
Sorry. Try to tough it out. You’re doing good and people care about you.
If you otherwise have a decent relationship with her, maybe tell her just that. “Mom, I’m planning on moving out in just a little over two years.  This really isn’t how I want to remember my last time living with you - I want to look forward to visiting, not dread it. Please, stop this.”

💜💜💜
First of all, I am very sorry that you are being treated like that. You don’t deserve that. 

Second of all, times have really changed since I was growing up. You are incredibly brave for coming out at all before you are an adult. I did not transition until my 30s even though I knew since I was around 5/6. I didn’t even know any openly gay or lesbian people growing up. It really gives me hope for the future. I know it’s hard. 

While your family may eventually come around on their own when they realize they will probably lose contact with you otherwise, you can’t control if/when they do. Don’t waste your time trying to argue with them or convince them of your truth. They are passing judgement based on their personal feelings and biases and not logic. 

Try to interact with them as little as possible when they’re being cruel and don’t give them the satisfaction of making you upset. Try to look forward to how your life will be better soon. I know it seems really far away, and time goes slower when you’re younger, but you will make it and you will be able to live freely. If you can find part time work, do that. Save up. Make your escape plan even if you can’t save just yet. Lean on people in your life who are supportive. Try to spend as much time as you can outside the house whether it be at a friend’s house or activities you enjoy or in nature. Whatever you have access to and makes you happy. Reach out to local support groups like PFLAG of LGBT community centers if they exist in your area or online support groups and communities. You got this.
*”the identity that she chose for me”*


Is she aware that this isn’t something she could’ve chosen when irregardless of whether or not you’re trans?
tysm,, 🫂❤️ low-key teared up near the end lol-
Anytime, friend, if our family is shit, then we have to be here for each other.

Ngl, I teared up a bit reading your post, too, lol. I still haven't come out to my mother, I think she'd lose her shit about me not being her daughter anymore.

It's damn hard having a parent that treats you poorly, and it's so damn long to get out of there and away from it. There are people out there who will actually love you, love you for you, and support you. Might take a bit to find them (it did for me, but I'm socially awkward af, lol) but they are out there.

You're fucking awesome, and it will get better once you're away from that kind of hate and harassment."	12obyzk	trans	48	0.98	2023-04-16 14:59:46

TRADE DEAL - Please read description	"I have some female hormones as well as feminine body, I’d like to swap this for masculine. 

It comes with long hair, chest, rounded face, and Uh… other girly things. Due to dysphoria, I decided that Ill have to get rid of the ol girl for something new. I’ll gladly take a masculine body, but it has to have short hair and a decent face. 

The female hormones are free so don’t worry about that, as well as the reproductive system. Please comment if you want to do a trade! I can’t wait to see! 

*this entire thing is a joke, I could only dream of actually swapping my body but I hope it brings you as much joy it did me*"	"Trade you a beard, leg hair and butt hair for extra chest fat and some hips
I'll take the trade, but what I really need is to swap the super expensive suit I purchased thinking it would ""fix"" everything, for a nice dress😂
If only we could get all the trans men and trans women together and do trades like this!

I'd be up for this in a heartbeat!
Y dis not real?? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I got a deal for you, slightly older model, with a little weight on it, but that’s easily repaired, plenty of body hair, and strong bones and muscles. One small problem, but of a thinning hair line, but there are solutions.

Oh and did I mention the all terrain, 2 leg drive?
Too funny 😂
Good offer but I’m afraid I’ve been cursed with….. ✨tiddy✨
OMG im asking this again… do we hate trade jokes or not?! i swear i see posts saying how many people hate it and then i see posts like this!

im just so confused 😭 can we reach a consensus?
ill trade with you lol i hate my body and everything to do with it
I'd trade you but I'll warn you that this model is already pretty short and bad at growing facial hair. But leg hair grows super fast!
Sure I got a whole 6 ft for you, along with a growing beard (Im often told Im handsome by my mum if that counts) and of course the reproductive stuff too. Body hair ofc included but you better be quick because that will be gone Sunday. Also have a seemingly endless supply of testosterone if you want that.
I would love to give you my masc elements in exchange for what you dont want. Tho I do wanna keep my dick x3
Trade with me. You'll be 6'1, barrel chested, strong, leg day without ever doing leg day. Ability to grow a beast of a beard.
Well I know this is just for fun, but like...if it was possible it would probably be illegal :/ (although I'd destroy humanity without hesitation to be a girl)
Wow, smart idea OP. Never thought of just asking 😩
Mood though, I wish I could just give my boobs to someone who wants them. Free to a good home! Heck they're huge, we could probably turn them into two sets for someone who actually wants them.
So what's the status on those brain switching devices I always saw in cartoons when I was younger? Are they real yet?
HMMM… drop the ass hair and I’ll give you long hair and cheat
For a small fee of more testosterone, I’ll buy you a dress. Maybe multiple. 😄
Yeah everyone would be happy! Ig one can dream
IKR 😭😭😭 it’s not fair
Not the two leg drive Oml… those are top model!
Id gladly take the tiddy curse off your hands
I think if they are offensive in anyway and mean then it’s not cool but I think if you make it light hearted and kind then it’s ok. As long as you are respectful. I can understand why people wouldn’t like it, that’s why I was careful with my wording n stuff, but I haven’t gotten any bad comments so I think it’s ok 😂
Same, I think trading is a good deal tbh
Meh! Being short isn’t bad. 😄
OH MI. I can be taller than my mom. Im around 5’8 if that suffices.
Ok that’s fine 😂
HELL YEAH
We can create a black market for us trans people :)))))
IKR! It’s a good idea! 😂😭
Y E S. I would love to do the same XD. If only it was real
Hmmm.  I’m positive it’s in almost every cartoon, maybe when we figure out how to transfer to the anime/cartoon world we can steal one. But in reality, no one has made one yet. Rip
Deal, think I know another transmasc I can pawn the butt hair too for more chest fat as well and that might get me to a comfortable size.
And did I mention this all comes in a nice, compact, and portable frame that is fuel efficient and a possible 5 star crash test rating… I don’t know I’ve never been in a crash.
Sure go ahead I don’t want them
I love it actually but I know some transmacs don't like it so I thought I'd warn you. Buyers bewarez y'know
Thats perfect thanks. I can be shorter than my mum with that.

Edit: after some brief research we'll only need about $100 million and numerous willing surgeons and countless hours in physical therapy. Will it be worth it? Probably.
😂
Wow this sounds like such a good deal
Yeahhhh. I’m 5’8 almost 5’9 (idk my height but my moms 5’9 so I’m guessing here) so I be taller
Yes. It will be worth it. The fact you RESEARCHED IT THO IS HILARIOUS
Warning, this awesome deal of a chassis come with not one, but two controlling parents who totally don't want you to have kids, but actually want you to have kids and will try to control you through guilt and ""parental guidance.""
It was only like a quick google search. Apparently scientists did it on a monkey in 2016 and they kept him alive for a whole 20 hours. I will most likely do more at about 2am tonight tho because I now am obsessed with the idea.
Oh damn… you will get one Christian mother, a Bi brother, and a quiet dad. Sorry to say the parents are Republicans… I hope this doesn’t mess up the deal. Another thing, the mom is VERY touchy
As long as she doesn't try to touch me with Holy Water... then we're good.    


Parents on my side are republican as well... so yeah.

What little things bring you euphoria?	I’d love to hear how y’all find joy, especially between the big moments. I’m hoping for big changes on hormones, but I’d like to treat myself to euphoria where i can find it along the way, instead of waiting for monumental changes to kick in. I bought barrettes from urban outfitters that sometimes make me feel super euphoric and girly. I def play with makeup and the like. But I would love to hear how y’all navigate this on a daily basis. Where do you find joy in your gender expression?	"i guess this is something that isnt gendered, but you made me think of it. Sometimes when im happy i bounce my arms when i walk, and one time my boyfriend told me it was cute. now whenever i find myself doing it i smile a little
""little things""

The little pockets in girl jeans.  They are small and terrible but also unmistakably feminine and euphoric to me.
Before realizing I was trans, I was convinced that guys didn’t do stuff like decorate or take really good care of themselves. But knowing now that I’m a girl, I really enjoy getting girly stuff to decorate my room with. Taking baths and doing skincare is also really nice.
Hi 👋🏼 

For me it’s wearing a white tee shirt without a binder. 

And the tiny facial hairs I have 🥲
being called a housewife by my friends
Lumē has a deodorant with the scent ""Silver Spruce"".  It may just be that I really couldn't smell things until recently, but I've never smelled anything like it.  It makes me so happy, and I just feel like myself when I'm wearing it.  It's masculine, but not overpowering like a lot of stuff for men that I've come across.

Oh shit, I've just realized I have a signature scent.  Weird.
whenever i get my hair cut (barbered) and its super short and fuzzy in the back and i just get to like rub it lol
press on nails since i can’t really do acrylics or grow natural nails because work. but having long colorful nails just feels so good lol
When people gender me correctly, when I wear a binder and my chest is a bit flatter; when I have a good day with my voice training and ny voice sounds super ambiguous, my new piercings and my fake septum lol, and DOC MARTENS
that pointlessly gendered, over-masculine deodorant. I will tell you all day about how stupid it is, and then I’ll go home and be like, “hehehe i smell like M A N now.”
The way my chest bounces when going up/down stairs. The gentler shape to my cheeks. The smooth softness of my tummy and waist. The way I instinctively cross my legs when I sit down, now. The way my hair cascades down the sides of my head. The quiet moments when I paint my nails.

All some very nice, small things.
One thing for me is being at work and someone mentions there being only one girl that works in the kitchen ☺️
Its not necessarily anything to do with gender but honestly, just reassuring myself that I'm on the right path towards my happiness and that at some point I'll be able to truthfully say ""I'm happy being me.""
Every time i get to my dress, every time I sound at least somewhat feminine and every time my friends use the correct name make me feel euphoric. Even better, one of them started using a nickname based on my new name and it's super cute and I love it.
Sleeveless shirts for some reason
mom allowing me to wear more masculine outfits and letting me get a haircut so now i have short hair!!

friends irl who support me and will hear me out whenever we talk about the lgtvhq community 

the thought of coming out when i move out and go live with my online homies where i can freely be myself!!!
I got a pedicure this weekend and did the clear gel on top and I can’t stop looking at my feet and thinking how pretty they look!
When I'm putting my bra on and get the hook on the first try.
Doing my nails, hair, makeup, etc...
Feeling my legs after I shave

You may be the only person to ever enjoy those damn pockets. Congratulations.
that’s so great! i’m glad you’re enjoying them. Any particular brand? I’m always looking for jean recs
Haré Wearing guys jeans but women's jeans are awesome. Only problem is my phone falling out of my pocket. 😅
that’s awesome 💗 thank u for sharing, dude
Oooo most have some type of signiture scent but aren't aware of it or can't pinpoint the actual smell so embrace it and make a candle for whoever u want to think of u when lighting it :D.
That short fuzz has a nice texture. I want to get my hair cut so bad right now. The bleach and dye it with my Splat pink fetish/mixed berry color dye, it starts out as an almost neon magenta and fades to sunset pink💖. And yeah I like pink and I’m going to be starting my ftm journey soon(hopefully).
music is definitely how i get through it all 💗 i smoke weed but lately it’s just bringing me anxiety :/ id like to replace some of that weed time with something else.. maybe more music?
Ehh, hard to give good recs since I mostly buy jeans from thrifts. My favorite pairs are actually low-rise bootcut jeans from the late 90's early 00's, especially my pair of H&G jeans with rhinestones and embroidery.  Low-rise denim finally returned to vogue and I'm happy to be rocking vintage. 😎👍"	vb2jk2	trans	40	0.97	2022-06-13 03:12:44

Apologies if this is the wrong sub, but a supervisor of mine just told me she will be transitioning soon and beginning the process to take hormones. What can I do to help her?	"We aren't extremely close but I reacted with joy that she felt comfortable telling me. She was born a man and is taking this step after 20 years of therapy. I voiced my encouragement and told her that it must have been so difficult to get to that point and she should be very proud.

It ended up being such a wonderful conversation. I suppose I did all I could, but is there anything I can keep in mind for our friendship as she goes through this?

Thanks friends:)"	"If you aren't close, I wouldn't do much. Don't ask personal or invasive questions or get ""too"" supportive (many trans people say it's a thing they've experienced). Don't out her to anyone without her permission. Don't deadname her unless she says it's okay. Probably don't imply she was ever a man or was born a man. 
Use her pronouns always, stand up for her when coworkers make transphobic jokes, which they absolutely will. Ask her how you can assist in her journey and what she needs in a good ally.
This is... *a* right sub. /r/AskTransgender would be better.

Since you're here though, the first thing you have to get - before anything else can make sense - is that she *wasn't* born a man. She was born a woman. Everything else flows from that.

By the same token, transition doesn't change a person's gender, it just makes trans people healthier and happier. She's not putting a woman costume on, she's talking a painful and ill-fitting man costume off, for the first time in her life.

It feels good. Feels better than you can know.

To help her, you need only to accept the above, that she is and always has been a woman, and to treat her as such. Treat her as you would any other woman.

More generally, 'support' isn't something you say or feel or even something you do to a particular person. It's something you do as part of your life.

When you encounter transphobia on the web or offline, stand up. Tell that person ""that's not okay to say'. Honestly, you don't have to convince them they're wrong (you cannot reason someone out of a view they did not reason themselves into) you just have to make people feel that it's not okay to say horrible things or act on evil thoughts.

Changing hearts and minds is a nice long term goal, but the priority is just stopping bullying. It really makes little difference if some percentage of the population will always hate us, so long as there is a general attitude in society that /it's not okay to say and do transphobic things/.

That means shaming and shunning people who say and do those things. When people feel that being transphobic earns them the derision and contempt of their cis/het/white/whatevs peers then they will stop doing it. When adults stop saying and doing those things, children will never learn to think them, and those things vanish from the Earth.

When you see someone who is trans, well, first realize that there's every chance you're wrong. But even if you're right, don't single them out. Treat them as you would anyone else - and address them according to how they are presenting (But be aware not all of us get to present authentically!). Don't let them know you 'clocked' them, even if you did.

And remember, you already know more trans people than you realise! You just don't know they are trans, either because they haven't come out (perhaps even to themselves) or because they are 'stealth' (that is, transitioned, passing and hiding their trans status).

We're *EVERYWHERE*. There are so, so many more of us than you realize and you certainly know more than one. Seriously. This next decade is going to blow some minds as people fully realize that.
>She was born a man

Ouch, her mom's vagina! 

But seriously. You don't need to do anything specific beyond using her pronouns and name. If you don't know much about trans people, educate yourself a little bit so you learn the things you shouldn't do, like ask her about her genitalia, or tell other people she's trans after she transitions.

>reacted with joy that she felt comfortable telling me

I don't know the exact situation, but don't assume that she has told anyone else at work. Don't bring it up with anyone else. It will likely be a while before she wants everyone to know.
Lovely of you to want to support her. Id just echo the thing about pronouns =) like, use ""she"" even when talking about her in the past, never mention her old name (if shes changed it), and correct others if they dont do those things - well meaning people are always saying things like ""then james told me he was really a she"" , rather than ""thats when janet told me she was really a girl"" - janet probably doesnt want her dead name aired to everyone  =p glad youre supporting your supervisor! xx
Other than the standard ""be a decent human being"" stuff, if you have also undergone female puberty, brief her on PMS and your coping mechanisms and keep an eye out for if she starts having PMS symptoms. While it is something we can look online for information about it, the information exists in a combination of ""a bit scary for us to think about"" and ""so much information we can't tell what is useful"", and that is without taking into account that we cannot be impartial observers of ourselves. If she's comfortable enough with you, you could even see if she would give you information on her scheduling so that you could stay extra vigilant when dosage would be at its most critical, especially if she gets injections.
Just remember her pronouns and her new name and you should be fine. She doesn't need your help, just your understanding.
Thank you for caring enough to ask, though
If she's anything like me, the last thing she wants anyone to do is make a big deal about it. The suggestions above are good though, especially those about her pronouns. 
Yeah you're right. She didn't tell me that her name had changed so I'll continue to call her Andy until she tells me otherwise.
Just a word on pronouns, it probably goes without saying really.. but ask her to tell you when to switch. In the early days it can become easy to accidentally 'out' someone before they're 100% ready to go full time. Remember it's her choice who to come out to, and her choice to tell people's she's transgender.

Oh and definitely, when new people come in.. don't tell them her secrets, her old name, etc. ""That's something you should probably discuss with her"" is a workaround whenever anyone puts you on the spot or gets too nosy.

Your post made me so happy to read. I appreciate the thought out response. I will make sure to think of it that way, I was more describing her physical gender at birth rather than saying she was a man at any point. I'm glad that you elaborated about that though.


I'll be sure to stand up against any negative comments I hear, as that is truly the way to change public perception of this.

Thank you:)
Yeah haha. So basically treat her like a human:) I can do that. And I wanted to tell a close friend but her husband worked with this person and I thought they'd prefer to tell everyone else in their life on their own terms.

Thanks for your response:)
We did talk about that a bit! She said that she was expecting to be a bit emotional, and I said that I totally understood hah. And we talked about it a little bit too.

Thanks for your response:)
“Don't deadname her unless she says it's okay.” Watch out there. Otherwise, you seem to be doing fine though. 
> I was more describing her physical gender at birth

See, this is exactly the sort of thing...

Now, before I go on, we all know that it's hard to get mood and intonation from text, so please read the following in the mood of ""patient and hopeful, smiling slightly"" - because I absolutely do not want you to think I am telling you off. I'm not.

Cis people tend to misuse the words sex and gender. They use them as synonyms, which they *aren't*.

Sex is a sort of generalization of physical characteristics. Remember, to a biologist, 'biological sex' is every bit as real as unicorns. Biology doesn't deal in sex, it deals in sex characteristics. Individual elements of an organism which are sexually dimorphic. If a specific individual has more of one kind of sexual characteristic then for simplicity, for the sake of... *bookkeeping* we can say it is one sex or the other - but that's all it ever is, a short-hand for ""this individual has mostly this kind of sexual characteristics, but perhaps a few of the other too.""

Sex characteristics are legion, but include things like the texture of your skin, where and how hair grows on your body and how fat is deposited - not just what shape your junk is.

Gender is not sex. Gender is, briefly, who you are. Gender is man or woman or other - gender is what words like 'he' and 'she' refer to. When I say your supervisor has always been a woman that's what I mean. Her gender was female long before she was born.

You may have heard the phrase ""gender identity"" - it's not one many trans people use. It was created to mean what gender actually means, because cis people think gender is another word for sex. Notice how ""gender identity"" is only ever used about trans people? It's othering and inacurate. We just have a gender, like you.

Our gender is different to the *sex* which was assigned at birth. That's all being trans is. When a child is born, the doctor or midwife or parents take a half-second look between its legs and *assign* a label based on what they see there. Normally they guess right, sometimes they guess wrong.

If you are curious, gender is in a real sense one more sexual characteristic. Gender is the emergent property of the shape and structure of the brain - which is itself sexually dimorphic. Gender is neuroanatomy and is largely set at the end of the first trimester of development.

There are girl brains and boy brains and some in between. Sometimes a baby is born which looks like a girl but has a boy brain, sometimes a baby is born which looks like a boy but has a girl brain. Sometimes a baby is born with a brain that's sort of somewhere in between. These people are trans people.

The prefix 'trans' means 'across', 'over from'. A transgender person is a person whose gender is different to the majority of their other sexual characteristics at birth.

People like us.

Which turned out to be a far longer explanation than I intended, but you get my point? Her gender was female and her sex was *assigned* on the basis of an educated guess, which turned out to be wrong.
I get it. And I appreciate the explanation. This stuff is hard to ask about because I know I use the wrong words to describe it sometimes, with no ill intent of course. I'll try to think of it that way and hopefully won't ruffle any feathers:) thanks again"	7nitx0	trans	38	0.97	2018-01-02 00:30:45
Im just so incredibly lost	Hello r/trans. I don’t know if these types of posts are allowed, I’ll delete if this is out of place. But basically Im an 18 year old person who doesn’t know where they belong or who they are. I’m assigned male at birth and I never had any problems with this until about 8 months ago. For the first 18 years of my life, I was a shy kind of reserved boy who was pretty awkward and annoying. I was pretty happy until puberty made me super depressed and anxious. Still though, I had a lot of happy moments. I started identifying as bisexual when I was 12 and I started embracing femininity and crossdressing when I was 17. I was a femboy for about a year and then I started questioning my gender around my 18th birthday. At first I brushed it off because I never had any prior signs of gender dysphoria. But then around March I got SUPER depressed. All of a sudden gender would not leave my mind. Now I can’t stop thinking about it. For months on end I’ve been in an internal struggle with myself about wether I’m trans or not. I’m severely depressed and I can’t even function anymore. I wish I was a trans woman. I reallllyyy wish I was a trans woman but for some reason I’m still not sure and it’s killing me. I’m afraid I’ll be humiliated and embarrassed and I’ll regret transitioning. More than anything I’m afraid I’m a fake trans person and that I’m just a confused cis boy. I don’t know who I am and at this point my life just seems useless. Nothing brings me joy and I don’t know what to do. I start college soon so I’ll probably end up presenting masculine and being depressed. I’m afraid if I present feminine and come out as trans I’ll be even more depressed. I don’t know anymore. 😭	"Hello me from 6 months ago.

I cant tell you if you are trans or not, nobody really can. Thats a deeply personal journey. Its also a separate question from ""should I transition."" You could do one but not the other if that makes you happy.

What I do know is this, despite the fact that I have been medically transitioning for a few months and more certain of myself for nearly half a year now, I still don't ""feel"" like a girl, and I ESPECIALLY don't feel like a woman. But I really, really want to be one. I've had fears in the past that I was wrong, that I wasn't trans, because I really wanted to be trans and transition and be seen as a woman, etc. For me, having those fears was proof enough that I was trans.

How can anybody feel like they are something when their entire lives they've been streamlined into some other experience? When every waking moment their own body feeds them a nonstop sensory nightmare of the opposite body? Nobody can be 100% certain of anything, and definitely not this. All we can do is follow our emotions.

You dont have to know for certain. Its enough to just follow your emotions and do what makes you happy. Don't feel like you need to put a label on it if thats too stressful. You can always start trying things and nope out if you realize it's not right for you. Even with medical transition, these things take a while. There is no pressure to do or not do a certain thing, but you should instead just try to do the things that make you happy.

It may be embarrassing or difficult at times, especially entering into a new space. Just know that post secondary schools are normally very accepting institutions. Hell, I even got on HRT through my schools Healthcare. But no matter what, dont focus on what some hateful types might think (provided you are physically safe). Focus on what makes you feel the most correct in your own body. Because at the end of the day the only person who has to live with your body 24/7 is you.
No doubt, it can be incredibly confusing when you're first grappling with feelings that your gender might not be what you were always told.

But you're not the first to walk this path, and plenty of people before you have put together some good resources to help you figure it all out. So let me pass you this [guide to gender questioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1460QwQM5S2Br8sPfv3HuKw1xrz7MBijrxv_cgoqL1F0/edit?usp=sharing), and my best wishes that you find the clarity you seek.
You are young and you have a lot of time to figure it out. I started living at 50. It took me 50 years to accept I was gay bi thought my feminine side was due to my being gay. Fast forward 6 years and my egg cracks. 2 weeks later I walked in to work as a woman on a Monday morning. I have seen most trans youngsters start their transition at college. I suggest you look into that. Once away from home just go for it. Look at my profile and see the pictures. If an old grey bearded man like me can look this good you will be fabulous. Also you need to see a gender therapist and get on depression meds. It helps a lot. Cheer up we are all rooting for you
Typically cis guys don't wish they were trans girls and I don't think I've ever met a cis person who has had debilitating depression and fear over the possibility that they might not be trans.  


Ultimately this is your journey to take and your identity to figure out, but bearing what I just said in mind, don't you think you owe it to yourself to just try ? Do something, anything you think would be affirming and see how it feels, doesn't have to be big, hell I cracked my own egg just calling myself a trans girl out loud at home; it was incredibly euphoric!  


Just take the least scary step you can think of and work your way out from there. A lot of people seem to think transitioning is this line you cross and you can't ever go back, but really it is what you make of it, what makes you happiest and comfortable.  
Make as many or as few big or little changes as you want and if things don't feel like you, stop. You can always turn onto a new direction or go back to whatever feels right to you.  


Wherever you end up, I am wishing you best I hope that your depression lessens with time and that you can truly flourish :)
You should read this to learn more about how gender dysphoria manifests:

[https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/)

As far as I know, this is the most detailed source that describes gender dysphoria. It should tell you a lot more about whether you are experiencing gender dysphoria, which would tell you that you may be trans.
I wasted many years wishing I was trans so I could transition. Turns out, cis guys don't think like that.

A lifetime of depression and anxiety has all but disappeared, since coming out. It's shocking how many people have commented that I'm visibly happier now.

Also, some years ago, I knew this severely annoying and unpleasant boy. They came out, and are a lovely young lady. It's amazing how liberating it can be, to be yourself.

I can't tell you who you are. Only you can do that.

But you don't sound confused. You sound scared. Which is something I'm familiar with. I would strongly suggest finding a local trans support group. They won't care how you're presenting, they'll be accepting. And just a little support will do amazing things.

And these days, colleges tend to be accepting, supportive, and you'll make friends who are also trans.
Thank you for commenting. My therapist really thinks I’m trans and she got me linked up with a psychiatrist and I’m starting meds soon. My psychiatrist also diagnosed me with depression and gender dysphoria so hopefully I can feel better soon. Also you have cool political takes. Based granny 🥰

I love being trans	"Exactly what the title says. I genuinely love being trans. I haven't, by any means, had my journey go entirely smoothly. My dysphoria drives me to tears, all my friends were forbidden from seeing me after I came out at age 15 (now almost 19), and I was sent to a religious form of conversion therapy. Despite this, I started testosterone six months ago, and now have a consultation for top surgery in a month. I can't put into words how happy it makes me to present as myself in public and be recognized as any other man. I want to eventually move out and go stealth, passing as a cis man, but I would not have been born as a cis man if I could relive my life.

When I get gendered correctly--which is a majority of the time, now that I'm on HRT--I feel waves of euphoria wash over me. This hasn't changed no matter how many times I'm referred to as a guy, it makes me just as euphoric each time, and I doubt many cis people feel this much joy just from existing as their gender. I know so many people here are struggling with intense social and physical dysphoria and don't know if it'll ever get better, but I promise you that trans joy IS real. We deserve to feel it, and I hope everyone here gets to experience true euphoria that lasts."	"My guy this was a happy read I'm so stoked for you!

My mother, the ally.	"I'm currently sitting in a room adjacent to my mother, while she listens to a lecture about queer history hosted by a local museum. She is genuinely curious how lgbtq+ folks lived in the past, what we suffered through. The fact that she has not only been the largest advocate for me during my transition, but continues to be invested in the history of our people out of her own curiosity, gives me such signifcant joy. 

This is a woman who, many years ago, told me she just didn't ""believe I was gay"" and ""didn't want me to screw up my life, making a bad name for myself"" when I came out as gay in my teens. A woman who vocalized that she ""just didn't get why gay people had to be so forward with their lifestyle"" and ""stole the rainbow"".

"Getting called ""She"" has gone from weird to joy"	"It's super early for me, start of week 7 or 8, but I'm out to more people and starting to get things rolling. A lot of the time the first questions are new name (still working on that, and my name is pretty masc coded, so I don't think I can keep it despite liking it) and new pronouns. I was genderfluid for, like a decade, so was used to different pronouns but didn't get ""she"" too often unless I was really, really femme, I'm not ""passable"", but told friends that I'm planning to move pasted ""They/them"" pretty quick because I have a destination in mind.

For a while, they'd occasionally slip ""she"" in there, and for several weeks I kept saying ""That's so weird to hear"" in relation to myself as the coding starts to get settled in.

Yesterday, despite the deep voice, thinning hair, belly that I need to lose, and minimal femme attire, they were calling me ""She"" and ""Her"" and yeah, it was still weird to hear it when I did, but it also made me smile.

Just wanted to share."	"Yea im also having an interesting time adjusting to hearing my new name and pronouns. My brain is like ""What? Who? Oh, me. OH! ME! YAY! Why did I not get that right away? Shouldn't it be more automatic?"" within like a nanosecond 💛
I can help with the voice if you ever need it!
Yeah, I don’t really ‘get’ she pronouns at this point
I'm probably gonna hit you up. I'm on a waiting list for personal training with a small local voice lab that has a few dedicated to gender coding voices, but while I wait I've only been able to practice with online tutorials, guidance would be much appreciated

I'm about to send this to my transphobic best friend. Wish me luck. CW: Mentions of Transphobia and mental illness	"My best friend of five years called to ask me about why I changed my pronouns in my bio and confronted me about being trans. This is my response to that conversation. I've been crying for almost two hours and could really use the support right now. Thank you.

&#x200B;

""Hey. I just want to apologize for not being strong enough to say this out loud but I knew this would happen eventually. I’m not one for long, sappy novels of text and I know you aren’t either so I’ll try to make it as brief as I can.

Firstly I just want to say that I am thrilled that you said you would be willing to consider using a different name and set of pronouns for me. That is wonderful to hear and it made a spark of joy. For that I thank you. However, like that comment, there are some strings attached. I don’t mean to be rude but by saying things like “I can try but I’ll never see you any different- and I don’t think I could even if I tried”, “If it makes you comfortable that’s alright… but I want don’t want to be uncomfortable, ya know?”, “Normally my approach to these things is just to not associate with it.” causes a slew of emotion for me. On one hand I understand your perspective. This isn't considered normal. This is something that is unfortunately considered taboo in many parts of the world. Though on the other hand it makes me feel ways that offended simply cannot cover. It breaks my heart. It fills me with rage. It makes me want to break down, cry, curl into a ball, and hide away in a dark corner forever. To me you aren’t just saying these things. You’re telling me that you will NEVER, in any capacity, see me as I see myself. You are telling me that no matter how hard I try I will never reach my goal of becoming something I know I already am- and that even if you lie to yourself, you'll never truly perceive me for my true self. On top of that, if lying to yourself doesn’t work you can always just pretend I don’t exist and that we never knew each other. That hurts. A lot.

I know what you mean when you say that you’ll never see me any different. I understand your confusion. However I ask that you please try to see mine. Everyday I wake up with a numbing buzz in my head. Over the past several years, and even since I was a little kid I always knew something was different about me from the other boys. I always got along better with my female classmates, I grew my hair super long, I painted my nails- hell in 9th grade I did a drag show and LOVED presenting femme. I didn’t understand it then. Countless nights of dreaming of simply living as a girl would make me so happy. I’ve always hated my body but I never understood why. I used to think it was because of my surgeries, but after years of counseling for that I came to find that I was okay with my surgeries. I still hated my body though. I still do to be honest.

When I was a child I used to have an imaginary friend named Jenny. She started coming around when I was really little and she would age with me as I grew. Jenny was one of my only friends I had in my early school years. She was stabbed through the heart and said that she was a version of myself from a past life. Whenever I would get scared, or sad, or angry she would comfort me and say that things were going to be okay. Eventually, one night she stopped showing up. Her voice was lost to me. I got so confused. She was everything I wanted to be. She was smart, sweet, strong, brave, caring, and beautiful. As the years went by my shoulders broadened, my voice lowered, I started growing facial hair and I hated all of it. My body was changing and forcing itself into something I didn’t want. As it changed, so did I. I became angry, confused, scared- at times even violent, reckless, and dangerous. I didn’t give a shit about my body because why should I? It’s not what I wanted. I felt like radio-static forcibly sealed into an ugly meat sack.

It wasn’t until after high school when I got away from all the forced relationships and false sense of what was important that fully I realized that I was trans. Checking out some communities, doing research, speaking with doctors, and several appointments would lead me to look back and piece together why I had so much anger boiling inside of me. I recently have begun to speak with a new doctor about HRT and...to be honest...I’ve already started. I’ve been on it for about three months. I have felt more alive in these past three months than I ever have. Nowadays I wake up excited to see what the day brings. Everyday is one step closer to becoming the amazing woman I was born to be.

If you get a chance I would like you to look up the terms “Gender Dysphoria” “Gender Euphoria” and “Dissociation”. That is a much better way of explaining it. It’s unending. I don’t expect you to understand, I just ask that you try to keep an open mind.

I’m so happy that you are willing to take these things into consideration but I need you to understand that this is something I’m going to do regardless of anyone's input because it’s for myself. I need to do this to live a truly fulfilling life. If you aren’t comfortable I understand but I am not going to keep myself repressed for the comfort of others anymore. You are one of my family. I will always think of you as such, and I will always support you on your journeys. Even if our paths should eventually part ways. I do truly care about you with all of my heart, and I hope to continue to know you for many years to come. I understand if you need time to process however. I think I might need to do some as well.

Your friend,

Lindsey (Formerly known as \*\*\*\*)"""	"That is very well said:)

A big hug for you! 

I know making these kinds of letters can be exhausting emotionally! 

You obviously care a lot about your friend and i really hope he turns his lack of knowledge into  supportive wisdom:)
The part where you talk about your imaginary friend burst me into tears. I feel it in my bones right now. A lot of people used to have imaginary friend during childhood, and they were always so conforting. But now they are just memories and I can't even remember when they stoped existing.

I imagined you transitioning and being able to see Jenny again, appearing in the mirror, smiling at you with tears of joy and euphoria.   


You deserve to be loved. I know your friend might sound a bit close minded, but I'm sure you will become a wonderful woman. And you'll prove him how wrong he was.

First time	So i just shaved my legs for the first time and could not believe how invigorating it was. Sitting in bed just feeling the smooth skin. It just filled me with such joy. I have a lot of weight to lose still and I'm hoping to soon start hrt, but what an amazing feeling. I wish i would have just accepted how i felt sooner.	"Good for you! I remember  the feeling,  one of my favorite feelings ever when I started shaving full time! 🙂
Lmao it feels fucking amazing doesn't it.
It's awesome, isn't it? 

I've been shaving for a few years now, and I still can't get over how amazing it feels to just lie in bed and feel my smooth legs rub against one another.  🥰
My leg hair grows to fast and too thick for shaving to be effective i went through 6 razor blades in 3 days and that was only shaving mt legs twice and wax is too expensive so im going to go the extra step and get a home laser hair remover
I knew there had to be a few who still remember that first time. Its such a difference because of how freaking hairy i normally am.

Dysphoria much worse after starting HRT	"I started HRT three weeks ago. The first two were great, I felt more comfortable in my own skin, I felt euphoric, I felt like I was finally making progress. There was even a moment where I looked in the mirror and liked how I look. It felt like I'd felt joy for the first time.

Now, for the last few days, the dysphoria is worse than ever. Before HRT, chest and bottom dysphoria was usually mild. Now it's this gnawing discomfort I struggle not to focus on.

I never had much social dysphoria l, but now that I've also come out to my close family and two roommates, I so acutely feel the difference between how I see myself and how other people see me. I feel like no one will ever see me as a girl.

It doesn't bother me so much with people I'm not out to but my roommates haven't gendered me right once and still struggle with dead naming me. It's getting to the point where I want to go hide and cry every time they misgender me.

It's like the closer I get to being who I want to be, the worse the vast difference between how I see myself and how other people see me hurts. I keep feeling like I should just give up and go back to being a guy. 

I'm not going to, but whenever it gets better it gets worse too."	"I feel this so hard. I literally was just having this issue last few weeks. I just started HRT almost a month ago, and I was reeeallly struggling last week especially with major dysphoria and feeling like I'm never gonna get where I want :/ like why bother, but its a long process and we gotta be strong. My family still dead names me, and misgenders me but honestly its kind hard for others to break that cycle just like we have to as well. Not saying its great or fun or even something we should have to deal with in a perfect world but sometimes it takes time for others to transition their thoughts and words too. I can for sure say its weird cause I barely hear she/her and its off putting and almost makes me sad cause I feel like I'm not a real girl and don't deserve those pronouns. But thats not true either lol. I know we can both make it to our goals though! So keep it up sister! We can do this :)
Why not wait and socially transition later on. After you have been on HRT for a year. By then you will look the part. If you practice your voice for at least 6 months you should make some progress there too.

Don't try to change too many things at once. Take it in smaller steps."	x640p4	trans	31	0.93	2022-09-05 02:00:31
I asked out my childhood friend after coming out!	"I mtf (22) will refer to myself as J and my friend as A. sorry for the direct writing style I'm on the spectrum and non science based writing is my weakness. I just really need to share this bc AHHHHHHHH!

When I was young I grew up in a very tight knit community of LGBTQ+ people, witches, druids, and more where I met A in a youth group. Since 2nd grade we would joke and laugh as the two quieter kids sitting in the corners and this quickly resulted in a child like friendship. Year after year as the youth group grew and new faces were added we became more of who we now are as adults. Me the tall chaotic one who always tried to make A laugh and A as the brilliantly weird and caring person they still are (yes I currently have a crush if its not obvious by my writing). During highschool we became more distant from each other as we both made good friends both inside the youth group and outside during our daily lives. I began to try to ignore my feelings for A as I knew that dating within the group was a taboo (trying to minimize drama if things ended poorly) but at every event we went to we kept running into each other and resorting to our old friendship we both clung to as children. One night we were playing sardines in an old church (reverse hide and seek) and got separated as we all spread out (to look for clues lol) to find the lone hider but after an hour no one could find the hider. exploring the dark corridors I saw a figure standing illuminated at a window with arms outstretched looking at me, or at least I thought it was. Giving out a yell at the sight the figure turned around to look at me to reveal A who was ""enjoying the moonlight"". It seems odd but them scaring me like that by just being their weird self was the moment I began to have stronger feelings for them. 

I refused to act on my feelings due to the rules of our group and as we graduated highschool it became clear that I needed to work on myself and figure out who I was. At this point I had come out as nonbinary (the only out NB person in our community of 200+) and was a very vocal advocate for trans rights and proper education about what NB is and how to respect NB people. Culminating in a speech where I came out to the entire community and educated even elder LGBTQ on trans existence (which was met with very positive feedback and at one point I had an elder LGBTQ tell me they wish they had been like me at that age). This might seem unrelated but I'll get to that. 

College came and went for both of us and I found myself back in my hometown for an extended period of time when I ran into A. We hadn't stayed very well in touch during college, both of us growing up during those 4 long years I had come out at a transwoman. While I was initially worried about how I would be seen by A, it became quickly clear that my fear was misplaced. A had come out as NB, and that my speech on NB existence and how to respect NB people, had helped them realize who they were. Knowing I was no longer bound to the groups old rules and that I could act on how I still felt. Seeing their smile and hearing their laugh even as a memory makes me feel a joy I've never really experienced. So I asked if they wanted to date. They smiled and looked at me with those eyes and said yes. Turns out they had been waiting a while for me. 

We had our first date yesterday. I will post that update tomorrow if anyone wants to know more."	"Update on date....YES Please. Share the joy you have found with the rest of us. It is a rare and precious commodity we seldom get to experience. ❤❤❤
PLEASE UPDATE OMG this sounds like a romance manga but irl, it's incredible.

The joy of being a trans couple. At least they're not too similar		estradiol runs debian	hrtwkx	trans	27	0.95	2020-07-15 19:11:50
Just left egg_irl. I didn't want to, but it's making me suffer internally.	"I love trans memes. I love reading them, laughing and being able to share the joy with my other trans friends. 

But, the amount of transfem memes that appear every single time I open this app, is crushing my soul. 

Now, do not misunderstand. I am **not** against transfem people in any way, shape or form. 

The fact is, I am transmasc. So maybe you can imagine how it goes... 

*Example:* I open the app, I read the ""top"" part, giggle etc. because I assume how the punchline or whatever might go, read the ""bottom"" part and get jumped by **something something girl**

I insert myself immediately into the situation (and I can't control that I've tried), so in the end I get hurt by calling myself a girl, fem, woman etc. 

Now, that's one example of how it damages my own self esteem. 

The second is basically feeling sort of left out. 
I **know** not everyone is transfem there, and there's still transmasc memes every once in a while, but you must admit (if you've been in the sub) that the fem population is much higher, so naturally there will be more mtf memes than the other way around. 

(This is not only that sub, the transfem community is most definitely higher here on Reddit.) 

And it f*cking sucks. I want to be able to laugh and relate to more transmasc memes, but there's just not that many. 

If you want to, go to the subreddit right now. You'll see by most liked, all of it is basically transfem memes. For every fifth transfem meme, you get one that's transmasc or gender neutral.

I feel *uncomfortable in my own skin*, in a f*cking trans subreddit, I feel *lonely*. 

I wish there were more even gender neutral options, but there's nothing I can do about it. 

I'm not so funny or whatever to be able to make my own memes. And what's the point of that, because I know how the meme goes. 

If only there were more masc people so we could build our own empire of memes, as beautiful as the transfem communitys' is. 

... 

Or maybe I'm just crazy and I get all these fem memes, even though I am not a woman. 



***Thanks for reading my rant!! :)***"	"That place exists it‘s r/transmasc_irl  
Also check out r/transfellowship xD 

Edit: I also think most meme subs could benefit from a tag for transmasc or transfem.  
Sadly many people don‘t feel like using those in mixed spaces, especially transfem when they already dominate the sub (looking at R/translater, which I left because it was 99% transfem posting selfies. Just too much to stay comfortable in as a supposedly not selfie-centered sub. They claim they‘d like more trans men in there, but yeah … I DOUBT it highly.)
Reddit is mostly trans femme.  r/ftm
I've noticed something strange. Reddit has mostly transfems, while Tumblr has mostly transmascs. Why is that?
As a trans woman I feel similar. I still sub to most of the trans related stuff so I don't miss anything important or whatever, but I am definitely not that demographic anymore. I don't have as many issues with dysphoria, I don't live with my parents, most of my life problems are just regular boring adult stuff. I've just gotten past transitioning related problems. 

I do find myself more relating with the lesbian subs and their memes though so I guess I've just found my fix elsewhere. Be the change you want to see- as cringy as that always sounds.
Hi. I agree with the fact that there is an imbalance in this subreddit, but I think it's important to not focus on whether content is directed towards transfem or transmasc, specifically. We're all dealing with being trans, and it is a very difficult and alienating process. I picture it like an umbrella we are all under. I'm sorry that you're feeling uncomfortable, but know that there are people on this subreddit that have your back. I get emotional when I see any posts on here where the person is able to change themselves in the pursuit of happiness. It takes a lot of courage to transition, even the small steps can feel like leaps at times. I wish you nothing but love and happiness, and I'm rooting for you.
Thanks so much for tagging those! 

But even with the r/transmasc_irl (or r/transfellowship) look at the tiny amount of people in it! It just can't compare to the size of egg_irl, which makes me sad. Now I feel like there's only around 5-6 thousand transmasc dudes. 

But I'm definitely glad there's a place where I can enjoy some more transmasc memes! :) 

As you've mentioned in your edit, I've been in that subreddit as well, left that shit too. While I'm happy for everyone who enjoys the content, I can't, it causes distress, same as egg_irl.

Also just not interested in selfies as much. 

And as for the tags - hell yes, we need those!!! It doesn't even make sense for the trans subreddits (unless they're specifically tailored for fem or masc or gender neutral) to not have them, when the trans experience is immensely diverse, based on your sex and gender.
Yeah I know :). I'm happy the fem people have found their people, just wish I could magically *spawn* in more masc boys.

Edit: Also thanks for tagging that subreddit. For some reason I haven't followed it. 🤦‍♂️

Edit2: I just realized I'm using my other account and not the main one. It all makes sense now.
We need someone to make r/FtMemes

Edit: oh wait that actually exists and it’s a different thing oops

Edit edit: there are other subs which do this such as r/transmasc_irl and so my comment is rather pointless
Probably the fact that Reddit mostly consists of cis men and tumblr mostly consists of cis women, so any trans men probably are more likely to start off on tumblr and trans women on Reddit before they realize they are trans
There are probably more transmasc on reddit, but not everyone is into memes. Or they don‘t know subs for them exist.  
Took me a while to collect a list of trans subs, there is one for almost everything haha  
But reddit is definitely a transfem place. I hear tumblr is mostly transmasc, but also quite toxic at times. (and young!)  

Oh hey, a fellow translater expat! Hope you found us in r/FTMover30.
I'm sure if they are orher masc boys, they too feel the place is too much made for transfems. Ftm does not have that much memes tho, does it ? I'm transfem but I lurked there to try and be supportive but I'll admit I don't relate to tons of things
As an anime fan, it cracks me up that r/ftmemes is a fairy tail subreddit.
Yeah that makes sense!
We are, after all, all different human beings, it's okay if you don't relate to everything, that's not possible haha. 

And thanks for your support! :)

what happened with eden is tragic and devastating. please take care of yourselves, please stay safe.

her acc on twt is cyberangelfeary if u wanna read her last tweet it goes into detail but please only do so if ur in a good place mentally for that as its very triggering

summary: her parents hired people to lure her back to saudi arabia but she was under the impression they would ""fix"" her relationship with her parents. the people were basically grooming(?) her to convince her to detransition, and she eventually ended up back in saudi arabia with her parents who monitored her heavily and made her stop taking hrt. she ended up committing suicide.

Read as woman for the first time ever	"Hi everyone!
I'm 33, just decided I'm going into hrt a few days ago. I don't see myself passing as a female yet, but clothes on and specially mask on, I feel I'm reaching some point...

So I went to the cinema and after the movie I went to the toilet. Men's was on one side of a big hall and women's was the other side. Approaching the door, men's as usual, was this guy like a door keeper who just said ""women's is the other way"", pointing me the direction. It kinda woke me to what was going on and my sugar levels started to rise in joy. I just forgot I had to pee. This is the first time someone explicitly reads me as a female without knowing me, and in a public space."	"The first time I was recognized by a stranger as a woman was a euphoria I’ll never forget! Congratulations!!
Such a cool feeling when that happens… it means you’re well on your way! 😊🙋🏻‍♀️. Best wishes for more of those moments!
congratules! Keep on doing you!
Omg that's so great. I understand the feeling, best thing ever. I was shocked too when I passed for the first time after puberty. I'm 18 and since I let my hair grow out last year, I started passing some of the time, even w/out makeup on. Before those events I'd always felt like passing was not even close to possible, children at my sports club even told me they felt like I was a woman (I'm not out at my sports club), which goes to show how intuitive children are
Much appreciated! 💜
Thank you very much!
💗
Wow that's the feedback we need, right? Children. That thing around ""I see you"" and ""I feel you"". They're the best. I think we all can recover that openness.
I have 3 nephews which are the kids around me and I'm sure they get me, although they don't say it.

Crying over FFS before and after pictures TW: past s/ attempt	"Out of curiosity I looked up FFS and found a website that showed before and after pictures. I have a very masculine face, big forehead and nose, deep brow ridge, wide jaw. But while looking at these pictures I thought ""I could fix this face, i have a chance to look like me and not just a male version of me"" and I started sobbing.

Full on breakdown as the relief hit me wave after wave of mixed bitterness and joy. I know its far off, I haven t even started HRT yet but the thought that someday I could look at my face and just be happy with what I see looking back at me...

I feel like I’ll be closeted forever…	"I (26, mtf) feel like I’m never getting out. I only started questions about 6 months ago and my egg properly cracked over New Years.

My wife and I moved to a new city about a year ago so I could go back to uni. Late November we got pregnant (super excited 😁) but this, in combination with her being 100% cishet had me super worried about coming out. While not overtly transphobic she definitely doesn’t have any exposure to trans people and comes from a fairly conservative Christian background. She very much has the outlook of “people can identify however they like, and do whatever makes them happy. After all it doesn’t effect me.”

Unfortunately, this time it does.

Then tonight she just completely broke down in tears. Telling me how much she’s struggled to make friends at her new work, how none of her friends from back home have kept in touch and she feels like I’m her only lifeline. Part of this I know is because she’s been really badly effected by prepartum depression but she has talked about this isolation before. 

I feel like if I do come out it’s going to the end of our marriage, and now I feel like I’ll also be taking away her only support. The fact is I love her so much, and I don’t want to put her through this while she’s struggling with her pregnancy, but the longer I leave it the harder it’s going to be. I also feel that right now she would view it as such a betrayal that she may cut me off completely, which would break my heart.

I’m really just feeling alone, I’m sure others have been through the same but I’m finding it so hard to hang on to that feeling of comfort and joy I had when I first realised “I am a woman”."	"This is a tough situation all around. I’m so sorry, but also congratulations! My recommendation would probably be to open up a dialogue between you two, without speaking in absolutes regarding your gender or where you intend on it potentially going. Just about how you’re feeling. Then take it from there.
feeling heard makes me feel just the littlest bit better. Thank you. 

I wasn’t really expecting advice when I posted but this could be really helpful. I hadn’t even thought something like that was possible (it’s all pretty new to me too haha)
Heh, sorry if it wasn’t necessarily wanted. I like to try and help where I can to ease people’s minds a bit when it seems like they need it. For what it’s worth I was scared my wife would reject me as well, but I started opening up to her about it and she was surprisingly receptive. Just don’t go in too heavy handed, that will get the worst reaction out of most people. Good luck love <3 hugs if you want them
Quite the opposite! I’m really grateful for the advice, just meant that I wasn’t fishing for it.
I’m glad it went well for you, makes me feel a little bit more hopeful. And I always want hugs. I’ve always hated how guys don’t seem to get as many. Hope I can return them some time.
Wow, can’t believe I forgot to mention my wife is Catholic so the religious background comparison is there too. I really am tired as heck. I thought it and didn’t type it lol! Hugs are another funny change for me. I used to not like being touched, now I want hugs all the time 🤣
That’s nuts, I’m bloody exhausted too so I don’t blame you.

I’ve always loved hugs, I just crave the physical connection. Used to get ribbed something proper by they boys at school for hugging a girl I was mates with whenever we saw each other 😂
Seriously thanks, I feel so much better than I did an hour ago
Damn, I believe it. I’d lose my mind if i got passed up for a hug now. 🤣 I am really tired though - I’m gonna hit the hay. Gn love :)
Don’t even mention it <3 I have an open DM policy too. Take advantage of it if you’d like :)"	sg8ezd	trans	26	0.88	2022-01-30 12:42:37
So it just dawned on me.	"I have an appointment with an endocrinologist in March. (Scheduled it last month.) And just today the realization hit me. ""Wait... I'm actually doing this... like I could soon actually begin to start looking like the me I want to be! This isn'ta dream, I am actually taking steps towards this!"" And now I have to stop myself from screaming with joy at work due to the glee I feel for myself! 

For once in my life, I did something I am proud of myself for doing!

What was your: ""Oh crap! This is a reality and I can barely hold back my excitement."" Moment?"	"My appointment is on Friday and I keep having this moment. I’m so excited for you!
Running down the stairs and my new boobs were bouncing and hurt!
I'm so excited for you! My 1 year HRT anniversary is December 7th, and I love what it's done and continue to be excited over what else it will do over the next few years. I cannot even begin to imagine stopping it now. I'm so happy you're taking time to feel proud of yourself! You should be so proud! Go you!
When I scheduled my appointment it felt so far off, only two weeks, which I know is short considering others' situations, but it hit me that it was happening two days before the appointment. I was hit by the train of nervousness, yet excitement. It felt unreal and I thought life would throw a curve ball and stop the appointment from happening. On the day of, my heart was leaping out of my chest. I still hadn't believed it. During the appointment, I was in disbelief. After the appointment, prescription in hand, I didn't believe it. 

Even when I took my first dose I didn't believe it. 

It's a magical experience. And even a month in I'm still gathering my feeling every time I hold the pills in my hand. Not once have I regretted taking them, or had the thought that it wasn't right. Just ""oh shoot. I'm really taking it...""

Good luck with your appointment! Be your truest self~
I might be on the slippery slo... I mean the pipeline into it... 

I've kept silent about being trans for 10 years, most of that time even to myself... 

It feels like I blinked, and all of a sudden, I have a Finasteride and Minoxidil prescription, 4 skirts, 6 bras (some with surprise padding), and an IPL machine. I had a few things before this, but these all happened so fast. 

I've also noticed instead of feeling like a boy wanting to be a girl, I actually feel girly sometimes. (I mean... I could feel girlier for sure, but I've noticed the change in mentality)

I wish I could increase the pace, but it's scary to think of what's ahead...
When my mom's co-workers started calling me by my preferred name. While I may not have the most out-there parents, hearing that I'm accepted into this world bit by bit really was a wake-up call. :)
Maybe not excitement per se, but I distinctively remember when I was finally ""all in.""

My first appointment for HRT, where I knew was just going to be a chat and getting a blood draw to check my levels before starting got delayed. I talked with the office staff and they were able to give a fair timeline for how this stuff usually goes. It was initially for early December and had to get rescheduled for a little less than two weeks before Christmas. I knew that I was going to have to wait 2 weeks for a follow-up. With the holidays coming up, I was going to have to wait for January before I could get my next appointment. No biggie.

I got my blood draw done at Quest Tuesday. One of the tests they only ran on I think Thursday, but they had to mail it to the central lab for that. Due to scheduling (holidays) I was getting my draw after that day's package went out and with their overnight shipping it still wouldn't be there in time to start the labs. Shit. This is going to be cutting it close.

I follow it on their web portal and watch as it starts getting processed. I get an estimated completion of the day before my appointment. *Whew*, just in the nick of time.

Even up to the second appointment, I wasn't 100% sure I was actually trans or that HRT was right for me. 90-95%, sure, but not 100%. I needed to try it and I was convinced that I'd know fairly shortly if this was really right for me. There was plenty of me that wanted it to be wrong, for me to hate it, and realize I was just being silly about the whole thing.

So, at the second appointment the doc said that she didn't get the blood work from quest. No biggie, they probably just didn't send it. She sent off the nurse to check with quest while we continued about treatment. A few minutes later the nurse comes back in and asks to speak with the doctor out of the office. This is telehealth btw, so while they're both gone I log into quest to check myself. Blood work wasn't complete.

I was fine at first. But after a few minutes it started sinking in; I wouldn't be starting HRT yet. A few minutes longer, and I'm straight up ugly crying. And I'm not talking like regular ugly crying, I couldn't even swallow so on top of the tears and snot I'm drooling too; I'm just an absolute mess. I can't remember a single time crying that hard before.

About 10 minutes later the doc comes back. One of the tests had taken longer, and quest was waiting for everything before sending it over. However, through a phone call they were able to get the rest faxed over and the last test wasn't really needed for the initial perscription.

It was in that doctor's appointment, or reflecting on it once I calmed down, that anything even resembling doubt was gone. I was fully committed to making this work and starting down a path that I knew I wouldn't turn around on. It's probably the most internally affirming thing I've ever experienced.
Good luck on Friday!!!

This is my story	"I knew I wasn't female in 9th grade, I started putting the pieces together while 2 of my friends were discussing their gender crisis in the changing area quietly near me. 

I knew I wasn't a girl and didn't want to wear a dress to my mom's wedding but we bought one anyways (they didn't get married thank the Gods). I remember telling my Nana that I was going to wear a suit to her wedding and her asking ""a pantsuit?"" and me not wanting to argue I said ""yea sure"" 

I knew I was trans while me and my ex were dating because I told him I felt masculine and not like a girl. I just didn't know then what I know now. 

I knew I was trans while dating my most recent ex because I had a dream that someone called me ""trans boy"" and in the dream I smiled and my heart swelled with joy. 

And yet even after I told him he still called me ""wifey"" and ""beautiful"" and ""future mother of my children""."	"you tell them🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Atta boy, sounds like you’ve got a lot more of your story left
One might say that dreams allow us to peer into the soul. I remember in middle school, I was a girl in a dream, and it was an indescribable feeling. I woke up and I would often think about it. I wish you the best on your journey
I hope so
Ah yes, I’ve had a few of those dreams the most recent one was the one that finally had me stop questioning because in my dream I was ACTUALLY happy. Now I am happy, even though I’m only just beginning
Thank you, I wish you the best on your journey as well!
I've unfortunately only had one dream, but I'm glad to see other people who have had dreams like mine.
Yeah, that feeling of not being alone is always nice for sure!"	sg13pj	trans	27	0.92	2022-01-30 04:48:04
Enjoying a little sister love 💓	Yesterday I was on the train coming home. As I was walking to the front of the train I waited a few seconds for a woman to adjust her hair. She was partially blocking the isle. I nudged by her slowly. After I passed her with a joyful playful voice she looked up at me and said nice boots with a big smile. I was smiling ear to ear. Thank you I squeaked out lol. I got home and my neighbor complimented me on my earrings. More smiles. Very validating! Love to y'all ❣️	"Aww that honestly sounds amazing

Just had my first laser hair removal appointment	"I'm very emotional about this and I don't have anyone else I can talk to about it, but I am so happy. I'm MtF but I'm not out to anyone. I didn't know what to expect going into the clinic for my consultation today, but I could not have been happier. For the first time in my life I used my real name and pronouns, and everyone there was so kind and friendly. 

To be called by my real name made me feel on top of the world. 

They were very knowledgeable and walked me through the processes and payment plans, and I even got my first treatment today free. I walked out of there and sobbed with joy in my car, and I'd be lying if i said i wasn't crying while typing this out. Any doubts or inhibitions that I had died in that clinic with my old name."	"I am so happy to read that. Congratulations Hun. I know it's a big step :) <3
Congratulations! I got my first treatment two days ago myself, but I haven't been brave enough to come out in public yet. I'm getting other things waxed tomorrow. I'm glad it went well for you.
Congrats! I’m on my last few laser sessions and I can say it’s worth every penny!
I have my consultation tomorrow, and I’m super nervous!  I’m only out to my wife and therapist, and not presenting femme in public at all yet. I’ve read lots of reviews that the place I’m going to is trans friendly, so that’s good. Any advice?  Questions I should ask?
Thank you <3. Im sitting in my car trying to stop crying over it so I can go back into my apartment and not look stupid lol
I went to Milan Laser Hair Removal, and I know they do things a bit differently than a lot of other places do. My best advice is be honest with them about what you are looking for, but only do what is in your budget. Im pretty hairy, so I have to end up doing pretty much everything from the neck down, but due to financial reasons I'm just starting with my underarms and working my way around. It stings but no worse than a tattoo, and it's ALOT quicker. 

They had a cancelation so they were able to get me in for my first session right after the consultation, but I wish I had waited because they has to dry shave the area and that definitely made it hurt a but worse. They told me to shave the area they are working on the day before the session, and only clean with soap and water. Don't apply any lotions, oils, or anything else to your skin and try to stay out of the sun. The laser (at least the one they used on me) targets the pigment of the hairs, so anything that either adds pigment to your skin or covers up the hairs will affect your results. 

Good luck! It's going to be so worth it for the both of us, and I'm already giddy for my next appointment :)
Crying doesn't make you look stupid. 


Holding all your emotions in so people around you think you're a robot, that makes you look stupid. 


Cry your heart out and then go get comfy and have a good evening/night/day whatever time of day it is where you at.

Finana Ryugu Appreciation Post	"(For context: Finana Ryugu is a Vtuber of Nijisanji EN, and recently banned the t-slur anime fans love to throw around from her channel & spoke in support of trans people. As a response she got attacked, causing her to unban the word again)

Dear Finana,      
I just wanted to express my gratitude for taking a stance, it was a clear sign to me (and probably also to other trans ryuguards & ryugals) that I am welcome and can feel safe in your streams, which really meant a lot to me.       
Also, I had kind of a shitty week, but hearing your explicit support made it so much better, so thank you for that as well.

I am sorry that people attacked you for doing what you felt was right (and for the record, I think it was the right thing to do), but I want to show you that you are appreciated, and that doing that had a direct positive impact. So please, don't feel bad for what you did, and don't pay the hate you got too much attention <3.   

So please remember, no matter what happens, you made at least one trans Ryugal very happy with what you did, and probably much more than that. u/Finana_Ryugu , thank you so much for being awesome!

A trans Ryugal who you gave a lot of joy"	"Thank you for openly supporting the Feesh! The hateful mob tried to drown any discussion with attacks and bad faith arguments, so in turn we need to voice our support just as loud or louder.

Yes.
It is about ""Tr*p"", which is why I specified anime community.      
and despite what banana said, it still gets used as a slur quite often.    

(I had once a person tell me ""You are not a Woman, you are just a Tr*p"", and you cannot tell me it wasn't used as a slur there)
The word has always meant a man that dresses feminine and looks effeminate to the point where they are very attractive in a feminine sense, but they still are a man and identify themselves as such. In anime.

If people are using it incorrectly and using it to refer to MtF trans people, they're wrong, and you're giving them the power and satisfaction by taking offense.

Tr\*p (apparently the word is banned) is a silly word and the outrage around it makes all of this very silly. Next time someone calls you that just tell them not to worry because you're a woman and if they think you're a tr\*p it must mean they think you're sexually attractive/hot.

The Vtuber has already backpedalled her statements, released a video, deleted her tweets and called it a day so there goes that.
You really show how privileged you are with your lack of understanding of how slurs & offense works. 

First the offensive thing is not the word per se, but what is expressed with the word, in this case the denial of who I am.     
Also, the reason slurs etc are so hurtful isn't b/c they indifidually are bad, but the sum total of ALL the slurs, discrimination etc eats at you, and every new slur is putting a finger in the wound. In itself it would not be that bad, but with everything else it is really painful.

> giving them the power and satisfaction by taking offense 

that is complete bs, that is not how that works. you can't just decide to not take offense, and you thinking otherwise shows your lack of familiarity with discrimination.

If you think it is such a silly word, why tf are you insisting on using it then?? There are a lot of other words you can use, like femboy, tomgirl, heck, even Queen, so why insist on using the one term where a group of people has told you it hurts them.     
If it is such a silly word, you shouldn't have an issue with not using it.


Finally, by calling Fina ""the Vtuber"" instead of Finana, Fina, Feesh, Fish or anything like that, it really seems like you don't watch her at all, so why do you care? Is your favourite emotional support slur getting banned anywhere really such an issue for you?     
Also, Feesh didn't backpedal her support, didn't delete her tweets, and the fact arseholes like you bullied her into unbanning a word she is uncomfortable with really isn't the win you think it is.
>You really show how privileged you are with your lack of understanding of how slurs & offense works.

Thanks but you wouldn't know the first thing about me.

>First the offensive thing is not the word per se, but what is expressed with the word, in this case the denial of who I am.Also, the reason slurs etc are so hurtful isn't b/c they indifidually are bad, but the sum total of ALL the slurs, discrimination etc eats at you, and every new slur is putting a finger in the wound. In itself it would not be that bad, but with everything else it is really painful.

You mean the sum total of all ""words"" that can be offensive to you, eats at you.If that ain't privilege I don't know what is.

That's life, i can think of at least 5 words off the top of my head that can be way more offensive and those words aren't considered ""slurs"", not even here.  


>that is complete bs, that is not how that works. you can't just decide to not take offense, and you thinking otherwise shows your lack of familiarity with discrimination.

That is how it works, both meanings of the word are not at all related to trans people, people become offended because they misenterpreted the word, creating a new ""slur"".

&#x200B;

>If you think it is such a silly word, why tf are you insisting on using it then?? There are a lot of other words you can use, like femboy, tomgirl, heck, even Queen, so why insist on using the one term where a group of people has told you it hurts them.If it is such a silly word, you shouldn't have an issue with not using it.

The word is fine, i'm not going to stop using it, in a situation where it's vtubers and anime (which is this situation) it has no reason to be replaced. Plus none of those words fit except for maybe femboy, but I'll never use femboy, i feel gross just thinking about it.

&#x200B;

>Finally, by calling Fina ""the Vtuber"" instead of Finana, Fina, Feesh, Fish or anything like that, it really seems like you don't watch her at all, so why do you care? Is your favourite emotional support slur getting banned anywhere really such an issue for you?

More like the desperate need to create more ""slurs"" by taking something from a different community and putting your own little spin on it just so it can be interpreted as an insult bothers me a bit.

&#x200B;

>Also, Feesh didn't backpedal her support, didn't delete her tweets, and the fact arseholes like you bullied her into unbanning a word she is uncomfortable with really isn't the win you think it is.

She did and arseholes like me probably wouldn't be bothered to bully anyone because I'm on the outside looking in on the whole fiasco and thinking its all just too silly to take seriously.I'm just here to say that whatever this situation is, it has to stop. And the ""t-word"" isn't going to go away because of your recent breakthrough discovery in it's so called opression.
>Thanks but you wouldn't know the first thing about me.

you sound like every other edgy cishet white guy

>become offended because they misenterpreted

lmao no, people use it specifically to hurt us, and that is why it is a slur. the fact that you refuse to listen and even consider that that is what is happening really shows a lot about you

>She did

[she still didn't](https://twitter.com/RyuguFinana/status/1542265196244344835)

also, the fact that you are this pissed off despite being on the outside, lol. really embarrasing, feeling the need to bully someone b/c they did something that doesn't affect you, just because it means you hypothetically couldn't be an arsehole if you ever where to watch her streams lol.      
You are quite the pathetic arsehole, her core community clearly supported her original decision, or at the very least didn't mind.   
But you, oh no, you had to come into a place that was entirely fine without you, proceeded to hurt others, and now feel righteous b/c you and your priviledged arse don't understand how discrimination works. Go educate yourself."	vowvzd	trans	22	0.8	2022-07-01 09:41:00
This is my first ever post in a trans subreddit	"First of all, hi.

This post will be just a vent. Any advice will be welcome, but I am making this post primarily for myself. As I said, this is my first time ever posting something in a trans-related sub. I've been on femboy subs and non-binary subs, but never on a fully-fledged trans sub.

I wanted to post something here because recently I rediscovered a part of me. I've been dealing with a lot of depression during 2021, and some aspects of myself were kinda rotting away. For example, makeup.

I had to wear it again, recently, after so many months. To see my face so clear and pretty after so long sparked something that I thought lost: the joy of looking myself at the mirror, and seeing a more feminine face. I've always resigned myself to be a femboy, but as time goes on... I'm not sure anymore.

I am 28, and I feel like I have only barely lived my life up to this point. I have always been fascinated by female beauty, but I've never had the courage to try anything on me until a couple of years ago. I had just turned 26 when I first wore makeup and a dress, knowing full well what I was doing.

And it felt amazing. I was expressing a new part of me. It felt rejuvenating and exciting. I wanted to try more stuff, to experiment with myself, to get closer to that femininity I had always secretly desired.

But then, something else came along. I started to feel grossed out by all of those things that reminded me I was a male. For a moment I tried to fight it, only to resign myself to the truth: I will never be a girl. I am just a man. Slightly feminine, maybe, but just a man.

So I resigned myself to be a femboy. Expressing my femininity without ever letting my expectations surpass reality. For a moment, I thought I found the perfect compromise.

But recently, I realized that I am just forcing myself to be someone I don't really wanna be. Whenever my friends tell me that I look feminine, or whenever I look at my shaven face in the mirror, a part of me screams: You're just lying to yourself. There's a reason you envy female beauty more than male beauty. There's a reason you don't like to feel masculine, and there was also a reason you were so happy when that random lady mistook you for a girl when you had long hair.

If I had a magic switch that would turn me into a girl, I would press it without hesitation. This is my realization.

I'm just sitting here, degrading, but I don't know if I will ever have the courage to take this path. I feel like I am too old, and the road is too steep for me to take. I feel too emotionally and psychologically broken to take such a leap. And I am poor, I'm poor as hell.

I just wanted to voice out how I'm feeling. Thanks for your attention, and stay proud."	"Hello!🤗
I dont know if this will help much since im not the most experienced but i hope it helps a little.
It is never too late to transition❤️
There are many many people who have transitioned and are in their 40s, 50s, and even 60s. 
Being 28 youre actually very young! And now would be the perfect time for you to transition if that's what you want(This is coming from a 19 year old lol)
Personally when i came out as trans i was very scared of peoples reactions, so maybe id suggest what i did which was to come out to the one person you trust the most to give a good reaction, and then go from there!
When you were saying things like ""i started to feel grossed out by all of those things that reminded me i was a male"", to a lot of us thats called 'Gender dysphoria'. If this is affecting you i would Definetly start talking to a mental health expert. There are a number of ones however that dont have a lot of experience in this field so maybe find someone that is geared towards this? I realize that money can be an issue; However, im sure that theres places to go that are inexpensive and/or free😄
I think the most important thing to keep in mind would be to do what makes you the most comfortable and happy with yourself. But at the same time, dont try to force yourself to be an 'ideal woman' or an 'ideal man'. If wearing makeup makes you happy, then i say go for it! If having longer hair makes you happy, then do that as well! Hope you have a great day/night!
You sound like me until about a month ago, when I finally resolved to make the leap next year. I'm going to go into a doctor or a therapist or wherever I need to go and scream at them until they give me the girl pills.

(Ally) I think I'm beginning to understand.	"Hey peeps, I had a friend that I sometimes met, we used to go on walks and stuff. I lived a while away, but we saw each other every now and then.

Last year we went on a bicycle trip and he outed himself, told me he's trans and his name that he goes by. I was actually pretty nervous because I didn't know any trans person before and didn't want to do or say something stupid! But he was very glad that I was supportive and it was a wonderful day.

I now moved into the area and a few weeks ago we met again. That evening it clicked, we fell in love and spent basically every day together for the next months. (It was surprising to my parents that I have a boyfriend because I never told them I'm bi, but they're supportive too).

There was one moment when I realised the magnitude of it all. He is on hormones already but they showed little effect. It was because of his estrogen level that was still quite high. He received a ""blocker"" for this and was told that there might be some effects soon. And the way he told me this, his face was lighting up! He was so happy and it was so cute to see him like this! He showed me the hair on his arm, which he had noticed was more dense than before! The pure joy that he showed when sharing this made me realise. I'm so happy for him, seeing him become more like the person that he truly is. It was so cute! I'm very grateful we met."	"Thanks for sharing your story :)
Love it!
I need a cold drink. My heart seems to have been warmed to an almost dangerous degree.

I love seeing allies here. Before I realized I was bi, I was an ally, but I never felt very comfortable butting into LGBTQ places. I'm just an anxious person, though.
I do feel part of the lgbtq+ community, which hasn't always been the case. But I also realize that my position in society (white guy) is quite privileged."	krzt7s	trans	23	0.92	2021-01-06 23:15:54
STARTED ESTROGEN YESTERDAY!!!	Oh my god I can't tell if it's just joy from finally getting to start transitioning, but I feel AMAZING. I feel high. It's like an orgasm that lasts all day. My skin is humming. I feel electric and connected to my body like never before.	"Yeah, the first couple days I was on E I definitely felt high. Now a few months in I don't notice that so much, but I do notice my mood/energy dropping a little before I take my pills in the evening. 

Congrats on getting this far!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I CAN'T GIVE HELP HERE I'M STILL PRE EVERYTHING BUT HOLY FUCK GIRL YOU GO!

Wife and I did Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn. She let me do her makeup (it's my hobby) and I made her Ivy costume. I was fairly bursting with pride and joy because she got so many compliments and was glowing.			qken9l	trans	22	1.0	2021-11-01 14:01:51

Any Trans people change their middle name as well? What did you come up with?	"Personally all I did was alter the spelling of my first name since it was already pretty androgynous-femme. But I also wanted to cast off the masculine middle name my family gave me. I'm a massive astronomy nerd so I wanted to rename myself after a star. The name Chara, a G type star around 27ly from earth stuck with me, it's also the Greek word for Joy apparently, which I thought was cool. So yeah, that's what I go with now!

I'm curious to see if any other trans people decided to change their middle names as well, and what they came up with, if you feel comfortable sharing of course."	"I changed my surname to mums maiden name cuz they're more my family than dads side. In the process I changed my middle name to Jean cuz it's grandma's name and mums middle name and I wanted to keep the tradition alive. It's also our cats middle name ☺️
I haven't officially changed anything yet. But I'm changing my first name entirely. It does share the same initial, but that's mostly coincidence. It's handy though because my email is (first initial)(last name), so I don't have to change that lol.  

But my middle name is my dad's name right now. He and I are on rocky ground because of me transitioning, but he's going to work through it and I think we'll eventually be good again. So I feel slightly guilty changing it, but I also don't want to keep a masculine middle name.   

So I'm thinking Veronica. It's a name my wife's stepdad has been trying to get all the girls in the family to name their kids. There are now 7 kids and no Veronicas. So I'm thinking of using it instead. He and I are close and I think it'd be a nice gesture.  

I actually heavily considered the name for my first name, but it came in 2nd in the running when I really thought it through.
My middle name was a name shared with my dad, and his dad, and _his_ dad, so on and so forth.

I hated it, but I wanted to keep the initial.

So I picked a middle name that started with the same letter, but it was silent. Both recognizing my past and denying it at the same time.
All of it. I'm changing it all. I do not like any of the names and they don't belong to me.
I changed my entire name. After searching for like 3 years to find the ""perfect"" name, I kinda just gave up and went with the name I really liked. Which means I inadvertently picked the name Lily for my middle name lol, for no particular reason other than liking the name. But it flowed better than Lilith. And I changed my first name to Violet, because it's my favorite V name, and I've always wanted to go by the nickname V. And my last name became Morningstar, because I love the symbols I'm of that name for many reasons.
Yep! It's the name I go by, or rather the full version of the nickname I usually use.

I let my parents pick my first name, though I rarely use it.  I like it, but we fell out & I prefer my middle name.  Plus, it worked as a trap for transphobes who insisted on using my legal name instead of my ""chosen"" one.
Hmm that's something I'll have to think about now! I'm taking the fem form of my birth name, as I was named after my grandfather and want to keep that connection (plus it's a cute name/nickname!) but I have absolutely no idea what do do with my middle name. It's Robert, and there's a family connection there but not sure what anymore...
I'm changing all three. My first and last are going to be completely different names totally unrelated to my birth names that I just like a lot. My middle name now is my mom's deadname and I'm going to change it to her true name. She passed in 2013 way before I knew I was trans too and it's my way to honor her memory.
I will because my middle name is to masculine and I never like it. I hardly use my boy middle name unless fill out paperwork. I even thought about changing my last name because I'm ashamed how abusive my late father was.
I changed mine by dropping it completely. I didn't need one and it's much simpler to have surname and family name
So I changed all of my names, and added another. I took my wife's last name, changed my first name, and picked two new middle names as well since that's tradition in my wife's family. I have no attachment to any part of my deadname so I threw it all in the trash where it belonged.
I changed my middle name to just something that sounds cool. It also happens to be from the same heritage as my last name
I picked one with a nice meaning and sound that paired well with my first name. And I kept my last name because I like my mom and sister.
I was lucky enough to be given a male birth name so I didn’t need to change it! But my middle name was extremely feminine, so I changed it and hope to get it legally changed eventually. Since my mom was so supportive when I came out to her, I let her choose my middle name for me. She picked one of the boy names on her list from when she was pregnant. I think it was very therapeutic for us both :^) me because I get a male middle name and her because it will help her feel more like she is part of my transition as she gets used to having a son instead of a daughter
I changed mine to Terra. The original name I would have used if it wasn't so atta hed to my ffxiv character now. 😅
I was really bothered by my old middle name, Jacob, because it’s pretty masculine. I didn’t know what to do until my mom pointed out that the feminine version, Jacqueline, is also the name of the home nurse who took care of her after her cancer surgery. So that settled it. 

Thank you, Jacqueline. We haven’t met but I am proud to share your name. 💕
I haven’t changed anything yet, but yes, my first and middle names will be changed. I’ll keep my family name.
Yup, I now have two middle names. The first I picked, with my girlfriend, because I wanted to set up an email account and my new first.lastname was already taken and I thought there is no reason why I can't just give myself a middle name.

Second is my mother's name. I used to have my father's name as a middle name so I asked my mother after a came out to my parents and she was delighted
(MtF) Wellll, first name is super masc but was already going by a more gender-neutral nickname for basically since ever. So just changing first name to *be* that nickname. Middle name though, no such excuses, so swapping out my grandpa's name for my mom's!
I chose Nicole as my middle name. :) Madelyn Nicole *last name*
i picked a new first name for myself and for my middle name i picked Paige, which is the name my parents had chosen for me after my mom’s initial ultrasound said she was having a girl. things work out in funny ways
I did not, BUT I did make my whole name start with R. My initials are RRR. My middle name is Rayne, if anybody wants to steal it. 😁
I'm changing my full name. My soon to be dead name has never brought me anything but pain. 

So first Lily -purity middle Grace-for how i have dealt with life up to this point. If the judge permits a last name change Brio-vigor 

My mother pushed me back into the closet multiple times from age 5 till her passing away when I was 38. My biological father was something of a bar brawl legend in the area and I'm tired of carrying that legacy tag. That's my story on my name.

For reference my deadname initials are SOB.
I'm planning to change mine. Istg when I was born and my parents were naming me they thought to themselves, ""How can we make this child as feminine as humanely possible?""
I'm planning on changing it, but I have no idea what I want to change it to.
My middle name is Jean as well! My siblings and I all have some familial ties with our middle names, and my Aunt's middle name is Jean. 


She really helped me during the start of my transition, and I wanted to have a shared name with someone close.
I'm sorry you have to go through that with your dad, I hope he'll come around.  Veronica is a very pretty name and I think you should go for it!
I'm in the same situation, with the shared middle name, so I feel sort of guilty about changing it and I haven't told my parents yet about wanting to change it. I like how you cleverly chose the symbolism behind your new one! Best wishes!"	ww32oe	trans	23	0.95	2022-08-23 23:10:07
Disheartening	"I went to search for some transgender euphoric videos on youtube and I was disheartened to find that a good chunk if not the majority of videos that come up when you search ""transgender"" are videos of people trying to invalidate us and call ""transgenderism"" a threat and a evil corrupting thing. I sat and thought about it for a moment... they're gonna keep bombarding media with negative opinions and portrayals of trans people trying to get people on their side.... we should bombard them back... flood the internet with the joy and purity of the trans experience. Smother them in our smiles and our love. Stomp out their message of hate with just wonderful trans love and joy."	"I won’t lie, it really is disheartening.

I’m so fearful my family is beginning the process trying to possibly look for Asylum.

All that being said after the last 30 years. I say you’re one hundred percent right.  I don’t know about YouTube, but I do agree that the best way we can fight back is to show them we are a community of love, and no matter how much hate they throw at us we won’t break.

This community has taken enough abuse, we ain’t going to buckle because alt right douche knocks like Tucker Carlson or the Republican Hate fest.

We are human and we love, no matter how much they want to act like we are just some monsters.
Idk if this is really what u r looking for BUT there’s a Stop Hibari-kun edit that’s like full of trans positivity in the comments and also it’s fun to watch. [The Gender Dysphoria be Hittin’ Different Sometimes](https://youtu.be/-PuBb6AIbCs)

So apparently I have a husband, any advice is appreciated.	"So, my husband is a trans man. We've been happily married for about 5 years now, and about 8 months ago, his shell cracked. This was news to both of us, as I had just figured that he was a woman who didn't like the many downsides of being a woman (which is super understandable!). But as we kept improving his life and figuring out what would make him happier, there was always something that was still off. Welp, we found it.

So I'm looking for any advice to help get oriented. I've got the pronouns down and verbally being supportive every day, our marriage is rock solid. But, I'm also a straight cis male whose lived experience doesn't match any of this. I like my assigned gender, I like my body, I like my assigned gender roles. I don't experience gender euphoria when someone uses male pronouns.

So to be frank and vulnerable a bit, for me a straight, white, cis male, I feel like society has always been saying ""Okay there are are only 2 colors of sexual identity, maybe 3-4 but we don't talk about those"". And I'm like cool, I like being the color red. This seems like a nice color. And now as I learn more about things, it feels like I'm being informed that my color is hex code  **#cc66ff** and it's actually more of a blue-ish red. So I feel that a lot of personal meaning and joy that I derived from my gender may not apply in this new technicolor world.

Thanks for any advice!"	"First of all: it's great that you're supporting your husband!

But you need to ask how heterosexual you are. When your husband goes through transition, he will become more and more masculine. If you're still attracted to him, then everything is great! If not, well... that would suck. 

I think that's a bit above reddit's pay grade. You should definitely seek counseling either way, because there's no way you won't profit from that.

Maybe some married people on here have valuable experiences they'll share with you. I can just give advice from the outside.

I hope the two of you can grow and change together, and that whatever happens, you two will be happy. <3
Hey, just want to let you know about r/mypartneristrans whish is a bit more specific for you. There should be a lot more cis partners over there that know this experience.

Dunno where the colour comes from, but if you love your partner then you love your partner. IMO the most alpha chad thing you could do is to continue to love your partner and support them the way they need, and not give a shit about societal views. 
Find confidence in the fact that you can be a shining example of why #lovewins.
Thanks for the encouragement! We are doing martial counseling once a month with his LGBT friendly therapist.

As for where I fall on the Kinsey scale, I'm still sorting that out. I definitely feel like I'm a 1 out of 0-6 at the very most. But I'm hoping that human brains are flexible enough that if you love someone and have spent 7+ years with them, you can kind of work around that. But yeah, this is a challenging situation.
Great suggestion, thank you.
I will definitely check these out, thank you. 

Also the Straight Spouse Network sounds like the strangest tv channel ever.
I feel that so much. I wish I could just fork over some of my pansexuality for you. Maybe with the amount of love you feel for your husband, it'll work.

So far you seem to be doing absolutely everything right that I can think of. All the best to you two!
Hey just to be clear if you're definitely straight it's nothing to feel bad about! You can still be friends and care deeply about each other, but attraction isn't something you can control.

Hope it all goes well, sounds like you've both got the right attitude. :)

Work places that claim to be inclusive but clearly are uncomfortable with you being trans	"I started a new job at a daycare which I just got terminated on after only THREE DAYS of working there. 

My work ethic was great, I could see that the children enjoyed my presence and I got along just fine with my coworkers. The one person I could not tell if she liked me or not was my supervisor. 

When she misgendered me the first time I kindly corrected her and told her I was trans. She did not apologize and seemed uncomfortable with the conversation. I had this feeling after our interview that she didn’t like me but she had no reason not to hire me because everyone else seemed to like me very much. 

Some people are absolute garbage and have zero empathy ESPECIALLY in spaces where you would think they would be like a child daycare. This woman pretended that she liked me, and I could feel the fake but I played along. 

I cried so hard after being let go because I truly was enjoying my time with these children and I could see the joy they had as I integrated into their classroom environment. 

I can see that people are very much threatened by our openness being trans, that we are not willing to hide because they feel uncomfortable with our identities. I hold onto hope that I will find another workplace that would not be so cruel as to hire me, make me do loads of paperwork and training, make me feel welcomed just to throw me away over my IDENTITY.

I wish I had proof of some sort to go to HR, this has never happened to me before and she terminated me so quickly with absolutely no discussion. It was the most embarrassing experience and I hope this pissy lady gets her karma.  

LDR; I had a feeling my supervisor felt threatened by my trans identity and let me go with no reason and I am left heartbroken with how mean people can be."	"I am so sorry that you had to experience that. Its just not right. It hurts to know that the children are being denied the loving care that someone like you would provide just so that the single individual who is more concerned with their personal level of comfort than the betterment of others. My heart goes out to you my dear.😭 Please take care and don't think this has anything to do with you. You are wonderful and an asset to those around you.
I am truely sorry that you had to go through that. I’m in a similar situation myself at the moment - I’m closeted in a workplace that is supportive of lgbt people but the workers even the ones within out community are very unjustly horrible towards local trans people for some reason even know some of them are gay etc themself. Keep strong. Hope you can find somewhere that appreciates you for being who you are. ❤️
It could also potentially have been a parent complaining about you being there and instead of standing up to them they caved and just fired you as that’s the easier thing to do. In either case it’s crappy and hope you find gainful and inclusive employment soon.
Thank you so much this message is so nice ♥️♥️♥️
I’m so sorry to hear that, I hope it gets better for you as well ♥️♥️

My first time passing in public!	"Yesterday, Valentine’s Day. My girlfriend and I went to the grocery store to buy some things and I had the courage to try and pass. 

This week will be 3 months on HRT and it’s been really awkward for me to fit into ether gender boxes at the moment, however yesterday was special because my gf wanted to spend Valentine’s Day with her new gf. Pink adidas, tight skinny jeans, big winter coat, company beanie with my short hair style hanging out, light makeup, and my mask. 

The combination made me feel really good, but uncomfortable from the fact that I don’t feel totally possible. Ugh, for once I wish it didn’t seem like the world was staring at me lol

Yet for the first time in my life, this little boy was about to walk in the middle of the ail as we were walking through, but the boys father looked me dead in the eyes and said to his son “don’t cut this lady off.” 

That man will never know how much joy just saying those words will bring me. I couldn’t even say ‘excuse me’ to be polite because my still deepish voice would have ruined the moment. Yet I’ll remember that for the rest of my life."	"Wholesome 🥺

My name is Cassie	"And I've finally come out to myself.  I'm 34 AMAB with a wife and two kids, but for as long as I can remember, I have wished I had been born female.  Every time I thought about it, I reasoned about why I wasn't trans or why I shouldn't act on it -- ""I can't be trans, I'm attracted to women"" or ""how would I explain it to the people I care about, or the people I work with?"" or ""You're not trans, you don't have dysphoria."" or (trigger warning) >!""Even if you transition, you'll never be a real woman.""!< And I'd push those thoughts away and keep living life as a man.  And, even though it wasn't ideal, I could live with it, I told myself.

In my teens, I was a goth kid, and that gave me the excuse to wear makeup and nail polish without much additional grief from anyone because I was dressing like a weirdo anyway.  But looking at my beautiful hands, tipped with shiny polish, I felt something fantastic that I didn't have the words for (I now know it to be gender euphoria).

And on a a couple of occasions after high school, I attended parties in skimpy ladies' clothing ""ironically."" You know, as a joke, right? Ha ha, so funny and edgy! But secretly, I felt beautiful.

Once I met my wife, I pretty much put aside any notions of outwardly living life as a woman, but the thoughts remained.  I might not think about it for months at a time, but eventually something would remind me, and I'd have the same conversation with myself -- if only I could be a woman, but here's all the reasons I can't.

This past week, the feelings returned. And for reasons which are not entirely clear to me, this time, the conversation went differently -- ""Trans woman can be lesbians!"" and ""Who fucking cares what society thinks?"" and ""Trans women ARE real women.""

So I decided to look for stories similar to mine, which is how I discovered this subreddit, and I was not disappointed. I see so many stories here that echo my experience so far, or people asking the same questions I have, and getting replies that give me the clarity I need.

In the past week, I've learned that you don't need gender dysphoria to be trans, that gender euphoria (what I've experienced) is a very real thing that many other trans folks have experienced, and that cisgender men generally don't spend time fantasizing about being women.

Thanks in no small part to this subreddit, I have gathered all the evidence I needed to make this simple statement: I am trans.

Until yesterday, my desire to be female was my deepest, darkest secret.  Yesterday, I said those words out loud to my best friend, and she was so supportive and amazing. And it was cathartic. Words can't convey the joy I felt (and am still feeling) having shared this secret with another human being who listened thoughtfully and told me no matter what I look like on the outside, she loves me for who I am on the inside, and that will never change.

I know not every interaction will be so joyous.  I still have to tell my wife, and I'm absolutely terrified.  It has the very real potential to dissolve my marriage.  I can't in good conscience ask her to stay married to a woman any more than she has any right to ask me to continue being someone I'm not.  Once I let the genie out of the bottle, I'm absolutely powerless to what happens next. I have a long, difficult journey ahead, and I hope to have her by my side.

Thanks for reading,

Cassie"	"Hey Cassie! Your post only just got on new. I'm sorry you had to wait so long, the mods must have had to verify it or something.
Well this was a lonely first few hours in the trans community 😢
It's so good to read your story,  and so good to meet you Cassie. 
Many things I find familiar... the lack of dysphoria (most of the time), the chances taken to dress up as female and make light of it, whilst actually feeling the most euphoria ever!.
I'm so happy for you that you have taken this first step and I hope that the future for you is full of happiness and joy. And love.  X
It’s lovely to meet you (166 days after you posted this :p)

I found your story, after creating my alt today, by search for “telling my wife” in this subreddit. 

I’m struck by the similarity with your story. We’re similar and age and situation. I just wanted to say thank you for putting this out there. It’s encouraging to see. I saw you’d posted about telling your wife, how have things been since then? That was an extremely courageous thing to do!

Congrats!! So happy for you; your story sounds very similar to mind (I just came out about two weeks ago).
I wish you the very best. I have been where you are and it is challenging. It is hard but these feelings progressively get more intense and so does the suffering. You will feel better once you take the steps to let your self shine through. I am pulling for you.
Hey Cassie, welcome to the family🤗
When I created my alt, multiple trans subreddits had holds on posts and comments from new accounts. I imagine this is to reduce abuse from transphobic parts of Reddit trying to be shitty while still hiding their identities behind fresh throwaways.
Yeah I messaged a mod about it who explained the situation, as it's a brand new account I made solely to talk about being trans.
I have had a similar experience to yours, especially the excuses I made why I wasn't trans, and not fully grasping what it meant to begin with. I just recently came out to my wife and it went well. I hope you find what you have been missing and I am so happy for you
Thank you, Emma!  It's weird re-reading this post, because I've come so far since then, and honestly in a fairly short time.  I'm out to a whole bunch more people, and once I know I won't be leaving the house again, I'm in girl mode, head to toe.  I've got plans to start HRT by year's end (whether that happens is a different story).  This post is such a good snapshot of me as I was just emerging from my egg.  Thanks for sparking this trip down memory lane.  Have a fantastic day :)
Hi Kenzi!

Thanks for reading and for the comment. Things have been shaky. We had a really rocky summer, and there was a low point where neither of us trusted the other, but we've had some frank conversations since then, and emotions have cool a lot. We just had our first couples counseling session this week, which I think brought more understanding. We've still got a long way to go before we're back to where we were, but I think there's still a chance for a future together.

-Cassie
Thanks. Since coming out to myself, I've already experienced a bit of what I'm guessing is gender dysphoria. A lot of masculine terms applied to me have started feeling like nails on a chalk board, and the beard on my face that grew out of laziness suddenly looks and feels disgusting. On the other hand, I feel like a wall that had been built up around me my entire life has been torn down, if that makes any sense. Like, having finally accepted who I am, I'm more free to think and feel things that I would have avoided previously, that feels really therapeutic.
Thank you!!
That makes sense. It's a shame that's how it has to be.
Yes I just saw it as your last post.  It's an amazing journey and things do seem to happen so fast. I can't believe how much I have changed looking back at my posts and photos and all since January. 

I'm really keen to follow your journey, and see what life has in store.  All the very best you you.  X"	ni7kgt	trans	22	0.96	2021-05-22 01:15:48
I went to the my chemical romance concert in the UK and!	"I met other trans people!! They were like in a group of four and the reason I could tell? They had a big ol' trans flag with em with ""mama is a a trans anthem' written on it. Now like. . . I don't remotely look like a girl and am currently in edge mode (it's my chemical romance so I busted out the trench coat, vest and flannel with a tie combo) so like. . . I was thinking about not talking to them but something in my brain said ""nope! Speak you fool"" and woosh! Through the crowd I went and after a few song we were all chatting and stuff and oh my lord I just can't even right now!! It was amazing!!

I don't see many trans folks in the UK but I've been to two concerts this week, first had a person with a trans and non-binary pin on Thier jacket and now this!! I need to see more concerts oh my lord!! It was great we talked, singed our hearts out, when the song mama came on I was fucken waving that flag as hard as I could! shit like that. After the show we even took a group photo oh my lord!! We even tried to like. . . Set up contact through discord but the wifi was shitty so it didn't send. . .

(Fr if anyone of you four is seeing this please send me a message I'm so sad the WiFi was bad aahhh. Genuinely y'all were sooo cool!)

But yeah. . . Besides technical difficulties an shit. . . It was fucken amazing and I'm going to be riding this high till I get to college. . .

Hyperfixating on transgender identity to avoid grief	"Really, the title says it all.  I lost my gramma on Tuesday, yesterday I was in shock, and today literally all I can focus on is my trans journey.  I don't want to use this to avoid thinking of her.  I need to grieve properly.  My last hyperfixation broght on by grief was scary intense and went on for so long (about seven years) that I burned out, subsequently losing my only effective coping mechanism and dropping out of high school right before graduation, then self-isolating for three years.  The crash was real and devastating, with permanent consequences, and it really drove home just how dangerous this kind of fixation can be to me.

  It's normal for me to fixate on things for a couple of weeks or months, but this doesn't feel like that.  This feels like my previous hyperfixation.  It was the only thing that could still bring me joy, so I clung to it desperately, to the detriment of every other aspect of my life.  That's what's happening in my brain right now and it worries me.  I don't want to do that damage to myself again.

  My previous hyperfixation was singing, which I really loved and was good at even before I started clinging to it.  Now, I barely ever sing, I have no desire to and I've let myself get rusty as a result, throwing all of the hard work of those years down the drain and it feels like shit.  I don't want something similar to occur to my experience with my trans journey.

  I wish I could find a balance between grieving and moving forward that is healthier and more sustainable than this cycle of hyperfixation.  Hopefully writing about this helps me remember to keep an eye on this before it gets out of hand."	"Do you see a therapist?
I'm doing this too to some extent. I just feel like the thing that can only make me happy enough to survive losing my mom is pursuing my true self and gender, and it makes me smile so much but I need to remember that I need to also honor my mom by balancing it out. We do this as a way to survive hard times.
Yes I do.  Unfortunately, my last appointment was about twelve hours before my gramma died, when everything was fine to the best of my knowledge.  My next appointment isn't until the 29th, though I am at the top of her list if there should be a cancellation.  I don't really have anyone to talk with in the meantime other than my mom, who just became an orphan, so I don't really want to talk about this with her right now, since she's still coming to terms with the fact that she's not losing me to my transition (she's looking for a parent support group, but even with that, it'll take some time for her to acclimate, she supports me all the way,mthough), I don't want to compound the loss she's feeling right now by reminding her of those yet unprocessed feelings on top of it all.  It's left me in a bit of a lurch, so here I am, spilling my guts on the internet as a way to not explode while I hope for a cancellation.
I hope everything works out for you❤️"	ve69dh	trans	21	0.93	2022-06-17 06:07:46
Beware the power of spinny skirts and binders	"My fellow genders 

I come to warn you about the dangers of spinny skirts and binders, of hair cuts and bras and new names. You may only have to try them just once and your life will never be the same.

Once you feel that joy, there's no going back. The bliss of ignorance will vanish and leave a void you can finally fill with your real self, and only your real self.

You can look away, you can cover it up, but it will hurt. At first only a little. A flinch at your old name or a new feeling in your chest when you change back. For some it ends there, for others they come to lay awake at night trapped in dysphoria. 

In return pain that you never knew was there will be lifted. The mirror's friendlier, the days are a little brighter, when you're finally you.

I hope you can wear those thigh highs, or that beard, or both, with pride. They suit you."	Gosh, what new name should I be worried about, just, you know, so I can avoid it extra hard?	t7sgul	trans	20	1.0	2022-03-06 06:05:39
Just wanted to celebrate	" Hi y'all first time posting here, just wanted somewhere I could scream with joy into the void of the internets. I am a 38 year old AMAB who just came out to my wife of 13 years as transgender, I was really scared but after we talked for 3-4 hours she hugged me, said that she loved me and said she couldn't wait to introduce people to her wife. Sorry to ramble but just wanted to get that out there.

I plan to stick around and be active

happiest day of my life	"&#x200B;

I got top surgery today and it was the happiest day of my life. I could share my whole story and how it's been an eleven year internal and external battle with myself, my family, and addiction to get here but basically - I just had the happiest day of my life. 

  
My surgery day started with a video call from my best friend/chosen sib's parents who have adopted me since I lost fam.of.origin relationships a year ago. Surgery went well. My chosen family took care of me, after all getting covid test results back. I was fed and nurtured and given meds. My sponsees reached out to tell me they loved me. (I'm about to celebrate 2.5 years sober in 11 days.) My sponsor and her wife danced a happy dance for me when I let them know how I was. My phone and email were blown up by friends all over the US, old coworkers, old ladies from AA. One of my best friends did my t shot while my cousin took a kink questionnaire online and my sibling made themself a snack. They fed me homemade chicken soup, and tea, and oreos. We talked for a few hours about our lives, and skyped our chosen fam from far away. Everyone offered me a blessing for my new body - joy; congruence and clarity; enjoying being helped and loved; pride in how far I've come and sustainability in how I move into the future.  

  
Being taken care of is the part of surgery I've been the most afraid of, but today was the happiest day of my life. I have waited my whole life to be treated like this, and to give over control and be supported well.

For all my trans siblings who keep telling yourselves it is impossible or it won't happen or you'll die first or you don't deserve it or you should wait til your parents die, or any of the other 2,000 terrible things I told myself since I first learned what medical + social transition was, just take it easy and focus on being the same person in every room. My advice is to just focus on developing your character, your values, and your community. Because if you aren't ready to come out or transition, that's fine. Put the work in now so that you can live in line with your values and be intentional about handling and releasing internalized transphobia and homophobia. Later, no matter what you choose, you'll be grateful that you did. Your relationships will benefit and your soul will be lighter even if you're living with dysphoria or doubt or gender-fear. 

  
Whether you take hormones or have procedures done or change your name or not, you're a living human being who needs love and care and who is so much more than just your gender or just your secrets. Maybe I wasn't ready for top surgery or hormones 11 years ago. But I've done a lot of work, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and relationally to get to the place where I walked into surgery sober, calm, and smiling, and walked out free. 

Thank you for reading this and celebrating with me. Love to all.

Mom sang Happy Birthday with my new name!	"I came out two days ago to my family via an emailed letter. This morning, my mom wished me a happy birthday with a voice recording where she sang the song and used my new name, and I cried tears of joy.

My family has historically bowled over my boundaries and ignored the plights/differences of minorities… i know it won’t all get better, but the fact that the reaction so far has been mildly positive/supportive is way better than expected!!! I’m so relieved today and just comfortable and happy being me ☺️☺️☺️

Now if the gender clinic can just call me back… but I hear they are backed up."	"Happy happy birthday!!  🎂🎉🎈 (happy bday Water? I don’t want to get your name wrong)

That's beautiful and amazing! And only 2 days for them to do that is astounding.

I did it. Finally.....	"After years of trepidation, I got my HRT. After hours of waiting and agonizing over it, I finally took it. It is so overwhelming I feel like I am high. I want to cry, I want to jump for joy, I want to scream, I want to love, I want to......everything. Please tell me I did the right thing. I know I did....I know I did.....I know I did....I have to have. I did the right thing, right? I feel like I did the right thing......

I know I did the right thing.

right?.....right......?"	"Only you can tell. Very likely, yes. A cis person wouldn't usually go that far.

But don't worry to much about it. If it's not the right thing to do, you will feel it. Being on the wrong hormones would make you feel quite terrible.
Yes. Congratulations.
Congrats! (If ur happy it means its working right)
Cis people don’t consider HRT to change their gender. So.
I'm in your shoes as well. Decided I wanted to take the step and do HRT over the long weekend (poor timing since Planned Parenthood was closed, lol).

But it feels so weird. What? Start living as the opposite gender? After 28 years of living as male and half/half wanting to be female? It's so scary but also exciting at the same time.
You did the best thing for yourself ☺️ am happy for you and a tad jealous 😋
This is, what people describe joy as in books, so yeah, I think it is the right thing
If you're this excited about it, it's probably the right thing

first encounter with a trans flag in the wild	"Nothing particularly special but it made me happy so I thought I’d share and try and make everyone’s days a little better.

So I live in Australia and down here we have a super-supportive handmade cosmetic store called Lush. Idk if they’re overseas as well, but they’re here. 

Anyway I walked into my local Lush to buy a present for one of my friends and the first thing I saw was this little trans flag, about 30cm long, next to a crate of trans-coloured bath bombs. I’m glad no one was with me because the look on my face when I saw it would have dragged me out of the closet. I stared at it for like twenty seconds in absolute joy and I almost bought one of the trans bath bombs but thought it’d be hard to explain to my parents.

yeah that’s it. Just a small thing that made my day better. It’s the little things like that that count."	"It's the little things that make you smile.

That's so cool. Wonder if I'll come across one myself~
Cool i might check it out:)

I love my name [Trans joy/Positivity]	I love the way it looks when I write it in cursive especially. I love singing it at the top of my school papers. I love how unique it is. I love that I'm the only person I know with that specific name. I love that it means strong and wise. I love that it represent me. I love how natural it feels when other people address me with it. Before I transitioned I didn't get it when cis people said they loved their name. I get it now and I hope everyone here gets to experience that kind of joy in their own transition.

I’m so confused and you guys are the most educated on this so please help lol	"So I’m a dude and I have always been a dude but I just have weird feelings inside of me. I’ve never really experimented with more feminine clothing or ways of being but for some reason I just really get the urge to. I’ve questioned if I’m Trans because I don’t really feel comfortable as a dude, but I also know I’m not a girl. Therefore I’ve kinda come to this middle ground and I think this is the best place for it? 

Like I don’t wanna be a girl, but I don’t always wanna be a guy. More feminine clothing like a skirt and crop top just looks so much better and it gives me a weird rush of serotonin to see people wear them. Like when I do more feminine stuff (like today I accidentally did a cute pose) I get this rush of joy because I just fucking hate my own skin and masculinity. I’m just so uncomfortable being a masculine dude, but the same goes for being a girl. Like idk where the fuck I lie? 

I really really wanna experiment and actually be myself but I can’t. I live with others rn that don’t know about these feelings I have, they don’t even know my sexuality. I can’t order to the house because they will be the ones to get it from the door as I’m  out in the day. I can’t travel into town cos I live in the far outskirts and can’t drive. Like wtf do I do?

And another thing about it is pronouns and all that. Like idm being called ‘he’ but I also quite like the sound of others like ‘they’ or even ‘she’. I like all of them.

I’m just really confused, please help if you can or link some subs that can offer advice, thanks.

Edit: Forgot to mention a couple things. First off, I get this feeling in waves. Like I’ll have it for a couple weeks then it will pass. Same happens with masculinity. Sometimes I really like feeling masculine but that’s also in waves. Second, I’m a very masculine guy. I’m pretty tall, I’m a big build, I’m a combat fighter, I’m hairy as fuck and I have a deep ass voice. So yeah, thought that might help to explain a bit more."	"I'm going through this too! Once I told my brain my thoughts were ""safe"" it started getting easier. I'm starting to sleep again!! 😆
That rush could be what we call gender euphoria. If it's because you're doing feminine things, it can be a pretty good sign that you're trans. It's up to you whether that means anything though. I can't really help you with the clothes stuff cause I have the same issue atm sorry. If you want to explore this stuff a bit more, my DMs are open if you'd like, though I'm about to go to sleep so I'll probably respond in like 6-8 hours. Hope this helps a bit
Hey, I'm in the same boat. Can't exactly say I'm a trans. I absolutely hate my body hairs. Since I can't move out until like next year, I have to look like every other dude out there, you know the short hair and glasses.

Being a guy to me feels so boring. How do I put it? IMO, it's tiring having to be strong, to give off this sense of security, to not be emotional. Growing up, it has always irritated me that why is it okay for girls to wear pants, but not for boys to wear skirts.

Well, what I did was I took a degree in another town as soon as I turned 18. I studied hard to minimize financial dependence from my parents. Those years were awesome. I shaved my legs, bought wigs and purchased any skirt or dress I want, sleep in women sleepwear too! 

Unfortunately, I have to move back with them, because just when I was about to graduate, virus happened, can't get my first job. At the moment, I'm just spending time on this sub, talking to random people.

But, I've been preparing to move out next year. Am upskilling with online classes and plan on getting a job elsewhere so that I can live outside again.

I 'came out' to my family back then and it didn't go well. So, if you're going to live as who you are, be prepared that some relationships may be affected.
Two things to point out:

1. you can be a gender non-conforming man, meaning that you still identify as a man but express your gender in whatever way you please, regardless of societal expectations.

2. there are more than two genders: you don't have to be male or female or somewhere in between. You can be both, or neither, or something else entirely. They're just labels and they're only as powerful as you want them to be. Check out some non-binary identities!

I felt the same as you for a bit: definitely not a man, but I don't hate my body, and I'm also pretty sure I'm not female... so... I'm just me! If someone asked ""are you a man or woman?"" I'd say, ""no, thanks for asking."" and that's about all I have to say about my gender at the moment.
From what you have said (especially with the notes at the end), it sounds like non-binary and gender fluid may fit you best - where some days you feel like presenting as male and some days you may be more comfortable presenting as female.  

Not everyone fits perfectly into the binary male/female roles, and that is ok - as long as you are happy.  Figuring this stuff out can take years or decades even, but you can't go wrong as long as you use what makes you happy as your guide.

Also important to note, not everything you try may be for you.  You could have close friends use a different pronoun and decide after some time that it doesn't quite fit you and want to try a different one or go back to an old one.  This is ok too.

The important part is to do what makes you happy and be yourself.
Well I think gender is a spectrum,and you fall somewhere in-between. And that's perfectly fine. maybe feminine non binary? Gender fluid? Only you are the judge of your own body and health,so you make the call,but give this some thought.
I totally get what you're saying! I have to do homework right now, but have you looked into genderfluid or maybe even fluidflux? Those sound a lot like what you're describing.
Perhaps, but sometimes I get the same feeling for masculine things. Its in waves pretty much. Sometimes I will be at my happiest in a skirt and crop top but other times be at my happiest in a nice suit
I guess but I’m fine with being a guy (I think) I just don’t like everything about being a guy if that makes sense? But thanks for the advice!
Have you looked into non-binary identities? What you're describing definitely seems to fall under the enby umbrella. I highly recommend exploring the LGBTQ wiki and Gender wiki, especially the pages [agender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Agender), [bigender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Bigender), and [genderfluid](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Genderfluid).

You could also try posting something like this on r/NonBinary, there are a lot of great people on there who I'm certain can help give you advice, or at least share relatable anecdotes.
Hmm, that's really interesting, well sorry that I can't really help you much outside of transfem experiences, I guess I'll wish you luck in figuring this out ☺️
Thank you!"	nff021	trans	18	0.96	2021-05-18 16:23:03

First time getting “ma’am”’d	I’ve been questioning my gender for a few months now, and a friend of mine just refered to me as “ma’am” via text for the first time. Now, I’m flitting between minor confusion, minor discomfort, and minor joy. I don’t know what to make of this. I am having a mini spectrum of reactions to this all at once and I don’t know what it means.	Sometimes the first few times of getting praised as something else than the thing that you were referred to all your life can feel weird I had that, a year after coming out I just feel like people are nice to me and thank them.	njtbyp	trans	18	0.87	2021-05-24 08:51:51
Grandma called me boy!	"
Tldr; My grandma is the only family I have who sees me for who I truly am and loves and supports me unconditionally, and I will be forever grateful to have her in my life.

So Ive been out as nonbinary for roughly 8-10 years, and came out to my grandma about 4 years ago. At the time I was exclusively using they/them pronouns, which she has had a hard time adjusting to and tends to use she/her most of the time, but shes never once deadnamed me after I told her the name I've been going by and she's always been pretty good at calling me her grandchild instead of granddaughter. Tbh she's been way more supportive and understanding than I expected her to be, considering she's 94. 

Anyway, since starting testosterone Ive been using he/him and male terms in reference to myself a lot more often. I hadn't specifically told my grandma this, although she does know I'm in testosterone and that I plan to get top surgery. I recently changed my pronouns on Facebook to he/him and I have a feeling my grandma noticed this, as she called me a boy! I made a post about something political (my grandma and I are both pretty far left in our political views) and she commented ""That's my boy!"" 

This was one of the most supportive and encouraging things I have ever heard from any family member in my entire life and I truly cannot put to words how much it means to me. Anyway, just wanted to share this special moment with all of you. My heart is so full of love and joy and gender euphoria."	That’s so lovely to hear!

An amazing thing happened today	So I was at a store and I HAD to go to the bathroom, so I decided not to go to the female's bathroom, I was just to embrassed. So I walked in to the guys and it was very dirty, so I decided to go in the girls and well, used it, and the entire time I was in there, I was SO happy! I never thought I could feel this way! The joy was way higher than the worry. I know it sounds kind of dumb, being excited about going to the right toilet, but it made me happy!	"u/zeldalvr

Past Four Years	"It started with a gun in my mouth, as 3 decades of heartbreak torment and abuse convinced me it was time to do this world a favor, and ejected the emptiness that haunted my bones out into void. My eyes were pitch black as they’ve been my whole life because I knew they were always meant to offer nothing but darkness, how else could a mother look into them and say ‘monsters go to hell’. And as I stared into my reflection almost giddy with a twisted mix of revulsion yet conviction my  lips spread clumsily to articulate the only gift a creature like me could ever hope to offer, ‘one less monster in this world.’ 

But out from that black that has haunted my reflection my entire life, suddenly something flickered, and before I knew it that glint turned into a tear, as a voice I had long drowned in a life time of shame and alcohol managed to whisper a single word, ‘please’. And that word repeated, as more tears formed, and I realized that voice was my own the humanity I had long forgotten, if not completely purged by promised hellfire and sin that was inflicted on me since the moment I was born. Soon it tailed out of my mouth with strings of saliva ‘please,’ each reiteration gaining more weight yet never demanding, ‘please,’ it was a plea for pity, it pitied the creature before it, something no one has ever done before. Collapsing under the weight I with drew the gun from my mouth and unchambered the round and spoke for the first time to eyes that suddenly seem brown, earthy with potential and growth. ‘please, don’t, you matter, your worthy of love, your worthy of a soul.’ And like that I started laughing hysterically as the words ‘you matter’ rocked through me, my moment of hallelujah, overcome with madness I was still crying but they’d turn to tears of joy. I mattered, my happiness mattered, so simple, so stupid, and yet it took 32 years. So much lost time but it ended that day as I wiped my face from the mix of saliva snot and tears, and I got up and left to live my life for the very first time no longer as a monster, but a human being worthy of its innate soul.

My past four years started there, and while I lost some family, some friends and a job I loved, these past four years have been the best my life could hope for, that my life was always meant for. And while I’ve spent it mostly healing myself and not moving forward with my transition (no hormones, no surgery, but I did legally change my name and gender, and live my life fully as the woman I am) but fixing the emotional damages that mar my brain, I feel like I’m finally in a good enough place to take on that challenge and own it like I’ve owned these past four years. 

I know I’m long winded literally, because I could only speak in written word for most my life, so I’m sorry for that, but I wanted to share my beginning to remind all of you to never lose hope and always know you matter! Own it, rock it, make it your own, and jam your honesty down this crappy worlds throat, because you don’t owe them anything other than your absolute fiercest and boldest honesty and truth."	"I’m really happy that you’re still here.  My story and background is similar to yours… it’s been 4 years for me too! Stay strong and hope you keep finding the happiness you so deserve after a lifetime of sadness. Take care,Sis🙋🏻‍♀️
That was harrowing, painful to read, and beautiful.

I am glad that things turned around for you and wish you the best in what's to come.
I am speechless, you wrote this beautifully and it brought me to tears, you are so strong for what you have been through and I really relate to what you were going through. Im glad you are in a better place in life now. You should consider writing literature if thats not already something you do because you have a way with words..
Thanks, me too, I’m glad I wised up and stuck around. As horrible as it sounds it does help to know I wasn’t the only one. And yay! Congrats on your four years of being you!
Thank you for reading it, it’s been on my mind the past few days since I’ve been on here and I needed to share it.

Thank you for your comment and support.
Thank you so much! 😊 I am touched that my story moved you. I’m only getting stronger, and indeed in a much better place.

Nonbinary top surgery	I’ve been on this sub for a long time, and I finally have some joy of my own to share!! On Tuesday (Dec 14th) I got a double mastectomy. My parents aren’t thrilled, but processing. I’m still in a lot of pain but I’m happy it’s over. Feel free to ask me any questions you have!	"was it scary?? i really wanna get top surgery in the future but i’m genuinely so terrified of it omg and the healing process
I was a little scared, I won’t lie. My nurse team and surgeon were wonderful, answering my questions literally up until I was on the operating bed. I promise that if it’s something you want, the nerves will be worth it. The most important thing is making sure you trust your gut with your surgeon. Since I only got mine done yesterday, I can’t speak too much to the healing process. That said- the drains really are the worst part. They’re kinda a dull ache, sometimes when I stand it hurts a bit. I’ve been on Tylenol and I’d say my pain is super manageable. Let me know if that helped/you have more questions!
i appreciate it. it’s still a few years until i get mine.
did u have to be on any hormones to get ur surgery? i go by all pronouns and i’m leaning towards presenting masculine, but i don’t want to take hormones
I’m sure you’ll get it eventually! Feel free to reach out at any point if you have more questions :) /gen
Nope! At least for my state that’s not a requirement! I’m not on hormones:)

Got that appointment!!!!	"Just scheduled a consultation for HRT with a doctor my therapist recommended!! Set for this coming Tuesday, yeeaaaahhhh ya boy isn't going to be one sooooon!

Just had to share as I'm just super excited to finally be making progress. My egg only fully cracked a little over a month ago but life has not been good since. Depression and dysphoria has never been so high. Though I can't fully come out yet, just getting this appointment to start HRT makes me feel better.

Anyway that is for reading and hope your day is full of joy!"	Good luck, and congrats!	cchshd	trans	17	1.0	2019-07-12 22:43:33
I Told My Parents My Name Today (Wholesome Post)	"Just wanted to share this little moment of trans joy with some people.

I’m transmasc+genderfluid; I’ve been out to my parents as non-binary for two years. I’m from the Deep South, so it’s been a struggle getting them to fully understand my gender/how to address me. They do their best but have really struggled with not calling me a girl, so I was really nervous to introduce my new name/pronouns to them.

Well, I told them today. My mom asked a lot of questions but was generally very supportive. I could tell my dad was kinda uncomfortable with the conversation, but told me he would do his best.

Unbeknownst to me, my dad had gotten me a new toolkit earlier this morning cause I was talking about how I needed one a week ago. When he was fixing it up earlier this morning, prior to me talking to them, he wrote my deadname on the toolkit. A little bit after I told them, he went over to the tool box, mentioned it, scrubbed my deadname off, and wrote my new name on it🥲 

Just looking at this silly little toolkit is giving me so much joy. Seeing my dad’s handwriting spelling out my name on this tool box is possibly one of the most beautiful moments I’ve had as a trans person."	"OMG, I love this! It is so heartwarming!
I love that. aive been crying but that brought even more tears to my eyez
Warmed my heart - thanks for sharing"	z4zlpt	trans	16	0.9	2022-11-26 05:52:21
Happiest moment of my life so far (I'm 14 mtf)	"So I've got this really supportive friend that I recently came out to and today I had to shave my tinsy mustache for the first time and I was happy that it was gone but I don't want hair there I hate it it gives me incredible amount of dysphoria. I asked my dad for help (he doesn't know I'm trans, but not because of him I'm just not ready yet. Him and my mom split a few years ago) so when I got back to mom's place (who knows I'm trans BTW) I have a normal day jus thinking about how much I hate testosterone, but right after I brush my teeth I basicaly break down and start crying in my bed. So I tell my friend I'm crying cause it's been a long frickings time sins I cried and she asks if she can call me and I say yes. So we talk about dysphoria and other stuff for an hour and then, I ask if she has any skirts and she says no and asks if I have any, I reply with saying I don't have any but would like too. She then precedes to ask if I'd like to go shop for one day and I just start crying out of pure joy for the first time in my life.

Sorry for grammar I suck at it.

TL. DN: A friend asked if I'd like to shop for a skirt and I cry out of pure joy for the first time in my life.

Thank you for reading"	"That's really amazing and I hope you can get a skirt
Thank you, but there is a lot of corono so a lot of stores are closed right now so it will have to wait
I'm sure you already know this but just in case, you're just as much of a girl without a skirt as you would be with one, there's no rush by any means and you'll always be accepted here.
Thank you so much for your support I appreciate it a bunch. Yea I know I just won't skirt to go spinny"	m57mcm	trans	17	1.0	2021-03-14 23:48:28
First post here. Scared and want reassurance/advice	"AMAB
Starting to come out of my shell
IDK about flairs here. I usually skulk here and Egg irl.

So here's my word vomit. I don't really care if this gains traction at all. But I feel if I at least throw some thoughts into the nebula that is Reddit, it will help me. Because at least I'm talking about it.

I'm about to be 30. I've been in the military and I've worked in the trades heavily. Both very male and masculine dominated areas. I'm a fair ways up the corporate ladder now. I've aggressively enthralled myself in my work in order to make it in the late stage capitalist hellscape. 

Now at the brink of 30, my wife and I have finally found some semblance of security. This have given me the chance to start asking myself more about who I am (outside of work) and what do I want the rest of my life to look like.

Through various amounts of self reflection, experimentation, discussions with my wife, I've realized Ive really denied/blocked/internalized a lot of who I truly am, and who I truly am is a wonderful woman.

I did it. 

I said it.

I'm trans.

This is the literal first time I've declared these words out loud.

And I'm happy to be trans. I love feeling this part of me that feels so pure and real. It's like I finally got to meet myself, not some shell going through all the motions.

And with that screaming joyful realization, comes an immense wave of trepidation and fear. How do you gather the strength come out?

Thankfully I know my wife will be very accepting.

But given the nature of my job and the elbows I have to rub with, I fear it's nearly career suicide. That's our livelihood. Corporate boomers, old school tradesmen, and former military. Most will surely shun me if I do come out.

Am I over reacting to this? Have any of you had to come out and it ruined your career? Should I just pull the ripcord and if they make work miserable, just quit?

And how bad was it coming out to your family?

Basically: WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO NOW KNOWING WHO I AM? WAS IGNORANCE BLISS ALL ALONG??

big scared.

Need helps.

Be nice pls."	"As a baby boomer I find the openness of the trans community a refreshing breath, and am glad there is a forum as this. I have both gay and trans friends and they are above all human beings. I wish you the best in being yourself.
1. So happy for you that you found your true self.
2. I personally would advise that you would work out a plan B with your wife in chance that your Carrier dies from you coming out.
Hiding it can cause a lot of mental drain, I know the feeling, it's not fun. 
3. Make sure to check up om what laws can protect you from people who don't accept you.
It would suck to stand in a place where you are not sure the police can protect you. 
4. Check what insurene covers. Some may cover some or all the costs of bottom sugery if that is something you want <3

Sadly that is all I can advise since I am lucky to live in a county were being trans is widely accepted. 
But I know as long as you trust in yourself and your wife then I am sure you can get though it. So don't give up. And treat yourself to some new outfits :) a tip. Go figure out your size, try going from to a size you know is too big and work your way down :D the same with shoes. And maybe your wife can help you with getting into make up (if you want to that is)

And don't take any bull crap from people. You know who you are and none can change that! :D
 I hope you can read this though the typos. English isn't the best. I will say that :3 hope this helps even if only a little bit :3
Im facing the same problems you are except as a teenager, ive found talking with friends that you've known for a long time. And as you move forward kind of pick peoples brains to get an idea on their views.
I wanted to check in with you about your first day out. Hope all was well.
I think the most important thing you can do for yourself to start is to talk to your wife. Whatever else happens, you will need and want her support. This is a major shift for you, certainly, but remember that at this point it's an internal change. You have some control over the external elements of your gender identity, and you will want to slowly guage your level of safety and comfort in each of the arenas of your life. I'm happy for you. It won't be easy, but you'll be rewarded by loving yourself more than you thought possible.
I too in a mostly male dominant field and ex military. I came out as bi years ago and trans earlier this year. I’ve told everyone even all my co-worker. It has gone very well so far. I’ve legally changed my name and have started HRT. 
You have to do things at your pace don’t let others tell you what to do. Talk things over with your wife and make sure you are both ok with whatever you decide to do in the future. If you live in the US there are laws against dismissing someone from a job because of gender but yes they could make it miserable for you so only you know how the people you work with are. 
Family wise everyone has been supportive except my mom and a few other relatives.
Good luck with your journey and welcome to the best group of people.
Thanks :)
I didn't even think about looking into my insurance yet 😬

But this great advice and I deeply appreciate the support! 🤩
Well I had to work a long day so I haven't talked about it at all with my wife.

But internally, I've been feeling wonderful about it all day. I keep catching myself smiling about it like a dork 😂

Today has been a big step in at least admitting it to myself. And I can't thank you all enough for the support!!!
I think shes basically knows at this point and is just waiting for me to come out to her 😂 but that is the right place to start. I'm still nervous about it. Just because I feel it adds some level of inherent pressure to start transitioning. But it's a band aide that needs ripping
Thanks for the support!! 🤩

How difficult was it to start HRT and changing your name? And advice there?
Feel free to message me if you want to talk more. I'm new to my own transition, but I'd be willing to share what I can if you like.
You will definitely feel pressure to transition and most of that will be internal. I tell you this because it will be important for you to remember that you have to be in control of your development. I really want to transition so that I can renew my vows with my wife and take her last name. I dream about it. It's the fantasy that keeps me moving from my self-identification as bigender towards a trans feminine identity. But I know that I can't drop everything and live that moment. I'm pre-hrt and newly into my own development. So what I did to help pace myself was to create a gender affirmation poster and frame it (chosen name, pronouns, three things I am grateful for because I came out, and a list of my transition goals in a rough order of when I want to accomplish them). This little poster has put me over the moon for the last three days. That's what's working for me. You don't seem to be that far along, of course, but when you sit and give yourself time to think about your future, it may be a good, affirming activity that will help your wife understand what you need and she can participate in your journey.
Starting HRT was pretty easy for me, I got a referral to an endocrinologist and met with her and she prescribed the meds right there. The name change is a little different in each state, for me in Arizona I had to pay $333 to file the paperwork than had my court date about a month later an pay another $30 for the certified copy. Now I’m in the process of changing everything to my new name.
Have you thought about a new name? I’m Olivia btw. If you just want to chat or ask a question just dm me.
Omg that poster is a fantastic idea!!
I've toyed with a few names so far in my head. Wrote a few down privately. I think that's something I want to finalize before I fully open up to my wife. 

And you're so helpful Olivia! :) I got to get back to work soon but I may DM you later!!

I love this community so far, y'all are fantastic!
I've not seen anyone else talk about doing one before, but it seemed like something that could be helpful. I'm not the sort of person who gets into affirmations generally, but as a newly out trans woman who needs a bit of encouragement that she is, indeed, valid and isn't just a guy who wears women's clothing and makeup, I needed something external and meaningful. One thing I may add to it is a quote I've seen here on Reddit. To paraphrase, it's along the lines of  ""Cis hetero men don't want to be women"" or ""Cis men don't wonder if they are trans."" Both kind of carry the same message for me and I find that sentiment to be very validating."	r4yesm	trans	17	1.0	2021-11-29 15:36:33
Getting a referral to the gender clinic!	There's not much else to it. I won't be seen for another few years because trans healthcare in this country is not great, but it's getting the ball rolling! I wanted to share because trans joy is important!	"So happy for you :) You got this!
Very good! Do I call you sir or madam?
Thank you <3
Well I'm non binary, but I feel like sir is fun for me!

Epiphany from Therapy (trans joy!)	"I attend a trans masc group therapy session every other week, and today someone was discussing how they dressed as a teenager - I had never thought about how I dressed/ how I would’ve dressed because I still thought I was a girl at that age - but I had a sudden moment where I realized I would’ve dressed almost the same exact way had I grown up as a cis boy.       
  

I had a “default character skin” in high school where I almost always wore a black tank top, black jeans, and boots.  If I had been a cis teenage boy, I would’ve had the same thing - just with more of a “wife beater” than a tank top.  I still would’ve worn dress shirts with jeans all the time.  Hell, I still would’ve worn skirts/ dresses to school on the rare occasion how I did.  I was already being myself, even if it didn’t match my body or name at the time.   
  

I’m just realizing how healing this is for me, that I can picture myself as a teenage boy way more clearly because I was always a queer teenage boy - dressing as comfortably as I knew how…. I’ve felt so detached from my teenage years for a long time, so this is really cool."	i love this.. and i can really relate. thank you for sharing	quy72s	trans	17	0.95	2021-11-16 03:23:20
Today is her surgery day	"It’s the big one. The one she has been working towards for nearly fifty years. And I get to be here with her. 

I gotta say that I came with my best friend’s sister as her support person. They play gatekeeper to the surgery and she had to have someone sign for her!  I have had eleven surgeries and not once, even the major ones, did I have to have someone sign. She was panicked as it’s almost impossible to get someone for 2 weeks, no matter the support system. 

I’m so glad I got that call and got to come. So elated to see her finally feeling joy. This was the grumpiest, unhappiest, pisser you had ever met and now she is a happy, joyously free fully realized human. 

I want to thank the luck I got for being here. Just felt like sharing her joy, my joy, this great joy that she is coming into her own. It’s freaking amazing for this old lady to witness."	"That's awesome. Did I get it right that you are hearing and your sister and her friend are deaf?
Sorry. No. She got the transition surgery yesterday. I am so excited for her.
What do you mean by ""somebody sign for her"" then? Signing a document? I don't know what the hospital wanted.
I guess I didn't understand the story. 
It's good for her, though.
I understand the confusion now. I was making assumptions that it was common knowledge. As part of the transition surgery l, they force the patients to undergo a lot. They must have letters from several therapists that they understand and desire the surgery. One from the primary dr. There are others. Then you must get someone to agree to commit to 2 weeks of care, “signing for you” without those letters and without someone willing to put their lives on hold for 2 weeks to devote themselves to your care you will be denied.  (even though it’s now a day surgery. And I have never been asked for someone to sign and agree to stay with me. I’ve had eleven surgeries). It is a huge sacrifice for the person agreeing to the 2 weeks because the surgery is rarely in the same city, or state, of residence.  And insurance is a battle to cover surgery so they won’t pay for someone to be your care attendant for several weeks, especially for a day surgery.  A good attendant would be upwards of $2,000 to $5,000 for 24/7 care. Plus travel expenses. So the additional cost of just this one requirement of surgery can run a person $5,000 to $10,000. 

It boggles the mind. I hope this clears it up. Yeah it’s confusing. I had to have it explained to me to before I quickly agreed. But I’m an old disabled lady whose children are hitting adulthood, without a job, and financially stable enough to make the trip. I was very lucky to be available.
Thank you for explaining, now I get it. Yes, you were both lucky. Your friend for starting their new life and you for being able to help. It's a good feeling.
I have never seen a happier person. Thank you."	mqbngp	trans	19	0.96	2021-04-13 21:09:54

I need to get my story out I guess. It’s going to be long so thank you for enduring if you get to the end.	"Seeing so many of you finally embrace who you are and try to live freely as yourself is truly inspiring. 

Ive hidden who I always felt I was, who I always wanted to be from almost everyone my entire life. I knew when I was 4 that I was “different”. I used to pray and wish and hope that every day I’d wake up a girl. Obviously I figured out at some point that’s not how life works, but my desire and longing to not be what I felt I was forced to be never wavered. 

I overcorrected and projected super hard to throw people off the scent of my internal struggles. Being raised in religion certainly doesn’t help with the feelings of shame and guilt. Hearing the people you love and care about say awful, hurtful or even mostly benign but ignorant things about others you identify with, works it’s way into your psyche without you even noticing. 

At some point very early in my life I figured out I couldn’t tell anyone how I really felt. That I would get in trouble and something bad would happen. So I hid. I covered it up and stuffed my real self as deep as down as I could. Which I know is so severely common for us. I know I’m not describing anything new or shocking either. If anything my experience is tame and I should feel lucky I wasn’t subjected to real violence or anger or rejection from my family because I never had the courage to let my true self out. 

I got “caught” so to speak a few times by my family. Random pieces of clothing in spots they shouldn’t be and things of that nature. My father was far more comfortable with me being a pervert, because telling him I was touching myself with the clothes made him sigh in relief and say “ok that’s normal. If you were wearing them then we’d have a problem” which just cemented my 12 year old self in the “always keep it secret” path I was on.

That secrecy led to my other self becoming a fetish and something I thought was just a weird sex thing I had. Hitting puberty changed (or I thought it did anyway) the way I looked at it. For a long time. It wasn’t until I hit 30 that I started to truly understand what I was repressing. 

My girlfriend at the time was the most supportive anyone has ever been with me. She bought me my first nice, expensive wig and asked me if she could see my other self. She did my make up and I wore a dress I really liked and I just cried when I saw myself. It was like I finally understood that this is who I really was. It broke me but in a good way. I felt so happy and giddy and just, beside myself with joy in that moment. 

I’ve told a few people since then, close friends and no family. Though my parents did out me to them against my will not long ago. That’s a whole other thing I won’t get into right now. 

I’ve been in therapy for a bit now, trying to get a firmer grasp or understanding of my true self. Things are coming to a fork in the road emotionally for me. I need to do something about it. Living a double life is something I know I can’t handle much longer. I know this will have consequences and I will most likely lose most if not all of my family. It’s such a huge decision and I’m worried I waited too long. 

I’m not entirely sure if I have a point here but, I guess I just needed this out of me. Thank you for being part of this space and reading my rambling."	"> I used to pray and wish and hope that every day I’d wake up a girl.

pretty sure the fact that these prayers never got answered are what turned me into an atheist.

Well, welcome to the party, girl. If you haven't stumbled across it yet, I'd suggest reading through https://genderdysphoria.fyi/ -- it helped me put a lot into context.
Your entire post is so familiar to many of us.  I didn’t think there were people like me.  I felt different and in a community of one.  Little did I know that there are hundreds of thousands of people that literally went through and felt the exact same things.
With you.. Seriously I've known since as far back as I can remember that something wasn't right and to hold it for so long is a painful experience and I respect your determination a lot.
I was thinking the same thing.  I went to atheism then decided I don’t know what’s out there so now I’m agnostic.  I’m definitely not what I was raised as, that literally cannot be true based on my (our collective) experience(s).
Thank you so much. I’m definitely checking that out.

I regret starting HRT (TW: thoughts of suicide)	"Apparently, about three years or so ago, I asked on Reddit if it would be possible for me to start HRT without letting my Korean family know. I wrote, back then:

*""I feel bad that I've been sitting on an opportunity that many others would kill to have but welp, here I am. Everything \*could\* work out if I try. ... I'm just so happy that I flew to another side of the planet for college. And here I am, at the front door of a very big decision. I am willing to change my looks back to my own \[edit: old\] self every time I get back home. I would look different, still, and that gives me a lot of anxiety over taking this big step. What if they notice! Coming out is unfortunately not an option.""*

In the comment section, I was told that I *""won't be able to hide it from them forever""*, and that *""it's not going to last forever""* and so on. Well, a not-forever amount of time has passed since then. About a few days after that post, I came out to an irl friend for the first time. Then, in a few weeks, I was ripped out of that very friend group because I was sent back to Korea (the university decided that I should be on a medical leave.) A year after that, I moved back to the US for a different school in a completely different region. It took me another six months on my new campus to convince myself that I was finally in a safe enough place to start HRT. Back then, I decided to make just a small compromise; I wanted to stay in the closet, but I also wanted to stop myself from growing any older in a male body. In the middle point was my tentative, minimum-dosage, bootleg DIY hormone replacement therapy. And I took that chance, with no damn clue on what to do afterwards, thinking that I could, if necessary, stop taking it at any time, by my own choice.

Another year and a half has passed since I made that leap of faith. I now have been on hormones for about as much time as it took for me to go from coming out to starting hormones. I am still in the closet, since I still do not find it possible to come out to my family. But I must confess that I have, since starting HRT, worn a dress in public, felt what it's like to have guys hit on me in a bar, and confused the airport security multiple times even with my best boymode. I have been to a pride fest for the first time as myself. I have felt the weight of the silence that befell on my vocal cords when someone tried to strike a conversation with me in a dress; I have also felt the mischievous joy, when I decided, cruelly, to blink, smile, and glance away from that poor man. I have no regrets about the life that I got to live here, even if it was for not much more than a year. Maybe I do regret not having done more with it. But I do not regret any of what I did get to do.

This journey of transition is unique to each and every one of us. But it is also one and the same, in the sense that, all of us, at some point in our lives, must embark on it in order to say that we have lived at all. That is what I did, just like you did, or will. It is so strange that I can read that post from three years ago and remember being this terribly scared, terribly confused boy, barely an adult. I remember how I looked like then, how I sounded like, how I talked like, how *I was*. But I do not recognize myself in him. No matter how hard I try, I cannot mentally establish a continuity between me and that boy. But I *was* him. We also look quite similar, and go by the same name. Yet I cannot imagine a world in which I am him; *I*, not in the sense of any legal personhood, but in the sense of my own, most immediate selfhood. I am no longer him, if there ever was a time when I was him. 

I had truly, truly underestimated what transitioning actually can do.

I underestimated it back then, and only now am I seeing its true power. I did not know then, that, by deciding to transition, I had begun a process that I cannot revert nor stop. I shouldn't have thought that I could just try this for a while and then go back. Had I known. Had I only known.

There is this Jewish fable that I read when I was a child. It goes like this: once upon a time, a fox found a vineyard. It was guarded by a mighty fence, except for a small foxhole. So the fox starved itself until it could fit in, and three days later, it finally shrunk down enough to get through. Inside, it began to enjoy the delicious grapes to its heart's content. It enjoyed the vineyard so much, that it even forgot that there was something like hunger, much less the time when it wasn't inside the fence. But, when the time to go back home eventually came, the fox found that it could no longer fit through the hole, having eaten so much. At the end of this story, the fox, I think, starves itself back and crawls out of the vineyard as hungry as it was before entering. But I have wondered if the fox could ever truly leave the vineyard behind. There is nothing outside the fence that the fox truly desires. It would rather starve for three days to go inside and taste those grapes, than to eat whatever it had been eating outside. Certainly, then, hunger isn't the problem; it's that the fox desires those grapes so badly that it would rather forego eating at all than to not have the grapes. I ask, then, if the fox wouldn't rather choose to live inside the vineyard, knowing that the day when he is caught is the day he dies, than to deny himself the grapes and return to a state where he can only long for the grapes from over the fence. I ask you, if you were the fox, would have done the same.

No one realizes, I think, that they had been missing out on something until they try it out for the first time. For example, no one thinks they need to wear glasses until they try on their first pair. Just like that, I had not realized, until I tried it out for the first time, that I could have this kind of happiness. And the fox could starve, and the glasses can be taken off again, but I can't let go of this happiness. At least, I can't do it myself; someone would have to pry it out of my hands. If I had been dejected from the beginning, if I was told from the start that I could never live this life, I wouldn't have to face this loss. I would have had the option of giving up, and wait for a time when I, maybe, could look back at it again. But a loss is so much harder to bear than not having had it in the first place.

I am now facing several serious attendance and assignment problems in this college. No matter how they get resolved, I know that their conclusions will all be the same: I cannot continue my life in this campus, in this school, under my visa, away from my parents' eyes, in this country. I must, one way or another, leave the only place I know how to live in. Not only that, my parents have been seemingly noticed something; they have been quite anxious about wanting to see me again. Just now I have answered another text message from dad that I need to buy that plane ticket for the winter break. It is as if they are racing one another; who will come first, the winter break, or the dismissal notice from the school?

I do not regret the HRT and what came about it. I only regret starting the HRT. I regret having done it the way I did it. I could have waited more for a better environment. I could have even lived without doing it at all. But I chose to test my luck in such a precarious time of my life. Maybe there could have been a different time, in an alternate life, when I could have started transitioning from a much more solid ground. But I blew it, prematurely. I have inadvertently tied my life as me with the temporary living condition that being an international college student provides. Now, the continuation of my being is contingent upon me maintaining my studentship. And really, that this whole thing, this whole reflection on what my life, started because of some academic disciplinary action, is quite comical to me. I tried to draw upon some kind of anger from within, but inside I found nothing but the impressions and crumbs of past emotions that once was there. Maybe empty laughter is the sound that it makes when you press down, like a bagpipe, on the space where emotions used to be filled with.

I mean, I probably should have known this. This was supposed to come to an end anyways. I could go to grad school after college, but what after then? What difference does it make to spend a year or two more, if I am going to lose it anyways? Of course, I am not actually that content nor calm about it. But it helps, certainly, to think of it that way.

Outside, the weather is approaching winter fast. There is a sense of finality in this time and place. But for now, I am just looking back on how good it has been.

I think I can afford to be content; I just need the bravery to say that I am ready to move on and leave this all behind. I do find it regretful that I didn't see back then that there could be a more sustainable path. But also, at this point in my writing, I am coming to the realization that my regret may be misguided; if I were given that choice again, would I not choose to start HRT? If the answer to this question is yes, then all the rest of the conclusions were inevitable; it was inevitable that I would enjoy my time here too much to go back, that I would tie my fate with my being a college student, and that at the end of the day, all I could do is to enjoy what time I am given here. I dreamt of so many things; but how many of your dreams do you actually get to see come true? In that ratio, I think I could say that I have truly succeeded. I can easily imagine scenarios where I wouldn't even have achieved what I had, and it is only thanks to my rushed, uninformed choice back then that I could have done it.

Maybe this reads too much like a suicide note. But maybe I am just grieving -- ""venting"" --  the upcoming loss of my life as I know it. It could be read either way. I, for one, am not sure.

But if you had read all the way here, do you think they are any different?"	"This is so heavy. I wanted to say thank you for sharing this deeply personal note with us. 

I don’t know what the answer is. But I do know this - your fox would have been miserable outside of the vineyard. We’ve all been through it. It hurts to exist when you know you don’t belong in this body yet you can’t change it. 

I don’t know what will happen when you go back to Korea. I don’t know if you can hide it from your family, what your solution will be, or if you will be cast out, have to detransition, or worse. 

It could be bad. I don’t want to sugarcoat it. And detransitioning can be an awful experience - again, like having a taste of those wonderful grapes in the vineyard and then having to go back out to the forest. But also being outed to a (presumably) extremely conservative family will also be awful. 

As bad as it may get, it is likely to pass. I’ve listened to the words of many transgender people (on YouTube mostly) who have detransitioned for one reason or another. And it’s not a great experience, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 

But it passed, and they found themselves living their best lives eventually. It may take years. Perhaps your degree will confer a new job that will grant you more independence. Perhaps something else. 

Stay strong hun. Eventually you’ll have a vineyard to call your own.
I know this is fairly old, but I stumbled upon it and wow, you got a lot into this post. It's pretty deep I won't even lie. It got me at the part with the fox fable. I know exactly why you put that there and what it meant. Ever since I started transitioning, in this case, socially, I couldn't go back. I had to continue with my transition and begin medical transition. I would have rather thrown my life away completely than be seen as a woman (I'm FtM). It's insane how much my life had changed just by finding out I was trans. Sure my life was fairly dull, and I wasn't necessarily happy or content before I knew, but after I found out, my depression violently spiraled out of my control. No matter what I did, it still only progressively got worse until I got access to medical transition. I basically got the the point, equivalent to that of the fox beginning to starve from eating nothing at all. I'm completely reliant on hormone replacements, but there's nothing I can do about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm happier than I've ever been! I just recently had a bit of reality check where I had an allergy scare. It was a penicillin allergy, but I was so convinced it was my testosterone. I was so paranoid that I would be forced to stop HRT as a whole.

Hello r/trans, please help educate me on gender dysphoria!	"I am a 22 year old queer female who believes in inner peace and resolution through gender identity. I’ve always seen my expression as more androgynous, though I’ve recently discovered the joys of feminine power through the gay, trans and drag community. The LGBTQ+ community has helped me discover aspects of my sexual orientation and better my relationship with my own gender identity. And for that, I’ve sworn to myself to always stand up for the safety to safety of other members of this vibrant community on all spectrum of the rainbow!

However, the recent discourse and subsequent hate aimed towards trans activist Dylan Mulvaney leaves me genuinely anxious about how transitioning women, and I realised that I know nothing about the anxiety, mental turmoil, and overall experience of gender dysphoria. 

Therefore, I am humbly asking you folks, the lovely beings of this community to educate me on your firsthand experience, the social, mental and physical, aspects on the dysphoria and how transitioning has both positively and negatively (if any) affected yourself in this journey of life.

All comments are welcome, and feel free to leave as little or as much detail as you’d like!"	"Start here: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
Imagine walking into the wrong classroom or hearing a recording of your own voice. 
That’s the feeling of living as my assigned gender at birth
I explain Gender Dysphoria like this:

Imagine you wake up in the opposite gender. You now have to go out into society and get dirty looks from the people who knew you when you were the opposite gender. You even get dirty looks from other people because they still see traits of your previous gender. AT some point, a feeling develops where you start to hate your new gender, you hate how it makes you different from everybody else, and how you get treated differently because of it.

Eventually it builds and builds until and causes emotional distress. The first things that cause this distress are the very things that keep you from being your true gender, like the pre-op chest on a trans man, or the genitals on a pre-op trans woman. Soon they narrow down to the nit-picky things that obviously differentiate a biological male from a biological female (examples: AMAB have stronger eyebrow bone lines, wider shoulders, AFAB have wider hips). Using myself as an example, I'm not super dysphoric about my penis, but the dysphoria I do have is painful because it means I'll never be a woman genetically, and be able to give birth or have a motherly connection to my future children. To me, a period is like a rite of womanhood, which feels invalidating as I am a woman. The best way I can describe my feelings about it all, is like a deep sinking feeling in my heart. This feeling never really goes away. On the best of days, I feel gender euphoria (like painting my nails, or getting complimented as a girl out in public), but on the worse days it's debilitating and leads to intrusive thoughts.

This is all before the media and transphobic people get to you, accusing you of being a pervert if you use the bathroom that is associated with your gender, or assuming that you a child groomer. It really causes dysphoria to become so much worse.
Being trans is different for everyone. The best way to get an understanding of a trans person , is to meet one . And then you’ll have an understanding of that one trans person. To understand us all, you’d have to meet us all. You’d see how different we are and how the only thing we have in common is the fact that we have some problem with our gender in relation to our sex. All of this stuff is confusing , and I don’t know it. All I can say is in my experience I enjoy living my life as a trans woman. My life is worth living now. I get called pretty and people are very nice to me. I have affirming people in my life. I am not hurting anyone or causing any conflict in my daily life with how I look and live. You’d have to meet me to understand
Hi. Your intentions may be good but running into a group and demanding emotional labor isn't.
For me it's just the body dysphoria, because gender identity is nothing more than the fitting between body and mind for me.
Like something is fundamentally wrong with your body, but people don't believe you.
I unfortunately can’t speak for the effects of transitioning, however the dysphoria I can definitely talk about, though it’s hard to explain but I’ll try my best.

Whenever I notice something that makes me feel dysphoric, such as my voice or my chest, I get this pit feeling in my gut and it just feels yucky. Sometimes it gets so bad that I just refuse to speak or look at myself because I just can’t stand it. When I’m deadnamed or misgendered, it just doesn’t really feel like the person is talking about me, more like just a shell of myself. My name particularly bothers me and always has, but that’s the part that gets abused the most as well.

I’m out to my family, I’ve told them my prefered name/pronouns but they’ve just refused to call me that basically saying that “because we’re your parents we’re the exception,” and they couldn’t be more wrong about that. They’re the ones I need the support from most and the fact that they aren’t providing that makes me more upset each day. More people need to understand that the more important they are to us, the less likely they’re “the exception.”

Of course there are good days and bad. I feel somewhat cursed and somewhat blessed to be trans. On one hand, I have to face discomfort and discrimination every day, even and especially in my own home. On the other hand, I have a wonderful community who will always be here who always support each other. I’m proud to be trans and a part of this beautiful community; not just the trans community, but the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. It’s as flawed as any other community, but it’s still full of amazing people, thank you all for being here!
I have to wake up everyday look in the mirror and see a body that will NEVER make my only dream come true. I’ve tried just living as my assigned gender at birth for a long time until i was able to pay for my bills and not need parental assistance. Growing up i didnt fit into the groups i was “supposed” to always felt out of place yet i liked and felt more similar to people of the opposite gender up until puberty and that is when my brain initially cracked bc i knew for the next 60-80 yrs of my life until i die my dream would never come true. So i would mask and pretend to be happy and lie when i would be asked if im ok. Well im done lying about being happy and now i just try and live out the rest of my life with knowing what i can change and just cry about what i cant. Adoption as a concept is helpful but its not as real for me you know? No one chooses how they are born so knowing that we shouldnt try to force people into doing things they dont like doing. Why should someone be forced to eat vanilla when they want chocolate ice cream and the reason being for them not are others that were born similarly enjoy vanilla instead so you MUST eat it same with clothes, hobbies, friend groups, etc etc etc. And it doesnf help when youre just trying to snjoy life when politicians are criminalizing you for wanting to stay alive even though society wants to make you their slave.
Thank you so so much!!! This genuinely helps, though I’ve gotta lot of reading to do :3

A wonderful moment	"So, I was at Meijer, our local Walmart competitor.  There's a transwoman who is one of the junior managers, really nice, but I'd never interacted with her before.  

So I was waiting in a long line she calls out to me, to tell me they just opened up a lane, and she calls me ""ma'am"".  

When I get up to the lane, she starts to apologize and call me ""sir"" and I'm like ""you had it right the first time.""   She looks at me for a moment then smiles and starts giggling.  

There are sometimes where being trans is quite joyful."	That’s really cute. Just a nice moment of shared understanding, womanhood, and humanity. Thanks for sharing it with us!	zl93tx	trans	15	0.9	2022-12-13 22:29:04
(mtf) So, I think I developed a funny habit.	"So, this isn't anything new for me, but... Having been on HRT for about a year, I now commonly end up brushing my own cheek all the time.

It's weird, I'm weird, and you think I'd be used to it by now maybe, but the fact my cheek feels softer just brings me a bit of joy and I love it. So... I keep catching myself doing it for months now. (And I probably look comical for those who I've told this now.) 

And... That's all. I... Wasn't sure exactly where to post this.
I just kinda wanted to poke fun at myself being weird.
I hope you're all doing well.

Can you fake euphoria?	Being called by my real name and he/him makes me super excited and smiling and dancing in joy but can one fake this? Like I recently got through a rough break up and maybe it’s a weird coping mechanism? (Luckily having a therapist appointment in the next month but I’m so confused)	"Nope. You can't fake it. You can pretend to have feelings, but you have the feelings and that can't be faked
Tips when questioning if you’re faking it, no matter the topic: 

- if you’re wondering if you’re faking it, you’re probably not faking it

- did you wake up this morning and decide “I should fake X. What would look most convincing?” If not, then you’re not.
Wondering sane thing. Last month I was miserable. The lowest of low... and now I feel free... no must be fake right 😅

So I'll say to you what my therapist makes me say to myself. 
It's ok to be happy! I'm allowed to celebrate! My feelings are valid!

Good luck and hope it helps
You can fake euphoria to other people but you can’t fake it to yourself. Unless you’re making a conscious effort to figure out how to fake it, you definitely aren’t! 

Besides, what motivation would you have to fake something as specific as that? Cis people don’t pretend to be trans after a breakup so I think you’re just trans.

EDIT: definitely talk to your therapist about it if you think that would help you figure it out!
The breakup was actually about him realizing he likes d*ck. But tbh even if I transition I don’t plan on getting bottom surgery and through the years of us dating I had my moments of fear here and there that I was a guy and it wouldn’t work out. So thank you!"	sfgkl5	trans	16	0.84	2022-01-29 11:49:41
Would u be ok with this reaction of your parents?	"My cousin came out to her parents.

They had quite the nonchalant reaction.

Her mother said sth like „well, it’s not what I wished for you but I kind of expected it. If u r happy, ok.“

Her father was a little bit more expressive and said only: it‘s not if I understand or could change it. I don‘t like it but you have to live this life, u r still my child.“

I told her she should be happy with that, but she is very disappointed by that. I don’t know what she expected. They accept her but they are not openly expressing joy or happiness about gaining a daughter. They are quite neutral…
Is that really such a bad reaction? My parents would react in the same way I guess…"	"„I don‘t like it“ and „it‘s not what I wished“ are not neutral reactions. They are negative. That is quite hurtful, because what they are being negative about is the identity of their child, her choice to be who she is and to strive to be more happy.   
Any child would be sad if their parents said they don‘t like them and their effort to become happier. We want to feel loved and emotionally supported. This sounds like there won‘t be any emotional support for her.  

It must feel terrible for her, because society often treats trans people bad. Imagine you have to face an angry group of people, while knowing the people that should be your rock, won’t be there for you. That is quite a lonely prospect for the future.  

While they claim they still consider your cousin their child for now, these answers can be an indication that worse reactions are to come. Sadly, according to most trans people‘s experiences that is very likely.   

Hence, yes, I‘d be sad after that reaction, too.  
Let‘s hope they‘ll come around for her.
A bit more support would have been nice, but it is NOT a bad reaction per se. Better neutrality than outright hostility.
Nah. That’s not supportive enough and I’m over non supportive parents lol. That’s why when they are adults they probably won’t even talk to their parents anymore.
I mean, if they aren't yeeting me out to the curb I'd call it a good reaction. But outside that low bar I'd say it's a fairly non-accepting reaction for the same reasons Banegard mentioned.
This is not a neutral or good reaction, and you can tell by comparing it to annoy her announcement (literally anything else).

If someone told their parents they’d just engaged and their parents said “well I can’t say I’m surprised, this sure is disappointing though” you would not say they’d responded well.

If someone told you they were pregnant and you said “look I don’t understand, I wish I could fix this and I don’t like it but you make your own decisions I guess” would you blame them for being pissed off at you?

You tell someone you’re going to uni and they go “oh well I guess you’re still my friend”… are you happy with this response?

Why do people expect us to settle for the bare minimum: a lack of outright hostility and hatred? This reaction is obviously not accepting or supportive. All the parents have said is what is technically true: she will be their child no matter what. Coming out as trans deserves the same reaction as any other life changing piece of news: joy, celebration, happiness, and overwhelming support and respect. If anything, we deserve more than what you would typically expect for a pregnancy or wedding, because we’re facing so much negativity from the rest of society. 

It’s not a matter of “what she expected”, it’s about what she’s entitled to. Could she have expected better? Probably not, most people are transphobic. Does she deserve better? Absolutely - everyone deserves unconditional love from their parents at all times, especially when it comes to being who you really are.
Honestly it sounds like people that are surprised, don't know how to react or process, so are hesitant but supportive. 

This straight up sounds like people that will come around. If they were outright hostile or angry you'd have trouble. 

A parent could say ""not what I was hoping for"" if their child comes out gay because they really wanted a grandchild. Not that they have a problem with it, but need to rearrange their expectations and mentality.
My own mother (a lesbian) had a similar reaction when I came out. She explained it as a fear and concern for her child that I would have to live a potentially much harder life than if I had not been queer. She's not upset or disappointed by any means but she's not thrilled I have to deal with navigating a bigoted society either.

These reactions seem very reasonable, rational and still show love for their kid. They could have countless reasons for not being overly joyous of learning their kid is trans that have nothing to do with being unsupportive.

Hopefully with time and communication your cousin will come to understand her parents reaction.
My relatives have smoothbrain takes about trans people, I'm only coming out to the people I care about, IE not them.
I'd call that a good reaction. Not everyone is going to be jumping for joy at the news. Try to think about it from their perspective... They've known a person one way for their entire life, and we're basically just told that the person they thought they knew and raised ""doesn't exist."" It'll take time to convince them that they are the same person they always were, just presenting differently. For many older folks, their child coming out to them is their first ever experience with something like this in their lives. Not everyone is a trained therapist or would even think to ask what kind of support they need.

To answer the question of the title, I actually did have an almost identical reaction from my parents when I told them. I was 29 and they were in their late 50s, if it makes a difference.
Oof. So, it could have been a lot worse, and a lot of folks have worse reactions from their parents. But no, it’s not a great reaction either. And you kinda overstepped by telling her she should be happy with that. It’s okay for her to be disappointed! Her parents are clearly disappointed with her news, maybe you should go tell them that they should be happier instead. 

In general, I’m really not a fan of telling people that their feelings are wrong or invalid. If what you really mean is “I would be happy with a reaction like that personally” then say that. But don’t tell other people how they should feel, okay? Best of luck to you!
Their reaction is similar to my own mothers reaction, and she has since continued misgendering me at every opportunity since. And I’m a grown ass adult with children!!! I don’t blame your cousin for feeling disappointed with their parents reaction.
How would u wish support to be like?

As a trans person, would it be wrong for me to get a Harry Potter related tattoo?	"Thinking about getting a tattoo and really wanting to choose something that has made a lot of impact. Harry Potter is something that comes to mind. I started reading the series after the passing of my grandparent who loved the series and it helped me cope with her death, and the series always really brought me a lot of joy in the darkest of times growing up. I really wanna get a tattoo in honor of this. 

However, I don’t support at all what JK Rowling has said/done to the trans community. After it was revealed she was transphobic, I distanced myself from the HP community and stopped supporting her all together. Would I be going against my own community if I got a tattoo in relation to HP?"	"I say you like what you like. Enjoying Harry Potter doesn't make you a TERF, even if the author turned out to be a terrible person. If you want to get a Harry Potter tattoo, get one.
Feel this. already have HP tattoo, found out I was trans after.  Personal opinion is you can support something important to you without supporting everything about that person.

^incidentally that’s my best hope how For how my parents will react to coming out eventually 😂
If you can separate the art from the artist go for it. It’s a personal choice and her views do not reflect in the art work.

Why not tie trans in some how harry him holding up a trans flag. Because the actor does support trans right
Hell, JKR isn't getting any money from your tattoo, and would probably hate the thought that trans people are getting HP themed tattoos. All of which sound like excellent reasons to get one.
Not at all, harry potter is not JKR, its much more than just her, and many actors have talked against what JKR said
To be honest, I still love Harry Potter and also Fantastic Beasts and where to find them. It’s a magical world what fascinated me since I was young. And that has nothing to do with JKR. And even though she says these things, I’ll still watch Harry Potter and also fantastic beasts in the future because I don’t connect it to her. I disagree with her on a personal level but that doesn’t mean I have to hate the art she created.
Better an HP tattoo than eating chic fil a. That holy chicken was delicious, too bad the owners are conservative, religious and anti trans whack jobs
Do what makes you happy. J. K. Is a piece of shit but if the books made an impact on you and you can separate the art from the artist I wouldn't judge you for it.
Daniel Radcliffe is our man. Even if jk ain’t.
If you're able to seperate the artist from the art, then more power to you. I wouldn't get one though, but if you want it, then go for it!
I still plan on getting my HP tattoo ASAP because the series has been such a huge part of my life for so long. I just separate the work from the author
Alt-reality transmasc jk rowling tattoo is the only acceptable answer.

(/s)

Like others have said, liking HP doesn't make you a terf. If you go to in-person trans support groups and its noticeable you might just get some weird looks? idk. it's your body
i feel like its alright unless you get a tattoo praising the one true god J.K. Rowling
That could also work! Or perhaps this opens a window for me to get a trans tattoo alongside it? lol
Does this have the same effect as me getting a butterbeer from Universal or buying Harry Potter related stuff from there or even hot topic? like would that be giving her money?
all hail the holy rowling! /j
Ya totally ❤️❤️
I believe jk does get royalty money from hp world and hot topic
So then would it be wrong of me to get those things? I live in LA near Universal and I go there for butterbeer periodically lol"	n1awkt	trans	17	0.88	2021-04-29 18:33:36
This is the closest thing to a shitty coming out I've had	"I came out two years ago, but I did almost nothing about it. I was still living with deep internalized transphobia and fear of the transphobia of others. On Monday I had a giant realization and I finally came oUT to myself after 26 years. I'm not ""a man who looks like a woman"", I'm not ""a man but I have XX chromosomes."" There was always a ""but"", always an asterisk, always the feeling that I'm not ""really"" a man. But that's not true. Transphobes be like ""oh you're just a woman pretending to be a man"", but no, I'm a man who finally, finally stopped pretending to be a woman. Full stop.

And I've been so, so excited about it. I feel like my entire life has changed. I'm so happy. I've cried from joy so many times this past week. People have called me ""Adam"" without me asking. So I don't blame my partner in his excitement when he wanted his parents to use the right pronouns with me.

My partner accidentally outed me to his parents on the way to their house for 4th of July. He asked them to use the correct pronouns. I was so mad. His mom knows, or must know, he reasoned. She's my facebook friend where I am basically dealing with my actual coming out. He was trying to help. 

But I hate those moments where the sentence stops and jerks at the pronoun because someone is unsure or uncomfortable. Or even worse, the fact that by the end of the night, they had just rearranged their sentence structure to just refer to me by my name. I hate it. I feel like a freak. I feel like there is an elephant in the room. I feel like I should be acting more masculine. Like they look at me and they still see and girl and go ""wtf?"" 


I don't care if you call me ""she""; because you think I'm a girl. The problem isn't the word, *the problem is you think I'm a girl*. Unless/until you can accept that's not true, then just don't try. Just use feminine pronouns and I will deal with how that feels. Whatever. Because this awkwardness, this sticking out, this feeling of every eye being on you and finding you deficient as a man is not okay. If you can't do it, then don't try unless or until you can. It just hurts. I'd rather just keep pretending to be a normal girl than feel like an abomination of a boy.


Aaaaaaaaaand now I'm crying and get to feel super manly about that too.


We're at his parents' house until Sunday. Fuck. 

I could really use someone to talk to."	"Honestly, I find it better to take people at their word. Since we're not mind-readers, if they say ""He,"" even if they stumble but eventually say ""He"" you can only assume they mean it. 

It's better for your sanity to stop there, and let either that person (or your partner) deal with whether they really believe it. You'll stop worrying about ""behaving like a man"" when everyone reaffirms what you already know. You're a man. How you behave is actually how a man behaves, because you are one.
-Hugs-
Just remember, however you act IS manly, 'cause you're a man. You're acting like a man whenever you act as yourself. Hope that helps.
I know its hard to get to grips with people stumbling over the correct pronouns. But they do need to practise and they will make mistakes. Just try to let it bounce off when they do fumble. They will get there in the end. Hugs xxx"	3c4azn	trans	14	0.86	2015-07-04 17:19:21
My Transiversary! A year in review	"My egg cracked about a year ago, and I've arbitrarily chosen the 12th as the anniversary date, because you know, 12 = a dozen, like eggs.  Get it? I figure I'd celebrate by reflecting on everything that transpired over the past year because it's been a wild ride.  It's been a year marked by firsts, blossoming as a human being, celebrating new and old friendships, and of course, a fair share of hardships.  I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

About a year ago, I finally gathered the courage to punch into Google a burning question that had been slowly making its way to the forefront of my mind:  Am I transgender? There was a mountain of evidence, but I refused to acknowledge it for my most of my life, instead figuring I could just ignore the issue and hope it would go away -- you know, like a totally healthy, productive way of dealing with any problem, right?

So, everyone here knows that doesn't work. At least, not forever.  That feeling of wrongness grew and grew, and while I didn't exactly know what to call it, I had a pretty good idea, despite not wanting to admit it to myself.  When I finally mustered the courage to ask the question, putting what had hitherto only been an abstract thought, my greatest fear, and darkest secret into the physical world, it wasn't so scary.  I found a community of people who had those same fears, secrets, and thoughts which make absolutely no sense to the rest of world.  And you welcomed me warmly.  I finally had a community which made sense.

The first person I came out to was my best friend from high school.  She's the only person I've consistently maintained contact with after graduation, some 17 years ago now.  I called her in the dead of the night, sort of in a bit of a panic.  I had said the words out loud to myself, but I needed to say them to someone else, and I knew that no matter what, she'd be accepting.  So, I just blurted them out, ""I think I'm transgender."" After a small pause, she replied with, ""Really?"" in an inquisitive tone.  I described to her the journey that led me to that conclusion, and she added, ""Honestly, that makes sense,"" and went on to detail some things she remembers throughout our friendship that weren't exactly cis.  My spirits were lifted.  Sharing that burden with her was one of the best feelings of my life.

The next person I had to tell wasn't going to be supportive.  I knew she wasn't going to be supportive in advance, but there was no escaping it, and there was no moving forward until she knew, because she's my wife and the mother of my two children.  It took me almost a month to gather the courage to come out to her, and it resulted immediate destruction of our romantic relationship, and the near death of our platonic relationship as well, though I'm pleased to report we're on much better footing now, though we're currently separated and heading towards divorce (an amicable one, at least).  When I told her, she cried for a week straight.  I felt horrible.  She confessed that she knew there was *something* wrong, but she didn't know what, and she never would have guessed it was this.  I felt a lot of the guilt and shame that I had feared for so long.  I didn't want to hurt her, but I was hurting too, and how else was I going to make it stop?

She convinced me to get into therapy, which was a godsend.  Having someone who was completely unbiased with whom I could discuss anything and everything was really empowering.  I had an outlet for my fears, secrets, and anxieties in a judgment-free space.  She helped bring into focus this person I was becoming and gave me the tools I needed to take care of that person emotionally and mentally. She reaffirmed that the things that I was feeling are legitimate, not just some depraved fantasy, not just a mid-life crisis, not just a fetish.  She taught me how to advocate for myself and my needs and not put up with other people's attempts to bully me into being who they want me to be.

Around the same time, I reconnected with another best friend from my childhood.  We'd been best friends from about 3rd grade through high school, but we'd lost touch during our early twenties.  Amazingly, she had also come out as transgender about a year and a half prior, and she's been extremely helpful as a sort of big sister to me (despite being six months younger), offering beauty tips, tips on transition, and tons of moral support.  Our friendship picked up exactly where it left off 15 years ago, and we're closer than ever now, despite living quite far apart.

July and August wound up being a really difficult.  At the time, we'd been living overseas in the UK for the past 3 years, and I learned at the tail end of June that my company was sending me back to America in mid-to-late August, which gave me just under two months to get my affairs in order for a huge trans-Atlantic move.  My wife wound up taking the kids and leaving early, partly to go house hunting and help out with elderly family, but mostly to put some distance between us.  We were at a low point in our relationship, and she left me in a big empty house filled with years of memories both happy and sad, children's toys, and deafening silence.  I cannot adequately describe the sorrow of going home everyday from work to an empty house that has been furnished to provide a loving, safe environment to raise two children, knowing that neither of them will ever set foot in that house again. I cried just about every day for a month and a half.  Worse still, because of the global shipping slowdown and bureaucracy, by the beginning of August, the original date for my return to America was looking more and more tenuous.  I had no clue when I would be reunited with my kids.

One benefit to having the house all to myself though was I got to really explore myself in a way that I had never been able to before, and haven't been able to since.  I bought an entire wardrobe of women's clothing, got to practice my makeup, and removed all my body hair.  I was surprised at the transformation, even without HRT.  The person in the mirror was an actual-factual woman, and even FaceApp saw me as a woman.  Maybe there was hope for me yet!

I also spent that time coming out to the friends I'd made in England, knowing that if they reacted poorly, it didn't matter because I was leaving soon.  I knew at least one of them would be very supportive because she was openly non-binary (she/they), though she mostly just presented as female, so I assumed she was just using she/they for woke points, which I'm fine with.  Instead, I got the shock of my life when I came out to her -- after she congratulated me for recognizing my authentic self, she told me she was AMAB, which had me in disbelief.  She sent me some ""before"" photos and we stayed up late that night just discussing trans things, such as weird thoughts and habits in our pre-realization lives, and again, there were remarkable parallels.  Among all of my UK friends, she became my best friend literally over night, and we've remained in contact ever since.  Most of the others immediately accepted me, and switched over to female pronouns with my even asking, and the holy moly, the first time I got gendered correctly, *I was not prepared*.  The euphoria sent a tingly warmth radiating from my chest out to the tips of my fingers and toes.

By August, I'd gathered the courage to start wearing nail polish out of the house.  As I was saying my final goodbyes to former colleagues, I met up with one person in particular, with whom I'd worked in London.  He was a gay man, but wasn't super out about it.  We had bonded over RuPaul's Drag Race when we worked together.  I showed up in bright blue nail polish, and while I wound up not coming out to him, he definitely noticed, though he was too polite to say anything.  He had previously said I didn't ""seem like the type"" to be such a fan of the show, and when I asked why, he said because I was such a clean-cut, cishet man, not really the demographic of the show.  It'd always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, and admittedly, I wasn't sure why I was so enamoured by it either.  I guess it makes a lot more sense now, although since my egg cracked, it's become a lot less appealing, because RuPaul is just such a problematic person, and because I've definitely seen how drag queens have an inadvertently negative effect on trans women.

I came out to my mom in August, who thought I was joking at first.  She kind of freaked out when she realized I was dead serious. I video chatted with her while fully presenting female, and after the initial shock wore off, she proceeded to tear into my makeup technique, my choice of colors, my choice of attire, etc., under the pretense of being helpful, but really it felt more like uninvited criticism for the sake of making it difficult for me.  A few days later, she had some questions for me ""out of concern,"" and interrogated me on matters about which no mother has any business inquiring. She did, however, respect my wishes and kept the information to herself, for a while anyway.  She has cried on the phone just about every time we've spoken since then, describing grief over ""the death of her son,"" how the ""little boy"" she loved is going away, being replaced by a stranger.  Lay it on thick, mom. Since then, she has also offered plenty of unsolicited opinions on HRT, statistics on detransitioning and suicide, and, of course, The Surgery\^TM, most of which are well-meaning but misguided, and ultimately unwanted.  It's clear she's still trying to talk me out of being transgender.

I wound up flying back home to the US on September 1st, and reuniting with my kids will forever be one of the happiest moments of my life.  I sobbed tears of joy at the airport, which really confused my 4 year old, who didn't understand how I could be crying if I was so happy.  We basically wound up being homeless for the several months, as the housing market was insane and there was no inventory in our price range, and even limited inventory at around double our price range.  We owned a home here in the US which we rented out while we were overseas, and we were ultimately forced to evict the tenants, which was probably one of the hardest ethical dilemmas I've ever been forced into, especially due to the fact that the tenant is a genuinely wonderful person, who's well-known in my area as a leading advocate for transgender youth.  Yeah, I still feel like shit about it.

Due to my housing situation, September through November was a long period of stagnation for my transition.  We were living intermittently with various friends and family, so privacy was at a minimum.  My wife and I still weren't doing great as a couple, but we had mended fences enough that we could stand to be in the same room together, and were doing an excellent job co-parenting, especially under the difficult circumstances.  Our 6th anniversary was in October, and it wound up being pleasant, but awkward, as it was the first time the two of us had been alone together with no kids, certainly since I blew up our marriage with ""my big reveal"" as she had once cruelly called it, but probably since 2019.  There was an elephant in the room that took us half of dinner to finally address.  We addressed it, and there were apologies from both sides about how things were handled, acknowledgments about how things could have been handled differently, and a resolution to work together as a team to raise our children, regardless of what happens between us.

I came out to my dad on Thanksgiving day.  I was really terrified because I had no clue how he was going to react, but my mom basically said, ""if you don't tell him, I will.""  My mom had pretty much reacted exactly how I anticipated -- she didn't disown me or express hatred or anything like that, but she also overreacted and has behaved in a way that's really counterproductive.  She was a known quantity, which is why I had come out to her first.  My dad was a complete unknown.  I had no clue about his thoughts on trans people, other than I know that he tends to vote Republican, though he can't stand Donald Trump or his ilk, and thinks both parties suck equally. He's also fairly conformist.  I was really into the whole goth counterculture when I was a teen and he refused to be seen in public with me at the height of it. He also tends to make light of race/sexuality/gender/religious minority issues, so I was really expecting an uphill battle.  I had sort of pre-emptively stopped talking to him for a few months, because I was not expecting it to go well.  I was pleasantly surprised. He took me seriously, and told me that he didn't know how to help, other than to give me his support and love.  And that was that. I've actually found out that in private conversations between my mom and him, he's actually shut her down several times for overstepping and not showing the support I need.

In December, things had settled down.  We were back in our old house, and we were establishing our new normal.  We took a trip down to Texas to visit my family for the holidays.  One of my close family friends was having a wedding while we were down there, and we were invited.  It was quite a ways away though, so my wife and I had another protracted period of alone time with no children.  It was excruciating.  There were some issues that had remained unresolved for her, and she took the opportunity to address them while we were driving up, during which time she said some really hateful things.  I honestly don't remember what she said, just how she made me feel, and she made me feel like shit.  It was just such an unprovoked, vitriolic rage -- who was this person I was trapped in the car with? The wedding wound up being a miserable experience because of it.  She initially intended to sit in the car for the entire thing, which was ridiculous, so I insisted she come inside.  She was standoffish the entire time, and as soon as the last of the traditions was completed during the reception, she bailed, and I left shortly thereafter.  I texted afterwards to apologized to my friend for my wife's brusk behavior during her big day, and she left me on read.  I haven't heard from her since.

I came out to my three siblings while I was down there as well.  The reactions were two shrugs and a whole-hearted embrace of who I am.  My sister (she/they) is delighted to finally have a sister.  She's accepted me from the get-go and has only ever referred to me as Cassie or Cassandra since learning.  She also frequently corrects my mom when she stubbornly refuses to get it right, something that I've not even been bold enough to do.

I have another friend down in Texas I always make a point to visit whenever I'm in town.  We had worked together a long time ago, and we really hit it off back then, and have remained friends ever since.  The last time I was in town, we went out for drinks, and he had taken the opportunity to come out to me as bisexual. I was honored to be entrusted with this secret, and this time around, I intended to repay him with a secret of my of own.  I symbolically chose the same place he came out to me previously, but unfortunately, he B-lined for the bar, and between the bartender and the other patrons, there was little privacy.  After a couple of drinks, I suggested we go grab a booth, as the bar stools weren't all the comfortable, I lied.  Mercifully, he agreed.  After a couple minutes of conversation, I waited for a natural pause, and then I reminded him how a couple years prior he had entrusted me with a secret, at this very location.  I told him it was my turn to entrust him with a secret, and I came out to him as transgender.  ""Me too,"" she said, grinning ear to ear.

We spent some time trading notes, stories, etc. As it turns out, she wanted to tell me, but got cold feet, unsure of how I'd respond.  So, she strategically chose a location where it wouldn't be feasible to do so in order to take her mind off the idea of doing it. She was glad that I had taken the initiative, as obviously, it made it super easy for her.  We had a couple more drinks and then left in her car to drop me off at my hotel, excitedly swapping stories the entire way back.

In late January, early February, we travelled down to Florida to visit my best friend from high school (the one who was the first person I came out to).  She's got two kids the same age as my two kids, so it made trying to keep everyone entertained super easy.  She and I stayed up late one night to give each other mani/pedis and it was fabulous.  It was such an affirming activity, staying up late with my bestie doing each other's nails. I'm not out to my kids or to hers, but she slipped up once or twice and called me by my chosen name in front of her kids, who didn't take notice, but those were also really euphoric moments for me.  Her older daughter also saw me presenting female back in August when I had drunkenly video called.  She introduced me to her daughter as Cassie, and she didn't even question it.  She didn't care about my deep voice, or the fact that I was clearly wearing a wig.  She just immediately accepted that I was a woman, and a very good friend of her mom's.  She even met be before, as a man.  She didn't make the connection at all.  Kids are frickin' awesome.  I'm convinced that bigotry is a taught behavior.

In March, I started HRT.  It was a ridiculously simple process (YMMV, I live in a progressive area).  I just called up my local Planned Parenthood, explained the situation, and had an appointment scheduled a week after that 5 minute phone call.  I had pills in hand a day after the appointment.  Why did I wait so long?  So far, it's been a slow process, but I've got some small but noticeable breast growth.  My sense of smell has improved, and my body odor has decreased.  Every now and again, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and think, wow, my face has slimmed down and femmed up! But it's only been just under 3 months, so I figure it might just be my imagination.

March was also marked by probably the most transphobic reaction I've gotten so far.  My wife accidentally let it slip to her step-mother that I was transgender back in February.  Her step-mom is a dear, sweet lady who loves everyone, without regard to superficial details such as race, gender, sexuality, etc. She measures you based on who you are on the inside, which makes it quite surprising that she's married to my father-in-law, the worlds biggest asshole.  He's your typical man's man Fox News junky, who acknowledges only two points of view in this world:  his point of view, and wrong points of view.  He has been criticizing my wife for every decision she's made since she was legally old enough to make decisions on her own.  He's always felt that she married down, and he's not shy about voicing his backwards opinions on everything, no matter how insignificant.  We knew that it would be a shitshow when he learned my secret.  

Well, he happened to learn the same day I started HRT.  My step-mother-in-law, thinking that my wife had let her know in order to break the news to my father-in-law, did just that.  He promptly called up my wife, berated her yet again for marrying a loser (the worst thing you can be in his book, and ironic given that we've successfully been living on only my income for the past 4 years), and told her not to bring me around anymore. That's all fine and dandy, as I have never had any love for the man, but my son's birthday party was scheduled for literally the next week.  I'm not invited to his house, but he sees nothing wrong showing up to mine to spend time with his grandson and just pretending like I don't exist.  It was hella awkward.  It was also hilarious, because like, clearly the only person having a miserable time was him.  Somehow, he thinks he's hurting me by refusing to share with me his hot takes on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How ever shall I carry on?

So, that whole ordeal sort of forced my hand, resulting in me coming out to much larger group than I would have been otherwise ready for, but in light of his knowledge of my being transgender, I was worried that he might cause a scene in front of a bunch of people who didn't know.  So, to get ahead of the story, I pretty much just came out to my entire friend group. They were all supportive.

Last month, my wife and I had an earnest talk about the future of our relationship, and while we've been heading down this path for a long time, we spelled it out officially -- we're getting a divorce.  It was mutual, and it's what's best for our kids and for us.  We each need things the other can't provide, and staying together for the sake of the kids will only result in anger and resentment.  We discussed what that looks like, everything from timelines to living arrangements to custody, and we have a verbal agreement that neither of us will try to make it difficult on the other, to prevent deepening of wounds.  That conversation wound up being a huge weight off both our shoulders, and the uncertainty around it was actually the source of a lot of the hurt that we'd caused each other over the past year.  Now that it's out in the open, things are great between us, at least platonically.  We can joke and laugh and have fun over our children and the things that brought us together again.  We're living life as roommates who just happen to have two children together.

So that's been the first year of my transition.  It's been a lot of ups and downs, but I feel like I'm on the right path.  Thanks to everyone who read this whole thing.  I know it's a lot, and probably not terribly interesting or important to anyone other than me.  But as Treebeard once said, ""Why say anything at all, if you can't take a very long time to say it?"""	"Thank you for sharing your story, warts and all. It's not often you get a ground level view of a long bit of time like this.
I couldn’t stop reading. I also read your initial coming out post and OMG you described my life so accurately.  I am so happy for you finding yourself after so long. My own experience has been a little bumpy and just due to being born in the wrong decade I had to suffer a little longer before coming out. But I am at least grateful that the world has finally become welcoming enough for me to live in it and that eventually I was able to find online information and support that allowed me to begin my life.

Thank you for taking the time to write this. Seeing other peoples experiences and how similar and different they can be is sometimes so helpful.
I'm glad you enjoyed the read! I wrote this about 5 months ago, and my life has continued to improve. I'm definitely on the right track (baby I was born this way). It's always great to hear from people who felt that I've left a positive impact on them, even in such a small way. Thanks for commenting!"	uo85rk	trans	14	0.86	2022-05-12 18:51:26
I hatched (20MTF)	"CORRECTION! I was fired out of my egg so fast my velocity has to be measured in large fractions of **C**. Watch out people down range you have 240 lbs of explosive energy **INCOMING!!!!**

&#x200B;

Anyways i am most definitely trans, MTF if your wondering. Know how I know? Putting on a cheap Walmart set of tights left me in euphoric bliss for the entirety of my work shift. All **twelve hours** of it! BTW overtime is wonderful.

&#x200B;

I was mentally singing: I'm traaaaans!!!! I'm gonna be a giiiirl!!!! I'm gonna be so pretty!!!!!!! my entire shift. I went to sleep mentally exhausted but feeling happier than I think I've ever felt. All that from a bargain set of nylons.

&#x200B;

Realizing i""m trans also cleared up my sexuality doubts. I'm Pan!!!! I am proud to say hot is hot regardless of your gender. Health and empathy will always be sexy as fuck. Though honestly I might just be a sucker for muscles. I mean have you seen some of the athletes on Reddit? Wowsa!

&#x200B;

It is amazing how easy it is to separate jealousy from attraction from general horneyness when you know what feelings are in play. It also really helps when I can label my general self loathing as dysphoria and be done with it.

&#x200B;

I'm out to my mom and only her cause she's the only one I know that will be both understanding and keep her mouth shut on the subject. I'm still amazed that coming out to her was so easy, she just accepted it right away.

&#x200B;

The rest of my family will probably never accept me. My Dad is a toxic (if cowardly) narc, both of my grandma's are dysfunctional and implicitly emphasize ""normalcy."" And my extended family are the type of conservative that mindlessly repost memes that end something like ""SHARE TO SPREAD THE NAME OF THE LORD"" or ""COMMENT AN AMEN IF YOU AGREE,"" I am not religious or conservative in any sense of ether of those words.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking of coming out to them in after a coupe of years of no contact and transitioning by going to the yearly reunion while passing (and with a boyfriend, girlfriend, and/or joyfriend) and doing a dramatic reveal in the style of a Hamilton musical number, confusing the hell out of them. My aunt will be furious, but I don't care because my tits are going to be better than the ones she got bolted on after ruining her old ones with smoking and being fat.

&#x200B;

O by the way: I'M GONNA HAVE BOOBS, I'M GONNA HAVE BOOBS, JOY, JOY, I'M GONNA HAVE BOOBS!!!! don't care how big just BOOBS

&#x200B;

Alright goals time. I wanna be the fusion of the korrasami relationship if that makes sense. Ruthlessly intelligent, compassionate, fashionable, but will destroy you politically with but a few words combined with optimism, enthusiasm, and martial prowess that equates to a god walking on the mortal plane.

&#x200B;

Also with Korra's body because I'm rather broad at the shoulders and good god she is beautiful.

&#x200B;

Luckily for me I wont have a terrible time trying to pass. My face is not strongly masculine due to my mom (THANKS MOM!) so once I lose some weight and learn some makeup I should be fine. I cant wait till i'm financially sable enough to transition.

&#x200B;

Also that meme format that is floating around on r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns. The one showing the lady with pride flag stripes in her hair. I want those colors. My hair is a little curly and will keep the colors separate so I would rock that look! I might look into getting custom contacts made matching her eyes as well cause those are cool too.

&#x200B;

So to summarize: I am a pansexual, panromantic, polyamory curious, anti-theist, apsitivist, transgender girl, with an interest in everything from biology to biographies, that wants to become the first **DARK EMPRESS OF THE INTERGALACTIC NEGA REALM**, unite the world and to find a way to shoot the first and second laws of thermodynamics with a shotgun."	"Amazing, love your energy. You are totally wonderful
Holy shit, you're exhausting! And I mean that in the best possible way! Your enthusiasm for what's to come is refreshing and exactly what I needed today, but damn did it wear me out.

Kick some ass out there! I'm rooting for you.
Working on it!!! Thus far I am working on losing weight and improving my self care. Now that I know what I need I can work to fight the self loathing that comes with dysphoria.

&#x200B;

Im not gonna lie though lots of the energy you see is simply anxiety. I am jittery by nature and living like i have has left me with a lot of coping problems. In real life I am not exactly mellow but I don't quite move at hyper speed like the post implies.

&#x200B;

I have a lot of work ahead, one does not become a amazon Queen by slacking after all, but i look forward to slowly shaping the creative effort that is me."	i7hrzy	trans	17	0.9	2020-08-11 00:53:17

My post on r/menslib about how I’ve changed my relationship with masculinity and femininity	"I’m a trans woman, so I’ve been thinking about the masculine habits of inhabiting my body I have.

I’ve been learning to feel comfortable swaying my hips, and standing contrapposto, with my hips slanted one side above the other supporting my weight on one leg.

I’ve started crossing my legs with one knee over the other, and starting to feel embarrassed about unconsciously man spreading my legs.

I’ve started flipping my wrist, touching my hair and my lips when I’m feeling flirtatious and aroused.

When I juggle my soccer ball I feel more comfortable exploring the relationship I have with my ball as I chase it and keep it from the ground. I’m light on my feet and almost dancing, deciding in each split second how slowly or quickly I should attack the ball in a way I can not even predict. If I drop my ball I can freely express my emotions of joy and frustration by spinning or bounding with my body.

My lover even picked me up yesterday, and I held on to her by wrapping my legs around her waist as she spun me around. Right then I was overwhelmed with gender euphoria, and felt so authentic and feminine.

There is even an aspect to masculinity that many men feel uncomfortable being touched, physically comforted and nurtured, but they are comfortable being the ones touching their partners. Imagine a loved one just holding you while stroking your hair or cheek.

I feel a lot more confident speaking up about my feelings, and I don’t care about appearing strong and stoic anymore, I can be silly and that has changed the basic relationship I have when I inhabit my body. 

I have a much larger emotional range I am comfortable feeling inside myself and expressing. Sometimes it feels good to feel weak and helpless till tears start running down my cheeks.

I think most men are afraid of inhabiting their bodies in that way because they are afraid of being seen as gay. It takes a lot of work to actively overcome that fear, and I doubt many men would do that unless they felt they had to, because it is very scaring knowing people see you as something different.

If you want to see how scared you are try painting your fingernails and then go to the supermarket. Very few people would actually care about the slightly effeminate stranger, but I’m sure most of you would be very uncomfortable, I was. (I posted this first in r/menslib , I’m sure many of you are comfortable expressing your femininity ;) )"	"Thank you a lot. I really appreciate reading this.

How do I help him?(long post)	"My husband is trans(ftm) and his family is a nightmare. He came out when he was 19 and his family was horrified, like he had said he killed the neighbors dog. He has come out 3 times since then and is now 30. They still call him by his dead name and use she/her pronouns. 
We have been together 5 years and in those 5 years I have heard it all. ""Why can't you just be a lesbian?"" ""You are a girl, it's the way God made you."" ""I'm sorry but you will always be a girl to me."" ""It's a shame you turned into a lesbian, now you say something like this."" ""Maybe you should pray on it, God can help you not feel like this."" I'm honestly sick of it and I know he is as well. His mom's husband even went as far to say... In front of me, ""it's not to late to find yourself the right man and settle down. Don't you want to be happy and  normal?"" 
Now flash forward to when we got married last year in Florida. it was just our mom's with us and my mom is very very supportive of my husband. She will correct people and go out of her way to compliment him. With it just being the 4 of us I think my husbands mother saw this and being the sheep she is, started calling him his male name and using he/him pronouns. She even said she was the mother of the groom. He was over joyed and thought finally. He had the chance and took many of them to tell her how he felt. She seemed to listen and realize that he had felt this way even at a very young age. When he told her everything, she cried. She called his grandma and said how bad she felt that she never saw it. They talked about it and we thought omg finally!!! 
But as soon as we went back home.... It was right back to his dead name and she/her. 
His mother said it was because ""nobody knew him that way, and it's just going to be easier to not have to explain"". It's honestly sad because in a way his family has pushed him back into the closet. It's was like that week in Florida never even happened. 
He is forced to use his dead name and pronouns around his family and others. I just don't understand and I'm trying really hard not to get mad at this. I try to be very supportive and I would do anything to make him happy. But at some point you just kinda gotta ask why. Sometimes I feel like they do it just to spite him. I well say he and in the same breath they say she/her......
What do I do? What do I say? Can I do anything? Or is it up to him? Help me!"	Really just being supportive helps but I think he is going to have to realize he needs to cut contact with his family. It sounds like they are a bunch of bigots who will never give him the respect he deserves. There’s really no point in wasting any more time on them. Although I do understand its really hard to go through with it but isn’t him sparing himself all that pain worth it? He deserves to be respected as the man he is.	vnamz8	trans	15	0.94	2022-06-29 08:17:22
Transgender Literature- Her Story	" 

**Her Story**

I first started asking my mother to call me Samantha at the age of 8. It was brushed off as confusion, “Your name is Sam. You are a boy and only girls are called Samantha”. She didn’t understand how each correction she made stung like a slap on a fresh wound that would never heal. She didn’t know that every time she wrote me off as “going through a phase,” a part of my identity would stir in confusion. Most importantly, she didn’t know that I was her daughter, just waiting to be acknowledged for who I truly am.

My first love was a kid named Jeremy. He sat two rows ahead of me and one seat to the right. The angle was perfect for me to see him smile when his friends said something funny, leading me to never get any work done. 

I first confessed my love to him one day at recess. It was by the picnic bench and 3 minutes before our next class was supposed to start. It was a precise timing; I wanted to tell him and then be able to run and hide from a safe distance. The safe distance being the space between his desk and mine. The fact that my plan had an escape route should have been the first sign to abort the mission. I completely ignored any conflicting thoughts running through my head as I continued towards him. My mind quickly ran over the worst-case scenario, and the only thing I could come up with was him saying no and me moving on with his funnier best friend, Mason.

My heart was pounding so fast that I could barely hear the crunch of the gravel with every step I took. No thoughts ran through my head at this point, only a picture of him and me on our wedding day, him in a dark suit and me in a white dress. Yes, I am aware I was just thinking about moving on with his best friend, but what can I say? I am a hopeless romantic. As the daydream came to an end, we were finally face to face. He was looking at me as if I had been standing in front of him for hours without saying a word.

“Will you be my boyfriend?” It came out much louder and more demanding than I was expecting. His face scrunched up immediately; I could only see only the blacks of his eyes. 

“It’s Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, gay boy!” His words sent daggers through my heart, and I immediately looked around to make sure no one heard. With every word that came out of his mouth, it was like a drop of acid pooling and distorting the picture of us I had in my head. *Gay? I am not gay.* 

The sound of the final warning bell caused everyone to run toward the school doors, even him. I slowly followed the other students, not taking my eyes off Jeremy for a moment. On the way back into the classroom, there was a constant whisper going back and forth between him and his friends. 

*I am not gay*, was the only thought rushing through my head as I closed my eyes and hid my face down on my desk. This was the first time I’d purposely looked anywhere other than towards the direction of my beloved. I did not have to question his whereabouts due to the snickering coming from his side of the room.

It seemed that the laughing would never come to an end, and the only thing I knew for sure was I needed to be out of this room. Without raising my hand or asking for permission, I bolted out of the classroom. I did not hear the teacher call for me, so she must have not noticed. 

As I walked down the hall, I went towards the bathroom. It was the only place where I wouldn’t be questioned about why I wasn’t in class. Once I reached my destination, I realized there was another hurdle coming my way. I stood between two doors, one labeled male and the other labeled female and all I could do was pause. 

I whispered, “screw it,” as I grabbed the door to the right of me, marked with a girl icon, and went inside. At this moment, I broke down my walls and let me be me, let me be Samantha. The girl who had just gotten her heart broken, not “gay boy Sam.”  The moment I walked in and saw the cream-colored stalls wide open and no one inside I felt as if I could relax. I quickly locked myself in the first stall I walked past and sat down on the closed toilet seat. 

“You are allowed to feel. You are allowed to have a moment,” I whispered to myself as tears ran down my cheeks. I chanted these words over and over again until I finally let my mind drift away. If only I looked the way I feel, would things have gone differently? 

I reran through everything that had happened, only this time as Samantha. I would have walked up to him with my long hair blowing in the wind. My uniform would have been a khaki skirt instead of slacks. When I approached him he would be imagining me in my wedding dress as I imagined him in his suit. He would have greeted me by saying, “Hello Ms. Samantha, you are looking beautiful as always.”  I would have blushed and curtsied in response. Before I would be able to say a word he would have stopped me and grabbed my hand, “Would you be my girlfriend?” he would ask.

“Of course,” I would exclaim with joy. He would march me right up to his friends with pride and tell them how lucky he was to have a girl like me. 

***A girl like me.*** These words replayed on a neverending loop as my tears dried up and I was once again in the real world. I knew it would only be moments before a teacher would come looking for me, so I quickly composed myself as I opened the stall door. I took one loop around the bathroom and took everything in before I landed on the mirror standing parallel to me. It felt, once again, as if the world was crushing me as I looked into the mirror at *him*. Sam, the boy that never matched the way I felt. Every step I took I felt farther away from her, me, Samantha, or whatever the hell anyone wanted to call it. Every step closer I lost myself.

Darkness was all I saw and felt as I blacked out. It was as if a black fog was consuming me, and I had to fight it off before it took me for good. Before I knew it the floor was covered in glass, and the mirror and Sam were once again gone. My knuckles were bleeding from the hit they just took, destroying the vision of what others see. Something in me felt free, but at the same time, I was still locked away. A loud gasp brought me back to reality. Standing behind me was my teacher, and I knew I was going to be in trouble. Bracing for the yelling, I held my breath, but nothing came.

“Sam, are you okay?” She spoke in barely a whisper. I was expecting her first question to be, “why are you in the girl’s bathroom” but I guess the shattered glass and blood dripping over my hands took top priority. 

I couldn’t respond as I focused on my breathing. How do I even begin to explain what actions have brought me here? She quickly whispered into the walkie on her hip for someone to get a first aid kit and leave it at the front of the bathroom door. After she received a response that it was on the way, she slowly started to make her way towards me. It felt as if we had been standing together for hours when in reality it had only been about 60 seconds. 

As I let the tears roll down my cheeks she finally spoke again, “Would you like it if I called you Samantha?” this was the first time I made eye contact with her since she entered the bathroom. 

All the teachers were aware of what my mom called a *mental condition*. She was sure to bring it up and let everyone know it is not acceptable. If I were to request to be called Samantha it needed to be shut down immediately. If this rule wasn’t followed they would be hearing from her, and it wouldn’t be pretty. She was afraid of anyone encouraging it.

A bunch of sounds ran out of my mouth before any actual words would formulate. “Please,” was all that I could muster. I wanted to scream *thank you* and wrap her in a hug in the hope that she would never let go. 

I quickly analyzed myself for any glass as I moved over to a clean sink. I washed away the blood and patted it dry. I heard the door open, and I knew she was grabbing the first aid kit left outside. I didn’t know if I would be able to look at her out of embarrassment, so I made sure all my concentration was on my hands. I counted every cut, found every bruise, and picked at every hangnail. Soon I felt her cool hands on mine fixing all of the damage I had caused. 

“You have the right to be who you want to be, Samantha,” I didn’t respond, causing her to continue, “There is support right here in this school, and I know the local high schools have it too. They have LGBTQ+ meetings, counselors, and other mental health tools. They can also help you find any of the support you may need outside of school. I know it is a big step, but just know I am here to support you in any way that you need.” I could feel the urgency in every word, and I knew that she meant it. 

The tears that trickled down turned into pools, but this time it was from relief. I had never realized my small frame was about to break from the pressure of living in this world in a body that did not feel like mine. As she finished caring for my wounds, she told me stories of what it was like being part of the LGBTQ+ community. For the first time I felt understood and welcomed. I am normal, these feelings are normal, and I am valid. There were no longer mean and angry words running through my head; only her kind words played like my favorite song. I go back to this moment and relish in the feeling of care and acceptance when things get hard. I will forever hold her close to my heart as I live out my newly transitioned life as a Transgender **woman**."	Ngl, made me tear up a little. Sweet	n3zjpk	trans	14	0.95	2021-05-03 15:52:26
Finally getting my life together! <3	"I’m so happy and proud right now. 
I managed to move out into a shared flat with other students a few months ago and came out as Trans Mtf. They accepted that and started to call me by my chosen name and pronouns. 
I also started a therapy cause the german law forces me to do so. I found quiet a good therapist who is trans too. All that in only 4 months. Friday I have a appointment at a hospital with a doctor. 
After this I could start with HRT. 

I’m soo happy that I get my life together now and that I can start living as my true self. 

Everyone I told it till now is fine with it. Even my boss at work said that he is going to support me. 

All that gave me so joy and proud and took my fear about the future away. 

I hope y’all doin great! You are valid and loved!"	"That’s awesome! I’m so happy for you!

I am trans lol	Hi! So i recently discovered I’m trans (mtf) and no one could possibly understand how much joy and happiness I got out of coming out to my freinds! They were all accepting of course, but still. I don’t have that much dysphoria about my physical appearance as much as I have social dysphoria. I would like to wear feminine clothes and have boobs but my top priorities are people respecting my pronouns and stuff. So just my freinds seeing me as a girl, me seeing me as a gal, all of that makes so incredibly happy! I just wanted to share that with yall bc you all are an amazing community and would understand better than anyone else lol. I haven’t started hormones yet and won’t for a few years because of parents but I can’t wait to actually start them!		m8elz7	trans	14	0.94	2021-03-19 10:50:37

just looking for support	"my mom said she doesn’t see the sparkle in my eye anymore: i’m not (well..) out to her yet (I’m ftm gnc, they know the name and pronouns I prefer, they just don’t like it) but she brought up an old video I posted on tiktok, back when I was dating my ex long term partner. This relationship that grew and accepted me, left me feeling like a husk of a person. it’s been 8 months… and I still haven’t bounced back. 
Ive been around some people, I adopted a cat and it’s going great, i’m at the time of my life i thought I would be enthralled and happy moved out on my own! but I don’t feel joy anymore. I’m making appointments for gender-affirming therapies and surgeries, and I just feel like i’ve lost a lot of my support system on the precipice of a lot of heavy shit. I just semi came out to my mom (this morning) and it was something that made me feel my ex’s loss even though it has nothing to do with him. It’s been really hard and reading everyone else’s stories makes me feel a little bit less alone: thanks yall."

I think I know how you feel. Our situations are different, obviously. But I can relate to how you're feeling. So far there's only been one thing that really helps me: Socialising. I've been building up my social circle and it has helped me immensely. Finding other queer people who are understanding and supportive can help you understand and support yourself. I've been learning how to have fun again. How to forget my issues for a minute and just enjoy myself. I highly recommend it.

My family doesn't serve as a support structure for me, so I'm finding new family. Chosen family. People who love and accept me.

I hope this helps somehow. I also hope you start feeling better soon. Just know that there's nothing but support for you in the trans community (at the very least you have my support) Good luck! <3"	st5nlu	trans	14	1.0	2022-02-15 15:36:23

I. A transman. Experience insane gender euphoria when I interact with anything pastel pink	"Its really confusing but anything pastel/baby pink makes me so incredibly happy and brings a smile to my face. It makes me feel like such a beautiful man.

My usual preference for things is purple or black. Im actually a mixture of goth/grunge in my daily wear. But lately I cannot bring myself to go without something pink on me!

Looking at baby pink. Wearing it. Having pink things. Painting my nails. Anything. Its taken a lot for me to be able to let myself wear and like these colors. But since I've accepted it I've never been happier.


Thats really it. Thank you for reading and I hope this gives some others some joy as well. 

(P.s. sorry if the flair is wrong, I rarely post anywhere)"	"Pink isn’t a girl’s color bro, it’s a nice color
18th century men loved them some pink.  If you love the color, own it!
Pastels are awesome so I can't blame you! 🌸💙

I keep thinking about saying “I love pink and I’m a guy” and then remember that I just look like one but I’m not actually a guy lmao

Trans joy	"I've been thinking a bit about trans joy recently and the ways that I've honestly struggled with it. I think my biggest obstacle is that I just don't connect to most of the stories other people tell about themselves. When I do connect it's electric but every other time I just feel a little more alone.

So I'm going to switch up my approach. I did some journaling a month ago about possibly my first time ever feeling at peace and it is one of my prime examples of trans joy. I want to share it here and see if anyone connects to it.

""I just paused folding my laundry, both to write this and to enjoy the view. I've pretty much cut 'boy mode' from my day to day and have started presenting more femme or androgynous, and I'm reminded of that by looking at the folded clothes arrayed on my bed. It reminds me of the week I've had. Having a full day out with my best friend while wearing a dress that I'd bought with my mum earlier than day. Wearing a skirt and croptop to the support group. There's a bra here and all the usual tank tops and I feel so at peace just looking at it all. I've even organised my outfit for today. Nothing special for grocery shopping (though I am going to renew my estradiol while I'm out which is exciting). However the fitness wear I've planned for pole this evening has me excited, compression panties and the usual shorts as well as a new top that I've been too afraid to wear out until now.

But I've called this note domestic euphoric cause I'm not just thinking about my laundry right now. I'm thinking about all the other things I'm doing these days to take care of myself that are giving me Euphoria. I'm cooking now while listening to my girly music. Every morning I'm carrying out my skin care routine. I could be keeping my room a little more tidy, but where there is clutter there is also signs that I'm loving myself for who I am. 

And that's what has caught my interest, the reminders around me that I do love myself. The Euphoria in caring for yourself in the ways that you need, because you love being you. Mundane things like this have never made me feel so safe and happy before. I'm finally sitting in a nonbinary girls room, and belonging there."""	"I love this soo much ❤️ like the imagine it conjured is what and where I want to be :) and it sounds like a very happy place.
This was wonderful tonread, and realizing I've been doing a lotnof domestic things differently.
I hope you get there ❤️
Do you mind me asking what some of those things are?
Thank you me too ☺️
Cooking, organizing the pantry, and I LOVE folding laundry now.  Which is another datapoint for me.  I loved folding laundry as a kid, and making my bed.  When puberty hit I practically lost the ability to do those things, let alone enjoy them."	zhvry1	trans	12	0.85	2022-12-10 15:51:23
Fishnet Appreciation Post	It’s 3:00 a.m. and I am wearing fishnets in my bed under the covers. I don’t know what it is but they give me euphoria I think.

How do I help a young trans boarder?	"I'll call him 'T'.  He's a trans boy, just turned 18, a son of very dear family friends.  We've known T's family since before he was born, and helped raise him...but his father is ex-military and very strict, and there's only so much we could do to cushion that.  His parents allowed him to start transitioning but it's obvious they weren't happy about it.  I think he's taking anti-depressants but no hormones that I know of.

T has just moved in with my wife and I.  He and his parents mutually agreed that he should get out of their house as soon as he graduated from high school.  He's in our guest room now, and he'll be looking for a job, and we've promised his father that we'll make him pay rent as soon as he's able.

My worry is that T is just...I dunno, beaten down.  He rarely makes eye contact.  He apologizes for everything.  He's submissive to the point of cringey.  The poor kid has zero self-esteem.  He has no aspirations or wants that I can tell, aside from someday getting top surgery.  (He doesn't want bottom surgery, claiming it never turns out well.)  I worry that he's suicidal, but he speaks so rarely, who could tell?

I do not care one bit what gender T chooses.  I loved him when he was an outspoken little girl, and I love him now that he's a trembling, terrified boy.  I don't like that he's grown up this way, but I had little opportunity to help before.  Now that he's in our house, I have a little more influence.

How can I help this young trans boy regain their self-esteem and find some joy in his life?"	"Wow, that’s one hell of a responsibility you are taking on. I am MTF, my partner is FTM and my 17 year old son is FTM. I understand what it’s like to be brow beaten. It put me into a deep depression, I got lost in food and ended up 400lbs. 

He probably has been caged so long, he may not know how to trust just yet. The best thing you can do is respect him. Let him know you respect his feelings as valid. Encourage him to join a transgender youth group (if there is one your area), but never force it. There is probably a whole shot load of emotional baggage he needs to unpack. Be patient with him and re earn his trust. 

I should add, sounds like he is leaving a very abusive household. If he asks you not to tell anything to his parents, do not break that trust. I am 42, and I can’t be in the same county as my mother without having a panic attack.
It may help to validate his identity, and emotions, to let him know that he has people who support and love him. Maybe T will feel better if you accompany him in the transition process, and help build his confidence and his hope that things will get better and that he can do more than just survive. Also encouraging him to go to terapy could help him a lot, it will help him to better understand his emotions and how to deal with negative thoughts, it is always good to have a professional guide. I hope this helps you and I hope T feels better soon.
Yo, make a list for therapists that treat depression in your area and get him to them. 

A therapist provides much that a close friend or relative can't. A 3rd party that is not involved with the patient's life, a professional voice that has already heard many horrors of life. Tons of medical knowledge.

It is expensive but once he finds the right one, he can finally be vulnerable enough to open up for the better.
Your best bet is getting him into therapy without forcing him. It only works if he wants to go himself. Apart from that, try helping him out with transitioning as much as you can. Given your username I take it you're male yourself, so you can help him learn how to shave when he starts growing a beard, teach him about bathroom etiquette (always leaving a stall in between two occupied ones free and the likes), go with him to buy some male clothes if he doesn't have any yet and all those other things. Just remember that in the end of the day he needs to be alright with all of this.

Also, about the self-esteem thing, I know what it's like to have zero self-esteem myself. I used to think I was worthless and that even the things I was good at were useless. Luckily I'm better now. What helped for me was reading through a notebook I wrote full of poems a couple of years before because I was shocked at how good some of them were. It helped because I love writing so being impressed at the quality of the things I, iyashikay, wrote gave me a good start towards healing. Is there something he likes that he is good at? Maybe you could try that out.

Also, before I end this, I just wanted to say you are an amazing person for wanting to help him like this and letting him live with you. Not many people would go the lengths you've already gone. I wish you all the things you could ever wish for.
I feel like maybe he doesn't feel like he has autonomy, or maybe isn't even sure what autonomy even is.  Others suggested therapy, and I do too.  I also think you will need to make sure he feels like he has freedom. You may have to make it explicitly clear to him that he has freedom.

Also have be sure to do things (and not do other things) to enforce the idea that he now has autonomy. Not an easy task since it's possible to do or say things that may seem benign to you but might trigger feelings of being restricted. Especially difficult if he happens to be neurodivergent .
Adding in to the therapist comments from others: make sure the therapist is at the very least trauma informed if not a trauma specialist. CPTSD seems likely growing up in that type of  environment and you've listed symptoms that are associated with abuse, though not exclusively so.
Be vulnerable first. This my advice for anytime u need someone to be feel safe. Being vulnerable with them usually makes people feel a lot safer being vulnerable with u.
It sounds like his family wasn’t the best at that and may have been the opposite of the safe space someone like that needed.
I'll keep his trust, but I can't speak for my wife.  She's a mom, through-and-through, and she tends to team up with other moms to help mother each others' children.  These ladies raise their children as part of a village.  (I married into the mix after my wife's children were grown.)

I'll have to talk to my wife about that.
I doubt that his parents hit him; they're good people, just very strict.  But they had odd types of discipline, such as telling him to drop and give them 20 pushups in public when he mouthed off once.  I'm sure that leaves its own kind of emotional scars.
You don't have to hit a child to make them live in fear of you. Living somewhere you don't feel safe or feel like you can turn to anyone, especially as a child, has life damaging consequences. Humiliating your kid in public can be damaging, especially if it done repeatedly. I would highly advise posting over on r/CPTSD for advice as well. This is likely going to be a very long and difficult road for him, even without the additional stress being trans brings."	vpjjed	trans	14	0.95	2022-07-02 04:32:29

Moms reaction stings a bit.	"The other night I came out to my parents. They were both stunned. We had a talk and I had to make it clear to them that I was expressing a want for support, not a debate.

There were some small ignorant questions but it seemed to go well for the most part. My dad did all the talking and my mom stayed quiet for the most part. They both told me they loved me.

I was happy. But then the next day she was just depressed. She sat down and asked me some more questions. In her fear and confusion she's been sort of trying to talk me out of it.

I can't help her understand that I am 23 and have spent almost 15 years of my life HATING myself. That for the first time in my life, I've known self love and self worth. 

She's worried about how hard this path is going to be. I can't get through to her that if I stayed lying to myself, or dropped all of this right now and repressed it, that path wouldn't last very long. She's worried my best friend of 18 years will leave. I've told him already and he asked for patience but supports me 100%.

I asked her why she is sad. What part is she sad about? She told me, she's scared. Fear. Fear has controlled my whole life. Never being/acting/looking good enough for anything. I've run from fear my whole life. Now I have joy to pursue. 

Her reaction isn't out of malice. She doesn't say these things because she hates trans people. She's terrified and confused for her child. 

I believe she'll eventually come around. But it hurts so fucking much that my joy causes her such distress. Not to mention I expected any bad reaction to come from my dad and not her. She's been my foundation my whole life, and I just feel like I made a massive rift by wanting to be happy."	"I'm sorry she reacted that way, no one deserves that kind of a reaction to coming out. It is understandable to be fearful, but her fear shouldn't stop her from being happy for you. It's a good thing that you can be who you want to be, even if it's a difficult journey. I really hope it gets better for you and that she comes around quickly. Hang in there!
Just tell her that no one chooses to be transgender. We wish we were born in the right body we weren't.

Just like nobody chooses their skin color, their hair color eye color who they're going to fall in love with, or who's going to fall in love with you.

You just are this way, and to escape depression you have to pursue this. Support would be much more welcomed than trying to talk me out of it. 

At least that's how I would say it to her.

No one can tell you what you gender is except yourself. From what you're saying, it does sound like you're a trans guy.

Sounds like ur mom is just a transphobe luv the only one determines who or what you are is you, and if you want to be a guy u can be a guy and if h want to transition a lot, or a little is entirely up to you because its your body and u get to choose how u take care of it, and denying ur self a right to what makes you happy isn’t healthy, so don’t take what she says to heart, be strong, be brave, and be able to hold your own because its a long tough road ahead but I believe in you

The quiet joy of not being explicitly gendered	"There’s a restaurant I go to on occasion that is a pretty gendered space—the demographic is a kind of rural southwestern, which is not MY thing, but I enjoy the food.

I’m trans (questioning / MtF?), but not really out. My presentation is male, but with some feminine touches: maybe a women’s cut T-shirt some days, long hair in a high pony or occasionally in stupid pigtails that I just can’t seem to resist, or maybe a cute hair clip. I go into this space very much aware of, and in a way both proud and afraid of, the degree to which I don’t come across as “a proper man”. I might be called “sir” by any of the customers there, but not without a bit of subtle judgement, if you know what I mean?

So anyway, when I visit, it is always to my great relief and delight when I run into a certain cashier who has consistently gendered me as “dear” or “that one” rather than “sir” and “him”. I don’t know if she’s picked up on something or if she just uses “dear” for anyone it reasonably could fit, but either way it just makes my day every time, and washes away a lot of the social anxiety that I might normally feel in that space. Ironically, this is one of only a few places I can go to consistently NOT be called “sir”.

So I guess this post is there mostly just to share the joy of that small interaction, but also as a shout out to anyone out there in the service industry who uses gender-neutral terms when interacting with customers. For some of us out there who may not obviously need it, that little bit of validation can nevertheless make all the difference!"	"Nice! I’m still holding onto when I was called “amiga” by the lady at the BK drive through a month ago, that and the time my hair clip was called “cute”. It’s the littlest things but so nice.
I had a similar experience at a bookstore once! I had been on testosterone for a few months at the time and was still generally being read as female but wearing male clothing, and when the cashier called over their manager to fix something on my account they used 'they' for me without even batting an eye. It was really cool to see someone acknowledge that my gender wasn't totally apparent and just decide to be diplomatic about it and move on. Small acts of kindness make such a huge difference."	caqr93	trans	15	0.94	2019-07-08 20:51:40
Hey everyone, I'm Amelie, and yesterday... I finally came out!	"Hiya, I'm Amelie (amab) and as the title says: I finally came out yesterday !

Roll back: I'm in my late 20s, but for over a decade, I've known that I wasn't a straight cis man, contrary to what everyone seemed to see in me.

I've started discovering myself and figuring out I might be a gay or at least bisexual man. Then I actually met some gay men and one thing was clear: I'm not like them. This wasn't me.

Then I would actually think crossdressing would be fun, huh? But what if everyone thought I was a pervert... Better keep this to myself then.

I then met my gf (afab) and I finally rediscovered a feeling I had forgotten for a while: joy. Everything, every minute, every word was joy, ectasy, bliss. But my dark thoughts crept back in, and my unease with it.

For the past five years, I've been thinking: I might... be trans...?! Nah, surely **I**'m not, it's just a phase, just a thought, right? Then COVID hit, and you could establish a direct correlation between the months since COVID has been a thing and the increasing size of my (male-looking, ew) belly. This time has not been kind on my body (which I had already been hating for the last 15 or so years). The less I liked my male-presenting reflection in the mirror, the more I was coming close to realising: I AM trans.

From ""*nah*s"", to ""*maybe*s""; from ""*I guess*es"", to ""*it must be*s"", I was circling around, coming ever closer to the magical ""**I AM**"".

That's all on the inside. On the outside: well I just looked like a depressed young man who seemed to have everything going fine. I wasn't starving, right? I wasn't homeless? I wasn't discriminated, right, I, a ""straight white male"" (you know, the role I was starring as IRL)? I'd look fine on the outside for days and days, and then suddenly looked like my whole life was crashing down for no *apparent* reason.

I've been secretly lurking r/trans and r/MtF for the last 3-4 weeks (and was virtually absent from my Christmas dinner because of it: oops!), and reading all of your stories has been a blessing for my mental health. Thanks to all of you.

So, fast forward to yesterday. I was going to finally tell the person that mattered most (my gf). I tried to be brave, and just blurt it out. It was on the tip of my tongue... Well, my tongue didn't show up, and my eyes were first on the replacement shortlist: I cried like a massive baby. Cried years worth of tears. I don't know for how long. 10 minutes? 20? She justed hugged me and tried her best to soothe me.

Fission mailed ! After all the water had come out my eyes, and the only liquid in me was wine, she suggested I wrote it down in a diary. Which I did... Twice... And twice I tore it into pieces. And the third time was the charm. I took a little envelope, on which I wrote in English (it's not my mother tongue, so I thought it'd be easier to actually say the words): ""I think I may be..."" and on the inside ""transgender"".

That letter stayed in my pocket for hours, and hours. Until finally I had the courage to just put in under her nose during dinner, and sat behind her, so she couldn't see my face (ready to turn the newly ingested wine into more tears).

I held a pillow tight \[the couch was near the dinner table\], and just tried to gauge her reaction from the back of her head, wondering how bad she'd take it.

She opened it, read the word, and said: ""That's it?"" and hugged me. As though that was not a problem... Because it actually wasn't. It was normal. It is normal. I am normal. I am me, and I'm pretty sure, now, that I'm a girl. And that's O-K-A-Y.

Aaaaaand, I cried some more, but for the first time in **years**, I smiled through the tears. It felt foreign, like a dream that had faded, but I could taste the salt, so it must be real, right?

She even immediately tried to make me more comfortable by asking where I wanted her to gender me correctly, or if I was set on a name.I told her not to worry about gendering me as male for the moment; most of my dysphoria comes from my body, face, clothing and general attitude. I have no problem with my genitals or being called a ""he"" (for now at least), and I didn't want her getting used to calling me a girl and accidentally outing me in front of my family and friends, before I actually come out to them. I want to remain in control of that.As for the name, I told her I had settled (I didn't need much thinking, it seemed just right)... But I'd rather wait until I actually present more feminine, and feel good about it, before telling her.

So you get to be the first to call me ""she"", ""her"" and ""Amelie"", lucky you ! Hehehe

And there we are ! I've spent the last 24 hours or so catching up with all the smiling I hadn't done these last couple of years. I went out, feeling relieved of a heavy weight on my shoulder, finally acting and walking like I wanted, after years of walking like I had a stick up the arse just to keep up the act.

I feel like everything is going to be fine, now. I wanted to tell her before 2022, so I could dedicate this whole year getting rid of the ""male"" me, step by step. I'm seriously considering HRT down the line (if I feel good about all of this by the end of 2022), but probably not before early 2023 (but I want to do it before I'm 30!).

Sorry if this has been too long (DISCLAIMER: I do not know how to use this reddit dot com, I've only been lurking for a few weeks, and I created my account to tell you all my story, specifically).

My name is Amelie, and I think I'm finally okay !

PS: Thanks for all of you who have read until the end. Sorry for all the potential typos and/or mistakes. My written English is getting poorer by the day.

Anyway, don't hesistate to AMA or just say hiya. I hope we'll get to chat for years to come."	You got this! ;)	rs87fr	trans	14	1.0	2021-12-30 18:15:01

The strength of apathy, and the hardest part about me coming out. (More writing)	"This is another post that's as much for me as it is for anyone it might help, but you all haven't been upset about that so far, so...

It's been two months, about, since I realized I was a trans woman.  And I still misgender myself.

And I wanted to know why.  So I did the only thing I could think to do, which was think about it a lot.

What I've realized is, well, kinda weird.

When I thought I was a guy, I was miserable.  I mean, I didn't realize *how* miserable, because really, I'd just become extremely numb.  I mean, I'd have highs and lows, but looking back, everything was very muted.  I was nothing but shades of gray and brown, washed out, with differences only really standing out in comparison to the rest of me.

As I've said in previous posts, once I realized I was not cis, and especially when I understood I was a woman, I could *feel*.  This fog, this weight of what I thought was simple self loathing, it lifted off of me.  I could experience ambition and motivation again.  I could enjoy the moment.  I smiled.

I also cried.  And I can't handle as much stress.  I can't tune out the emotional turbulence like I used to.

And I noticed, when I would misgender myself, it was often in times of stress.  My thoughts of ""what if this is all just a phase"" would come at my worst times.

Understand, if I embrace my femininity during these times, that also makes me feel better.  But instead, I find myself leaning into the old ""you're just a guy"" idea.

I realized that the apathy, that numbness, that constant pain, gave me a perverse, self deprecating strength.  See, I was already hurting so much, more pain wasn't a big deal.  I was already so stressed, more was a marble on the pile.  I had cultivated an almost nihilistic apathy as a coping mechanism, and then used that as a coping mechanism against other stresses.

It was a crutch.  A broken, damaging crutch. And part of me misses it.

I don't miss thinking I was a guy, mind you.  But I miss that ability to just ""handle"" anything.  To put myself in a box, and sort it out later, so I could handle the now.

But that isn't good. It isn't healthy.  I wasn't caring for myself, I was emotionally lobotomizing myself to progress through life.  Yeah, I got pretty good at it, but it was still damaging me.

So, now I'm making a conscious effort to lean into my gender more.  To embrace myself as a woman, and internalize the joy it brings me.  And yes, the stress is harder.  And hardships hurt a little more, and I can weather a lot less.  But I can be happy.  I can like myself.  

I'd forgotten what it's like to like yourself.

So, I guess my point is, if you find yourself doubting your ""transness"", stop and ask why.  Really think about it.  Because you might just be missing what you were used to, even if it was hurting you.

Thanks for reading, and I still love you all. <3"	"Are you me? Serious. Go read my comment history... Unless you already did. ;P

Yeah, I was invincible in a way too. You couldn't hurt who wasn't really there, and when you don't value yourself at all you can take on any risk.

A thing that was very enlightening was going through a diagnostic questionnaire with my therapist on how much I disassociated. We did it in relation to some trauma work and I was newly on the other side of accepting myself as trans.

My numbers were rather high, and if I thought not very far back, to just before acceptance, the numbers came out much, much, higher. Like I was disassociated nearly all the time pre acceptance.

It's been a trip. I quite literally thought I was tripping when the fog lifted, given how tweaked and disorienting my non dulled sensory input was.
I think this is something I prided myself on as I grew up. I dealt with a lot and my main coping mechanism was to not let anyone in and pretend everything was fine. Granted, there was stuff I actually didn't bottle up, but I prided myself on holding onto the pain and angst and staying in control. In a lot of ways, I was scared to express myself and I didn't want to impose my feelings on other people. I can't say this relates solely to questioning my gender or being trans, but I felt I lived in an emotional box as a teenager and a younger 20-something. Apathy and ease were my pathways to dealing with stuff. As a result, I don't think I felt a lot and at best I was content with my life.

At this point, and because I've went through a bit of life change with starting graduate school, I realize my emotions have a life of their own. All the unchecked problems I've had over the years have came back and present whenever I get stressed with school. Whether it's my lack of social life or romantic relationships, or limited range of gender expression, I've realized that I can't ignore these problems by just saying 'I'm okay.' Especially with the latter.  In the past, I would have explored my gender for a week and I would have resorted back to 'I'm okay' because of discomfort.  It's just easier to not have to deal with the pain of exploring myself and what others think. But I just can't do that anymore. 
I'm so glad seeing people like you posting their thoughts, it's like you have put into words what i've been feeling for yeaaarrrsss, and it feels so right and validating of my own experience. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!<3
Thanks for the empathy.  This is one of those things that can be difficult to describe to people, so someone understanding helps a lot.
I feel your feels on not being able to do it anymore.  After a while, the apathy and the numbness start being more frightening than the change.
That's a huge, huge compliment.  Thank you, and I'm so glad it helps you.
I'm happy to provide the perspective. I think it is more common than you think. There are several accounts I've read that seemed eerily similar to my experience. It is comforting to know you are not unique in your experience.
Definitely. I think I've just had this jolt of energy with everything going on in my life. I just want to be able to express myself fully. I know external circumstances have dictated and created my apathy, but I'm realizing that's not who I am. I'm always chasing to be who I was before I was a teenager. Not necessarily my behavior, but my spirit. I won't even say I was completely apathetic as a teenager and an early 20 something because I had some good years and bad years. But I just want to get back to the point where I was a relatively free spirit. Being able to express myself and feel something is a part of that.
I'm glad you're in a place where you can pursue that.  Being happy, it's a wonderful thing to reach for.  :-)"	7mbupu	trans	13	1.0	2017-12-27 01:25:56

Essay: Curse or super power	"I feel I should preface this and say that the reason I'm writing this is to share the beautiful parts of my journey as a trans woman, and to hopefully show that things do get better for us. Quite recently it has dawned on me that I've been openly trans for a decade at this point, give or take a few months. This realization has spurred me on to reflect on my journey, and how it's changed and taught me many things. There was a lot of hardship for me at first. When I was a teen it seriously considered it to be a curse, another hardship to bear. As I'm sure we all do I faced a lot of discrimination, and attacks. Those incidents compounded with my lack of experience with the Healthcare system made every day a struggle to just be okay with who I am. As I aged things became a lot easier, I learned to pass (which I feel blessed for) I was still pretty constantly terrified or paranoid about discrimination. Hrt was a huge battle for me, I repeatedly stopped and started due to money, insurance, or living in a rural area. Until I reached the age of about 23 I very much considered being trans as just another heavy burden to carry along with the rest of my crap. After continuous conversations with myself, my husband, and my allies, I realized how magnificent, and beautiful it is to be trans. Each day is a joy to me at this point, hrt has been hugely helpful, but the ultimate source of joy for me has really been my own relationship with my trans nature. When I was younger I shunned all elements of masculinity in myself that I could, and it wasn't til recently that I realized that those elements of myself are beautiful too and meant to be embraced and cherished. This unity of masculinity and femininity I believe is a real gift. It makes relating to people much easier, and more fulfilling.  The hardship of finding this beautiful dichotomy has given me the skills and emotional fortitude to face any issue with open arms and for this, I am profoundly grateful. So many of my relationships have grown so much thanks to being trans as well. It has also really (seemingly ironically) made me truly appreciate the goodness in people, many members of my family have completely shocked me with their support, love, and kindness, despite rampant conservatism, and transphobia in their social circles. There are so many ways that I find this path we all walk to be truly beautiful, despite my inability to capture it in words. I don't know if anyone else has experiences similar to this, but I thought I would share my story. I hope this helps, and I would very much love it if you shared some of your ""it's beautiful to be trans"" experiences with me.

I am beginning the process of getting HRT tomorrow, and I am terrified to my core. Here's my vent.	"To preface: I am 24, AMAB, and live with my family. My parents are good natured but have radical right-wing beliefs about pretty much everything.
I plan to have been on HRT for awhile before coming out, but I'm getting a head start on what I would like to say to them. Maybe some of you will relate with my experience, let me know if you do.

The day before tonight was... anxious. I began writing my coming out letter. At first there was passion, and excitement to finally be putting everything I've been working through into a succinct page meant for the one audience that I once hoped never to have to tell.
When I put it aside for the morning, I kept it on my mind through the day. What sort of things I might want to say, how I could present this part of me in a way that makes it easiest for them to understand. What excitement there was turned to anxiety, then to fear, then to doubts.

I pushed myself through an important lesson that I needed to learn. That not all doubts need to be considered. There are rational doubts, ones that come up in light of new information, when it's time for you to rethink what you've been believing. In fact these kinds of doubts may often look like a sudden realization, as your mind processes the points that run for or against a thought. Then there are the doubts that come as a reaction to fear, opposition and anxiety. They appear without any argument to be made, trying to shake up your whole world to make the current path seem unreasonable, so you don't confront the perceived danger. Doubts like this will say, ""Do I really want this? Is this really the way I should go? Have I properly thought this through?"" These questions don't arise in search of real answers. They are rhetorical in nature, a defensive reaction to fear disguised as rationality. In truth, I do want this. This is the best way to go. I have properly thought this through. I've made all the calculations based on my best understanding of myself and the processes involved. But in these terrifying moments where a change like this seems like it could turn my world upside down in every conceivable way, my mind doesn't recognize the weeks, months or years that I've spent contemplating this. It only sees the fear, anxiety, all the things that could possibly go wrong, how my life as I know it could end.
This lesson taught me to discern a rational doubt from a reflexive one.

The rest of the day I felt off. I felt wrong, like maybe this a bad way to do it. It doesn't feel right to say, ""Mom, dad, I'm going to become a woman."" How can I explain the idea of gender fluidity to people who think gender = sex and there are only two? It would be easier to just tell them I'm transitioning into a female, and leave the more ""advanced"" gender fluid part out of it. But then I'm still lying, hiding a bit of myself from them just for convenience. Chances are they reject everything about what being transgender means and recoil into their own misinterpretation of everything I tell them, so I may as well put everything out as accurately as I should.

I'm still ready to transition regardless of how this draft feels to write. I know this because of what I see in the mirror. Looking back into my reflection I see the ideal self that hides behind my eyes, and in the shapes of my face. I see the femininity in my expression looking back at me. The potential is there, and only after being this ready and set upon this goal, can I see the hope in my eyes for this thing that I've been so desperate for. I can imagine that face after months of hormones, with that same hope and joy and pride shining through with the subtle differences. I can see her.

Or them, or whoever I end up being. Truth is, I don't know what identity it should be called in the coming out letter. In reality all the gender does is give an explanation of myself to others in a way they can relate to. I don't need to call myself a woman or a man. I don't need to make sure others see me as a female, just as I don't care if people find me attractive. What matters is that I have the body that I am comfortable to live with, and that I can express myself in a way that lets me find myself attractive, regardless of others' opinion. If this means they see my bald head and see a man, okay. If this means they see my breasts and see a woman, okay. If this means they see everything put together and see a weird, unfashionable mix of a Mx, okay.

The point is that I can see that person and the hope in her eyes when she sees just how ready she is to stop worrying about what her life is like when her secret is exposed to her family. The point is that I feel my life open up to everything else I've been wanting to do when I think of finally being on hormone treatment.

On Monday I'm going to call my doctor to make an appointment, then jump through all the hoops they need for me to get this done.

I'll never be sure of the future, because the future is never a sure thing. Yes, so many things could go wrong. I could, and most likely will be rejected to varying degrees by my loved ones. I could somehow lose eligiblity for hormones and not get be able to continue. Maybe I'm outright denied the care I seek.
But so many things could go right. My brain will finally begin to match my body. Being out will mean I don't have to pretend to be who everyone thinks I am. I can finally begin experimenting with all the social aspects I've been curious about. I know exactly who I am. The person I am is not a man, and certainly not in the way everyone expects me to be. I know most of the little bits that form the mosaic of my identity. In that big picture, there is a sure disconnect between me and my sex. I desire a feminine body more than anything; all goals and ideals of success ultimately lead back around to wanting a safe, welcoming, graceful transition into a body that I can live with. Does that mean I feel comfortable calling myself a woman? A female? I'm not certain that's the label, or gender that I want. I don't really want the gender known as ""woman"" any more than ""man."" I just want to cure the dysphoria in my body that makes me wake up every day feeling uncomfortable with the sex characteristics I was born with. I don't know exactly who I'll become, but I'm ready and excited to find out as I begin this journey away from who I've been dishonestly trying to be."	"I also live with my family and am seeking hormones, having only reached out to a doctor recently. My family tends to be more center left, but since they made their money theyve started buying into some culture war bullshit, so i suppose its important for me to be here. They believe jk rowling did nothing wrong; not that she wasnt transphobic, that she didnt do it (big potterheads, working on it).

I understand the fear, and especially the doubt. Not all doubt is reasonable, not all doubt is honest, not all doubt has your best interest in mind. Listen to it still, but recognize the difference between real and fake doubt. Even the fake doubt can give you insight to how youre feeling though. Insight to your fear that you may have otherwise lacked had you simply not listened at all.

Its like a part of our minds has been colonized to participate in our own eradication. Cishet society finds us inconvenient and makes it as difficult to exist as possible, and the weight of overcoming that and existing honestly is something we carry forever. To quote my favorite show, “youre gonna carry that weight.” The choice to live with it and learn from it instead of collapse and let it crush you is a victory in and of itself. It is nothing to be scoffed at, and represents our resilience in the face of overwhelming odds

I know for a fact youll do great, regardless of them. From your words i can tell youre bright and brave and strong, more so than myself in many ways. I hope to be as strong as you in coming months and years <3
Maybe you just need leave parent house and  living alone with pretty girl?
Thank you for the kind words, friend.

""It's like a part of our minds has been colonized to participate in our own eradication."" Strikes me in just the right way. In some way these feelings seem like reality is pulling itself apart, trying to figure out what's internal and external. I am so sure of what I want and why, right up until it comes to making the steps to obtain it. It has me questioning if I'm even trans; if I feel strongly enough about it to want to make this change. The closer I come to having what I want - what I need - the more my mind resists taking it. When I break these feelings down, I know that a bodily transition is all that I really want, the social stuff and presentation stuff could be left alone completely for all I care. But all that stuff tends to come naturally with the new body, because of the gender society has created around it. It's this that I'm going to have the hardest time adjusting to, and where I'll meet the most resistance and insecurity.

What's getting me through is that this is only one step, and none of these changes are instant. More things will become knowable when I begin, and my feelings will change as I learn. Cowboy bebop is amazing.

I don't feel brave, or strong, or bright. I suppose no one does in these situations, though. Thank you for the encouragement nevertheless, and I wish you the same success and courage as well.

The best we can do is offer our hearts and souls and share those thoughts with you remotely via Reddit and DMs. I am sorry that we seldom have the physical aspects of a loving supporter to hold us when we are scared, to provide the shoulder when we can no longer hold back the tears and pain comes out in words that cannot be understood, to jump and dance when with us when we experience the type of joy that is contagious at the smallest of affirming events in our lives. I want all of us to remember that we are uniquely and beautifully made. That we are the only ones who can be the very best version of ourselves in the world. That no person or government or organization can take our validity away from us no matter how hard they try. You are worthy of LOVE and RESPECT and of being cherished by others who recognize just how special you truly are.

Anyone else suffers of impulsive dysphoric shopping?	I just spend 150 in fem clothes (clothes that I'll be hiding from my dad) and I regret a lot.

This feeling of “regret,” do regret buying them and having them?  Or do you regret having to hide them? Regret not wearing them openly?  The regret is where the dysphoria is.
OP probably was feeling dysphoric and alleviated it with some affirming shopping, if I had to guess.

ADHD and being trans	"NB: Still waiting on the official diagnosis for ADHD but the evidence strongly leans towards it. 

This is probably just a stupid scenario my brain cooked up so I’d like to run it through the community to calm myself down.

What if I’m mistaking gender euphoria for a brain desperate for dopamine?

The fact that I also never went through this “I knew since puberty hit / since childhood that I am of a different gender” phase but rather felt total apathy towards my body is worrying me.

But then again, the episodes of gender euphoria were spontaneous and unplanned — why would my brain go into hyper euphoria when someone told me “you go girl!” when I wasn’t even considering I was trans? (although I was questioning my gender)

Past evidence is telling me that I always work myself up into making things more complicated than they are.

I got a referral for HRT yesterday and I was crying of joy (or was I crying because I was fearing rejection?) and now it feels like I’m punishing myself for feeling this? 

There are days when everything is clear like water and days like these when I am questioning everything, ugh."	"Tbh, I wish I didn't read this, it's making me doubt myself as well but here we go.
I've been in therapy for ADD and one of the things that's now coming out of that is that I'm accepting myself as trans, the first week of that was probably the happiest have been in the past 4.5 years and it also gives my live some direction I've been desperately seeking for a while now.

But now about a week later imposter syndrome is kicking in mostly because I didn't have any (concious) problems with dysphoria until very recently although the feeling that i should have been born a women first came up to me 6-7 years ago, and now after reading you story I'm feeling even more uncertain, since what if it is actually the add looking for some explanation. 

I'm happy for you that you got the referral for hrt, i hope you can decern for yourself if it was joy or not, for my crying if joy and of sadness are so different are such different feelings and i hope you can figure out for yourself where your heart is at.

You go girl💜
I love that you asked this. I’ve never thought of it that way. I’m pretty sure I’m in the same boat as you with probably having some sort of ADD and not diagnosed yet. 

To make you think for a minute though, the many other sides of trans may me a good reference such as: Do you experience gender envy? Do you love womens fashion (assuming mtf)? Do you still do your hyperfocus dressed as the gender you want? I think those are things that deal with transgender issues more than dopamine highs. 

I love doing projects and the more of them I do, the less I think about gender envy and constantly having the “should I transition” in my brain. After that all stops, I still want to be a trans and present female. Now I’m at the point where I like to do the projects and present female. I think that’s something that came with age and experience. Being almost 40 now, the newness of presenting female has become normal and apart of me. In my 20’s all I could do was feel that dopamine high when I dressed fem.

I like your perspective!
I am so sorry to have stirred your doubts! I wasn’t sure between the TW and the Questioning flair because I could only pick one. 

Honestly the fact that you knew for years (even if that ‘knowing’ maybe wasn’t expressed in the same way with the same words - not saying this is the case, I wouldn’t know) that you should have been born this way - that’s a solid and stable thing, tried and tested over time imho because it’s not coming from sustained social pressure but from within you.

If it were an ADD thing, and I’m no expert here but comparing with my own experiences, it wouldn’t have been a source of focus for 6-7 years as you said. 

You’re as valid as you can be ❤️

As for my emotions there - I was already primed for things going bad with my GP and when she turned out to be so wholesome I guess it was a mixed bunch of joy and stress release. Definitely not a negative source of tears.
Hey no worries, I could have always decided not to reply, but this community here is so inclusive that i dont feel the need to hold back when i feel like I want to get something out there. All in all things have been weird/are weird since I'm feeling a bit down rn I'm writing up a post (lots of rambling) and that will go up probably later today

But to me it sounds like you know where your heart is at ;) and i wish you the best for the what you are/will be going through.

If you need to vent my dm's are open, i probably can't give advise but I know how helpfull it can be to have someone listening.
💜
Thanks honey, it’s wholesome chats like these that just warm the heart and make the day easier! 💜

Managing ourselves is a full time job but as long as we’re surrounded by positive vibes it’s all good"	uh8y25	trans	13	0.85	2022-05-03 05:19:58
"How I decided to be a ""hetero sexual, bright pink loving trans-y 'boy'friend"""	"I really have no idea where to go with this... but I also somehow feel like I really want to put it out there, somewhere.

After questioning, exploring, discussing and testing for about a year, I feel like I have found an answer, at least for now. I am a trans woman, but won't transition. 

In therapy and many other places I heard the question ""how do I handle [insert problem/bad experience]"" and I noticed that at least in my case, handling a problem always means to find an answer to a certain question. In some cases it was ""why is it like that"" or ""what does that mean"".

Well, in the case of being transgender, it came to the question ""what am I gonna do with this?"" It was very early clear to me that I am trans, that nothing would make me happier than being a woman. But that was not the answer I needed, that came a lot later. In the form of my girlfriend. She is (obviously) the best person on earth an has given me waaaay more than I deserve. And she decided to become a couple despite knowing that I am trans and might make her a lesbian, an idea that she wasn't exactly fond of, but kept quiet, because she didn't want to be in the way of my happiness.

But after a while I asked her what her real thaughts about this are and her answer was basically that she is not against it, especially if it means I am happy, but she loves me the way I am and is afraid of a transition changing exactly that. Maybe not true, but gender is a huge part of personality after all, so it's not unreasonable. But my decision was not because of this (although it would be a lie to say it didn't have a part in this).

It made me think, what do I want to do with my trans-ness? What to do with this incredibly rare ressource inside me? And those questions finally brought the answer. In my case and my living situation, it just does not seem exactly worth it. I am one of the blessed persons who do not absolutely despise their body. Not fond of it, at all, but I think I can make it work. So if I train and work on myself, psychologically and physically, I can make myself maybe not the person I should have been born as, but something I can still be proud of.

Sure, it will always be harder than for me than for cis guys, but transition is risky and a very very hard path to follow. My respect and utmost envy to everyone doing it. So yea, my answer is the following: I choose not to become what I should have been born as, but will use the old me, which failed at life and the girl sleeping inside me to forge a person in between both sides, making me a ""hetero sexual, bright pink loving trans-y 'boy'friend""


If anyone actually read it this far, thank you. I think the main reason I wanted to share this is because I am proud and happy about this. And since I am always trying to make the world a better place, I thought this may bring a little joy to people desperately trying to find their place. And I am a living example that everyone can find their place <3"	"Good read. You are so valid man, proud of you.
My sleep deprived brain read this kinda like ""his valid is over 9000!!"" which made the comment hilarious to read.

Also, thank you, that means a lot :)
I'm actually going through something similar. I deal with dysphoria but I'm not sure I need to transition to be comfortable with myself. I think it's brave to transition but it can't be said that not transitioning isn't brave. Maybe it's the journey and the trials we go through to become comfortable with our bodies and gender identity that makes us brave.
I think that dealing with gender identity and finding your own means to break with very basic rules we were tought growing up and that work for most people, just not us. 
And that, I think is pretty damn brave"	ayiqgm	trans	12	0.89	2019-03-07 22:38:44
❤❤❤ I love trans women so much ❤❤❤	"Like, in a lesbian way, yes, but also in an admiration way. We're so strong and our joy is so pure. I love watching these AMAB women finding their bliss.

Other trans identities are awesome too tho"		j9zopb	trans	13	0.88	2020-10-12 21:11:24
I've never felt so happy	OMGGGG I did my makeup so well!!! I actually look like a girl! Im only on 15, not on blockers or hormones so its hard for me to look pretty in my head. I looked in the mirror and bursting out crying seeing who I truly have been dying to see!!! First real joy I've felt in a while. Christmas has been so hard on my anorexia and has made me very dangerous to myself. So it's truly a wonderful thing to feel pretty after eating. I know the makeup will be off tomorrow and I wont be able to probably do it as good again. Thats fine tonight im happy and thats enough.	"Yup… was me on Christmas … and the make up wasn’t even good

It’s an unbelievably feeling , right ? 🏳️‍🌈"	ru6t7z	trans	13	0.84	2022-01-02 10:13:06
Getting euphoria from newfound bodily changes but also increasing terror at the prospect of coming out lol	Anyone else feel the joy of all the beautiful changes hrt brings comes alongside an increasing fear that one day soon you’ll have to come out, bcos of said changes??	"Trust me, life is too short to live in the closet! As long as it's safe for you to come out, I recommend doing it. It takes a huge load of psychological weight off! I waited until my 30s to come out as bi and my 40s to come out as trans!  It's never too late, but it's also never too early!
Same page family knows already but I'm scared to tell friends and coworkers or dress how I want when I go out and in a few months people are gonna notice on their own lol
I don't have any changes yet except in not horny anymore which is sad"	zigv1b	trans	13	1.0	2022-12-11 05:40:28
Since adding my pronouns They/she/he to my signature at work a year ago a total stranger is the first to properly title me. I cried tears of joy.			n9weiu	trans	13	0.85	2021-05-11 12:57:15
Came out to my mum and sister and...	"IT WENT WELL!!!!??
It'll take them both a while to get used to new name and pronouns but honestly I feel so relieved and just overwhelmed with happiness and joy right now. 😭✌🏻"	That’s amazing news.

Any advice for a 31 year old who just received a big smack in the face from the universe saying: Yes, you’re trans, now do something about it!?	"Hi everyone. Sorry, this is a long one, but I could really use some guidance.

I’ve been struggling for years about my identity in general, and had a certain curiosity about being MtF. But it always came and went in waves that didn’t last too long, and I always told myself that I couldn’t be trans because if I was, I’d be more trans than I am. If that makes sense.

First of all I’ve never felt very masculine, but I wouldnt say I felt feminine either. I have always been told I look quite fem though, my facial features and such. I did some cross dressing when I was in my mid teens and always liked the feeling of fem clothing, but I also felt ashamed from this and kept it a secret. I convinced myself it was some weird kink, that I should not be engaging in.

I struggled through depression and agoraphobia from the time I left school until I was around 22, and my self esteem was pretty much non existent. I am quite a creative person and disappeared into my various art projects. I’ve written three novels and have a band that I write songs for. (Trust me this will be relevant) But I always presented these works to the world anonymously, again because of this strange disconnect I feel with how I look.

Through all this time I felt very uncomfortable with my appearance, not feeling like I fit in with other guys. And I did sometimes have the fleeting thought of wishing to be a girl, but these didn’t last long.

Anyway, I got some treatment for my depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues and became a lot more confident in myself. I managed to get a job and met my wonderful girlfriend who I am very much in love with. At the time, I thought the gender issue was settled, and only had extremely rare thoughts about it. However i still found my appearance strange. 

I no longer thought I was unattractive, but I still hated pictures of myself for some reason that I could never explain to people. They would always reassure me I was a good looking guy, and I didn’t disagree, but I never got any sort of joy from being complimented on my appearance as a male, I just felt indifferent.

Anyway, this lead to a big argument between me and my girlfriend when she came to the realisation that we basically have no photos of ourselves together as a couple as I just can’t bear to have my photo taken. She likes to post stuff on social media about her life but it looked like I was completely absent from it. She thought it was because I didn’t want to be seen with her. She couldn’t really understand how it was an issue with myself causing this.

Anyway, I put that aside and forced myself to be more present online and in photos with her, but again couldn’t shake this uncanny feeling that somehow those were not photos of myself.

Then came faceapp. I tried it out because everyone was, but also thought I could perhaps pinpoint what it was I didn’t like about my photos by editing them and seeing what I preferred. I’m sure you can see where I’m going with this.

Given that I do already look fairly feminine, the app did little to change my features, just smoothed my skin and gave me longer hair. But immediately I found I was not repulsed by the feminised images of myself. To further push the realisation, my girlfriend commented on how good I looked as a woman(she is pansexual too) and that was the first time I ever felt good being complimented on my appearance. Do I began allowing myself to look a little more androgynous, and occasionally experiment with cross dressing and makeup again when no men was around. And the photos I took of myself like this made me feel so comfortable and good about myself. I have posted some of these in anonymous places to see what people think, and even without any steps to medically transition, I have gotten such an overwhelming response about how fem Iook, and just being told I’m pretty fills me with so much joy and confidence.

From here I’d say things snowballed somewhat, as I realised how much of my creative work seemed to relate to this issue once I looked at it through the lens of gender dysphoria. Songs I’ve written that I didn’t quite know what they were really about suddenly made sense to me. And the plots in my novels also related to feelings of unease about identity and the duality of male and female. This probably sounds very dumb, but it felt like these were messages from my subconscious coming out through my art.

And finally, the silliest part of it all, but it genuinely is what seemed to finally crack me egg, I found out that Blahaj is a mascot for the trans community, and I’ve owned one of those for nearly 9 years, completely coincidently.(we have it because my girlfriend is obsessed with sharks)

So now I think I finally know who I’m meant to be, but it does mean some big changes if I were to embrace this revelation. I think my girlfriend would be ok with me transitioning if it came to it, she is pansexual and has in past said that it’s my personality she loves, and if I had been a girl she would have still fallen for me.

This all feels so much like the universe is telling me to just go for it, but I do have some worries about the transition process. I’m now 31 years old, and feel almost like I’ve wasted the last decade not being my true self. I’m just wondering if you have any advice for someone discovering themselves at this point in their life? Can I still make transition work at this point?"	"I transitioned at 27 and am happier than ever. What matters most is having supporting and loving people around you, and that's something that you do seem to have.

It's _harder_ when you're post puberty, but it's not impossible, and although it's more likely that people end up less able to ""pass"" as their gender when they start at an older age, that doesn't mean it's impossible and it doesn't mean you should give up trying to be your best self.
Transitioning works at any age! 30 years old here, been on HRT for 2 months, my boobs are growing fast, and my ex tells me I look just like my mother, for reference she doesn't know that I'm transitioning and we were married for 5 years. Without seeing your pictures, I would describe myself the same as you described yourself. Feel free to take a look at my transition timeliness on my profile! But also take every response with a grain of salt because your milage may vary with HRT.

💚😊
I think it's absolutely possible as you're still fairly young from what I've seen! Also, just turned 31 myself and have been having my own revelation as well! So a lot of what you said I can relate to! I wish you the very best in whatever you decide! Remember, it's never too late~💕"	10v6am7	trans	12	1.0	2023-02-06 13:13:14
